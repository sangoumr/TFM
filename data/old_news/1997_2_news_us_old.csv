A year later, I saw the picture hanging in her bedroom, and I said to my wife, 'Why don't we do it again?' The next time I thought, 'We'll include our son.' '' In the years since, Goldberg has made the family photo sessions an annual event, adding children as they arrived: Nicolas and Matias were born in Paris when he was working for the photo agency Sygma, and Sebastian after the family relocated to New York. ''It's always a little ceremony,'' says Goldberg, now the photo editor at Clarin, a newspaper in Buenos Aires. ''The problem is that I can't stop. It has a life of its own. I've got to fee the monster.'' Goldber's photographs are a kind of human time-lapse photography: they catch his subjects in the act of change. And they put a frame around the often haphazard experience of growing up - a bid, as Goldberg puts it, ''to stop for a fleeting moment the arrow of time as it passes by.''",1997-02-02T05:00:00+0000

Oddly enough, this really packs 'em in. ''It's a popular day,'' says Msgr. Donald Sakano of Manhattan. ''Which defies any kind of analysis.'' Blaise, alas, couldn't save his own neck.

This theory is central to ''Silent Coup,'' a 1991 book (by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin) that drew a still-unresolved libel suit from Dean. 4. Dean's alleged motive for the burglary? To expose a Democrat-run call-girl ring. 5. Whatever their take, many revisionists agree that the Boca Raton panelists represent an outmoded Watergate orthodoxy.

A better answer is that there are musicians just as great as Hendrix and Jimmy Page out there today. But we live in a rock culture that in part because of the success of these musicians has grown more adept at turning an art form -- especially one built on youth, nonconformity and protest -- into an industry.

us,Moving Pictures,"In CAPTURING THE MOMENT: The Sports Photography of Barton Silverman (Penguin Studio, $34.95), Barton Silverman takes the reader on a tour through the last 30 years of professional and nonprofessional athletic competition. The moments Mr. Silverman, a sports photographer at The New York Times since 1964, has captured run the gamut from the ridiculous (Tonya Harding tearfully showing the judges a broken lace on her ice skate during the Lillehammer Olympics) to the sublime (Cal Ripken Jr. enthusiastically greeting fans after breaking Lou Gehrig's streak of consecutive baseball games played). Mr. Silverman captures the artistry as well as the athleticism of sport. His shot of the Chinese diver Sun Shuwei performing a dive during the Barcelona Olympics looks surreal, depicting him suspended in midair above the city with the Church of the Sagrada Familia looming ominously in the background. No photograph better shows Mr. Silverman's ability to depict the meaning of an event than his famous shot of Muhammad Ali sitting dazed in the boxing ring, unable to come out of his corner for the 11th round against Larry Holmes in the world heavyweight title match in Las Vegas on Oct. 2, 1980. The haunted look in the eyes of the former champion is a study in dejection and brings home to the reader that even the mightiest figures in sports are all too mortal. Carolyn T.

us,On Ice,"Peter LaSalle's HOCKEY SUR GLACE: Stories (Breakaway/Lyons & Burford, $20) brims with affection for hockey -- more accurately, for skating and winter. It's full of fond memories of searching for good ice as you tramp through the woods with your friends after school, of taking a breakaway and tucking the puck into a homemade goal on a frozen lake while young women watch, of skating defense while your wife watches. As the main character in ''Hockey'' observes, ''He had never liked anything in the world, loved anything, as much as to hear his blades cutting over the ice, to be skating.'' This is the small-''h'' hockey of mill towns and pickup games on pond ice, played by past-their-prime skaters with their old jerseys and old gloves and boys' hearts for the game. Stories like ''Hockey Angels,'' ''Wellesley College for Women, 1969'' and ''Van Arsdale's Pond'' all take weight from a powerful retrospect, from lost times that were both troubled and blessed, rife with the smell of winter air or the refrigeration of old rinks. ''The Injury'' is an 11-page sentence about the moment a young professional hockey player's life is changed forever, and ''Additional Consideration'' starts out as a mock-academic examination of the ''sleep shot,'' then twists deeper to become a love letter to the narrator's dying father. For good measure, Mr. LaSalle includes four poems (among them ''Goalies Are Weird'') and closes his book with ''Two Great Quotes.'' But the seven stories are plenty to convince us of his regard for, and personal acquaintance with, a life on the ice. Ron Carlson",1997-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,The First Supermodel,"Lisa Fonssagrives, a self-described ''good clothes hanger,'' was a leading figure during the 1940's and 50's in the business of being beautiful. A consummate professional, the willowy Swedish model projected a combination of lofty sophistication, impossible slimness and radiant physical well-being. She worked with the foremost fashion photographers of her time, and together they produced classics. In the early 1930's, Fonssagrives's first husband, a dancer turned photographer, sold photos of her gamboling on the French coast to European magazines. She entered fashion's big time in 1936 when Horst P. Horst was commissioned to do test shots of her for Paris Vogue. In LISA FONSSAGRIVES: Three Decades of Classic Fashion Photography (Vendome, $75), with an essay by the art historian Martin Harrison, the photographer David Seidner has assembled more than 100 images of her by 21 photographers. The pleasure of the collection, aside from its appeal to the fashion-afflicted, is the quality and variety of photographic vision. Some photographers, best represented by Horst, use Fonssagrives as a key element in formal compositions. Others, notably Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Frances McLaughlin-Gill, portray her as an active woman in less studied environments. Erwin Blumenfeld exploits her dancer's strength and agility by photographing her leaning out from the Eiffel Tower, her skirts billowing in the wind. The few disappointments -- images of vaporous fantasies of the model swathed in chiffon -- only enliven the whole by contrast. Her collaboration with Irving Penn, whom she married in 1950, transcends mere mastery of technique, graphic design and merchandising. In the soft northern light in which he photographed her wearing the Paris collections, both the woman and the clothes crackle with wit and sex appeal. Fonssagrives, who died in 1992 at the age of 80, was a direct descendant of the Gibson girl, but her own progeny are difficult to discern among the disordered and disturbed images in vogue today.

us,Ireland Without Saints,"In his first novel (but not his first to be published in America), Patrick McCabe presents a devastating portrait of a backwater community on the border between the Irish Republic and the North. Not surprisingly, CARN (Delta, paper, $11.95) shows us a place in which the uncertainties of the present meld into the tragedies and glories of the past. The town of Carn's fortunes ebb and flow with the economic vicissitudes of faraway countries that are only dimly recognized by the local people -- but they also vary with the endless, much more immediate cycles of the Irish ''troubles.'' In this book, which was originally published in 1989, Mr. McCabe uses a more traditional narrative technique than that of his acclaimed second novel, ''The Butcher Boy,'' but his prose here is equally graphic. Unflinchingly, he introduces his readers to a society in which the local priest doesn't hesitate to wield his unquestioned power over his parishioners, in which unwed mothers furtively kill and bury their newborn children, in which young men become hopelessly ensnarled in the sort of raids and counterraids that both create heroes and destroy them. Focusing on two women who dream of escape but are finally sucked back into the only world they truly know and understand, Mr. McCabe creates a story that is searing and brutal yet still tender in its subtlety and sympathy. He leaves the people of Carn waiting for a miracle, making it painfully clear that what they yearn for -- a return to the imagined certainties of the past -- is impossible.

In the San Francisco area, GHB-related emergency-room admissions topped 100 last year, up from 37 in 1995. 4. Overdose may cause coma. ''Better Sex Through Chemistry,'' a 1995 book that praises GHB's ''disinhibiting'' effects, advises users to lie down, thus preventing injury from ''falling, stumbling or dropping to the ground.'' 5.

During his solo improvisation concerts of the 1970's, he would go into a state of what appeared to be ecstatic pain. While playing the notes urgently and self-referentially, he would slide off the bench so that he was sometimes on top of the piano and sometimes beneath it and most often wrapped around it.

Getting her down is the simplest of his tasks. The swollen river is rife with dangers and the baby comes early. But the relationship that develops between the man and woman as they journey to solid ground is the heart of the story. -- Caitlin Lovinger",1997-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Bollenbach, said he was upset by statements that ITT would unload assets like its 50 percent stake in Madison Square Garden and the New York Knicks and Rangers sports teams. ITT said on Wednesday that it planned to focus on its casino and hotel businesses. It recently cut its stake in the French telecommunications company Alcatel Alsthom S.A. ITT shares rose 62.5 cents each yesterday, to $58.25. Investors apparently were speculating that the strategy would increase ITT's value, since the proceeds from asset sales could be invested in its faster-growing casino and hotel businesses.

Since the early 1970's, at the container terminal in Port Newark-Elizabeth they have been the operators who run the enormous cranes visible from the New Jersey Turnpike. From their waterfront perch atop the 120-foot cranes, the operators have a view of the Manhattan skyline and Newark Bay on one side, and a bustling stretch of the Turnpike and Newark International Airport on the other. But there is little time for sightseeing. Crane operators work quickly and in around-the-clock shifts to load and unload container ships that have come from all over the world and are in a hurry to be on their way again.",1997-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Natural Habitats,"''I look at these photographs with a prurient interest,'' John Updike writes in his introduction to THE WRITER'S DESK (Random House, $35), ''the way that I might look at the beds of notorious courtesans.'' Mr. Updike's implication is that most lovers of books will view these pages with the same voyeuristic fascination he does, and of course he is right. Jill Krementz has photographed more than 1,500 writers, and the majority of the 56 depicted here, each accompanied by his own commentary on the creative process, appear to feel comfortable with her. Jean Piaget sits at his desk, surrounded by piles upon piles of papers, yet he claims to have lost only one paper in his whole life -- and that, most likely, on purpose. An arresting Susan Sontag sits at a long wooden table filled with papers and stacks of books, staring seductively into the camera. The portrait of Toni Morrison is quiet yet regal: she sits on a sofa wrapped in a robe, writing in a notebook as the light of day approaches. Not all the writers are pictured at proper desks; several, including Walker Percy and Cathleen Schine, do their writing in bed; Ann Petry sits at her kitchen table; and Veronica Chambers sits on her kitchen counter with her laptop. Though Richard Ford is shown sitting at a desk, for him a desk is ''more of a concept than a thing.'' The other writers portrayed include Edmund White, Eugene Ionesco, Katherine Anne Porter and Joan Didion . For anyone interested in writers and their work, Ms. Krementz has provided a small but revealing look beneath the covers. Robin Lippincott",1997-02-16T05:00:00+0000

In his retirement he created a tropical garden on his Sugar Loaf Key estate in Florida which became internationally famous for the large variety and outstanding specimens of its palm trees and other cycads. He travelled the world with his wife, with frequent trips to Europe, Asia, South America and Africa, as well as Russia and China when both were first opened to foreign visitors from free-world countries. He was an active board member of Fairchild Gardens in Miami and a leading conservationist in the Lower Keys until he moved to Houston in March of 1995.

us,The Innocents,"Julie Schumacher's first collection of short fiction explores -- and usually celebrates -- the complicated passage from youth to adolescence. Most of the stories in AN EXPLANATION FOR CHAOS (Soho, $21) are told from the point of view of an outsider on the inside: a younger sister watching her elder siblings grow, a shy girl analyzing a more ''popular'' friend's interaction with adults or an only child serving as the pivot in an evolving divorce. These attentive children watch their parents and others carefully, translating observations into explanations: sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but always illuminating. In ''The Private Life of Robert Schumann,'' a girl uncovers a romance between her music teacher and the class outcast, her tangential initiation into the world of adult sexuality; in ''Rehoboth Beach'' a pair of young sisters jealously watch their older sister start, enjoy and then destroy an affair with a ''gentleman philosopher,'' a man the younger sisters are willing to ''kidnap'' to keep. And in the title story a woman is interrogated by an unknown questioner about her relationship with her father; despite her anger and frustration with his flaws, she cannot avoid acknowledging the depth of her love. A careful, subtle writer, Ms. Schumacher draws full characters with just a few lines, gently defining the fluid zone in which innocence gives way to understanding.

In 1933, he fled the Nazi regime and escaped to Italy, where he completed medical school at the University of Padua. In 1939, he fled to Jerusalem, where he began a training in neurosurgery. He emigrated to the United States in 1946 and completed a residency in psychiatry at Hillside Hospital in Queens.

His life was enriched by his abiding interest in art and literature. An expert in abstract expressionism, he edited Richard Heulsenbeck's memoirs on the origins of the Dada movement, published in 1959.

us,Winter Salads Flavored With Beets and Celery Root,"CERTAIN kinds of salads seem tailored to winter. Salads served at room temperature with pungent greens like arugula or watercress make a good first course before a light meat or fish dish. Beets add a colorful note, too. If they are roasted in the oven, they develop an intense, concentrated flavor, which does not emerge when beets are boiled. Raw celery root is also good in salads. It usually shows up in French bistros as celeri remoulade, grated and tossed in a mustardy dressing. Waldy Malouf, the new chef at the Rainbow Room, combines it with hazelnuts, arugula and endive. He sprinkles the salad with a pungent aged goat cheese, which comes in stick form to make it easy to grate. Goat cheese sticks are available in specialty shops or from Coach Dairy Goat Farm, Rural Route 1, Box 445, Pine Plains, N.Y. 12567; (518) 398-5325.",1997-02-23T05:00:00+0000

As Executive Officer of the Architect of the Capitol, Franklin oversees a team of six full-time workers who, year round, lower and raise the flag hundreds of times a day. The flags -- available in nylon or cotton, five sizes, with or without fringe -- are sent to constituents who request them through a congressman or senator. Customers pay not just for the flag (a top-end 8-foot-by-12-foot model costs $67), but for postage and $3.30 in flying costs. In 1995, 134,000 flags went out, and the requests keep coming.",1997-02-23T05:00:00+0000

Because their lives so vividly embody the notions that preoccupy the Mexican photographer Graciela Iturbide -- the tensions between the traditional culture of Mexican villages and Northern modernity; the resilience, adaptability and capacity for happiness of Mexican communities bound by family, work and seasonal customs; the wonder and strength of Mexico's syncretic religious rituals -- images of children abound in her IMAGES OF THE SPIRIT (Aperture, $40). In these black-and-white photographs, taken over the last two decades and presented in her first major publication in the United States, still lifes are rare. Indeed, whether depicting her subjects from afar, lost in Mexico's dramatic landscapes -- like the two small human figures, one of them on crutches, walking toward an ancient temple in ''Calzada de los Muertos'' (''Pathway of the Dead'') -- or from up close (like the young woman smiling softly as she breast-feeds her baby in a hammock), Ms. Iturbide seems to favor finding beauty in the various forms of human life. Informed by the notions that haunt her, Ms. Iturbide's definition of beauty in Mexican communities is complex -- in turn violent, spiritual, joyous, tense or tender -- and it always has to do with dignity, the dignity of a ritual performed, a bond asserted, an identity worn with pride.

Those who aren't models come under the category of ''real women'' -- as if models were figments of our imaginations, which in some respects they are.

us,Toward a Visible Woman,"Several features that appeared in Jane Shore's two previous volumes of poetry, ''The Minute Hand'' and ''Eye Level,'' also distinguish her latest one: a concern with the family and with Jewish traditions; a fondness for the miniature and the fairy tale as metaphors; an indebtedness to Elizabeth Bishop, to whom she dedicates a new poem called ''The Wrong End of the Telescope.'' But in a departure from Ms. Shore's earlier lyrics, MUSIC MINUS ONE (Picador USA, $20) is resolutely autobiographical, reaching from her 1950's New Jersey childhood through her adolescence and sexual awakening to her acknowledgment of her maturity, occasioned by her daughter's birth and her parents' deaths. This impressive sequence (which is a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle prize in poetry) imparts a sense of deepening consciousness, of shifts in perspective over time. Thus, in the beginning, we see Ms. Shore as a child, moved by Anne Frank's diary to invent a game called ''washing the streets of Holland,'' and then, in the book's final section, we find a reprise and variation: the grown woman, overcome by her visit to the Holocaust Museum, ''descending floor by floor / year by year, into history.'' Similarly, we encounter the young girl as she watches her father shave and, later, the adult opening her father's safe after his death with the combination he has taught her. In ''The Visible Woman,'' the book's last and possibly its most moving poem, Ms. Shore describes her mother's physical diminution and terminal illness as she helps her daughter to assemble a plastic model of the female body. These 31 poems all work together in a similar fashion, forming a seamless arc of personal history, both artful and accessible. Gardner McFall",1997-02-23T05:00:00+0000

The new enforcement is designed to prevent rollicking mutts from disturbing the winter habitat of a threatened shore bird, the Western Snowy Plover. It's the sort of environmental measure that Bay Area urbanites tend to cheer when applied to loggers in the Pacific Northwest -- remember the spotted owl? -- but Avanzino say this measure is cruel and unnecessary. (Arthur Feinstein, a local Audubon Society official, counters that the dog lovers are being ''a little selfish.'')

Of Rowayton, CT, who led the efforts to revitalize South Norwalk in the late 1970's and 80's, died Wednesday night in Norwalk Hospital of complications following an emergency operation. Beloved wife of Francis X. Fay, Jr. and loving mother of Valle Gaynor Blake of Brighton, MA, was 77. As Founder and President of the Norwalk Preservation Trust in 1977, Mrs. Fay arranged the educational programs and forums that redirected the focus of Norwalk's urban redevelopment from demolition to rehabilitation. Concurrently, as one of five Norwalk Redevelopment Agency Commissioners, she influenced the agency between 1978 and 1981 to adopt the rehabilitation of the Washington Street Historic District, a project that won two national awards in 1988. Mrs. Fay was one of five cited in the US Department of Interior Historic Preservation Award for the ''creative use of contemporary historic preservation techniques.'' The project was also selected and she was cited for the Downtown Development Award of the Downtown Research & Development Center of NYC, ''as a demonstration of public/private partnerships creating a vibrant downtown.'' ''Valle was the inspiration behind the city's approach to restoring the wonderful assets of South Norwalk,'' said former Mayor William A. Collins, who had appointed her to the Redevelopment Agency. ''I don't belive we could have gathered enough strength in the community to support the program without her effort.'' ''Valle was the pivotal person, and her voice was the stongest in saving the South Norwalk heritage despite the tremendous opposition at the time,'' said Rod Johnson, former Redevelopment Agency Excecutive Director. Mrs. Fay's interest in architectural antiquity had been inspired as a youngster by visits to St. Genevieve, Missouri, 60 miles south of St. Louis. Her paternal ancestors, the LaVallee family, had been among the early settlers in that first white development of Missouri (1735), and had produced three governors general of what was then known as the Louisana Territory. Mrs. Fay was Chairman of the Norwalk Green Historic Commission, Trustee and Secretary of the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum and served twelve years as a member and Vice Chairman of the Norwalk Historical Commission. Mrs. Fay had been Post Master of the Rowayton Post Office from 1961 to 1963. She had been a trainee with the Women's Air Service Pilots (WASP) during WW II. She was cited for her accomplishments in 1995 by Celebrate Women!, a Norwalk organization honoring women's achievements. Mrs. Fay was born in St. Louis on March 5, 1919, and raised in nearby Webster Groves, MO, the only child of the late John A. and Ethel Bass Weber. She was a gradaute of Mary Institute (1936) in the St. Louis area. She also attended Mills and Barnard colleges. She was predeceased in 1969 by a son, Robert E. Blake III. A memorial program will be held at 7 PM, February 2, at the Norwalk Maritime Aquarium.

Straus is survived by his wife, Barbara, his daughter, Penelope More of Olema, CA and his son, Christopher Jesse of Santa Barbara. A stepson, Simon Flower, lives in Kingston, England. Penelope More is the mother of his two grandchildren, Braden More of New York City and Alexandra More of Olema, CA. Straus is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Isidor Straus. He graduated from Harvard College in 1927 and spent two years studying abroad at Trinity College, Cambridge; the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris, and the Geneva School of International Relations in Switzerland. On returning to the United States, he entered and graduated from the Harvard Business School in 1931. He first worked for the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration of New York State and in Washington, DC for two New Deal agencies, the National Recovery Administration and the Resettlement Administration. Returning to New York in 1936, he was elected to the New York City Council in 1937 and served two terms. In 1942 he enlisted in the United States Army. After a year in the Pentagon, he went to London as a Military Government officer, assigned to the Civil Affairs staff at Supreme Headquarters. In 1958, he and his family moved from New York to Los Angeles, where he had purchased a bi-weekly newspaper in the San Fernando Valley. In this enterprise he, with partners, developed one of the first cold type and web offset printing businesses in California, Sun Litho, which they sold in 1980; after which Straus retired in Santa Barbara. In Santa Barbara, Straus served as a trustee of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art for a number of years. In the 1980s he and his wife established the Barbara and Robert K. Straus Thinking and Learning Center at Pace University in New York to encourage interdisciplinary education based on the work of Alfred Korzybski, the founder of the Institute of General Semantics. Straus had been interested in this approach to education and the study of decision-making for many years.

Born in New York to a family coming from Siena, Italy, Mr. Roy Rossetti served as Executive Secretary of the Italy America Chamber of Commerce for twelve years, until 1995, working with six different presidents, thus becoming a focal point amongst the business community that lives and operates in this area, trading between Italy and the U.S. Hard working, loyal and imaginative, Mr. Rossetti carried out the activities of the Chamber, initiating and cultivating business and commercial contacts both in Italy and the United States. He proved to be instrumental in shaping the guidelines of the Chamber and creating new programs aimed to its improvement and development. His leading presence in the Chamber assured the continuity of the commercial bonds between the two countries and was therfore of key importance. It is also thanks to him that the Italy-America Chamber of Commerce, the first Chamber in this country linking Italy and the United States, founded in 1887, is the main point of reference for business men of the two countries. For all these reasons the President of the Republic of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, bestowed upon him the honorific title of Commendatore in the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy. Mr. Rossetti is survived by his beloved wife, Paola, daughter Claudia, along with relatives and numerous friends. Services to be held in Miami on February 28, 1997, Van Orsdel Funeral Chapel (305) 446-4412.
