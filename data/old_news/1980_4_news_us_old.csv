us,Screen: Alienation By Peter Handke,"""THE Left-Handed Woman,"" the first film to be directed as well as written by Peter Handke, the Austrian novelist, playwright and poet of alienation, is a beautiful, mysterious and somnolent film that leaves you even as you are watching it. It has the manner of someone who falls asleep as he's telling you a long, meticulously detailed story of no recognizable point or ending.The story  to begin with, anyway  is about the Woman (Edith Clever), who lives on the outskirts of Paris with her husband, Bruno (Bruno Ganz), and young son. She is a large, fine-looking woman with the heroically sculptured features you'd find on a statue representing, say, Wheat. The chin is firm, the nose is queenly, the cheekbones obviously of granite, and the eyes reveal nothing.One day she tells Bruno that she wishes he would leave her. She wants to be alone. Bruno leaves her, and the Woman is very much alone, even when her son is home from school. The Woman's life is like the interior of her house. It's sparsely furnished.The Woman walks around the empty streets of her suburb. Trains go roaring by on the way to and from Paris. She begins to translate Flaubert's ""Un Coeur Simple"" into German. In the yard, her son and a friend imitate Laurel and Hardy. Her son's pretty school-teacher says how much she envies the Woman. ""I'm a lukewarm person,"" the teacher says.The Woman suffers small fits of activity. She takes her son on a picnic to the top of a hill. She thinks about attending a women's liberation meeting, but after looking in the window of the meeting, she thinks better of it. She is almost gay one afternoon when, by chance, she meets Bruno on the street. She insists on buying him a pair of white sneakers but refuses to let him back into her life.The Woman's father comes to visit from Germany. He's a gentle old man. He's also lonely. She shines his shoes. He mends a hole in her sweater. They go for walks. He says to his grandson: ""You know I don't wear slippers around the house and I'm almost 70. That's the only thing I'm proud of."" He goes back to Germany.""The Left-Handed Woman,"" which opens today at the Cinema Studio 2, is less a narrative than a state of mind evoked through a rhythmic succession of images that are often beautiful and finally numbing. Mr. Handke, who wrote the screenplays for two of Wim Wenders's most interesting films, ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" and ""The Wrong Move,"" has made a movie about alienation that is so alienating one stops attending to it. The Woman really is a concept, and as the movie goes on, she becomes increasingly transparent until she disappears completely.Although ""The Left-Handed Woman"" is a movie, it looks like a collection of still-lifes. We notice shapes, colors, light and shadows, and pay no attention to the emotions that (I think) Mr. Handke means for us to respond to. It's risky to make a movie in which the images are meant to be important not for what they reveal but for the information they withhold. After a while, one's mind moves on to other matters.Then, too, Mr. Handke has not been entirely faithful to his austere method. Although Miss Clever (""The Marquise of O"") is properly cool, Mr. Ganz (""Nosferatu,"" ""The American Friend"" and ""The Wild Duck"") brings with him a flesh-and-blood vitality that is at odds with everything else in the movie. It also doesn't help that Mr. Handke has persuaded some very fine European actors (Gerard Depardieu, Michel Lonsdale, Rudiger Vogler and Bernhard Wicki) to play bit parts, as if this were some kind of pageant or all-star musical.Because Mr. Handke is a superior writer, there are arresting moments in ""The Left-Handed Woman,"" but the total effect is as empty as the Woman's face.",1980-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Penitentiary':Jailhouse Blues,"""PENITENTIARY,"" which opens today at the National and other theaters, is a small, brutal and none-too-convincing prison melodrama about an anonymous young man who, after being wrongly convicted of murder, finds salvation as a prison boxer.Near the beginning of the film there is an extended fight between the young man and a very large, muscled older con who wants to make the new fellow his ""property"" in a sexual sense. The fight goes on and on, accompanied by the kinds of fake grunts, groans and mayhem one associates with professional wrestling. The rest of the movie is more of the same. It's not boring but then it's not very gripping, either. It's like watching two loud drunks pushing each other around on the sidewalk.The film, which was written, directed and produced by Jamaa Fanaka, belongs to the post-black exploitation film era. Because most of the characters, good and bad, are black, it avoids the reverse racism that was sometimes apparent in the earlier films. The strongest statement of the film  and one that can't be dismissed  is that 99 percent of these inmates are black.Leon Isaac Kennedy plays the young man.

us,Screen: An Engaging 'Sitting Ducks':A Caper by Amateurs,"SIMON (Michael Emil), an accountant for the New York mob, is in his 30's, stocky and a health nut. He exercises regularly and is kind to his father. Sidney (Zack Norman) is also in his 30's and considers himself a swinger. If he had a gap between his upper front teeth he'd look like an American Terry-Thomas. Sidney is tall, fast-talking and optimistic, but he's really no more able to cope with crime than Simon.In ""Sitting Ducks,"" which opens today at the Gemini I Theater, Simon and Sidney score something of a coup. They hit the mob for one day's bookmaking receipts (approximately $750,000) and take off in a Cadillac limousine for Miami, where they plan to fly to Costa Rica and eternal, moneyed ease.In comedies like ""Sitting Ducks"" you know right away that Simon and Sidney can't get away with this caper without problems, and the problems that arise are of a consistently cheerful if slapdash order.""Sitting Ducks"" is the third film to be made by Henry Jaglom, a fellow whose ambition to be a movie maker somewhat exceeds his talent. I'm not sure that this gap is noticeably narrowed by ""Sitting Ducks,"" but it's certainly far more fun than either his ""A Safe Place,"" in which Tuesday Weld prepared for suicide, or ""Tracks,"" in which Dennis Hopper played a returning Vietnam vet.Mr. Emil and Mr. Norman are not, as has been suggested elsewhere, the Laurel and Hardy of the age of anxiety. They are too friendly. Their personalities lack the clearly defined edges of seasoned comic actors. What they do have, though, is an approach to comedy that is endearingly tentative. They're like old friends, say, an accountant and a salesman, who are asked to perform their amateur routines in front of a group of people they don't know. They come on with modesty and good humor and do their best. The effort is as entertaining as what they do.En route to Miami, the two would-be scoundrels pick up three hangers-on, Jenny (Patrice Townsend), a pretty, bronzed young woman who looks like an all-American girl and likes to make love with everyone (but she won't kiss); Leona (Irene Forrest), a high-strung waitress who shares Simon's dependence on vitamins, and a chauffeur (Richard Romanus), who wants to be a pop singing star.Much of ""Sitting Ducks"" looks and sounds improvised. There are times when even the editing seems ad-libbed, as when the camera cuts to a reaction shot and finds no real reaction, only a self-conscious grin. In some subversive way, this works. ""Sitting Ducks"" is sloppy and disorganized and almost always engaging.",1980-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Return of the Secaucus Seven:In the Byways of History,"IN the late 1960's, Jeff, Frances, Mike, J. T., Irene, Katie and Maura were, in one way and another, finishing their educations and burning on behalf of good causes, of which there were plenty to go around, including the fight to end the war in Vietnam and the newly declared war on poverty.It was a time when one ""smoked"" dope, demonstrated, ""rapped,"" ""crashed"" wherever one was and moved from one love affair to the next with no hard feelings. The goals were worthwhile even when they were undershot.There was, for example, the time the seven friends took off by private car from New York for Washington to march on the Pentagon. They got as far as Secaucus, N.J., where they were arrested on a phony charge and spent a night more comic than grim in the local cooler, thus missing completely the big show in the capital.Now, 10 years later, the members of the Secaucus Seven come together for a weekend reunion in New England. Mike and Kate, who are teachers in Boston, are the hosts. J. T., who still dreams of becoming a folk-music star, arrives with his guitar, hitch-hiking. Irene, who once had an affair with J. T., brings her new lover, Chipp, and Maura, having left Jeff, is also alone.John Sayles's ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" is about as sweet and engaging a movie as anyone could make about unexceptional lives growing stale as we watch them. The film will be shown at 6 P.M. today at the Museum of Mondern Art as part of the New Directors/New Films series being jointly sponsored by the museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It will be shown again at the museum on Sunday.Mr. Sayles, who wrote, directed and edited the film, is best known as a novelist (""The Pride of the Bimbos,"" ""Union Dues"") but he has also put in time as a screenwriter for Roger Corman (""Piranha,"" among others). ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" is a far cry from the kind of sensational movies Mr. Corman produces. It's not exactly understated but it is so full of common-places that one longs for a tiny bit of sensation or even a small discovery, perhaps of a pregnancy.I suspect it's easier to deal with these sorts of characters in written fiction, where the voice of the author becomes a participant in the proceedings, than in a straightforward film where we pay too much attention to the looks of the actors and to what they say and how they say it. The characters here talk with a facetiousness that in real life often passes for wit. It seems accurate enough but it also makes them seem less important and interesting than I think they are meant to be.The performers are all good, but noteworthy are Maggie Renzi as Kate, a capable young woman for whom the reunion triggers some unexpected panics; Gordon Clapp as Chipp, Irene's preppy lover; and Mark Arnott as Jeff, a former Vista volunteer who now works with drug addicts and gives every indication of wanting to try the hard stuff himself, though he doesn't.The movie covers much of the same territory as ""Small Circle of Friends,"" but without the sentiment of that Harvard Yard romance. ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" is an honest, fully realized movie. My reservations have to do with the dimness of the characters and their lives. Fiction  including film fiction  demands much more than mere authenticity.",1980-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Night Games,' Roger Vadim's Bel Air:With Feathers","VALERIE has a problem, poor thing. Her husband, Jason, is a nice man, something Roger Vadim establishes in his weary new ""Night Games"" by showing Jason taking Valerie shopping on Rodeo Drive. Jason owns a big house in Bel Air, and he and Valerie would undoubtedly be happy there if Valerie could only sleep with him. But she won't. She can't. She was assaulted once, and the memory lives on, preventing her from having sex with ordinary men.Her only lover is a fellow in a bird suit, who appears for evening trips and, in the film's most memorable episode, steps into a bathtub wearing a blindfold and a full-length gold lam cape. The erotic charge of this moment  Valerie is already in the tub, after all  is nothing beside the question of whether the bird suit won't look even sillier covered with soap bubbles.""Night Games,"" which opens today at Loew's State and other theaters, stars Cindy Pickett, a former soap-opera actress who was billed, most optimistically, as the latest of Mr. Vadim's glamorous finds. Miss Pickett is as strident and uninteresting as her predecessors  among them Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve and the young Jane Fonda  have been voluptuous. She is also very American, as the whole film means to be, and that's a lot of the problem.The dialogue is inordinately awkward and the cast seems to be speaking English as a second language. The whole film has a feeling of dislocation, especially because the smarmy sensuality that is Mr. Vadim's stock-in-trade doesn't enter into the story until a lot of parties and lunches and shopping trips have gone by. Time is also frittered away on a long haunted-house sequence, when Miss Pickett, as Valerie, hears terrible noises that turn out to have been caused by a mouse. Valerie is alone because she has discharged the maid and the gardener, after finding them on the coffee table doing something that isn't easily confused with anything else. ""What are you doing?"" the screen play has Valerie scream.The thing Mr. Vadim does best this time is to accentuate Miss Pickett's pearly teeth and gold eye shadow during the last part of the story. Otherwise, the film looks grainy, feels choppy and wears out its welcome long before the bird man flaps by.",1980-04-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Top Dog,' Portrait of an Ambitious Rat by Poland's Feliks Falk:The Cast","""Top Dog,"" the second feature to be made by Feliks Falk, a young Polish film maker, is a humane, nicely observed portrait of an ambitious rat and how he rises to the top in the tacky world of show business in the Polish provinces. Whether or not the film refers only to show business is beside the point. I suppose that ""Top Dog"" can be interpreted more broadly, but it's not necessary. Like all good films, it means exactly what it says before it means anything else.Danielak, the hero, is tired of acting as master of ceremonies at those club dates, company parties, fashion shows and so on that his older colleagues turn down. Further, he knows he's better than they are. He has a more comic way with a bad joke, a harmless leer that means more to the women in the audience and a more insatiable desire to play the big time, which, in this case, is a televised carnival ball to celebrate the opening of a big, garish, ultramodern hotel.""Top Dog"" covers the few days before that emcee is chosen by whatever government agency it is that's in charge of variety artists. Danielak, in his breathless pursuit of the prize, seduces a more-than-willing older woman to obtain information damaging to his competitors. He hands his girlfriend over to another fellow who can help him. He double-crosses his best friend and even steals money from the wife he hasn't bothered to divorce.As played by Jerzy Stuhr, Danielak is not especially appealing  his motives are too clear too early  but his effrontery is fascinating. Mr. Stuhr has the open, candid face of someone too self-interested to hide his feelings for very long, but it seems apparent by the end of the film that no one will much care about his character as long as he's the charming fellow he's supposed to be on stage.Mr. Falk's appreciation of the milieu illuminates the film and roots it in a reality that is as important to the drama as the people it's about.""Top Dog,"" which was produced by Andrzej Wajda's X Film Unit, will be shown at the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art at 6 P.M. today and will be repeated Monday at 8:30 P.M.",1980-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Series at Modern Is Presenting 'Radio On':The Cast,"""Radio On"" is an almost unendurably precious English movie about a kind of alienation its characters seem to have picked up from looking at too many better movies of the 1950's, 60's and early 70's. It's about David, a radio disk jockey who moves without expression through a series of unexceptional encounters with his girlfriend, his late brother's girlfriend, a British soldier who has deserted his post in Northern Ireland and a couple of young German women who appear to have been borrowed from a Wim Wenders movie.Mr. Wenders, the talented young West German director, was this film's associate producer, which may explain why the English landscapes look so German. Maybe it's also because of the stark black-and-white photography, which recalls Mr. Wenders's far superior ""Alice in the Cities.""The hero, who spends much of his time in his car, always has his radio or tape deck on. There is lots of rock music heard, which supplies the emotions the characters are no longer capable of feeling. These people are always on an edge, but they never fall off it. Of course, if they fell off, they might connect with something, and then ""Radio On"" would not be about alienation This is a very bad movie. Boring.Christopher Petit, an English film critic, wrote and directed it. He says he was prompted to make it after seeing a film ""of minimal interest"" and knowing he could do better. If it does nothing else  and it doesn't  ""Radio On"" should make all critics think twice before making movies about alienation.""Radio On"" was shown at the Museum of Modern Art Friday night as part of the New Directors/New Films series sponsored jointly by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum. It will be shown again Tuesday at 6 P.M.",1980-04-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Soviet 'Interviews' At Modern:Disturbing Fragments,"""INTERVIEWS on Personal Problems,"" Lana Gogoberidze's new Soviet (Georgian) film, keeps nudging the memory. On the surface it seems to be about the personal and professional life of Sofiko, an intelligent, 40ish. happily married wife and mother who is also a newspaper reporter, specializing in so-called human-interest pieces.The form of the film is that of a collage, with bits and pieces of Sofiko's private life intercut with the testimony of the various people she interviews (an elderly librarian, a young, happily unmarried mother, a school teacher) and flashbacks that matter-of-factly recall Sofiko's childhood when her mother was hauled off to a never-explained exile.Though the movie is scored with the kind of syncopated, big-band sound one associates with commercial Italian movies, though much of it was photographed in the soft, idealizing focus of romance, and though it takes a positive stand on behalf of the liberated woman, ""Interviews on Personal Problems"" is full of intimations of profound dislocation, apprehension and regret. If Miss Gogoberidze had gone just a few steps further, she might have made one of the first Soviet films to be seen in this country about an alienated society.There's an extraordinarily affecting moment, presented without special emphasis, when an ancient woman wanders into Sofiko's newspaper office and asks the reporter to help her get into an old people's home. She has a family, the woman says, but they're out of the house all day and when they come home at night, they talk only to one another. ""Death,"" says the woman with a shrug, ""has passed me by.""One day on the street, Sofiko has a chance encounter with a quite alarming woman who cannot resist standing in a queue if she can purchase something at the other end of it. At home at supper, Sofiko, her husand and children are at the table when a strange man enters and announces himself to be the exterminator. Embarrassed at the man's initial embarrassment, Sofiko offers him supper. He refuses, but asks to have a glass of beer. The scene ends with the family silently watching the man drink his beer.Though Sofiko's problems  her husband's decision to separate, her mother's death and an offer of a new job  are the center of the movie, ""Interviews on Personal Problems"" is much more interesting as a kind of surreptitious report on the party and on the quality of life it has won for its guests. The rock song on the children's radio, sung in English, contains the heavily Russian-accented refrain, ""It's a rich man's world.""The movie works on the imagination retroactively. As you watch it, its fractured form looks self-conscious, something borrowed for effect, but the fragments themselves have disturbing impact later as they accumulate and modify each other's meanings. Miss Gogoberidze is, I suspect, a real film maker.""Interviews on Personal Problems"" is being shown at the Museum of Modern Art today at 8:30 P.M. as part of the New Directors/New Films series sponsored jointly by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum. It will be shown again Wednesday at 6 P.M.",1980-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Ellington and 'Tapdancin':After 3,388 Performances, 'Grease' Ends Record Run Musical Double Bill","""MEMORIES OF DUKE,"" an 85-minute homage to Duke Ellington, zeroes in on the late composer and bandleader and his musicians as they play their way through a 1968 Mexican tour. They play in a vacuum in the film, which was seen Saturday and will be shown Friday at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of the New Directors/New Films series presented there through April 23 by the museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.Gary Keys, the film's producer and director, gives us very little audience reaction and only sparse background material. Presuming a knowledge of the man and his work, ""Memories"" stays right with the band. The camera plunges in to highlight a face here or an instrument there in a beautifully photographed  by Urs Furrer, Bill Hudson and Ed Lachman  weave of cold brass glints and warm, light-absorbing black faces. As the band plays through many of the old Ellington hits, the film provides its own subtextual resonances, now sly, now bittersweet, now ecstatic.Individual players emerge then fade back into that mass of smooth-running machine, and the camera catches both their moments of self-absorbed glory and Mr. Ellington's reactions. Cootie Williams and Russell Procope, two long-time Ellington musicians, talk of the Duke. ""'Coots,'"" Mr. Williams remembers the Duke saying, ""'I want you to preach a sermon with your horn.'"" He struggles with his grief, recalling the year Ellington died. Mr. Procope recalls playing ""Mood Indigo"" night after night with a hint of resignation. ""But it was mine to play with,"" he says stoutly, ""because when Duke sent you out to the mike you were on your own."" And when you left Duke, he asserts, ""you had to go to the Philharmonic, to New York to play Mozart, Bach.""On the same bill, Christian Blackwood's ""Tapdancin'"" opens with a stunning shot of black men hoofing across a black-and-white checkerboard floor, under a red exit sign. The 75-minute tap panorama sweeps across the current scene, from classes and workouts to performances. There are irresistible film clips of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson and the daredevil Nicholas Brothers and Four Step Brothers.But despite its high-energy pace and attractive personalities, the film seems incomplete and somewhat arbitrary. There are endless shots of a tap class for children. A segment on white, ""third generation"" tappers goes on much too long, as does an unproductive interview with the Nicholas Brothers. John Bubbles and Honi Coles have fine, ironic comments to make. ""White dancers go one, two, three  up to 10,"" Mr. Bubbles explains. ""Black man has to get deep: um, um, de, de, de.""He recalls blacking his face so that his blackness wouldn't be discovered. ""My goodness, you had to be everything else but what you were to get on stage. Janitors! Janitors! Some of the world's great dancers and singers in those films, and they had to be janitors.""""Blackness mattered,"" Mr. Coles says. ""But maybe you wouldn't be a dancer if you were white."" At moments like this, when such veteran tappers talk or dance, the film soars. But there are too few such moments.""Grease,"" Broadway's longest-running show, closed yesterday after 3,388 performances.It ended its eight-year run mainly because of the lag in business during the 11-day New York City transit strike, a spokesman said.The musical, depicting rock-and-roll and high school life of the 1950's, opened on Feb. 14, 1972, and survived critics, a royalties dispute and occasionally slow box-office sales. It took its record from ""Fiddler on the Roof"" on Dec. 8, with its 3,243d performance.""Grease"" helped the careers of a number of young stars, among them John Travolta, Richard Gere, Barry Bostwick, Adrienne Barbeau and Marilu Henner.",1980-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: C.I.A. Pro and Con In 'Company Business':Agency You Love to Hate,"""ON Company Business,"" which opens today at the Public Theater, is an earnest, interminable and not particularly illuminating look by a group of young film makers at the organization that so many people love to hate, the Central Intelligence Agency.The film is not particularly cinematic, either, consisting of closeup denunciations and briefer defenses of the agency, and television and newsreel clips. There is no narration, which might have given some sense of proportion, and almost nothing in the way of maps or graphics, which might have been helpful to those who aren't quite sure of the location, say, of Ecuador.The major lectures on the sins of the agency are given by Philip Agee, Victor Marchetti and John Stockwell, all former employees who have published books on the subject, and those in its defense by William Colby, its former director, and David Atlee Phillips, former head of Latin American operations, among others, both of whom have been quoted to the same effect many times before.Mr. Agee, who has lately been striking a blow at the agency by publicly disclosing the identities and addresses of its officials abroad, also provides a simplistic crypto-Marxist summary of world history since World War II.""On Company Business"" concentrates on C.I.A. misdeeds in Latin America, particularly Chile and Cuba; Angola, possibly because those are the areas where Mr. Agee and Mr. Stockwell, respectively, were stationed, and Iran, but only up to the overthrow of the Shah. Oddly, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, where the C.I.A. had a dominant role for years, are scarcely mentioned.Howard Dratch and Allan Francovich, the young film makers who produced ""On Company Business,"" which Mr. Francovich directed, are so busy chronicling the blunders and crimes of the C.I.A. that they neglect to mention that it was often operating, for better or worse, against the ruthless and effective intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union. Nor, does it deal with the ""reforms"" of the Carter Administration, which are now being perceived in some quarters as having seriously damaged the C.I.A.'s capabilities.The film will be shown through Sunday and next Tuesday through April 27. It will be televised by the Public Broadcasting Service in three one-hour segments May 9, 16 and 23.",1980-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Disney Ghost Story:Haunted Landscape,"""THE Watcher in the Woods,"" the new Walt Disney film that opens today at the Ziegfeld Theater, is a haunted-landscape movie in at least two ways.The story is about a patch of beautiful English countryside, where, 30 years before, a teenaged girl disappeared in a bolt of lightning while playing with three friends. When the film begins, the newly installed inhabitants of the manor house in this landscape note such odd occurrences as mirrors that don't reflect, mysterious lights in the bottom of the pond and, on several occasions, a ghostly image of a blindfolded girl. These things qualify ""The Watcher in the Woods"" as a haunted-landscape movie in the conventional sense.In addition, the stars of the film are Bette Davis, who plays the apparently batty mother of the long-lost girl, and Carroll Baker, who plays the mother of the new family in the manor house. Watching these two fine actresses as they wrestle with such lines as ""Where are you going?"" or ""You must be crazy!"" or ""What have you done?"" is to be reminded of talents that so long ago lit up movies like ""All About Eve"" and ""Baby Doll."" The talents are still there, but it's as if they'd been placed under a spell of fearful silliness.Miss Davis and Miss Baker receive top billing, but the film is mostly concerned with Miss Baker's two daughters, the pretty Jan Curtis (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and her little sister Ellie (Kyle Richards), whom the film's supernatural ""presence"" attempts to contact during the film.""The Watcher in the Woods,"" which was directed by John Hough (""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"") and is based on a novel by Florence Engel Randall, is a peculiar sort of Disney movie in that it's likely to scare the daylights out of the very young while reducing their usually sober-sided elders to unfortunate giggles. The audience in-between may well enjoy the standard spook-movie effects, but I challenge even the most indulgent fan to give a coherent translation of what passes for an explanation at the end. The movie's metaphysics, bogus anyway, are not helped by the appearance of a creature that looks as if it had been stolen from a Chinese New Year's parade.Miss Davis brings vigor and authority to a role that doesn't exist. Miss Baker acts as if she hoped this were really something serious, say a television sitcom, instead of the failed foolishness it is. Also in the cast are David McCallum, who plays Miss Baker's husband and is often off the screen, and Ian Bannen, who plays a mean-tempered neighbor who lives in the next manor house down the lane. The young actors are not notably appealing.The woods, the lawns, the fields and the houses are, however, splendid.",1980-04-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Suzanne Somers In 'Nothing Personal':Populist Comedy,"""NOTHING PERSONAL,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters, is a skimpy, poorly paced, feebly populist comedy about a college professor, played by Donald Sutherland, who fights Big Business to save an endangered species of Alaskan seal. Suzanne Somers of television's ""Three's Company"" plays the Washington lawyer who helps the professor.Mr. Sutherland, who has been a good actor in the past, appears to be uncomfortable much of the time, as if he knew what we are in the process of finding out, that is, that George Bloomfield, the director, has no knack whatsoever for humor in movies. There are some talented actors in the supporting cast, including Dabney Coleman, Lawrence Dane and Hugh Webster, who has the only funny moment in the picture.Miss Somers is very game but, to be quick about it, she's terrible. She's not a manufactured star but an assembled one. The teeth seem borrowed from Farah Fawcett, and the torso has the shape of one of those rubber dolls you order through the mail and inflate with a tire pump. The hair looks suspiciously like high-grade nylon.Of her gestures, her smile is the most elaborate. However, because it communicates no amusement, warmth, intelligence or interest, we watch the smile as we would watch the opening of a garage door equipped with an electric eye. It's a minor mechanical feat.""Nothing Personal,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some vulgar language.",1980-04-18T05:00:00+0000

""Black Goddess,"" a Brazilian/Nigerian co-production in the Museum of Modern Art's New Films/New Directors program, was written and directed by Ola Balogun in something approaching a documentary style, although it tells a fictitious story. It will be shown at the museum this evening at 8:30 and tomorrow at 6 P.M.The story ostensibly concerns a young Nigerian, Batatunde, who is sent by his dying father to Brazil, where one of his ancestors was carried off in slavery centuries earlier. Batutunde's mission in Brazil is to find out what became of his family, and by the end of the film this is revealed, in flashback sequences that are affecting but relatively conventional by comparision with the rest of the material. The modern-day sequences, far more fascinating, follow Batatunde into Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, as he seeks out an African community and observes dances and religious customs. There is a pretty young woman who functions as a kind of medium at one religious meeting, and soon enough Batatunde has fallen in love. Mr. Balogun scarcely misses such opportunities to keep the material as entertaining as it is instructive.A commanding young actress, Sonia Santos, plays both this young woman and one of Batatunde's forebears, a slave who is pursued and raped by her white owner as she falls in love with Batatunde's captured relative. Mr. Balogun lets this part of the film grow slightly feverish and familiar, but it remains dramatically effective even then.",1980-04-18T05:00:00+0000

It is a survival of the practice that died out generally in the 17th century of rendering a capital ""F"" as ""ff.""That out of the way, there isn't much to be said about the film, which deals with Mr. Moore's foiling of a gang of hijackers who are threatening to blow up a supply ship, an oil-drilling rig and a production platform in the North Sea if a 25 million ransom isn't paid within 24 hours.With the clock ticking and Britain facing a crisis of unparalleled magnitude, as they say, Mr. Moore leaves his headquarters in a castle on a remote Hebridean island for conferences at 10 Downing Street. He agrees to take on the job after having made clear who's the boss to Britain's female Prime Minister.The screenplay, adapted by Jack Davies from his own novel, can't seem to decide whether or not it's all a joke. In any case, there is a great deal of nervous telephone and radio talk and little in the way of action or suspense.Andrew V. McLaglen's direction is, to be charitable, routine. The production, compared to the Bond films, is strictly bargain basement  all matte shots and unconvincing miniatures instead of the real thing. The turbulent North Sea, which only a few weeks ago destroyed an actual platform, becomes a gently heaving body of water, either Galway Bay, where much of the film was shot, or a studio tank.Mr. Moore, wearing a full beard, performs with good-natured authority. James Mason plays a bemused admiral with his usual deftness. Tony Perkins, the leader of the hijackers, is less successful. As a fiendishly clever international criminal who turns into a babbling psychopath, he becomes monotonously mannered long before the picture is over.T-t-t-that's all, ""ffolkes.""The film is rated ""PG"" (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because of the occasional use of vulgar language.",1980-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Part 3 of 'The Battle of Chile':The Workers Speak,"PATRICIO GUZMAN'S ""The Battle of Chile (Part 3): Power of the People,"" which opened yesterday at the Film Forum, supplements rather than carries forward the first two parts of Mr. Guzman's monumental ""The Battle of Chile,"" which were shown at the Film Forum in January of 1978.Parts 1 and 2 present an epic, immensely sorrowful account of the last days of the democratically elected, pro-Marxist rgime of President Salvador Allende Gossens, whose Government was overthrown in a right-wing coup in September 1973. Mr. Guzman and his associates devote the third part of the trilogy to a description of the methods by which the Chilean workers attempted to counter the effects of the series of rightist-inspired strikes and boycotts designed to topple the Allende Government. After managers, supervisors and other white-collor people departed, the blue-collar workers continued to run the struck industries and to set up alternate methods of distribution of food and other essential commodities.The wonder is not that they didn't save the Allende Government, but that they were able to keep the country running as long as they did. It was, as the film demonstrates, an unequal battle to begin with.When ""Power of the People"" lets the Chilean workers speak for themselves, and when we see the awesome scope of the civil disorder, it's quite as powerful as the first two sections of the film.The English narration, however, has all the persuasiveness and conviction of a prerecorded announcement. The vocabulary is early revolutionary  ""fascism,"" ""imperialism,"" ""class,"" ""comrades,"" ""reactionary,"" ""left,"" ""right,"" etc. While there's nothing wrong with these words, the way they are used here indicates that they are meaningless unless we agree completely with the political set of the mind that speaks them.The film, which was put together by Mr. Guzman in Cuba after he fled Chile, is moving for the passion with which it was assembled, not for the tone of the narration. When the soundtrack tells us, a bit grimly, ""In 1973, the patience of the workers begins to wear thin,"" the phrase is an unfortunate echo of what Hitler used to say before gobbling up another country.""Power of the People"" is being shown at the Film Forum at 7:45 through Sunday, and at the same time next week, Thursday through Sunday.",1980-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Screen: 'Soupcon,' A Silver Separation:After 25 Years","""SOUPCON"" is the story of a couple who decide to separate after 25 years of marriage and the first thing wrong with it is that it never generates the remotest interest in whether or not they will reconcile. The second and main thing wrong is that this is the kind of film that could have been made only in French, if indeed it had to be made at all. There is no other language in which vague meanderings and frequent meals take on such consequence. Nor would the absolutely pointless light interlude take on the importance in Swedish, say, that it carries here. These are Jean-Charles Tacchella's principal directorial tools, and he uses them often in ""Soupon,"" if not well.Mr. Tacchella, who appears really to have outdone himself in directing the airily successful ""Cousin, Cousine,"" this time strikes a mood that is superficial without being in the least bit light. At the glum beginning of ""Soupon,"" which opens today at the Baronet, Franois and Brigitte Dupuis are seen telling their three children that they plan to live apart. The children, whose own family situations with their spouses seem meant to turn the film into a parade of insightful anecdotes, are at first surprised at their parents' daring. They soon get used to the arrangement, and the various characters go their separate ways, meeting only for brief discussions and light snacks.Franois, played by Jean Carmet, is meant to seem something of a cut-up, and he is also a self-proclaimed bohemian. So he falls down in a subway station, waits for a good Samaritan to revive him, and then explains ""I just wanted to see if anyone cared."" At a restaurant, he hands the young woman a note reading ""I am a deaf-mute, can you help me?"" and then pretends to regain his speech miraculously. Incredibly, the young woman is impressed. She invites Franois home for a tryst, gets into bed, and asks him to close the window. While doing so, he looks across the courtyard and sees a woman cooking a duck with truffles. They trade recipes, and soon the woman is inviting him over for a meal. He goes, asking the first woman to wait for him. Francois is a cute guy, and this is his cute movie.Brigitte (Marie Dubois), taller and steadier but just as kittenish in her way, runs a boutique. She dates a film buff who pretends to lose his wallet in the store, then makes a date with Brigitte for a night when there's nothing interesting at the Cinmathque. It is virtually impossible to worry about where all this will end, and indeed ""Soupon"" isn't a film to set either its characters or its audience to brooding. Affecting a spirit of adventurousness, and charting these two characters' journeys into supposedly unknown waters, the film is altogether without risk or surprise, which is even more damaging than its being without humor.Some of the lesser characters are lively, and a few of the episodes are successfully offbeat. And ""Soupon"" is visually pleasant enough to seem less of a trial than it might be. These aren't strong points of recommendation, but they do help make the time go by.",1980-04-18T05:00:00+0000

Fink, Stephen L. Forman, John Fraker and Dennis Lanson, raises more questions about American political and social life than any one movie could conveniently answer, which is one of the reasons it is so effective.For a period of months the film makers virtually lived with the Phan family, 20 members of which, representing four generations, successfully escaped from Vietnam at the end of the war and arrived in this country in September 1975. Their Jersey City house is small, crowded and neat, and though it's apparent the Phans have come down in the world (in Vietnam Mr. Phan was a colonel in the army as well as a businessman who owned a 400-room hotel, among other properties), one suspects that the Americanization we see at work in Jersey City was well under way before the Phans left home.They didn't develop overnight their passion for appliances, for plastic slipcovers, for artifical flowers, for kewpie dolls with hoop skirts, and for automobiles, including one equipped with television, a CB radio, stereo and an eight-track tape deck. The Americanization of the Phans began a long time ago, which is what makes this picture of their exile, and of their dogged efforts to succeed in this country, so poignant.Two extremely pretty, articulate daughters, who are in their 20's, work in a shoe factory and talk animatedly about their efforts to better themselves. They have nothing against the other workers, they say, but these two Phans realize they're belong to a higher class. One son, a waiter in a diner, is the proud owner of that completely equipped sports car. Another son, abandoned by his Vietnamese wife (who ran off with the foreman of the Jersey factory where she worked), hangs around the house much of the time, pacing like a zoo animal.Mr. Phan, a small, wiry man, described as once having been the best tango dancer in Saigon, works cheerfully at whatever menial jobs he can find. The only member of the family to speak candidly about her unhappiness is the eldest daughter who, at 32, cooks and keeps house for the others and longs to get away from them. It would be a rare family that could stick together under such pressure.""The Phans of Jersey City"" is a fascinating picture as well as another sorrowful postscript to the Vietnamese debacle.Michelle Citron's ""Daughter Rite"" is another kind of experience completely, and I wish that, to review it, I didn't have to reveal its remarkable secret.The movie looks and sounds like cinma vrit, a film made by the narrator and principal personage, a 28-year-old woman named Maggie, to understand her furious feelings toward her mother. In still pictures and interviews with herself and her younger sister, Maggie relives her angry childhood and her equally angry present, while the mother, seen only in old snapshots and home movies, slowly becomes the flesh-and-blood focal point of the picture.Maggie and her sister talk in the argot of the analyzed. ""The whole interaction numbed me,"" Maggie says at one point. Also, ""I hate my mother and in hating my mother, I hate myself."" The way Maggie talks makes you suspect that her mother is well rid of her. But wait.""Daughter Rite"" is not cinma vrit. It's a fiction film, based, I'm told, on interviews with more than 40 women. Taking this material, Miss Citron and her two main actresses, Anne Wilford and Penelope Victor (who are excellent), improvised this simulated documentary about one particular mother-daughter relationship.""Daughter Rite"" is a technically stunning achievement. I do wonder, though, whether the form isn't more of a convenience than a stylistic necessity. Perhaps not.

us,Film: Japanese 'Vengeance Is Mine':Banal Mass Murderer,"""VENGEANCE IS MINE,"" directed by Shohei Imamura, a Japanese director largely unknown in this country, is chilly without being austere, the sort of confounding movie that tells us too much and not enough. Based on a true story that was the basis of a nonfiction novel, the film is about a young man who begins as a juvenile delinquent before World War II, turns naturally to schemes of fraud while serving as an interpreter with the United States Army after the war, and drifts easily into mass murder, as if that were the logical progression of events.The film, an award winner in Japan last year, will be shown today at 6 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art as part of its New Directors/New Films series, and again tomorrow at 8:30 P.M.The movie opens with the arrest of Enokizu, the young man, and proceeds alternately forward and backward to describe the alarmingly casual career of this fellow who could murder as easily as someone else might pad an expense account. Though money is usually Enokizu's immediate motive, the real impulse is a profound misanthropy that the movie  eventually and not very satisfactorily  attributes to a traumatic childhood experience:Enokizu, born and raised a Roman Catholic in a Buddhist country, was made to witness his father's humiliation by the military in their small seaport village. The scene, very prettily photographed, is convincing neither as psychology nor as drama.The emphasis that Mr. Imamura places on this single event trivializes everything else in the movie. The director also leaves unexplored other influences that might have had a far more damaging effect than any one such humiliation.What turned the boy's family to Catholicism in the first place? How rigid is their dogma? Do they go to church? To confession? Have the Catholic teachings filled his head with any fantasies whatsoever? Are there any other Catholics around? Mr. Imamura never aswers such questions. Instead, he imposes Catholicism on Enokizu as if it were an inexplicable, prenatal curse.It was the director's intention, I'm sure, that we see Enokizu's life as more banal than wretched, but it's also so peculiar that it seems to have no reference to anything else. Much more interesting than Enokizu are the subsidiary characters whose lives he wrecks. These include his wife, his father and his none-too-bright mistress, who accepts the fact that at any time her lover might murder her.Except for some awful footage done with a hand-held camera, ""Vengeance Is Mine"" is an extremely handsome film. The dominating style is that of those elaborately setup, vividly colored Hollywood commercial films of the 50's and 60's. This choice, which I assume to have been a conscious one, calls attention to the gap between real life and the romantic notions about killers contained in most other commercial movies.",1980-04-22T05:00:00+0000

He's a biogeneticist. His field: the aging of cells. He looks inward, not out.At the beginning of Reinhard Hauff's severe, very good new German film, ""Knife in the Head,"" Bertolt Hoffmann suddenly finds himself on the edge of despair. His wife, Ann (Angela Winkler), has left him, not, apparently, after some corrosive domestic battle. She seems to have drifted away casually, out of boredom, the way other wives drink or learn Chinese, and joined her leftist lover in his work at an urban youth center, which may or may not be a cover for a terrorist group.One night Bertolt goes to look for Ann at the center and finds the police in the process of raiding the premises. When, in a panic, he breaks through the lines to find his wife, he becomes involved in what is headlined as a major political incident. The police later testify that Bertolt came at one of their men with a knife. In self-defense, the policeman shot Bertolt in the head. They further suggest that he's a terrorist, the worst kind, the kind that masquerades as an apolitical sheep.Ann's friends say that Bertolt is a victim of police brutality, that before he was shot he was badly clubbed, which would seem to refute the story about the knife.Whatever the truth, Bertolt is left with the motor speech center of his brain partly destroyed, an infantile man in the intensive-care ward where he must learn all over again how to think, speak and walk, how to cope with a world he seems never to have attended before.""Knife in the Head,"" which opens today at the Cinema Studio 1, is about Bertolt's rehabilitation, physically and emotionally, as he attempts to get a fix on a life he never much thought about before. It's part metaphysical mystery story, part furious denunciation of both the German right and left. That's not to say the film has the effect of singing the praises of the good, proper-thinking, middle-of-the-road intellectuals. Far from it. The film is, rather, a meditation upon the nature of society and on a particular man's survival.At the heart of the film is the performance of Bruno Ganz, whom I first remember some years ago, when he was still primarily a stage actor, as Gregers in Hans Geissendorfer's screen adaptation of ""The Wild Duck,"" with Jean Seberg. He may also be seen currently in Peter Handke's ""The Left-Handed Woman,"" though he was more prominently employed in Eric Rohmer's ""The Marquise of O,"" Wim Wenders's ""The American Friend,"" and in Werner Herzog's ""Nosferatu"" as the victimized Jonathan Harker.As Bertolt Hoffmann, whose agonizing therapy is the point of the picture, Mr. Ganz is extraordinary. His is the sort of film presence that finds power even in utter passivity, to such an extent that when the character finally explodes, as it does at the end, it's both a shock and thoroughly satisfying.Miss Winkler's role is less spectacular, being initially inscrutable and then all too clear, but she's very good. So too are Heinz Honig, as her leftist lover, and Hans Christian Blech (last seen here in Mr. Wenders's ""The Wrong Move"") as the lawyer for both Bertolt Hoffmann and the radicals.As the new German cinema gathers momentum, it is creating a gallery of first-rate international film performers, including Hanna Schygulla, Klaus Kinski, Miss Winkler (who's also in ""The Tin Drum""), and now Mr. Ganz.Mr. Hauff, whose ""The Main Actor"" and ""Paule Paulander"" were shown at the 1978 New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art, is not a director of the sort of spectacular idiosyncrasy that distinguishes the work of a Fassbinder or a Herzog. He is, instead, methodical, laconic, self-effacing and completely in command of the medium. ""Knife in the Head"" is such a closely integrated work of writing (by Peter Schneider), direction and performance that it's difficult to separate the individual contributions. The only thing I'm sure of right this minute is that ""Knife in the Head"" is another major, very original German movie.",1980-04-23T05:00:00+0000

It was formerly a Nazi torture ship, and it craves new passengers.So it rams into an ocean liner and persuades the few survivors of the collision to climb aboard. The survivors aren't very smart, but then survivors in movies like this rarely are. Soon they are taking showers of blood and discovering the ghost ship's many hidden features, like its tub full of rotting corpses and its drawer of gold teeth. There is also a movie projector on board, showing Nazi newsreels and turning on and off by itself. All of this, as directed by Alvin Rakoff, is shoddy and repellent, but not particularly frightening.""Death Ship,"" which opens today at Loew's State and other theaters, has a hapless cast, headed by George Kennedy, who gives a much better performance in his current television painkiller ad than he does here. Also on board are Richard Crenna and Sally Ann Howes, as a dull married couple, and Kate Reid, whose face turns to gray mud during one of the story's more imaginative turns. There are also two freckled kids, ostensibly the cute offspring of Mr. Crenna and Miss Howes. ""Women!"" grouses the little boy about his sister, in one scene. ""Men!"" says she of her brother, later on. Child actors!",1980-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: At Home With Kerouac:Menage a Trois,"IN ""Heart Beat,"" Carolyn Cassady's memoir about life with Jack Kerouac, the novelist who died in 1969, and Neal Cassady, who died in 1968 and by whom she had three children, Mrs. Cassady writes cheerily of their mnage  trois in the early 1950's:""While I performed my household duties, the men""  Kerouac and Cassady  ""would read each other excerpts from their writing in progress or bring out Spengler, Proust or Shakespeare to read aloud, accompanied by energetic discussions and appraisals. ... I was happy just listening to them and filling their coffee cups. Yet I never felt left out. They'd address remarks to me and include me in the group with smiles, pats and requests for opinions or to moderate an argument.""Such passages as this have apparently inspired John Byrum, the film writer and director, to make ""Heart Beat,"" certainly the most epically, unintentionally funny movie about literary life since ""Youngblood Hawke"" in 1964.However, ""Heart Beat,"" which opens today at the Sutton and other theaters, is so solemnly self-important and banal that one soon begins to suspect other motives at work. My theory at the moment is that John Byrum is a pseudonym for one of those literary critics of the 50's who thought Kerouac was a hack, resented the fame he earned with ""On the Road"" and ""The Subterraneans,"" and is now doing his best to scuttle the Kerouac repuation and to demystify the whole beatnik era that Kerouac and his friends came to represent.The story of the film, such as it is, covers several years in the 1940's and 50's, when Kerouac and Cassady bum around the country in a car and finally settle in San Francisco, where they meet the beautiful Carolyn, an art student with a penchant for awful dialogue. Both men love her, but Cassady wins her.Kerouac continues to bum around, occasionally writing furiously on a typewriter balanced on his knees. Eventually, he moves in with Carolyn and Neal and becomes Carolyn's sometime lover. Suddenly, seemingly out of the blue, ""On the Road"" is published, Jack becomes a big celebrity and, when last we see him, he's sitting in Carolyn's garden shivering in the sun and described as being ""in very bad shape."" You might think he'd eaten a disagreeable onion.If you have any desire to know more about Kerouac, Neal and Carolyn Cassady, Allen Ginsberg (portrayed in the movie as ""a wild young poet"" named Ira Stryker) and the others, I suggest you read ""Jack's Book, an Oral Biography of Jack Kerouac,"" by Barry Gifford and Lawrence Lee. Mr. Gifford and Mr. Lee seem to have interviewed everyone connected with Kerouac, including Carolyn Cassady, and come up with a far more informative and incisive account than the bilge contained in this film, which, among other things, suggests that Kerouac and Cassady were both charmless and boring.This time I think it's really safe to say that the movie is not the fault of the actors. The screenplay is beyond repair except by a shredder. Sissy Spacek plays Carolyn, and she's mostly sweet, except when she's asked to say (on the soundtrack) lines that recall the platitudes she spoke in ""Badlands,"" only this time there's no irony intended. Sample (after Kerouac has become famous and refused to help Neal, who's in a jam): ""From friends we expect loyalty. From writers, only sequels."" Or, ""He'd gained a book, but the cost was high.""Nick Nolte, as Cassady, and John Heard, as Kerouac, have even more difficulty than Miss Spacek, possibly because the characters are not, as Mrs. Cassady might say, especially verbal. The depth of their relationship seems to be that of a couple of fellows who were in the Cub Scouts together. The curious sexual feelings are ignored and the use of booze and drugs is so discreetly handled as to be nonexistent. Further, any movie that reduces Allen Ginsberg to a comic supporting character has to be a bad joke.""Heart Beat"" is not a movie to send anyone to the library, only to the exit.",1980-04-25T05:00:00+0000

Thompson, the main attraction in ""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" isn't a clear enough character to hang a whole movie on, but he's certainly the life of any party. During the course of the film, Mr. Thompson is seen brightening up a wide variety of occasions as he practices Gonzo journalism, which is something he invented along with that doctoral degree. It certainly takes practice.He takes drugs, then flies an airplane while singing ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds."" He takes more drugs, then shoots his own telecopier machine and takes aim at the telephone whenever it rings. He coaxes a room-service waiter and a maid to set up a very small football game in his hotel room on the day of the Super Bowl, and scores enough touchdowns to splinter all the mirrors. He trades his ticket for the game for a bottle of wine he sees a man drinking on the street. The bottle is in a brown paper bag, but that's fine. Whatever else Mr. Thompson may be, he isn't fussy.""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and stars Bill Murray, includes a number of funny gambits and very little glue. Mr. Murray is clever whenever he is audible  which isn't all the time, because he speaks with a cigarette holder clenched between his teeth, and the film's director, Art Linson, has a way of training the camera away from the speaker, making it difficult to lip-read. But the story rambles desperately, and there are times when the screenplay is barely there. Mr. Thompson's only identifiable quality soon becomes facetiousness, and it wears terribly thin.As a writer for Rolling Stone, which for some reason is called Blast magazine here, Mr. Thompson is seen covering 1968 marijuana trials in San Francisco, the 1972 Super Bowl and the 1972 Presidential campaign, during which he either sees or imagines seeing Richard M. Nixon in a men's room. He is joined in these adventures by a wild-eyed lawyer, played by Peter Boyle; the lawyer, like Mr. Thompson himself, is a figure much more amusingly drawn in Mr. Thompson's writings than he is here. Their carousing goes from funny to flat and back again, lurching unpredictably between extremes. Both Mr. Boyle and Mr. Murray are occasional victims of Mr. Linson's awkward timing, when the film either cuts short laughs or lingers too long on dull material.The score for ""Where the Buffalo Roam,"" by Neil Young, works very well with the film. It includes Motown material, some rock anthems of the late 1960's by Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. It also offers Mr. Young's own approach to ""Home on the Range,"" which is performed here in several haunting versions.The 1979-80 Trustees Award of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has been awarded to Leonard H. Goldenson, chairman and chief executive officer of the American Broadcasting Companies, for ""continued distinguished service to television and the public this medium serves.""The award, a golden Emmy statue, will be presented at a dinner Tuesday at the Metropolitan Club, on East 60th Street. Among the speakers will be Lord Grade, chairman of the Associated Communications Corporation of England; Elton H. Rule, president of ABC Inc.; Robert J. Wussler, chairman of the academy, and Frederick Pierce, president of ABC Television.Mr. Goldenson joined ABC in the 1950's, when the network merged with United Paramount Theaters, where he was president and chief executive.Recipients of the award, which dates to 1958, have been John F. Kennedy, Bob Hope, Edward R. Murrow, William S. Paley, David Sarnoff, Dr. Frank Stanton, Elmer W. Lower, Donald H. McGannon, Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., and Dr. Peter Goldmark.",1980-04-26T05:00:00+0000
