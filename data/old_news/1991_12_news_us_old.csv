The Weird Side","Everyone who has encountered Charles Addams's wonderfully funny and macabre art remembers one treasured cartoon in particular, and it is wonderful to see the glow that comes when that drawing looms up yet again in the mind's eye, and to hear its horrors described in the soft, loving tone of voice that is usually reserved for tender recollections of childhood or the specially beloved. ""There's this sharp bend in this lonely mountain road with a sheer, steep drop,"" a rememberer will say, gazing dreamily into the middle distance with a gentle smile playing softly on his or her lips, ""and this weird little guy in a tiny, spooky old car is leering and waving the car behind him on so that it'll pass him and run smack into the front of this huge truck, which only the little guy can see coming around from the bend's other side!"" All listeners will brighten at the recollection, but then immediately enter into the gentle competition that invariably follows as each one recalls and describes the spooky Addams notion that has -- literally -- haunted him or her from the day it was first encountered in the pages of The New Yorker or in one of his many collections. THE WORLD OF CHARLES ADDAMS (Knopf, $30) is a big, handsome book of his cartoons, lovingly gathered by his widow, Tee Addams. It is, of course, both hilarious and genuinely frightening, and -- be warned -- no self-respecting coffee table will henceforth tolerate being without one. The publishers have been wise enough to give virtually each work of art a full page to itself so that it has plenty of room from which to spring; there is a lavish sampling of Addams's New Yorker covers printed in full color, and the book has been given an affectionate and informative introduction by Wilfrid Sheed. The cartoons are essentially presented in the order in which they were created, and the more scholarly may find the actual dates of their publication in The New Yorker listed at the back of the book. We can see Addams (1912-88) moving through his very early line work and then arriving at the rich tones and enormous complexities of the wash drawings he created from the 30's to the early 50's. These drawings have a marvelous dark beauty and are rendered with a scrupulous attention to detail that would have done credit to the illuminator of a medieval manuscript. The rest of the collection carries us through the varyingly looser techniques Addams employed in his later work. From start to finish all seems as fresh as if the water used to shade the overcast skies and cobwebbed corners were still damp. My only complaint is the usual one during recollections of Addams's work: the book is missing the cartoon I cherish most! My most beloved one shows one of his desperately lonely little girls exhaustedly skipping rope in the very small hours of a steamy Manhattan summer night somewhere back in the late 30's or early 40's, and she's chanting out her ten thousand thousandth jump. No matter. I'm not worried in the slightest. It will show up in one or another of the many tributes to come.",1991-12-01T05:00:00+0000

BERNARD HARLESTON, a soft-spoken experimental psychologist, has been president of the City University of New York's City College campus for 10 1/2 years. It has been a time of controversy for the college, founded in 1847 and famous both for its eight Nobel laureates and its volatile politics. With 14,000 students, it is the nation's largest producer of black and Hispanic engineers and among the half-dozen greatest sources of black medical school students. But it has presented Dr. Harleston with thorny challenges, most recently the turmoil surrounding Dr. Leonard Jeffries, chairman of the black studies department, who has charged that Jews helped finance the slave trade and joined with the Mafia to portray blacks in a demeaning way in the movies, and Dr. Michael Levin, a philosophy professor who contends that blacks are, on average, less intelligent than whites. In an interview, the 61-year-old Dr. Harleston reflected on how City College has changed and how the most recent Jeffries flareup has affected the college.

JoAnne Akalaitis, who took over from Joseph Papp as artistic director of the festival in August, was to present her own one-act adaptation of Jean Genet's account of a visit to the Palestinian refugee camp at Shatila after the massacre by Lebanese militiamen. But it developed last week that Ms. Akalaitis had not finished the adaptation, had not acquired the rights and had not let subscribers know that there would be no show. A festival board member, Joan Davidson, took note of some mitigating circumstances. ""For the whole year that Joe Papp was dying, a lot of things were on hold,"" she said.

In the early 1980's, William J. Casey picked him to run the agency's clandestine operations against the Sandinista Government, and in 1985 he helped Oliver L.

Riverdale Redux","I first saw Archie Andrews in the basement of the house my family moved into in 1962. I was 6 years old. Against the wall near the furnace were stacks and stacks of warped and crumbling magazines. My father burned most of them in a barrel in the backyard, but I snagged out all the comic books, a huge pile of them, mostly Archies. I kept them in an old cloth rice bag by my bed, and I still have a scar under my lip from the day one of my older cousins barged into my room and laid claim to my Archie comics based on this insane logic: ""I can have them because I can read and you can't."" At the time I didn't know that being unable to read an Archie comic was not exactly a liability. I didn't love them for the stories, anyway; I loved them for the feeling they gave me of spying on the world of teen-agers, who were my secret gods. My cousin grabbed at the bag and tried to run for it. I hung on. She was dragging me down the hall, screaming, ""Let go!"" She tried to shake me by yanking me down the stairs. We went crashing! There was blood! There was my mom! There was my chicken-faced cousin running out the open front door with my bag of Archies! I never did get them back. So you can imagine my excitement when I first saw ARCHIE: His First 50 Years (Abbeville, $29.95). Archie all the way from 1941, when he looked like a cross between a young Mickey Rooney and a less self-aware Alfred E. Neuman, to the present-day Archie with the six spooky freckles and weird black crosshatching on the side of his head. And 50 years of Betty and Veronica with changing faces and hairstyles but the same Frederick's of Hollywood bodies. Years of Jughead, Moose, Miss Grundy and Mr. Weatherbee with his tiny six-legged toupee flying off his head. And you can imagine my disappointment when I found out none of the comics that I remembered were included in this depressingly uneven 128-page collection. Instead, a lot of valuable space is taken up by gassy text like this: ""For Archie, as for teens everywhere and at all times, the common objects of daily existence are apt to take on a life of their own, and the mysterious ire of adults seems as easily provoked by his well-intentioned attempts to please as by his high jinks."" We do get the story of Archie, but Charles Phillips, a screenwriter and amateur cartoonist, sure goes the long way. He cites cave paintings as a possible origin of comics, compares Archie's hometown of Riverdale to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County and informs us that ""nostalgia"" is ""a word coined by an Alsatian medical student named Johannes Hofer."" He also has to be the only comic book historian ever to praise the tyrannical censorship policies of the Comics Code Authority, an organization generally despised for sending a lot of great comics to their graves in the mid-50's.

Pillow Talk","One of the pleasures of being a house guest is poking through your hosts' library and leafing through books you never got around to buying for yourself. The type of reading material found in the guest bedroom says a lot about their interests as well as what they think you might find interesting. And what better choice for a guest room than a couple of lavishly illustrated books on beds? THE BED (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $45) is exhaustively informative. Did you know that ancient nomadic Persians slept on goat skins filled with water? (And you always thought the water bed was invented by those libidinous 1960's flower children.) The early Saxons slept on sacks stuffed with hay, hence the expression ""making a bed."" Alecia Beldegreen, the creative director of Bride's magazine, also tells us that in the Middle Ages ""beds were designed so that the sleeper sat upright"" in a fully illuminated room with sword at the reach. Sleeping was ""a communal affair"" at both ends of the social spectrum until well into the 16th century, when ""an invitation to share a bed was recognized as a mark of political esteem"" and it was not uncommon for former enemies to share a bed as a symbol of reconciliation. In France during the Bourbon and Empire periods, the aristocracy slept, and often entertained, in beds of elaborate extravagance, several of which are depicted here. The graceful and simple four-poster beds that turn-of-the-century French nuns slept in are nearly as fascinating as the photograph of the vast one-room, 15th-century hospice where patients slept two to a bed as opposed to three or four in other hospitals. The most beautiful bed in this book must surely be that of the editor of Bride's, Barbara Tober, who has created a king-sized fantasy out of antique lace and linens, chintz and mirrors. Ms. Beldegreen has also thoughtfully included an extensive source list and advice on how to choose and care for all types of bedding and bedclothes. Diane Von Furstenberg's BEDS (Bantam, $35) is a very handsome and captivating volume filled with photographs of beautiful beds with fascinating histories from some very exclusive private homes. If you have always wanted to peek inside the bedrooms of the European aristocracy, past and present, as well as those of prominent American artists, designers and socialites, this book is a must-have. There are at least a dozen pages devoted to the beds of Napoleon, Josephine, Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette, Madame Du Barry and the perpetually recumbent Madame Recamier. In the event you are ever asked to stay the weekend with Kelly and Calvin Klein, you might do well to check out three of the guest rooms photographed here so you can put your dibs in for the one you like best. The next time you visit Gloucestershire, England, you simply must call in every favor ever owed you in order to wrangle an invite to the country home of Lord Jamie Neidpath, whose drawing room holds two of the most incredibly fabulous Chinese Chippendale daybeds. Real showstoppers these! I personally plan to stay a bit closer to home in the unlikely event Pauline Boardman or Baroness Marie-Helene de Rothschild need an apartment (or should I say bedroom?) sitter. These two grandes dames sleep in rooms a storybook princess would covet. It was quite puzzling to come upon the photograph of a 19th-century Kang opium bed. It is very difficult to imagine anyone snoozing on something so clearly hard and cold. The only conclusion I could come to was that it is called an opium bed because you would have to smoke a great deal of opium before you could possibly fall asleep on it.",1991-12-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"GIFT BOOKS: THE BIG PICTURE;
Looking Divine","This is a marvelous book but misnamed. It is not an encyclopedia because it fails to include all divinities, or even the majority. Among the Norse divinities, for example, AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ARCHETYPAL SYMBOLISM (Shambhala, $125; $150 after Jan. 1) touches on only five, and those lightly. The word ""archetypal"" is used loosely, to refer to themes that appear in various cultures widely separated in space or time. Basically, this volume is a simple picture book, a tribute to fine printing. Paintings, reliefs, sculptures and ritual objects from all over the world appear in full color, accompanied by prose that is often colorless. Among the 120 photographed objects is a lively relief, ""The Divine Child Dancing on a Lotus,"" from the Egyptian temple of Idfu. The child is Horus. We first get a physical description of the relief, helpfully identifying the several musical instruments portrayed. Under the heading ""Cultural Context"" we receive historical and symbolical information about lotuses, about Egyptian temples, and about Isis and Osiris, the parents of the Divine Child. The ""Archetypal Commentary"" that follows begins: ""The child is a universal symbol of the unknowable but latent possibilities of the future together with the concrete, specific inheritance of the past."" The language feels pompous and full of cliches. Later we read: ""This child that is born out of the lotus is also a newborn sun, revealing the necessary relationship between the conscious ego and the dark, potent realm of the unconscious from which it emerges."" Reading this, we feel as if we are eating archetypal airplane food. I don't want to be ungrateful for ""An Encyclopedia of Archetypal Symbolism,"" because it gives enormous pleasure and touches the mind; but for a book offering such magnificent symbolic artworks, we need prose as least as good as the photography. The author, or authors, are not identified; presumably the editor, Beverly Moon -- the managing editor of Tricycle, a Buddhist magazine -- is responsible. A few of the commentaries shrewdly summarize recent speculations about divinity; some reprint excellent short passages by Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, among others. The book's organization lacks concentration and intensity. It claims to cover 15 enormous themes, including ""Cosmos and Creation,"" ""Saviors,"" ""Sacred Animals,"" ""Sacred Marriage"" and ""Death."" The commentators in their archetypal planes fly high above these matters. Having access to the 13,000 photographs now in the Jungian archives, Ms. Moon might have done better to have chosen a single theme -- sacred marriage, for example -- and given us 120 photographs and 120 essays on that. Meanwhile we have this elegant book as a sweet sampling of the riches hidden in the archival castle.",1991-12-01T05:00:00+0000

Stately Faces of England","The American-born photographer Eve Arnold found Britain to be a haven from the ""political darkness and fear"" of her homeland in the early 1960's. For this reason she really does love Britain, and in THE GREAT BRITISH (Knopf, $40) she has taken pictures of every kind of Britisher, from the rich and powerful, posturing on their vast estates, to the weakest being looked after by the Salvation Army. It is difficult not to feel, however, that she liked these people against all odds. Many of her fascinating photographs are not without a certain irony. There is a picture of Sir Alec and Lady Douglas-Home that resembles one of those ""problem"" pictures that, in the 20's, the Royal Academy used to feature in its annual exhibitions; it could be entitled ""The Impasse,"" or ""Boredom."" We are also shown the Rev. Gregory Wilkins mowing his lawn; the skirts of his cassock are pinned up behind him, giving his bare knees a jaunty, almost Folies-Bergere look. There is a portrait of Reginald Maudling, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, on his farm with a pig in the background that is quite definitely imitating him. The beautiful colored portrait of Lady Spencer-Churchill depicts her wearing an expression of stoical dignity beneath a painting of an equally somber bulldog. Even a group of soccer fans looks less jubilant than downright surly. Only the Queen Mother, dressed as always like a publican's wife who has just won ""the pools,"" looks as though she ever said ""Cheese"" for the camera. Everything and everyone else, particularly the weather and the schoolgirls, looks glum, but Ms. Arnold's camera still bestows a keen interest and a kindness on whatever it sees. This is primarily a picture book, but the text is also lively. Ms. Arnold has enjoyed a full life. She has been everywhere -- Russia, Afghanistan, Arabia -- and she has taken the trouble to be a mother and a grandmother at the same time. It doesn't matter whether you share Ms. Arnold's love of Britain or not; this is a beautifully produced record, full of sly humor and deep compassion for its inhabitants, shown living, working and playing in their natural habitat during the two decades before Margaret Thatcher's acid reign.

Thomas passed Bob Lanier as the Pistons' career scorer when he hit a free throw with 3 minutes 53 seconds left in the third quarter, giving him his 15,489th point. ""It's great, but it's not important as the championships we've won,"" Thomas said about the mark. ""The most important thing is that we won the game."" Houston had cut the Pistons' lead to 78-74 with 8:23 left in the game, but Joe Dumars, who had been 1 of 8 from the field at that point, hit a jumper, buried a 3-pointer, then made another jumper to increase the lead to 11. Otis Thorpe led Houston with 20 points and 14 rebounds. (AP) Trail Blazers 91, Bullets 87: Clyde Drexler scored 20 points, including three free throws in the final 1 minute 23 seconds, lifting the Trail Blazers past the Washington Bullets in Portland. The Bullets closed to 85-83 with 2:13 remaining, but Portland scored the next 5 points on free throws to regain control. Rookie Larry Stewart led the Bullets with a season-high 19 points, 13 of them in the first quarter. (AP) N.H.L. Oilers Rout Canucks Bill Ranford made 33 saves and the Oilers' previously dormant offense came to life in a 7-0 drubbing of the Vancouver Canucks yesterday in Edmonton. With the Oilers ahead by 3-0 after the first period, Ranford stopped 16 shots, including a penalty shot, in the second period. It was Ranford's first shutout of the season and the third time the Oilers have beaten the Canucks, who lead the Smythe Division. Scott Mellanby scored twice for the Oilers, who had averaged only 3.04 goals through their first 25 games. Edmonton announced that Bernie Nicholls, obtained from the Rangers as part of the Mark Messier trade, will report for Friday's game in Winnipeg. (AP) Bruins 5, Whalers 4: Peter Douris and Bob Carpenter scored 15 seconds apart in the first minute of the third period as the Bruins held off the Hartford Whalers in Boston. Douris retrieved a 90-foot drive by Ray Bourque off the backboards and fired the puck past goalie Kay Whitmore 44 seconds into the third period. Carpenter then raced down the slot to convert his own rebound and give the Bruins a 4-1 lead just 59 seconds into the period with his sixth goal in the last five games. (AP) Jets 3, Blackhawks 2: Winnipeg rallied as Thomas Steen tied the game with 7 seconds left in regulation and Darrin Shannon scored 1 minutes 9 seconds into overtime for a victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in Winnipeg. Shannon took a pass across the slot from Pat Elynuik and whipped the puck into the net, handing the Blackhawks their fifth straight loss and extending the Jets' unbeaten streak to seven games. Steen, playing his second game of the season since returning from a back injury, sent the game into overtime by backhanding a rebound into the net for his first goal. (AP) TENNIS Witsken Wins Final Todd Witsken defeated Wayne Ferreira, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, yesterday to win the South African Open in Johannesburg. In the final, the 28-year-old American dropped his first set of the tournament, then fought back with a patient baseline game and sharp second-serve returns. With the 20-year-old Johannesburg resident ahead by 5-4 in the first set, Witsken double-faulted on set point. Witsken came back in the second set, breaking Ferreira early by returning winners off second serves. Ferreira led by 4-2 in the third set, when Witsken seemed to increase his intensity to win on his serves and break Ferreira in the eighth and 10th games. (AP) SKIING Spaniard Takes Slalom Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain edged Vreni Schneider of Switzerland yesterday to win the World Cup women's slalom in Lech, Austria. Fernandez-Ochoa had the fastest time in the first run, clearing the 51 gates 41.55 seconds. The 28-year-old Madrid native, who plans to retire after this season, was second fastest over the 52-gate second run in 45.14, for a combined time of 1 minutes 26.69 seconds. It was her fourth World Cup victory in 10 years of competition. Schneider, who won Saturday's race by rallying from eighth after the first run, again was eighth after the first run yesterday. She had the fastest time for the second at 44.55 for a total of 1:27.11. Petra Kronberger of Austria was third at 1:27.59. (AP) SWIMMING U.S. Open Mark Set in 1,500 Glen Housman of Australia set a United States Open record in the 1,500-meter freestyle yesterday in Minneapolis, capturing the event in 14 minutes 58.55 seconds.

us,Close My Account,"More and more people are trading in bank credit cards with interest rates of about 20 percent for ones with lower rates, as low as 9 1/2 percent these days. You can transfer balances from an old card to a new card. The issuer of the new card provides a special blank check that you fill out and mail to the issuer of the old card. That amount is then put on the new card's balance sheet at the new interest rate. Closing an account is not complicated, but it has to be done properly, or you can jeopordize your credit rating. Here is how to close an account. Call the Issuer Telephone the issuer of the old card through its toll-free customer-service number and explain that you want to close the account. Some issuers will accept telephone instructions; others want them in writing. When You Write If you write, cut up your card into several several pieces (to insure that the numbers and magnetic strip are unusable), and mail the card and letter to the issuer. Keep a photocopy of both the letter and the cut-up card, showing that you've fulfilled your obligation to make the card unusable if it fails to get to the bank. Follow-Up About two weeks after closing the account, call the issuer's customer-service number to see if the account has been closed or is in the process of being closed. Final Payments Don't assume that because the balance is paid, the account is closed. You may still owe money for purchases that were not posted when you asked that the account be closed, for an annual fee and for accumulated interest on unpaid charges. Call and get the final balance, and tell the issuer to waive the annual fee. (Source: Bank Rate Monitor)",1991-12-07T05:00:00+0000

us,'Never Give Up',"Her memories of a feisty grandmother inspired Pat York, a British-born photographer and magazine writer, to produce GOING STRONG (Arcade/Little, Brown, $35), an album of photographs and interviews with 70 men and women, all of them going strong after passing their 75th birthdays. Ms. York's work will amuse those who have reached that golden age and inspire those who aspire to achieve it. Two-thirds of her subjects are Americans; the rest are British. The majority are household names: George Abbott (the oldest at 104), Barbara Cartland, Julia Child, John Kenneth Galbraith, Sir John Gielgud, Gene Kelly, Burgess Meredith and Ronald Reagan, to name a few. Equally fascinating in their own ways are John Robert (Rabbit) Close, a Yorkshire trader who will buy and sell anything in which there's a profit; Mabel James, a cloakroom attendant in a London nightclub; Lees Meadowcraft, the senior guide at an English castle; C. A. Scott, one of the owners of an Atlanta daily newspaper, and Sidney Smith, an English gardener. Ms. York's camera is more uniformly successful than her tape recorder; the photographs, rendered in full color, are all striking. A life of endless rounds of golf, bridge playing and television watching is not these oldsters' cup of tea.

From the kente cloth patterns inside the covers to the 125 recipes gleaned from Mr. Copage's family and friends, the book celebrates the culinary contributions of Africa and the culinary diversity of black Americans. Mr. Copage, who is an editor at The New York Times Magazine, divides the volume into seven sections to correspond to the seven principles of Kwanzaa, with anecdotes that illustrate the virtues of unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. Interspersed are lively sections about Malcolm X, Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, Anansi the spider (an African trickster character) and even Mr. Coppage's feelings about Brer Rabbit. The section on breads has recipes for sweet potato muffins with walnut streusel and chile-spiked spoon bread. Anecdotes about Frederick Douglass and Berry Gordy accompany the beverage recipes. The recipes from Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean and black America capture the flavor of the African diaspora.

What is cited in THE FILMS OF MERCHANT IVORY (Abrams, $45) by Robert Emmet Long as ""the longest collaboration in film history"" began in 1961, acquired a critical boost with ""Shakespeare Wallah"" in 1965 and entered a larger-scale phase after the commercial success of ""Heat and Dust"" in 1983. After three brief biographical chapters, Mr. Long provides a film-by-film account of the 31 movies with which the members of the team have been involved to date. As do their admirers -- who also see beyond the pretentious aspects of the films -- Mr. Long appreciates the team's tendency to ""not rush to make a point, being more interested in the texture of experience as it is revealed in gradual accretions,"" as well as their ""elliptical approach to their characters in which what is left unsaid is often preferred to what is stated overtly."" But an apologist's approach ultimately strains both credibility and patience, when every film seems to be a masterpiece and any reservation is followed by a ""but."" The screenplay for ""Mahatma and the Mad Boy,"" for example, is ""too schematic"" on the one hand, ""but it is effective"" on the other. ""Slaves of New York"" is presented as ""flawed in certain respects . . . but it is a good film that manages to be both light-hearted and philosophic about young artists in Manhattan.""

Witnesses differ on whether the judge did so, but Ms. Holtzman was reprimanded for accusing him without reading a stenographer's record or interviewing the lawyers and court officers who were present.

If the person has given exceptional service during the year, it is customary to give a little more than usual and to include special thanks. Doorman or other building staff: $10 to $30 each Nanny or other personal helper: A week's salary, or a gift of similar value. Cleaning help: A week's salary. Hairdresser, barber, manicurist: 20 percent of the cost of a normal visit, or a gift of similar value. Newspaper deliverer: $10 to $30 depending upon frequency of use.

In the rap world, borrowing a piece of music is called sampling. Mr. O'Sullivan's song, which was No. 1 on the Billboard charts for six weeks in 1972, has been recorded by Andy Williams, Ray Coniff, Sarah Vaughan and other singers who obtained the rights. But Mr. O'Sullivan contends that Biz Markie used eight bars of the song without permission. Last week a Federal judge in Manhattan concluded that there was abundant evidence that the singer violated Mr. O'Sullivan's rights. He referred the case to the United States Attorney for prosecution and issued an injunction barring distribution of the album and ordering the return of unsold copies.

us,The Gang That Wouldn't Talk Straight,"THEY sure didn't look like Bugsy Siegel. They didn't even look like John Gotti. But the 28 reputed associates of the Colombo crime family who slouched into a Brooklyn courthouse last week, their faces jammed into the collars of lumberjack shirts or leather jackets, weren't there to preen like peacocks. And, it turned out, they weren't there to sing like canaries, either. Authorities say the Colombos are in the middle of a civil war, and 41 of them were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury so prosecutors could invite them to discuss anything they knew about five recent murders. Only 28 showed up. Most refused to answer any questions and were told to return on Jan. 6. The head of organized crime control in District Attorney Charles J. Hynes's office said some had agreed to appear before the grand jury, but lawyers for those who came to the courthouse denied that. They called the carefully orchestrated parade before the television cameras ""sort of like a Christmas party"" for the accused mobsters and dismissed it as a publicity stunt by Mr. Hynes. Hints that some of those summoned had agreed to talk might have been calculated to raise tensions between the two factions authorities say the Colombos have split into: one loyal to the boss, Carmine Persico, 58, who is serving a 100-year sentence, and the other loyal to Victor J. Orena, 57, whom Mr. Persico appointed interim boss in 1989, and then grew disenchanted with. But whether or not the inquiry produces any answers, the subpoenas and the publicity may have helped stem the bloodshed. Although several Colombo associates were arrested with guns and walkie-talkies early in the week, there had been no shootings since Dec. 8, when an 18-year-old worker in a bagel shop was gunned down. The police said he was apparently an innocent victim of the war, shot because the shop's two owners are part of the Persico faction. That killing, and the three pedestrians run down on Nov. 29 by the fleeing target of a drive-by shooting, helped unleash the flood of subpoenas.",1991-12-22T05:00:00+0000

All other bubblies, from elsewhere in France as well as from Spain, Italy, Germany, California, Washington state and New York, are properly known as sparkling wines. But regardless of where the wine originates, there are a number of terms commonly used on all sparkling wine labels that give some indication of how the wine will taste. Here's a glossary to help you choose the right one for your palate. Blanc de blancs: Sparkling wine made only from white grapes, usually Chardonnay; often a light-bodied wine Blanc de noirs: Sparkling wine made from pinot noir black grapes, often rich and full-bodied, usually golden colored but sometimes pinkish Brut: Very dry Brut zero, ultra brut: Drier than brut, usually very light and austere Cremant: Softer bubbles Demi-sec: The sweetest Extra dry: Semisweet, between brut and demi-sec Nonvintage: No vintage year on the label indicates a blend of wines from several years.

us,Georgia in New York,"In 1916, Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986) made her New York debut with an exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's gallery. In 1932, she made her break with the city after she failed to finish a mural that had been commissioned for Radio City Music Hall. What she painted and drew in the 16 intervening years -- notably in New York City and at her summer house in Lake George, N.Y. -- is the subject of GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: THE NEW YORK YEARS (Callaway/Knopf, $100), a gigantic and sumptuous book of 91 of the artist's works in watercolor, charcoal and oils. These are not the usual nude flowers and dry bones but O'Keeffe's abstractions, stylized cityscapes, luminous still lifes and cool renderings of barns and shells. While one can read O'Keeffe's coming obsession with flower anatomy even into the blue cracks of sky between black skyscrapers and into her peculiar view of split-open clamshells, what is most striking about these works is that abstraction was not something O'Keeffe worked into but something she worked out of. Bram Dijkstra, a professor of comparative literature at the University of California, San Diego, who has written a pompous essay to accompany the paintings, thinks he knows why. According to him, when Stieglitz made his famous comment about O'Keeffe's work -- ""Finally, a woman on paper!"" -- she was bent on disproving the ""gender ideology"" by showing she could do "" 'virile' abstraction"" with the best of the boys, until she finally found ""a visual language which transcended the artificially constructed boundaries of gender."" That is an absurd and anachronistic interpretation, but this collection of O'Keeffe's work is exciting because we can see just how far and wide she ranged -- in color and in subject -- before she finally settled on the style to which we have become so accustomed.",1991-12-29T05:00:00+0000
