An idea, or conception in the mind, is a kind of gift given to designers and inventors in any field, which is then followed up by laborious proofs to show that the thing can work. As the technological age advanced, this country prided itself on American know-how. But beginning in the 1960's, American travelers began to observe that designers in other countries frequently came up with different solutions, sometimes even better and more attractive, for such common essentials as light switches and salad spinners, to say nothing of cars and spaceships.

Maybe that is ''because they face down life and death or because the sense to worry has been knocked clean out of their heads.'' Mr. Wiley, a writer for Sports Illustrated, makes a two-fisted effort to understand the games some men play, and in ''Serenity'' he has taken the reader on an unflinching, sensitive and often sad boxing journey. Along the way, we visit a battered Bobby Chacon, a former champion who fought a bout the day after his wife committed suicide; we step into the world of Emanuel Steward, who runs the Kronk Boxing Club in Detroit, and we listen to his most successful fighter, Tommy Hearns: ''I was made a fighter. . . . I wanted to come and go as I pleased.'' And besides profiling the big men in the game now, such as Sugar Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson, Mr. Wiley brings us along on visits to some old-timers. ''I used to be real bad on the race question,'' Lew Jenkins, a white boxer who was the lightweight champion in the early 1940's, tells Mr. Wiley. ''See, I had never met a better man than me, any color. Then I met Armstrong,'' he continues, referring to the black fighter Henry Armstrong, who was a champion at several weight classes. ''Halfway through the fight, it dawned on me. I could never beat him. So I stopped being thataway right then. Right in the middle of a fight. And I've been a happier man ever since.''",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Eisler: Lieder Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, baritone; Aribert Reimann, piano. Teldec 8.44092; CD only. Unexpectedly good stuff here, at least for those of us who haven't previously taken Eisler for a subtle song composer. The songs were composed between 1939 and 1956; the texts are from Pascal, Anacreon, Shakespeare and others but mostly from Brecht; the idiom varies (sometimes erratically) from something related to the cabaret to 12-tone density. ''Thoughts on the Duration of Exile'' has a nattering, pattering quality that captures the poem exactly. ''To a Portable Radio'' is an adorable, plaintive miniature that should find its way quickly into the encore repertory. There are other strong pieces, and some that betray a lack of reliable musical invention. Mr. Fischer-Dieskau is sometimes vehement where irony might suit better, but when a light touch is wanted, he is excellent. The piano playing is specific and imaginative. - Will Crutchfield 'The Piano Album' Stephen Hough, piano. Virgin Classics VC7 90732-2; CD and cassette. Here are 20 short pieces generally heard (if at all) as recital encores. Some were very popular at one time (Paderewski Minuet, Levitzki Waltz in A). Some are little known (Palmgren's ''En Route,'' Godowsky's ''Gardens of Buitenzorg''). Some are songs in Hough's own transcriptions (Woodforde-Finden's ''Kashmiri Song,'' Rodgers's ''My Favorite Things''). But all are effective pianistically, and some are of unusual difficulty. Mr. Hough is a powerful technician, very effective when his fingers can keep moving. Stylistically he can be mannered, especially in music that demands a singing line. There he starts fooling around, adding unnecessary ''expressive'' devices. His performance of the Levitzki waltz is an outrageous exercise in self-indulgence. He must learn to play such pieces simply and naturally, as Levitzki did in his own recording 50 years ago. - Harold C. Schonberg Gilles: 'Motet a St. Jean Baptiste,' Three Lamentations Veronique Gens, soprano; Jean-Paul Fouchecourt, Douglas Nasrawi, tenors; Jean-Louis Paya, baritone; Le Concert Spirituel conducted by Herve Niquet. Adda 581119; CD only. For years, those fortunate enough to have stumbled upon the occasional recording of the Requiem by the Provencal composer Jean Gilles (1668-1705) have craved opportunities to hear other substantial portions of his work. Here is more choral music, and it is every bit as delicious as one expected - perky, quirky and as oddly irrepressible in the three Lamentations for Holy Week as in the Mass for the Dead. While one has yet to hear great profundity from Gilles, this further evidence of his remarkable ingenuity makes one only more determined to keep up the search. Despite uneven solo efforts, the performances are always adequate and often better. - James R. Oestreich 'The Earliest Disks' Berliner Gramophone Recordings, 1890-1901. Symposium 1058; CD only. This is strictly for curio and amusement value, but as such not inconsiderable. Where else can you hear the Royal Bucks Hussars Band playing ''The Deep Blue Sea'' with piccolo solo? Or Vess L. Ossman (''America's Greatest Banjoist'') in the ''Smokey Mokes Cakewalk''? There is even an 1896 audio advertisement for Plant's Baking Powder. A charismatic Spanish singer called ''El Muchuelo'' and a gypsy band from Budapest, both recorded in 1899, have some evocative power, as does an impassioned intonation of the 23d Psalm. The selection of 39 disks begins with ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,'' shouted over ferocious surface roar by a voice that may well be Emile Berliner's own. - W. C. Beach: Mass in E flat Daniel Beckwith, organ; Michael May Festival Chorus conducted by Michael May. Newport Classic 60008; CD and cassette. This is a frustrating recording. Amy (Mrs. H. H. A.) Beach (1867-1944) was one of the more imaginative American composers of the late 19th century, and this richly operatic, extroverted, joyous Mass is a fine example of her assured way of using - and spicing up - the musical conventions of her day. Composed for full orchestra, it is presented here in a workable transcription for organ, harp and percussion. The performance is little more than adequate, however, and the dry clarity of the recording exposes the thinness of the choir and the unhomogeneity of the solo ensembles. Still, it is worth attempting to ignore the shortcomings and concentrate on the music. - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ John Coltrane: 'Coltrane Plays the Blues,' 'Ole Coltrane' Atlantic. 1382-2, 1373-2; all three formats. At his worst John Coltrane played for more than an hour, transfixed, rocked by an endless, lulling pattern of modes. This was also Mr. Coltrane at his best, a mystic who heard the drone of eternity. ''Ole Coltrane'' (1961), which highlights the sluggish, withdrawn player, is one of his poorest records. ''Coltrane Plays the Blues'' (1960) is one of his best. Here he is blunt to the point of rudeness, his hard-nosed attack waking up old chord changes. The teacher of every tenor player since 1960 can be heard, as he cracks through to the otherworldly sound so many have imitated. But the student of Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young, apparent on every cut, is just as impressive. - Richard B. Woodward George Clinton: 'The Cinderella Theory' Paisley Parker/Warner Bros. 25994; all three formats. Crisp rhythms, mildly eccentric melodies and unpredictable overlays - jazz, rap, stray voices and choruses - mark ''The Cinderella Theory'' as the work of George Clinton, the mastermind of Parliament-Funkadelic, the most influential funk group of the 1970's. But despite Mr. Clinton's high standards, it's a thin album; too many songs are straightforward funk workouts, lacking the illuminating juxtapositions and polymorphous carnality of the best P-Funk. ''Goin' On,'' ''The Cinderella Theory,'' ''There I Go Again'' and ''Tweakin' '' (with guest raps by Public Enemy) live up to Mr. Clinton's catalogue, but there's too much filler. - Jon Pareles Dresser, Feldman and Roberts: 'Arcado String Trio' JMT 834 429-2; all three formats. The trio - Mark Dresser, bass; Mark Feldman, violin, and Hank Roberts, cello - moves from achingly melodic compositions that synthesize jazz with minimalism to noisy pieces that last for about 30 seconds. The group's members, part of just about every important new-music band on the downtown scene, are virtuosos, able to sift through the best elements of European classical music, pop and jazz and bring them to a rapprochement that sounds new. At once rigorous and rhythmic, the group, delicately balanced and precise, has found a lush sensuality in the midst of New York's urban clangor. - Peter Watrous Eurythmics: 'We Too Are One' Arista 8606; all three formats. A strong current of irony has always run through Eurhythmics' chilly pop romanticism, but it has never been as scaldingly direct as on their new album. Almost all the songs contemptuously examine examples of modern-day hubris, with images of love and salvation used as metaphors for malign political power. The golden couple exalted in ''King and Queen of America,'' a blaring rock-and-roll strut, turn out to be ''king of nothing and the queen of rage.'' The oracular ''Day Goes Down'' laments the decline of humanistic values in the age of Reagan and Thatcher. Melodically, this is the duo's strongest album. - Stephen Holden The D. O. C.: 'No One Can Do It Better' Ruthless 91275-4; all three formats. It's odd that rap can be painfully stupid and bigoted, yet still be brilliant formally, terrific dance music. The latest Los Angeles rapper to arrive on the charts, D. O. C. (Tray Curry, age 21), isn't blessed with much more on his head than a Los Angeles Kings hat, and keeping the misogyny and antihomosexual commentary down to a temperate one or two incidences a side, Mr. Curry sticks to a topic closer to his heart: himself. And he does it in style; his rapping, made up of short, clipped bursts, double-time flurries and syncopations that keep things on a rhythmically elevated level, floats on tremendous rhythm tracks that smudge samples together faster than nearly any other record. - P.W.",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

us,THE ARTIST AS ART,"Those familiar with Gilbert and George as a team of contemporary British artists are apt to be nonplused by the laborious ideology applied to their quirky work by Wolf Jahn in his critical study, THE ART OF GILBERT & GEORGE: Or, An Aesthetic of Existence (Thames and Hudson, Paper, $24.95). First celebrated in 1968 for presenting themselves as ''living sculptures'' that proclaimed the artist as art, Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore - who have lived and worked together since graduating from a London art school in 1969 - have continued to appear as photographic images in the large-scale paintings and gridlike collages that have marked their output ever since. But where others have detected a sense of irony in their redefinition of sculpture and art, Mr. Jahn's relentlessly sobering view is bound to alienate more readers than it might attract. No mere Gilbert and George groupie, Mr. Jahn, a German critic, emerges as an apostle with unabashed adoration. Their work resides ''outside the scope of normal art history,'' he declares. ''It is not for us, any longer, to try to grasp and comprehend them; they stand, wall-like, and contemplate us.'' Their work is discussed primarily in terms of its tendency to recapitulate ''the world's Genesis and man's primal imaginative act. . . . They create, just as in the beginning the world was created from the corpse of a sacrificed deity.'' Indeed, according to Mr. Jahn, Gilbert and George are on nothing less than ''a crusade to reconquer human values.'' If they were not always in service to his fanatical and inflated theory, Mr. Jahn's technically detailed descriptions of the many artworks represented, well served by David Britt's translation, would perhaps be more compelling.",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

In the 130-kilo (286 pounds) title match, Ali Reza Soleimani of Iran upset the Olympic silver medalist Bruce Baumgartner of the United States in the day's most exciting encounter. Soleimani came from behind to tie the score with 10 seconds left in the match. In overtime, he threw Baumgartner, the world's top-ranked heavyweight freestyler, to win by 5-4.(AP) Cycling Briton in Lead: Mauro Gianetti of Switzerland and Robert Millar of England broke away from the pack yesterday to dominate the fourth stage of the Tour of Britain, which ends today in London. Gianetti, who rides for the Helvetia team, won the 141-mile stage from Birmingham, England, to Cardiff in 5 hours 46 minutes 33 seconds. Millar, a member of the Z-Peugeot squad, finished second in the same time as Gianetti, while the main pack was more than five minutes behind. The second-place finish pushed Millar into the overall race lead with a time of 18:19:59. Gianetti was second, eight seconds behind.(AP) Soccer Victory for West Ham: Mark Ward's goal in the fifth minute kept West Ham atop the Second Division of the English League with a 1-1 tie at Hull in a soccer game that ended in a brawl yesterday. Watford scored a 3-1 home victory at home over Leicester to move into second place, and Blackburn also stayed undefeated with a 2-2 tie at home against Oxford. (AP) Golf 4-Shot Lead for Norman: Greg Norman attacked the Tuckaway Country Club course in Franklin, Wis., with another flurry of birdies yesterday, shooting a six-under-par 66 to take a four-stroke lead after three rounds of the Greater Milwaukee Open. Norman, who began the day tied for the lead with Wayne Grady and Mark Lye, birdied four of the first six holes and finished with a tournament-record 54-hole score of 17-under 199. Wayne Levi, Bob Lohr and P.H. Horgan III were next at 203.(AP) McBee Leads by 1: Rives McBee scored an eagle and three birdies over the final eight holes to charge to a one-stroke lead yesterday after two rounds of the Senior Golf Classic in Lexington, Ky. McBee, of Dallas, shot a five-under 65 on the second day to take a seven-under 133 into today's final round at Marriott's Griffin Gate course.(AP) Gerring Leads L.P.G.A. Field: Cathy Gerring recovered from a first-hole bogey yesterday to shoot a four-under-par 68 and take the first-round lead in the Ladies' Professional Golf Association Rail Classic in Springfield, Ill. Six players, including Beth Daniel, were tied for second at 69. Several others made runs at the lead, as 25 golfers broke or matched par. Gerring, who lost the 1986 Rail Classic in a sudden-death playoff, bogeyed her opening hole, No. 10, after putting her second shot into a greenside bunker. But she birdied the next three to finish the first nine at a 2-under-par 34. (AP) Harness Racing Goalie Jeff Wins Pace: Goalie Jeff, the top-rated 3-year-old pacing colt in North America, won an elimination race and the final heat with equal ease yesterday to capture the $377,650 James B. Dancer Memorial Pace at Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. Driven by Mike Lachance, the son of Cam Fella won the $113,295 elimination division by 2 3/4 lengths in 1:56. He went on to take the $151,060 final, leading from start to finish and winning again by 2 3/4 lengths in 1:56 2/5. Goalie Jeff clocked a 27.4-second final quarter to hold off Resonator, who won his elimination division in 1:55. The victory pushed Goalie Jeff, from the Centre Ice Stable of Ontario, Canada, over the million-dollar mark in earnings this year, giving him $1,068,317. Goalie Jeff returned $2.60, $2.20 and $2.10 for $2 across the board.(AP)",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Putting the Program Back in Program Music,"In Beethoven's time, the conductor Roger Norrington pointed out during his recent ''Beethoven Experience'' at the Pepsico Summerfare, it was altogether customary for a music critic to ''analyze'' a new piece with repeated reference to subjective content. That even instrumental music should carry an extramusical meaning - a ''program'' of some sort - seemed perfectly natural. In our own century, it has been acceptable to analyze music only in objective, technical terms. ''But,'' Mr. Norrington observed, ''the tide is turning.'' Interest in program music - on the part of composers, audiences and writers about music - has historically ebbed and flowed. Beethoven is said to have remarked already in 1823 that audiences were no longer so poetically sensitive as they had been a few decades earlier. The lowest ebb, however, occurred in the 20th century, between the two world wars, a period dominated musically by the figure of Igor Stravinsky. As a young man, Stravinsky understandably resisted Wagner, and he detested Richard Strauss and everything that composer represented. What the post-Romantic Strauss represented as much as anything, of course, was program music, which the 1920's, largely given over to Stravinskian Neo-Classicism, therefore rejected.",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

At the height of the Beatles' popularity, their manager, Brian Epstein, was almost as much of a star as they were - and with good reason, as Ray Coleman's carefully researched biography documents. Epstein's belief in the carefully researched biography documents. Epstein's belief in the Beatles and his hands-on role in molding their image - against considerable odds, he persuaded the scruffy and obstreperous Liverpool rockers to clean up their act - were the keys to their worldwide fame. But Mr. Coleman, who has also written biographies of John Lennon and the rock guitarist Eric Clapton, overstates Epstein's historical significance when he claims that he ''provided the springboard for a social revolution.'' Epstein's role in the ''social revolution'' the Beatles helped ignite had as much to do with luck as with design; and is undercut by the fact that almost none of his other management clients achieved lasting success. Grandiose claims aside, ''The Man Who Made the Beatles'' is a fascinating look at a remarkable entrepreneur. It is also surprisingly short on sensationalism. While he deals candidly with Epstein's homosexuality and his problems with drugs and alcohol, Mr. Coleman discounts the two most prevalent rumors about him: that his drug-related death in 1967 was a suicide rather than an accident, and that he had an affair with Lennon. The evidence he offers to prove that Epstein and Lennon were not lovers, however, is circumstantial; ''firm declarations of John's heterosexuality from Cynthia [ his first wife ] and many other women'' hardly rule out the possibility that Lennon might have had a homosexual fling or two.",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE PLAYER, by Michael Tolkin. (Vintage, $7.95.) In the cutthroat world of Hollywood, a studio executive finds that random murder seems a logical extension of his job. Last year our reviewer, Janet Maslin, called the book ''a shrewd, entertainingly dark Hollywood novel.'' MISSING BEAUTY, by Teresa Carpenter. (Zebra, $4.95.) In this true story of obsession and murder, a middle-aged medical school professor resorts to homicide to kick an expensive habit: Robin Benedict, a prostitute from Boston's Combat Zone. In this account of the 1983 case, Teresa Carpenter ''has fulfilled the subject's promise,'' David Black said here last year. ''She has been indefatigable in her research, and she has diligently reconstructed the events leading up to the crime, the crime itself and the community's reaction to it.'' THE UNIVERSE, AND OTHER FICTIONS, by Paul West. (Overlook, $10.95.) In one of these stories the protagonist is a neuron - more specifically, the 9,999,999,999th cell in Shakespeare's brain. Other characters in the collection include God, the sun and Moby Dick, author of the novel ''Captain Ahab.'' ''In Mr. West's fiction, weird, beautiful and unimaginable scientific facts apparently stand in for the banished ultimates, providing us with a sense of something outside ourselves,'' Linda Bamber said here in 1988. ''Again and again we are confronted with the huge spaces of astronomy, the vast sweep of geological time.'' THE EAGLE AND THE LION: The Tragedy of American-Iranian Relations, by James A. Bill. (Yale University, $13.95.) A foreign policy scholar re-creates the drama of America's failed attempt to manufacture its own Middle Eastern ally by propping up the precarious kingdom of the Shah. Last year our reviewer, Fouad Ajami, called the book ''the most detailed and vivid account yet of America's encounter with Iran. . . . Running through the book is a touch of nostalgia for a more innocent time.'' ACTS OF WAR: The Behavior of Men in Battle, by Richard Holmes. (Free Press, $12.95.) Plucking details from the long, slow sweep of military history, Richard Holmes tells what it was like to be cannon fodder in the world's various wars. ''The result is satisfyingly exhaustive,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The Times in 1986. ''A random list of odd topics covered would include: insects, cigarettes, suicide, venereal disease, pack-weights, 'Dear John' letters, battle cries, plunder, the sounds different weapons make, the smell of decomposing bodies, fatigue, the most-feared types of wounds, the ability of women to kill and the role of rumor on the battlefield.'' THE BIG NOWHERE, by James Ellroy. (Mysterious Press, $4.95.) In the midst of the 1950's Hollywood red scare, homosexuals are stalked by a serial killer. The Times's John Gross said last year that ''the mood of the period is adroitly conjured up, and some choice real-life characters put in an appearance: Howard Hughes, Johnny Stompanato, the ganglord Mickey Cohen.'' POOR SUPPORT: Poverty in the American Family, by David T. Ellwood. (Basic, $9.95.) By deciding what values the Government should reinforce, welfare can be used to break instead of perpetuate the cycle of poverty, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government believes. He ''argues persuasively that although poverty is not a disease caused by a flawed welfare system, a major overhaul of our social-spending policies could go a long way toward curing it,'' Tamar Lewin said in The Book Review last year. THE RUB OF THE GREEN, by William Hallberg. (Bantam, $8.95.) After an aspiring golf pro breaks out of a love triangle and lands in prison, he makes a comeback by helping turn a swamp into a two-hole green. This is a ''poignant, beautifully written first novel'' composed in ''a style that is at once lyric and spare,'' David Stout said here last year. SOMERSET HOMECOMING: Recovering a Lost Heritage, by Dorothy Spruill Redford with Michael D'Orso. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) A black woman from Virginia tells how, inspired by Alex Haley's ''Roots,'' she traced her ancestral lineage back to Africa. The story is ''as much about a remarkable woman as about an American people,'' Carl Senna said here in 1988. THE POET AT THE PIANO: Portraits of Writers, Filmmakers, Playwrights, and Other Artists at Work, by Michiko Kakutani. (Peter Bedrick, $8.95.) During the last decade, Michiko Kakutani says in introducing this collection, she has learned that writers and other artists have many different motives for talking to a member of the press. Her subjects include Saul Bellow, Milan Kundera, Ingmar Bergman, David Byrne, Brian De Palma, Sam Shepard and Laurence Olivier. Most of these pieces were written for The Times. FIREFLY SUMMER, by Maeve Binchy. (Dell, $4.95.) An American millionaire comes home to rural Ireland with a plan to build a luxury hotel. Last year our reviewer, Michele Slung, said this is ''the best Binchy yet, and it should send new readers back to her previous works, 'Echoes' and 'Light a Penny Candle' '' (now also available from Dell, $4.95 each). DOVER ONE, by Joyce Porter. (Foul Play Press/Countryman, $4.95.) To get him out of the building, Scotland Yard sends Inspector Wilfred Dover to find the killer of a promiscuous young housemaid. Later, in DOVER TWO ($4.95), the obnoxious detective is dispatched to investigate the case of a woman who may have been murdered twice. ''The novel, like its predecessor, is plotted with the technique of a virtuoso,'' Anthony Boucher said in The Times in 1965.",1989-09-03T05:00:00+0000

Harold Henning, who began the day one stroke back at 134, shot an even-par 70 to finish in second two strokes back.(AP) Ritzman Is Leader: Alice Ritzman birdied the final two holes yesterday to finish off a six-under-par 66 and take a two-shot lead after two rounds of the L.P.G.A. Rail Classic in Springfield, Ill. Ritzman's 36-hole score of 135 put her ahead of Cathy Gerring and Betsy King, this year's leading money-winner. Gerring had 69 yesterday and King shot a 66.(AP) Auto Racing Earnhardt Is First: Dale Earnhardt wasn't going for a bonus yesterday, but he drove as if he were, setting a record pace to win the Southern 500 Nascar stock car race at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. Darrell Waltrip, who did have a chance for the Winston Million, didn't come close to earning the bonus that goes to any driver who wins three of the sport's four major races. Waltrip finished 22d, eight laps back. Earnhardt led eight times for a total of 153 laps in the 367-lap event and averaged a record 135.462 miles an hour, breaking the race record of 134.033 m.p.h. set in 1983 by Cale Yarborough.(AP) Fabi Is Winner: Teo Fabi of Italy raced past Al Unser Jr. 26 laps from the finish, then used a perfect fuel strategy to run away to the Porsche team's first Indy-car victory in the Red Roof Inns 200 yesterday in Lexington, Ohio.(AP) Wrestling Soviet Team Prevails: Soviet wrestlers topped the medal rankings yesterday at the world freestyle championships after winning 4 of 10 titles at the two-day competition in Martigny, Switzerland. Second behind the Soviet team, which also earned two silver and two bronze medals, was the United States team with two championships and four silver medals. In yesterday's concluding matches, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist, John Smith of Stillwater, Okla., defended his world title in the 62-kilo (136.5 pounds) category with an easy 6-0 decision over Gary Bohay of Canada.

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"THE ECONOMY Steel prices have fallen to their lowest point in nearly two years, reflecting softer demand from automobile producers and appliance makers. Analysts said prices would remain weak or decline further the rest of this year. At the same time, the operating rates for the nation's steel mills have tumbled, to 76 percent at the end of August, from 89.5 percent in the comparable period last year and a high of 93.9 percent at the end of March. [ Page 33. ] INTERNATIONAL REPORT Trade talks are set to open in Tokyo today in a new phase of the U.S.-Japan effort to curb the American trade deficit. The talks are aimed at identifying and perhaps altering ''structural impediments'' to trade, which have to do with how each country manages its economy, organizes its businesses and sets basic priorities for its people. The negotiations are expected to last a year, and the going looks like it could be rough. [ 33. ] Developing countries are finding gold in the export of services. The trend is likely to have significiant implications for the world trading system. The third world's increasing stake in other nonmanufacturing activities that economists generally lump together as services is giving impetus to world trade liberalization, many trade officials believe. [ 33. ] Mallorca's rock-bottom hotel prices have benefited thousands of vacationers lured there this summer during the slump in Spain's leading industry, tourism. Amid fears that rooms would remain empty, the hotels started a price war. [ 37. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS The sale of El Diario/La Prensa makes it the latest media organization to realign its ownership and management to capture the attention of a booming Hispanic market. What is noteworthy about the sale of El Diario, the Spanish-language daily newspaper in New York City, is that it reflects a striking change in the makeup and distribution of New York's - and America's - Spanish-reading population since 1980. [ 33. ] American City Business Journals Inc. has scaled back considerably from its peak of two years ago as it tries to recover from its rapid expansion. The company has a new chairman and controlling shareholder. His predecessor told employees two years ago that he would never sell his interest for less than $80 a share. In June, though, he settled for $22.75. [ 38. ] Was the Hollywood writers strike worth it? A year after the five-month walkout, a CBS official says the networks permanently lost 2 percent of their viewers, and a guild leader acknowledges that the strike sharply reduced the work for writers. [ 38. ] Yet another battle has flared in the Dallas newspaper war as a result of the attempt by The Dallas Morning News to strip its archrival, The Dallas Times Herald, of such syndicated treasures as ''Doonesbury,'' ''Dear Abby'' and ''Erma Bombeck.'' Press. [ 38. ] COMPANIES Security Pacific is forging close ties with Mitsui Bank, the banking arm of the Japanese financial and industrial giant, hoping that the relationship will bring new Japanese banking customers to Security Pacific in the United States. Greater possibilities are envisioned, including teaming up with Mitsui, or another Japanese company, on deals in the Pacific Rim or in Europe. [ 33. ] The U.S. will study carefully the $6.75 billion bid for UAL. Although the Government has indicated that it is prepared to take a harder line against leveraged buyouts of airlines, it is unlikely to reject the labor-management offer outright, analysts said. The bid, which offers $300 a share to shareholders, was presented to the UAL board on Friday after the stock exchange closed. [ 33. ] Lee A.

Pierre au Tunnel * (Oct. 30, 1987), 250 West 47th Street (575-1220) - Nearly 40 years on the scene, Pierre au Tunnel is recommended as a homey theater-district bistro serving peasant-style dishes and Gallic classics. Dependable starters are the robust onion soup and pate de tete. Salads are prepared with care, especially such specials as rare sauteed salmon with greens in vinaigrette, and mixed greens with rounds of warm goat cheese. Recommended entrees are lamb chops, beef a la bordelaise and poached grouper with beurre blanc. Desserts are generally attractive and pleasing. Lunch entrees are a la carte, $9 to $15. The four-course prix fixe dinners are $20 to $24. Lunch: noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Saturday; dinner: 5:30 to 11:30 P.M. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and 4:30 to 11:30 P.M.

La Boheme * (Dec. 2, 1988), 24 Minetta Lane (473-6447) - Wide-plank wood-and-stucco walls, Provencal fabrics and an open wood-burning oven give this popular Village restaurant a rustic charm. The menu has many bistro favorites, among them appetizers of saucisson chaud with sliced warm potatoes in a perfectly balanced vinaigrette and eggplant on garlic toast grilled with cheese and tomato. Entrees include grilled baby chicken in a saffron-lemon sauce with french fries, monkfish au poivre, and Provencal-style pizzas. Appetizers are $4.50 to $9.50, entrees $12 to $17.

But Hollywood's version of fall will never be, in Melville's phrase, ''a damp, drizzly November in my soul.''

us,New & Noteworthy,"TRAVELS, by Michael Crichton. (Ballantine, $4.95.) To work his way through medical school, Michael Crichton wrote five pseudonymous thrillers, finally putting his name to ''The Andromeda Strain,'' which made so much money that he didn't have to practice medicine. Becoming disillusioned with his riches, he set off on a spiritual journey, seeking the kind of ''energy'' that doesn't come from batteries. Last year our reviewer, Patricia Bosworth, said she was ''ultimately swept away, not just by his richly informed mind, but his driving curiosity. . . . Michael Crichton may be overly detached, but he seems bound and determined to explore every single mystery in the universe.'' THE TEMPLE, by Stephen Spender. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) Sixty years ago, when 19-year-old Stephen Spender wrote this novel about the adventures of three homosexual Oxford poets in pre-Nazi Germany (modeled on Mr. Spender, W. H. Auden and Christopher Isherwood), it was rejected by his publisher as libelous and obscene. After the long-forgotten manuscript was unearthed in 1985 in the rare-books section of a University of Texas library, Mr. Spender rewrote it. Last year our reviewer, Martin Green, said the story has ''a modern flavor, even today. Its refusal to sound like conventional fiction, or to let us comfortably identify with the hero, is disconcerting in the manner of modern experimental novels.'' THE MATHEMATICAL TOURIST: Snapshots of Modern Mathematics, by Ivars Peterson. (Freeman, $10.95.) While physicists look to quarks as the building blocks of the universe, mathematicians seek reality's fundamentals in fractals, prime numbers, strange attractors, cellular automata and other abstractions. In The Book Review in 1988, Jim Holt wrote that Ivars Peterson's ''tour of mathematics moves along with an exhilarating tension-release rhythm: each of the many sections starts out easy, builds in complexity and detail, and then, just as it threatens to overwhelm the reader, gives way to a new topic.'' In ARCHIMEDES' REVENGE: The Joys and Perils of Mathematics (Fawcett Crest, $4.95), Paul Hoffman, a k a Dr. Crypton, writes about computer chess, thinking machines, impenetrable codes and other areas where mathematics intersects with modern life. In this ''breezy and lighthearted account . . . Mr. Hoffman approaches mathematics as a storyteller, and a good one,'' Mr. Holt said. In another new release, Theoni Pappas demystifies mathematics in a collection of miniature essays called THE JOY OF MATHEMATICS (Wide World/Tetra, $10.95). THE SHOWA ANTHOLOGY: Modern Japanese Short Stories, 1929-1984. Edited by Van C. Gessel and Tomone Matsumoto. (Kodansha, $14.95.) In one of these short stories, a Japanese boy finally masters the skill of bicycle riding the night Gen. Curtis LeMay's B-29 raid destroys Tokyo. Last year our reviewer, Hiroaki Sato, said these stories show the ''remarkable range of literary sensibility and expression'' produced in the last 60 years of Japanese literature. THE DREAMING BRAIN, by J. Allan Hobson. (Basic Books, $10.95.) A professor of psychiatry argues that dreams are tales told by the brain to make sense of the random neural firings that come with sleep. ''The evidence he cites in support of the theory is compelling,'' Gina Kolata said in The Book Review last year. ''He can even induce dreams by injecting the controlling neurons with a key chemical, acetylcholine.'' THE WOMAN WHO WAS NOT ALL THERE, by Paula Sharp. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) Left behind by her friends and children, Marjorie LeBlanc, a single mother in North Carolina, is shocked by sudden illness into remaking her life. In this first novel, Paula Sharp's writing is ''taut and precise,'' Diana Blackwell said here earlier this year. ''Occasionally it even achieves a certain sturdy beauty.'' ONE OF THE GUYS, by Harry Stein. (Pocket Books, $7.95.) Harry Stein, who used to write the Ethics column for Esquire magazine, joins the chorus of authors bemoaning the tribulations of growing up male in America. Such books ''tend to be studiously sociological, ponderously psychological, hortatory, lamentatory, or all of the above,'' Anthony Astrachan said here last year. But this one, saved by the grace of humor, is ''full of pleasures and rewards.'' PRISONER'S DILEMMA, by Richard Powers. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) Suffering from radiation damage, real or imagined, a father tries to lose himself in a fictional world called Hobstown. ''Despite its uneven prose,'' Ursula Hegi said here in 1988, '' 'Prisoner's Dilemma' gives an absorbing view of history, 'that most abstract, detached, impersonal, and curatorial of disciplines.' '' OXFORD BLOOD, by Antonia Fraser. (Bantam, $3.95.) While at Oxford to shoot a series on the life styles of rich and famous undergraduates, the television newswoman Jemima Shore uncovers a murder plot. In 1985 our reviewer, Beverly Lyon Clark, said Antonia Fraser's ''sentences are well-crafted and [ her ] frequent literary allusions tempt the reader to become a literary sleuth, even to deconstruct the novel.'' Bantam has also reprinted JEMIMA SHORE'S FIRST CASE: And Other Stories ($3.95), a collection of 13 mysteries, including one Jemima solves as a 15-year-old student at a Catholic boarding school. THE CONSOLATION OF NATURE: And Other Stories, by Valerie Martin. (Vintage, $6.95.) Last year our reviewer, Charles Johnson, said some of these stories ''occasionally generate suspense and capture the terror of nature and the nearly paralyzing humiliation of love's rejection.'' The title piece ''lays emotion bare as deftly as a surgeon.''",1989-09-10T05:00:00+0000

A script hurriedly cobbled together from a new German translation of John Gay's 18th-century satire ''The Beggar's Opera'' - along with Brecht's rewrites, Weill's music and a few borrowings from Francois Villon and Rudyard Kipling - was treated to a rehearsal period that would make the toughest and most sanguine of theatrical managers fall sweating and weeping to the office carpet. Appendicitis for one actress and sudden widowhood for another, performers' objections, both artistic and moral, a dress rehearsal that was three quarters of an hour too long, songs cut, songs added - it was the artistic process at its most vibrant and exciting. That Kurt Weill's bride, the fabulous Lotte Lenya, was accidentally left off the program was an incidental misfortune. And ''Mack the Knife'' - the mysterious and dangerous ballad that Bobby Darin made a Top-10 triumph - was a last-minute entry.

us,MERLIN WITH A LEICA,"Since the 1930's, the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson has traveled the world with his signature Leica, to paint with light his searing vision of humanity. He is the master of what he refers to as ''the decisive moment'' - an amalgam of time, place and circumstance - and there is perhaps no aspect of his art more revealing than his portraiture. HENRI CARTIER-BRESSON: Photoportraits (Thames and Hudson, $50) offers 255 examples of his work at its most affecting. In all of Mr. Cartier-Bresson's work there is an edgy grace that embraces contradiction. As viewers turn the pages, they are faced with a panorama of the past: Renoir and Matisse, Chanel and Piaf; the poet Robert Lowell, half-reclining on a couch, looking nearly as childlike as a young girl in the background; the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, his head bowed and turned away from the light; the activist Malcolm X at a restaurant table, returning the camera's frank appraisal with one of his own. Equally moving are the nameless people caught at a moment in time: a family man in Champagne; a Mississippi woman clutching bolls of just-picked cotton; a lone, dirty child beneath the tracks of Chicago's elevated train. The volume opens with an ambitious preface by a friend of the photographer, Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues (ably translated from the French by Paula Clifford). But it hardly seems necessary to introduce the work contained in ''Photoportraits.'' If, as Mr. de Mandiargues writes, ''photography is the offspring of the noble art of alchemy,'' then Henri Cartier-Bresson is our modern link to Merlin himself.",1989-09-10T05:00:00+0000

This sensible little book offers a penetrating and balanced assessment of a hefty subject: how a useful form of energy turned out to be unacceptable to the American public. The answer proposed by the authors of ''The Demise of Nuclear Energy?'' is that the commercial nuclear power program in the United States was flawed from the outset. Virtually every important decision about the design and regulation of nuclear reactors was made in private by small groups of engineers, businessmen and Government officials. Instead of developing safe reactors designed to be as economical as possible, the industry's early leaders developed economical reactors and then tried to build in safety. Lastly, the Government and the industry misled the public about the cost and the danger of nuclear power. Thus, support eroded swiftly after serious nuclear accidents near Detroit, in Alabama and at Three Mile Island convinced the public that the technology behaved in unexpected ways. Joseph G. Morone and Edward J. Woodhouse, who both teach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, write that the short, expensive and mostly unhappy story of the United States commercial nuclear power industry could have been different if the industry's leaders had grasped the central requirement in a democracy for developing a technology as powerful and potentially hazardous as theirs was: share everything, the good and the bad, with the public. Had vital issues become public in the 1950's, the authors argue, important mistakes might not have been made. Mr. Morone and Mr. Woodhouse assert that lessons learned from the disappointing experience with nuclear power should not be lost on leaders of other technical industries of the late 20th century, among them biotechnology, chemical engineering and transportation.",1989-09-10T05:00:00+0000

The company's season opens this Thursday with a four-week run of a new play, ''Indiana Dog,'' written by Jeffrey Klayman and directed by Mervyn Willis.

At the heart of Belva Plain's ploddingly earnest novel, ''Blessings,'' is Victoria Miller, nicknamed Jill, a vivacious, red-haired Barnard sophomore, the oldest child of a surgeon and a librarian, adopted at birth in 1969. Well loved, well raised, both independent and romantic, Jill is determined to find her birth parents. But although her intent is revealed early on, Jill herself doesn't appear until midway through a lugubriously overloaded plot. The ostensible heroine is Jill's birth mother, Jennie Rakowsky, a nice Jewish lawyer from Baltimore, engaged to Jay Wolfe, a handsome young widower with ''two small girls and an infant son, a rather grand Upper East Side apartment, and a partnership in one of New York's most prestigious law firms.'' Jay's gracious, wealthy parents have welcomed Jennie and blessed her with the family pearls. The senior Wolfes also ask Jennie to represent the rural community where they have had their country home for nearly half a century, which is threatened by wicked real-estate developers. Then ''happy, happy'' Jennie, the world veritably her oyster, answers the phone. It's ''Birth Search,'' a ''service for adoptees.'' In flashback we meet Jill's birth father and learn what happened when Jennie was a college freshman. On a cold winter night soon after the phone call, the doorbell rings and ''Jennie, the strong one, who so proudly coped with crises'' is struck speechless. A week of improbably operatic meetings and misunderstandings involving the whole cast follows. Jill is somehow plausible; the rest of the characters seem ordered from a catalogue.",1989-09-10T05:00:00+0000

With the advent of Lincoln Center in the 1960's and the increasing clutter of Times Square, however, it fell into the doldrums. There are signs now that it is rousing itself from that lethargy. The place could still be better maintained, and more money would permit more self-produced concerts, instead of an endless round of rentals. But this remains about the best midsized concert hall in town, with wonderful sight lines and honest acoustics.

Sprinting through back yards, Bobby (Corey Feldman) and Lainie (Meredith Salenger) collide with each other and while out cold on the ground somehow assume the spirit and persona of two neighbors, one a mystically inclined older fellow played by Jason Robards and the other his wife, portrayed by Piper Laurie. Not illogically, a romance is kindled between the pair. ''Beneath the folderol about dreams and incarnations is a routine high-school flick, with good guys, bad boys and sexy girls. . . . There's a moral, too, but don't worry about it.'' (Walter Goodman) Chances Are 1989. RCA/Columbia Home Video. $89.95. 1:48. LD. $39.95. CC. PG. Louie (Christopher McDonald), the husband of Corrine (Cybill Shepherd), gets hit by a car and goes to heaven only to return as a Yale student named Alex (Robert Downey Jr.). Corrine spends the next 23 years pining for Louie, whose best friend, Philip (Ryan O'Neal) spends the same 23 years mooning over Corrine, while Miranda, Corrine and Louie's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson), grows up and goes to Yale, where she falls in love with Alex. ''Romantic comedies, of which this is nominally one, are better off making their characters appear glamorous and attractive than making them look like ineffectual, long-suffering nincompoops, which is the case here.'' (Janet Maslin) Cousins 1989. Paramount. No suggested retail price. 1:40. CC. PG-13. Larry Kozinski (Ted Danson) and Maria Hardy (Isabella Rossellini), who are married to Tish (Sean Young) and Tom (William Petersen), respectively, meet at the marriage of Larry's uncle to Maria's mother and find themselves unexpectedly drawn together. An American remake of Jean-Charles Tacchella's romantic comedy ''Cousin, Cousine,'' this version is a ''coarse, raucous, furiously misguided effort'' that is ''ponderous and dull.''

Five baby dinosaurs join forces to find the fabled Great Valley and encounter earthquakes, volcanoes and a tyrannosaurus en route.

The rather incomprehensible plot of this comedy-melodrama involves a search for a serial killer by an ex-police detective turned fire fighter (Kevin Kline) and his ex-girlfriend (Susan Sarandon), who is married to the city's police commissioner (Harvey Keitel), the fireman's brother. ''Pat O'Connor, the director, has imposed no visible order on this minor chaos, nor has he been kind to Mr. Kline. He allows this very gifted comic actor to work so hard trying to be funny that one alternately sweats and cringes while watching him.'' (Vincent Canby) Under the Sun of Satan 1987. Connoisseur. $79.95. LD, $49.95. 1:38. French with English subtitles. No rating. Winner of the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, this film from the French director Maurice Pialat ''grapples simply and powerfully with the unknown.'' A country priest, Donissan (Gerard Depardieu), who gravely doubts his own ability becomes the center of a struggle between good and evil. Mouchette (Sandrine Bonnaire) is the woman who shapes his fate when she commits a murder. ''Though it deals with theology and rises to a stunning test of faith, it has a thoroughly secular style'' - one of the many things that make the film fascinating. (Maslin) Greetings 1968.

Robert De Niro plays one of three hippie pals from the late 60's in this early example of Brian De Palma's writing and direction, made some two decades before the director's recent ''Casualties of War.'' It's a modest comic-strip romp that takes satirical thrusts at everything from Lyndon Johnson and the draft to sex. ''Some of it is amusing, as when one of the lads is coached in the technique of draft-dodging,'' and much of it is strained.

The 37-year-old mother of twin baby girls died minutes later. The incident aroused a furor in a state where the traditions of the great outdoors are more and more at odds with the realities of suburban sprawl. It grew even more bitter when a Bangor grand jury refused to indict the hunter, a homegrown son of Maine, on manslaughter charges, fueling an ''us-versus-them'' quarrel between natives and newer arrivals from ''away,'' as the rest of the world is called. Karen Ann Wood was from away. Wood and her husband, Kevin, had come to the Bangor area with their infant twin girls in July 1988 from Davenport, Iowa, where he had been in graduate school. The Woods had both grown up in the small, upstate city of Binghamton, N.Y., met in high school and married a few years later. They had postponed having children until Kevin Wood was settled in his profession as a child psychologist.

SoHo, the Manhattan art neighborhood where more is never too much, is acquiring another gallery building, a five-story, 65,000-square-foot former bakery at 130 Prince Street (at Wooster Street) that has been under renovation for over a year. The structure, unusual in the area for its 1930's industrial design and its open, column-free spaces, almost became the Edward R. Broida Museum a few years ago, before the California collector changed his mind and returned to the West Coast. During the fall season, it will become home to as many as 10 new or relocated galleries. On Oct. 7, L.A. Louver, a 13-year-old Los Angeles gallery, will inaugurate an East Coast branch there, called Louver Gallery, New York, with an exhibition of work by Edward and Nancy Kienholz. The Christine Burgin Gallery, formerly of Lafayette Street, will follow suit later in the month, with an exhibition of new works by Fariba Hajamadi. Luhring Augustine plans to relocate from East 57th Street, opening in late November with work by the West German artist Hubert Kiecol. Other galleries that have signed leases for space in the building include the Andrea Rosen Gallery and Petersburg Press.

When it came to milking victories without much support by being skimpy in allowing runs to score, especially the earned kind, Walter Johnson was the cream of the crop. Johnson, who holds major league career records for 1-0 decisions won (38) and lost (26), rang up 10 seasons with e.r.a.'s under 2.00 in his 21 years as the mainstay of the Washington Senators in 1907-27, and that's four more than any other pitcher. No slouch was he as a worker, either, for Johnson often pitched more than 300 innings a season. Here is a breakdown by year of Johnson's 10 seasons below 2.00, with innings pitched in parentheses: 1.64 in 1908 (257 innings); 1.35 in 1910 (373); 1.89 in 1911 (323); 1.39 in 1912 (368); 1.09 in 1913 (346); 1.72 in 1914 (371); 1.55 in 1915 (336); 1.89 in 1916 (371); 1.27 in 1918 (325); 1.49 in 1919 (290).",1989-09-11T05:00:00+0000

After a summer of hard use this is a good time to check your camera and get it ready for fall and winter. The most crucial parts of modern cameras are the batteries; without them, the shutters won't even click. Keep a spare set on hand. Exhausted batteries can also leak, gumming up a camera's innards, so it's wise to remove them when storing the camera for a period of time. Never let a camera sit unprotected in the hot sun. Camera maintenance is simple, barring major accidents. Here's what to do for some problems: Greasy or dusty lens: Blow dust and grit away with air jet; wipe gently with lens-cleaning tissue or photo chamois, using slow, circular motion. Sand, dirt in camera or on lens: Brush or blow off; if rasping noises occur, take camera to repair shop. Soaking wet camera: If freshwater: open camera, put in warm spot to dry, then take it in for repairs. If saltwater: rinse with tap water, take it for repairs immediately. Camera won't work: Check battery condition, polarity and installation; check instruction manual; if displays light but film does not advance, take camera for repairs.",1989-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"LEGENDS: Conversations With Baseball Greats. By Art Rust Jr. with Michael Marley. (McGraw-Hill, $17.95.) ''I have always been a sports fan, but baseball is my great love,'' writes Art Rust Jr., the host of a New York City radio sports talk show. The short narratives in ''Legends'' and his warm, passionate dialogue with past and current superstars - including Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Mickey Mantle, Don Mattingly, Bob Feller and Rod Carew - amplify his claim. Mr. Rust's interviews (assembled with the assistance of Michael Marley, a sports columnist for The New York Post) are probing and illuminating. The players' tales of games, feats, teammates and opponents will fire up the memory of any baseball fan. However, the two most poignant voices in this book belong to Red Barber and Rachel Robinson. Mr. Barber provides anecdotes about the early radio and television broadcasts of baseball games. He also chronicles the efforts of Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, to integrate major-league baseball in 1947 and tells how he, a white Mississippian, learned to accept and admire Jackie Robinson, the future Hall of Famer who was the first black player in the big leagues. Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, gracefully tells of her husband's struggles on and off the field while playing for the Dodgers. Through these insightful interviews, particularly with the old-timers, Mr. Rust provides us with a view of big-league baseball in a gentler time - a time before Astroturf, domed stadiums, cable television contracts and players selling their autographs to fans. For providing us with this view, Mr. Rust deserves our thanks.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

My view is that HDTV will take longer to become widely available than most people think and that it will not alter the decline of the American consumer electronics industry. HDTV has, however, been helpful in focusing attention on the need for an American industrial policy. I am cautious about HDTV for three reasons: First, HDTV will take longer to become widely available than many people expect. A review of the pace of introduction of color TV as an enhancement of black-and-white TV, or of FM radio as an enhancement of AM radio, shows that these successful technologies took four to five years, from initial commercial availability to about 1 percent penetration. To reach over 50 percent of households, took another 10 years. Video cassette recorders, show a similar pattern.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

Campeau was trying last week to arrange an emergency loan from Olympia & York, the Canadian real estate concern. The talks were expected to result in Olympia & York taking effective control of the company from its chairman, Robert Campeau. Last week the bonds of some Campeau units had one-day losses of as much as $200 for each $1,000 in face value.

Charles Champlin, who left his hometown of Hammondsport, N.Y., in 1942 at the age of 16, still considers himself on ''temporary assignment from Hammondsport to the larger world.'' In ''Back There Where the Past Was,'' compiled from columns he wrote for The Los Angeles Times, he enshrines the small-town American life of his boyhood. Mr. Champlin lovingly remembers the gas station that was his teen-age hangout, the bandstand where he played the cornet during Saturday night concerts, and the post office, the social focus of the town. He writes of growing up with doting grandmothers and great-aunts, of being one of the few kids with divorced parents and about his conflicts over sin (that is, sex) versus purity as a member of ''the next-to-last non-permissive generation.'' Yet lurking among the charming details of Mr. Champlin's childhood are stories of other lives, and I wanted to hear more. What did Hammondsport feel like to Black Eva, one of its few black citizens, who made her living cooking for white families, or to Gladys, the sole Jewish girl in Champlin's class, or Jack Van Loan, the ''myopic bachelor with a vast belly'' who spent his life clerking at the post office? Mr. Champlin muses in passing on the lives of these and others, but in the end his memoir becomes a nostalgic slide show of the past, a book that will appeal to those who grew up in similar small towns, but that may leave some readers suspicious that everything back then, back there, was too good to be true.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

The Fine Young Cannibals, the British band that opened a sold-out two-night stand at the Beacon Theater on Tuesday, do not bother to disguise their pilferage. They ransack Top 40 songs from the 1960's through the 1980's, with special (and obvious) attention to Motown songs. Before they played their biggest hit, ''She Drives Me Crazy,'' the band's lead singer, Roland Gift, led an a cappella version of the Temptations' ''My Girl,'' which supplies a chord progression for ''She Drives Me Crazy.'' (Half the song's chorus, meanwhile, derives from Cyndi Lauper's hit ''Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.'') The Fine Young Cannibals have a worthy pedigree. Their guitarist, Andy Cox, and bassist, David Steele, were members of the English Beat, a band that put an intelligent spin on pop, punk and Jamaican ska. But the Fine Young Cannibals have returned to ordinary pop topics and cliches, retaining only the mildest of ironies by setting morosely lovelorn lyrics to uptempo tunes.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

Today his correspondence, stacked on shelves in cardboard filing boxes, covers an entire wall of the study in the suite of his wife, Vera Nabokov, at the Palace Hotel in Montreux, Switzerland. Later this month, some 400 of those letters will be published as ''Vladimir Nabokov: Selected Letters, 1940-1977,'' edited by Dmitri Nabokov and Matthew J. Bruccoli. Nabokov's correspondents were varied - friends, family, colleagues, editors and writers among them. And he addressed them variously with affection, irascibility, passion, outrage and - above all - honesty, sometimes to a fault, as the 18 letters selected and abridged here demonstrate. For instance, when his younger brother sends him a batch of poems for appraisal, he betrays a certain impatience, and questions the poet's motives.

Margaret Truman's ninth Washington-based whodunit is a bewildering clutch of characters, last-minute confessions, secret files, eavesdroppers and ethnic types who walk with, and without, limps. By the middle of the novel, we are as confused as the gracefully aging Mackensie Smith, a George Washington University law professor who reluctantly abandons his classroom to make sense of a scandal that begins when a lascivious female aide of Senator Ken Ewald is gunned down on the grounds of the Kennedy Center. Ewald, a philandering liberal Democrat from California and likely Presidential candidate, is discovered to be the owner of the weapon, and though there are no witnesses to the crime and no fingerprints are found, the police lock up the Senator's son, who was having an affair with the victim. Professor Smith, called in to defend the hapless lad, springs him easily but stays on to solve the murder. While calling on suspects and pursuing leads, Smith takes a suite at the Watergate Hotel. With his lawyer-turned-gallery-owner girlfriend, he eats in the right restaurants. They fly off to Manhattan to track down an unsavory blackmailer and then go on to San Francisco. In both locations, they also manage to stay in the right hotels and eat in the right restaurants. When the going gets rough, Smith hires a private investigator named Tony Buffolino, a hard-boiled photocopy of Peter Falk's Colombo, who provides comic relief and derring-do. Buffolino also ends up in the right hotels and restaurants, though he prefers room service. There is some muttering about the inadequacies of moral standards, and we are supposed to believe that Ken Ewald, for all his extramarital activity and derivative speeches, would make a better President than his conservative Democratic rival, a Georgian backed by a smarmy television evangelist - not to mention the smug Republican in the White House. At the climax a pointless assassination attempt is quashed, and the murderer confesses in a blurt of braggadocio, but what is most memorable are those room service entrees provided by the Watergate Hotel.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

Flush from the runaway success of his previous book, ''All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten,'' Robert Fulghum has come out with a second book of what are meant to be inspirational little homilies. Mr. Fulghum, a Unitarian minister in Seattle, specializes in taking ordinary stories from everyday life and using them to show that people are good, that life is sweet and that love endures. The stories in ''It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It'' seem to have been designed to make the reader feel warm and fuzzy inside. They are like the children's story of Ferdinand the bull, where the moral is that it is better to sit still and smell the flowers. There is a market for this stuff, but how compelling is it to read an entire chapter in which Mr. Fulghum explains why he declines to say what it is he does and why he disdains business cards that categorize people? He concludes, ''I and you - we are infinite, rich, large, contradictory, living, breathing miracles - free human beings, children of God and the everlasting universe. That's what we do.'' Or how about a chapter on Mr. Fulghum's laws of life, laws that include ''Buy lemonade from any kid who is selling'' and ''Always take the scenic route'' and ''When the circus comes to town, be there''? I had trouble with this book for the same reason that I cannot watch an evening full of situation comedies on television.

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL 'Slavonic Opera Arias' Lucia Popp, soprano; Munich Radio Orchestra conducted by Stefan Soltesz. Angel CDC7 49319 2; CD only. This is a welcome exception to the usual run of opera star recitals. Here is important, rewarding repertory that, while it has by no means gone unappreciated, has not always attracted voices of Ms. Popp's caliber. Here is an artist especially equipped by linguistic background to do justice to Janacek, Smetana, Dvorak, Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky, but who has generally been heard in her Strauss-Mozart area of specialization. The results may not efface the memory of beloved recordings of the individual arias (Ms. Popp's voice, though still quite beautiful, is not in its first bloom, and she is a sensitive and idiomatic interpreter rather than a riveting one), but they do add up to a very attractive introduction, for the general opera lover, to this exciting material. And right from the beginning of Tatiana's Letter Scene there is one unmistakable quality that has been in woefully short supply on other recent aria albums: enthusiasm. - Will Crutchfield Vaughan Williams: Choral Works Christ Church (Oxford) Cathedral Choir, English String Orchestra conducted by Stephen Darlington. Nimbus 5166; CD only. The five works in this admirable program display varied facets of Vaughan Williams as a composer of religious music: extroversion in the motet ''O Clap Your Hands'' and the 1928 ''Te Deum,'' sing-along simplicity in ''The Old Hundredth Psalm Tune,'' arranged for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and sensuous impressionism in ''Flos Campi'' for choir, viola and orchestra, based on selections from the Song of Songs. In all, playing and choral singing are splendid (Christ Church, Oxford, boasts one of the finest choirs in England), but ''An Oxford Elegy'' is marred somewhat by the dry speaking voice of the narrator, Jack May, whose aggressive declamation of Matthew Arnold's pastoral text is at odds with the ethereal lyricism of Vaughan Williams's musical setting. - Barrymore L. Scherer Cage: The String Quartets, Vol. 1 Arditti Quartet. Mode 17; CD only. The two works on this disk document part of a concert of John Cage's string quartet music the Arditti Quartet played at Wesleyan University last year. In both pieces the players sat far apart from each other, whether displaced on the stage for ''Music for Four'' (the work's premiere) or scattered in odd locations around the hall for 30 Pieces for String Quartet (1983), prompting one audience member to ask whether the players liked each other. Liking doesn't matter, though, with Mr. Cage's chance-derived music; only independence does. And the surprising result of music made from separated, unrelated contrapuntal voices is serenity. Mr. Cage's expertly made musical chaos happens to be just as good at producing beautiful patterns as the various forms of natural chaos are, especially when aided by an ensemble as good as this one. A second volume will include Mr. Cage's classic early quartet along with a new work the composer is writing for the ensemble. - Mark Swed Mozart: Serenade in B flat (K. 361) Orchestra of the 18th Century conducted by Frans Bruggen. Philips 422 338-2; CD and cassette. Mozart's sublime Serenade ''for 13 Winds'' (12, actually, and a string bass) has been a favorite of record companies in recent years and has already received fine treatment in period style. Still, no fancier of the sweet-and-sour sonorities of ''original'' instruments will want to miss this version. The Dutch band meets the lofty standard it has quickly established for itself, with chords superbly weighted and balanced, and Mr. Bruggen, a former wind virtuoso who is proving a formidable conductor, brings a particular virtue to this work: a sure instinct for pacing that allows the music to breathe and phrases to soar. No music ever written ''breathes'' more truly than does Mozart's third-movement Adagio, exquisitely languid and soulful in this performance. - James R. Oestreich Handel: Solo Cantatas Julianne Baird, soprano; John Ostendorf, bass-baritone; Aurora (period-instrument ensemble). Newport Classics NCD 60043; CD and cassette. We know by now what to expect of Julianne Baird: Limpid, fresh tone; unassertive but sparkling clarity of diction and spirited delivery; imaginative and virtuosic ornamentation, and brisk, neat rhythm. John Ostendorf, whose enterprise in record producing as well as his musicianly singing has made him a familiar presence on the Baroque music scene, has less charm of timbre, but he phrases with authority and moves his voice around the florid music with nimble athleticism. They do well, sometimes delightfully well, by the four tuneful cantatas (two for each singer) recorded here. The instrumental playing (which includes a traversal of a trio sonata, Op. 2, No. 8, spread out like a series of entr'actes among the cantatas) is good without being up to the highest current standards, but the singing is generally preferable to that of the British early-musickers who have recorded some of the same material. - W. C. Schubert: Octet The Nash Ensemble of London. Virgin Classics VC7 90731; CD and cassette. Beautiful ensemble playing, a classical sense of proportion and a striking affinity for just the right rhetorical gesture add up to a thoroughly engaging performance of this endearing masterpiece. As in this ensemble's splendid recording of Dvorak's ''Dumky'' Trio and Op. 81 Piano Quintet on the same label, the careful engineering yields both clarity and the desirable ambience of chamber music played at home. - B. L. S. POP/JAZZ Van Morrison: 'Avalon Sunset' Mercury 839262-1; all three formats. Either out of stinginess or because the way is so hard, this Irish singer has for years delivered only the outlines of a great Van Morrison album, making promises other singers could not keep and he himself seems unlikely to. On ''Avalon Sunset,'' he turns to inspiration from above, which means that he stays on his path, but also that his path is without interesting surprises. The songs are simple and in the end only perfunctory, but Mr. Morrison sings with passion and vigor, his voice twisting and swelling until it engulfs his subject matter. Against uninspired accompaniment, this is the foreground of a great Van Morrison album - a little closer than he's come in a while, but still tantalizingly not there. - John Leland D'Atra Hicks: 'D'Atra Hicks' Capitol 46990; all three formats. Half forgettable soporific ballads and half turbo-charged up-tempo material, this debut album marks the arrival of a 21-year-old singer of real promise, someone who can really scream. Her producers have allowed Ms. Hicks the room to sing, and each melody, however trite, gets the full treatment, with her dense voice swirling and Ping-Ponging all over the place. The tunes - and the lukewarm production - aren't always inspiring, but Ms. Hicks growls and shouts through the songs, giving the pleasure of a gospel-trained singer really emoting. - Peter Watrous Nanci Griffith: 'Storms' MCA 6319; all three formats. ''Folkabilly'' is the nickname that the twangy-voiced Texan singer and songwriter has given to a style that, in defying country and pop radio formats, has prevented her from becoming a star. ''Storms,'' her eighth album, moves toward a pop mode without adopting overly trendy musical trappings. As always with Ms. Griffith, the songwriting is the center of the album. By far the most powerful song, ''It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go'' is an aggrieved reflection on the rise of prejudice, with scenes set in Belfast and in a Chicago cafeteria inspiring a reverie of the 1960's and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. ''If we poison our children with hatred,'' the singer warns, ''then the hard life is all they'll ever know.'' - Stephen Holden Sugarcubes: 'Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week' Elektra 60860-4; all three formats. On the Icelandic group's second American album, innocent banalities - a missed bath, a synthetic fiber - trigger sudden outbursts of violence and collegiate irony. An unresolved mix of carnival frippery, psychedelia and incongruous horn outbursts, this album is a wrestling match: between Bjork Gudmundsdottir's dreaming, screaming waif and Einar Orn's truculent wise guy, between the folky underlying melodies and the noise billowing over them, between acerbity and camp. If ''Here Today'' is a bit disappointing after last year's eye-opening ''Life's Too Good,'' it's because Ms. Gudmundsdottir does not win the wrestle often enough, and camp prevails too often. - J. L. Frank Morgan: 'Reflections' Contemporary CD 14052-2; all three formats. While it's often said that Mr. Morgan is a briliant be-bop alto saxophonist, deep into the language of Charlie Parker, it's just as often overlooked that his style is changing a bit, growing more elliptical, even florid. This becomes especially evident when his work is contrasted to that of the other saxophonist on the date, Joe Henderson, who plays with a coarse bluntness; together they present a well-rounded whole. And as usual, Mr. Morgan elevates a kind tenderness and passion to an art. - P. W.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE CHASE. By Alejo Carpentier. Translated by Alfred Mac Adam. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.95.) We are, Alejo Carpentier once wrote, ''lost in a labyrinth of false notions.'' And picking through that labyrinth in search of occasional flecks of truth is what drives this brief novel. The Cuban writer, composer and diplomat, known for the architectural complexity of his plots, here adopts the equally dense structure of Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony to trace the intertwined days and nights of two young men who have come to Batista-era Havana to carve their destinies. One, a student and ticket seller at a concert hall where the symphony is being played, wants ''to understand great things.'' The other has stumbled into revolution and sees ''the best members of his generation . . . falling to the bullets of the repressive police.'' Betraying his comrades, betrayed by a prostitute, the rebel is on the run. As the chase winds through a closed-in byzantine landscape, he becomes increasingly incapable of escaping his past, even of confessing his sins, and when the music in the hall reaches its climax all the pieces in the lush, profound construction close in on him. Though not widely known here, Carpentier (who died in 1980) was one of the early giants of modern Latin American literature, a man whose writing helped shape and define the period of ''magic realism,'' a term that he coined. Without ''The Chase,'' which was first published in 1956, the work of Carpentier's more widely known successors would be vastly different. It is good that Alfred Mac Adam's fine translation has made this short masterpiece available in English at last.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

His way or hers? Sylvan, a college senior employed at Phyllis's day-care center, views her in a brazenly hormonal fashion. She lives with the widowed mother of one of her charges and appears to disdain men. But the clamor of her biological clock prompts a yearning for Sylvan, the ideal candidate to be the ''sperm daddy'' for the child she is determined to have by ''alternative'' insemination. This consistently benevolent, one-joke account of a Me generation that's evolved into a Me-and-Only-Me generation provides several comic obstacles to keep the course of true lust from running smooth. But while his wit is striking, Mr. Drinkard's green talent must ripen before he'll be able to produce a successful novel. At its most sage moments, ''Green Bananas'' uses sperm donation as a metaphor to reflect the sexual estrangement of our era, propagation stripped of any possible intimacy. Still, Mr. Drinkard's overall tone fails to sustain depth or develop characters beyond their surface. Bending truth for the sake of a laugh, using exposition to convey what would better unfold in dialogue and overdescribing the obvious, ''Green Bananas'' is the promising but unseasoned product of a talent that's clearly worth watching.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE BREAKTHROUGH: The Race for the Superconductor, by Robert M. Hazen. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A scientist gives an inside account of the race to discover and patent higher-temperature superconductors. ''The result is both dramatic and fair-minded,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ''Dr. Hazen writes with wonderful clarity about science, foreshortening the action where the going gets heavy and stretching it out when the story is accessible.'' BREATHING LESSONS, by Anne Tyler. (Berkley, $5.50.) In another novel about a lower-middle-classJU family in Baltimore, Anne Tyler introduces Maggie Moran, a cheerful, meddling woman who marries off her son to a 17-year-old she shanghais from an abortion clinic. Last year our reviewer, Edward Hoagland, said Ms. Tyler shows that ''in this fractionated era she can write so well about blood links and family funerals, old friendships or the dogged pull of thwarted love, of blunted love affairs or marital mismatches that neither mend nor end. Her eye is kindly, wise and versatile (an eye that you would want on your jury if you ever had to stand trial).'' THE FACTS: A Novelist's Autobiography, by Philip Roth. (Penguin, $7.95.) Philip Roth comes clean with the true story of his heavily fictionalized life, including, for good measure, commentary by his character Nathan Zuckerman. ''All of this suggests that for Mr. Roth his life and his work, his 'facts' and his 'fiction,' are virtually identical,'' Justin Kaplan said here last year. ''The three component terms of his title - facts, novelist, autobiography - are charged particles whose shifting polarities, repulsions and attractions account for the book's hypomanic intensities as well as its occasional languors.'' Next month, Houghton Mifflin will publish a 30th-anniversary edition of Mr. Roth's first book, GOODBYE, COLUMBUS: And Five Short Stories ($7.95). Included is a new introduction by Mr. Roth, written in the third person, explaining how the book came to be. A DEADLY SILENCE. The Ordeal of Cheryl Pierson: A Case of Incest and Murder, by Dena Kleiman. (Signet/ New American Library, $4.95.) A New York Times reporter tells about the sexually abused Long Island teen-ager who paid a classmate $400 to kill her father. Last year our reviewer, Betty Rollin, said the book is written ''with care, intensity and a novelist's sense.'' FOUND IN THE STREET, by Patricia Highsmith. (Atlantic Monthly, $8.95.) A nice waitress who wants to be a model moves to Greenwich Village and becomes the obsessive interest of Ralph, a middle-aged night watchman; Natalia, an art gallery manager; Jack, Natalia's rich husband, and a number of other people. ''Often misrepresented as a genre writer of thrillers, Ms. Highsmith is a fine psychologist and ironist, and her newest novel is a powerfully disturbing, resonant creation,'' Richard Burgin said here last year. ON BENDED KNEE: The Press and the Reagan Presidency, by Mark Hertsgaard. (Schocken, $11.95.) Reporters were too ready to laugh at Ronald Reagan instead of seriously analyzing his shortcomings, Mark Hertsgaard contends. Last year our reviewer, Stephen E. Ambrose, said that the author gives the press a ''bum rap'' but that he ''has worked hard and produced a readable and often enlightening book.'' THE INDIA FAN, by Victoria Holt. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) The poor daughter of a rector becomes involved with the fabulously wealthy family next door. This novel ''could turn the most resolute boob tuber into a book lover,'' Sheila Paulos said here last year. ''With a cursed fan made of peacock feathers, a bogus count, an illegitimate child, a white slaver, servants both faithful and traitorous, not to mention a follower of an ancient murder cult, the plot is full of enthralling stuff.'' THE LETTERS OF JOHN CHEEVER, edited by Benjamin Cheever. (Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) When this selection of John Cheever's correspondence was published last year, The Times's John Gross said that the author's son Benjamin had produced ''a loving but far from idealized portrait: a hefty selection of letters, accompanied by an editorial commentary that deserves a place alongside Susan Cheever's admirable memoir of her father, 'Home Before Dark.' '' THE ORGAN BUILDER, by Robert Cohen. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) A New York lawyer returns to New Mexico in search of his father, a Manhattan Project physicist who disappeared years ago. Last year our reviewer, Nina Sonenberg, called this ''an intimate, stunningly written portrait.'' Robert Cohen ''gives us romance and humor, real passion and pain and even some mystery, all narrated in a voice that, despite occasional excesses, often approaches sheer poetry.'' AMERICA INVULNERABLE: The Quest for Absolute Security From 1812 to Star Wars, by James Chace and Caleb Carr. (Summit, $12.95.) The Strategic Defense Initiative, the authors argue, is the outgrowth of an obsessive belief in unilateral defense that is rooted in the War of 1812, when the British burned the White House. Last year our reviewer, Gaddis Smith, disagreed with this thesis, but he said ''the two final chapters, on recent policies in this hemisphere and President Reagan's Star Wars enterprise, make this book worth reading.'' CABAL, by Clive Barker. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) The horrors in this novella and four stories ''demonstrate why the gleefully gory Mr. Barker is at the top of his genre,'' Howard Mittelmark said here last year. ''Filled with one ghastly, baroque effect after another, it's dazzling, captivating stuff, but finally it's all special effects.''",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

They broke Durie's serve to win the final game, which ended when McNeil hit a forehand winner down the line. It was McNeil's second victory of the afternoon after she beat Sara Gomer, 6-4, 6-2, in the day's first match, the fifth of the annual seven-match competition between the United States and Britain. In the second match yesterday, Mary Joe Fernandez beat Durie, 6-1, 7-5.

Like a dumb pet, the machine refuses to perform now that company has arrived.

His other vocation, the writing of poetry and books, was secondary. He treated his writing, which was influential in the secular and spiritual worlds, as an ''addiction'' that sometimes needed curbing. In ''The Road to Joy'' - edited by Robert E. Daggy, director of the Thomas Merton Center at Bellarmine College - the reader has further access to the heart and mind of the author of ''The Seven Storey Mountain'' and other books. After becoming a Trappist monk, Merton achieved his cherished solitude and devoted his time to prayer and writing. In this collection, the second volume in a series that began with ''The Hidden Ground of Love'' in 1985, the letters date from 1931, 10 years before Merton joined the monastery of Our Lady of Gethsemani, to 1968, when he died. His letters portray Merton's enduring exuberance and optimism, as well as his keen intelligence and sharp-tongued humor. They mostly concern literary and religious matters, from overseeing his publications to discussing his spiritual enlightenment. Often, Merton offered priestly advice or expounded on social and political issues - the Vietnam War and racism, for example - despite his cloistered existence. His gift as a letter writer was the ability to maintain the balance between his two vocations, sometimes to the point where the boundary lines disappeared. In reading these letters, one wistfully longs for Merton's close company.",1989-09-17T05:00:00+0000

On the other hand, only two players really matter - Babe Ruth and Ted Williams - because they dominated this particular aspect of batting, doing it seven of the nine times it was accomplished. In 1941, when he batted .406, Williams, baseball's last .400 hitter, put together a .551 on-base average, the best ever. It was so good that for the season, he finished 99 percentage points ahead of the American League's second-best performer in on-base average, Roy Cullenbine of the St. Louis Browns. Williams had 185 hits that season, including 33 doubles and 37 home runs, and walked 145 times. The Boston Red Sox outfielder also has the fourth-best on-base percentage in baseball history, .516, in 1954, and he didn't do badly in 1942 or 1947 either, when he barely failed to reach base half the time with .499 percentages.",1989-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Burnt Kitchen Cabinet Q. A candle placed too close to one of my kitchen cabinets resulted in a small burn mark in the finish, as well as some small blisters. The damage is too small to interest a professional refinisher, so how can I repair this small damage myself? A. The burnt material and the blisters must be scraped off first. The best way is by scraping with the edge of a small pocketknife or paring knife. Hold the blade so its cutting edge is vertical to the surface - as though you were going to slice down into the wood - then scrape back and forth carefully to remove the blisters and the scorched material. If this goes into the wood and exposes raw wood, you can restore the color by using a little touch-up stain or one of those touch-up pencils that come in various wood tones (you will probably have to experiment with a few shades to get the closest match). When the color looks about right, let the stain dry, then use a small artist's brush to apply two or three coats of clear varnish to restore the gloss. Moss-Coated Steps Q. The brick steps at the front and back of my house are continually coated with green moss. What can I use to help eliminate this condition? A. You can wash the moss off with a solution of one part bleach mixed with three parts water, or you can use the mildewcide solutions that are sold in swimming-pool supply houses. But the problem will come back unless you provide more sunlight and better drainage. Another method that usually helps is to coat the bricks with a waterproofing sealer after they are clean and dry. This will help them shed water and dry faster, so moss will be less likely to form. Faulty Shower Valve Q. A couple of years ago, a plumber replaced our faulty shower valve with a well-known brand of single-control faucet. Ever since then we have had a problem. As long as no one else in the house is using water, the shower delivers the selected mix of hot and cold water. But if the water is turned on elsewhere in the house, the person in the shower instantly gets water that is too hot or too cold. Our plumber has been no help. Do you have a clue as to what is causing this condition? A. I doubt if it is the new faucet, although you can easily check by replacing the cartridge to see if that helps. There are two common causes for a problem of this type: first, the supply pipes leading to the shower are too small or partly clogged due to corrosion or to a buildup of chemicals inside the pipes; second, there is insufficient pressure in your water-supply system. A good plumber should be able to determine which of these conditions is causing your problem.",1989-09-21T05:00:00+0000

The disadvantages are that most stores offer movie disks for sale only and not for rental (they generally cost about $25 to $35) and that you cannot record on disks. Here are some things to look for in an LV. Special Effects: Even the least expensive LV's (they cost about $500 and up) can produce great special effects on some disks (those labeled CAV). Models that can freeze frames and perform other special effects with all disks cost a bit more. Special dials on some players make it easy to zip to a desired scene, then scan it frame by frame. Sound: Most, but not all, Laservision players can also play compact disks. Conveniences in over-$1,000 players include changing up to three CD's, and a system to memorize and play a personalized selection of tracks each time a CD is played.

The poet and scholar Melvin Dixon's first novel, which won the 1989 Charles H. and N. Mildred Nilon Excellence in Minority Fiction Award, is a slim, poetic work. In the Southern Gothic tradition, Mr. Dixon's intricate narrative features an intense, brooding atmosphere, twisted passions, unsettling appearances and disappearances and uncanny intuitions. Yet for all the story's mystery and mysticism, it centers on the plight of a very down-to-earth character. A professor of American colonial history, Jordan Henry is the only black on the teaching staff of a small Massachusetts college. When racial trouble erupts on the campus, Jordan and his wife are ripe for a change of scene. Their journey is secured with a letter summoning Jordan home to Pee Dee, N.C., for his grandmother's funeral. Although Mother Harriet raised Jordan when his mother died in childbirth, they have been estranged for 20 years, ever since the teen-aged Jordan hitchhiked north to extricate himself from the hammerlock of her consuming hatred for his father, Jake Williams. Mother Harriet goaded her young grandson, even slyly trained him, to avenge his mother's death - to kill his father. And when Jordan returns south neither the back-country community nor his own soul will allow him to dodge all this unfinished business. Jordan draws courage, as he did as a boy, from his identification with the nearby Pee Dee River, but unfortunately Mr. Dixon's lyrical prose cloys with his insistent personification of its ever-changing waters. The only other false note is the unconvincing scene of violence between Jordan and his father. On balance, however, ''Trouble the Water'' is a success - primarily for its suspenseful, satisfying portrayal of Jordan Henry as he pursues grace in a fallen world.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Polls are necessary to transfer fan interest from the local level to the national. Polls take the energy of sports enthusiasm, spread over the entire country, and focus it on a few teams.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Finishing Madison Jones's eighth novel is like waking up from someone else's nightmare - or maybe being released from someone else's paranoid fantasy. That's because, although the fears that materialize in ''Last Things'' may not be anything like the reader's own, they still have a scary, spiky grip. As ''Last Things'' begins, Wendell Corbin has returned, against his better judgment, to his birthplace in the Deep South, the ironically named Bliss County. Here he intends to take up graduate studies with Leonard T. Rathbone, who, like Wendell, is a zonked-out fan of both William Blake and marijuana. But as quick as you can say cannabis, Wendell, who had done some dealing in his undergraduate days, is set up in a drug sale and given the chance, as a condition of his release by the corrupt arresting officers, to become a soldier in the illegal drug-running operation of a local businessman, Jason Farrow. Wendell's assignments include getting rid of a busybody who happens to have guessed what Farrow is up to and is also, conveniently enough, the hateful mother-in-law of Tricia Harker, a Nietzsche-obsessed woman that Wendell has taken up with. Wendell's uneasiness over his illicit activities eventually prevails, and he blows the whistle on the chicanery - but without producing quite the results he had intended. Although ''Last Things'' ends as an exploration of what can happen when middle-class morality is flouted, it begins as if it's going to be another satire of academia. But although there's a shift of gears midway, going from first to second certainly gives ''Last Things'' a surge of giddy power.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

To understand the playwright's intentions, the director and the actors were exploring the implications of the two men's relationship. In turn, the playwright explained some lines and deleted others. Two days later, in another space on the university grounds, the now-revised scene, titled ''The Heart Engages,'' was one of several dramatic sketches being given a staged reading before an audience consisting mostly of other playwrights and directors. As a result of the audience response, the director's and actors' perceptions of the characters were confirmed. During a post-performance discussion, the playwright himself arrived at a new perspective on the scene he wrote.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

American commercial publishers who once thought of cookbooks as strictly ''How-to'' now embed recipes in costly illustrated works that dramatize the rise of food from kitchen to library, where readers who never lifted pot or pan whet their chops each season over cookbooks, reading them as travel literature, social comedy, utopian fantasy, pastoral romance. Similarly, American university presses that once ignored food as a trivial pursuit have jumped on the culinary bandwagon to produce works as unpretentious as ''Chicken Foot Soup'' (Rutgers University, 1980) and as encompassing as ''Food and Evolution: Toward a Theory of Human Food Habits'' (Temple University, 1987).

us,FICTION,"THE CROWN: A Tale of Sir Gawein and King Arthur's Court. By Heinrich von dem Turlin. Translated by J. W. Thomas. (University of Nebraska, $25.) Readers accustomed to high-minded, nostalgic versions of the King Arthur tales may be surprised, amused, perhaps even shocked by this rollicking story by the 13th-century Austrian poet Heinrich von dem Turlin. J. W. Thomas's is the first translation into any modern language of ''Die Krone'' (''The Crown''), a compilation of oral folklore and medieval chronicles fashioned here into a cleverly plotted adventure novel. Lancelot, Guinevere and even Arthur are minor characters in this work. The focus is on Sir Gawein, whose exploits are, in turn, bold, violent, tender, sensual and sometimes intentionally ludicrous. The knight is presented as the savior of Arthur's court (which is located, in this version, in Brittany), the idealized center of culture and social pleasure. However, Gawein is untroubled by complex or deep feelings and often seems to trounce his foes for the sheer excitement of it. Marvelous, grotesque images abound and extraordinary monsters are dispatched with suitable ferocity. Events like these turn Gawein's quest for the Grail, one of the book's subplots, into a surreal journey through Purgatory. Magic is often integral to the story line, but the descriptions of court life - festivals, castles, costumes, jousts, hunts - are rendered in vivid, realistic detail. In contrast to the familiar British Arthurian romances, there is no suggestion in von dem Turlin's work that the age of chivalry is doomed. At the end, Gawein captures a stone guaranteeing perpetual victories for his monarch, and even receives the gift of eternal youth from a castleful of maidens. King Arthur's court lives on - and now, with this lively translation of ''The Crown,'' a new collection of its legends can be enjoyed by a wide audience.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Roux, on loan to Guinness, had served as controller and financial director of the British company and as a member of its board of directors.

According to Arturo Pandolfo, who is managing the project for the State Railway Company, the system will run both nonstop and local trains, reducing travel time into the city to between 10 and 15 minutes. The system will have the capacity to run its six-car trains every 10 minutes, and he expects it will handle up to 4,000 passengers per hour. ''But our system is flexible,'' he says, speaking in a phone interview through a translator. ''We can increase hourly capacity by adding up to four cars to trains.''",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000
us,New & Noteworthy,"IN PRAISE OF IMPERFECTION: My Life and Work, by Rita Levi-Montalcini. Translated by Luigi Attardi. (Basic Books, $9.95.) With the powers of that imperfect engine called the brain, an Italian neuroscientist discovers a chemical that makes nerve fibers grow and wins a Nobel Prize. This is ''an arresting story of someone who insisted on being herself rather than someone else's idea of herself,'' Victor K. McElheny said here last year. ''With great immediacy, she shows us how she has constructed her life.'' VANISHED, by Mary McGarry Morris. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) Without really meaningJU to, Aubrey Wallace, a dull-witted middle-aged road worker, runs off with Dotty Johnson, a 14-year-old runaway who has just murdered the father who sexually abused her. Rounding out their makeshift family with a stolen baby, they embark on a five-year odyssey of cheap motels and truck stops. ''Melodramatic as these events sound, they are presented with such authority by Ms. Morris that they hum with both the authenticity of real life and the mythic power of fable,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. ''This is a startling and powerful debut.'' THE LAST LION. Winston Spencer Churchill: Alone 1932-1940, by William Manchester. (Laurel/Dell, $13.95.) In the second volume of this popular biography, William Manchester asks why it took so long for Britain to wake up to Churchill's warnings about the Nazis. ''Mr. Manchester has a warm and affectionate admiration for Churchill,'' Kenneth Harris said here last year. Though historians may quibble at an occasional interpretation, ''thousands will read this book with great satisfaction.'' THE ASSIGNATION, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) These very short stories by Joyce Carol Oates ''have the transient shock effects of a newspaper headline,'' James Atlas said here in 1988. ''Holdups, shootings, random attacks are regular occurrences. Reading Ms. Oates, you get the feeling that it's dangerous out there.'' TOLSTOY, by A. N. Wilson. (Fawcett Columbine, $14.95.) As he died in a train station, fleeing his home and family for a destination unknown, Tolstoy proclaimed: ''I cannot go to sleep. I am always composing. I write and it all links itself together like music.'' In trying to explain how the novelist built so inescapable a mental prison, A. N. Wilson has written ''passages [ that ] display an uncanny intimacy with the alchemy of Tolstoy's art,'' Michael Ignatieff said in The Book Review last year. FEEDING THE EAGLES, by Paulette Bates Alden. (Graywolf, $8.) When these short stories about a Southerner exiled in Minneapolis were published last year, our reviewer, David Dawson, said the author ''serves notice that you don't have to trot out the standard cliches -lecherous evangelists, okra, uncles with two first names, Co'Cola - to write about the South.'' WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE, by Carolyn G. Heilbrun. (Ballantine, $6.95.) A humanities professor who writes mysteries tells how literature has conspired to make women seem more like men want them to be. In January, our reviewer, Wendy Martin, said, ''If Carolyn Heilbrun's astute and provocative book had been available 25 years ago, most of my friends and I could have been spared considerable grief.'' NEW AND COLLECTED POEMS, by Richard Wilbur. (Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $10.95.) This collection of verses by the man named poet laureate of the United States in 1987 won a Pulitzer Prize. Last year Robert Richman said here that Richard Wilbur ''enriches his verse by showing a willingness to face the dangers entailed in the quest for what Wallace Stevens called the 'truth that cannot be arrived at by reason alone.' '' THE FEMALE ANIMAL, by Irene Elia. (Holt, $12.95.) Concentrating on the females of the species, an anthropologist writes about the sex lives of insects, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including people. The work ''differs from other such books in that it focuses on female animals,'' Patricia Bridges said here last year. ''There is an underlying male orientation in most scientific literature, and a book that upends this stereotype presents a refreshing view.'' THE ACORN PLAN, by Tim McLaurin. (Norton, $7.95.) In this novel about life in a Southern mill town, Bubble Riley tries to save his nephew, Billy, from becoming a violent drunk. '' 'The Acorn Plan' is about excess - too much drinking, fighting, pride, family history - and Tim McLaurin conveys his understanding of such things in a clear Southern voice,'' Chris Goodrich said here last year. LISTENING OUT LOUD: Becoming a Composer, by Elizabeth Swados. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) A young composer provides a practical guide to the highs and lows of breaking into the profession. Earlier this year, our reviewer, Michael Kimmelman, said the book ''usefully caters to the broadest possible audience - those who think Mozart is the crown prince among composers and those who think Prince is a modern Mozart. [ She has ] drawn a neat and well-reasoned map that every young composer would do well to consult.'' REAL ESTATE, by Jane DeLynn. (Ballantine, $3.95.) A relationship that doesn't work becomes trapped in an apartment about to go co-op. Despite some overbearing diatribes, this novel is ''an on-target, wickedly funny tale of musical apartments, malfunctioning appliances and misplaced passions,'' Ellen Feldman said here last year.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Over the next 15 years, Prince Sihanouk struggles to maintain Cambodia's precarious neutrality. August 1969 The American-backed Marshal Lon Nol becomes Prime Minister under Prince Sihanouk, who delegates much of his power to the general. The United States begins military operations against Vietcong forces in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. March 18, 1970 Marshal Lon Nol deposes Prince Sihanouk as head of state and the Prince goes into exile in China, where he forms an alliance with the Communist Khmer Rouge, which had opposed him in Cambodia. Oct. 9, 1970 The Khmer Republic is proclaimed by the Lon Nol Government, ending Cambodia's 24 years as a constitutional monarchy. April 17, 1975 The Khmer Rouge guerrillas defeat Marshal Lon Nol's forces and take over Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk is reinstated as head of state. The Khmer Rouge imposes a brutal reorganization of society in which more than 1 million Cambodians die. April 2, 1976 Prince Sihanouk resigns and Pol Pot of the Khmer Rouge becomes Prime Minister. Dec. 25, 1978 Vietnam invades Cambodia. On Jan. 7, Pol Pot flees as Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, falls to the Vietnamese. A Hanoi-backed Government is installed. June 22, 1982 A Cambodian government-in-exile representing three guerrilla groups is formed with Prince Sihanouk as President, Khieu Samphan of the Khmer Rouge as Vice President and Son Sann as Prime Minister. April 5, 1989 Vietnam announces that all its troops will be withdrawn from Cambodia by Sept. 27.

us,Architects Must Listen to the Melody,"Goethe once described architecture as frozen music; if he was right, could cities be described as congealed concertos? Maybe this is stretching an already flimsy metaphor, but music, architecture and cities do share one striking characteristic. Just as agreeable music requires both solo and ensemble playing, and great architecture needs expanses of serenity to provide the setting for moments of soaring drama so, too, successful cities demand an underlying melody. The pleasures of Venice or Florence are not only the wonderful churches and civic buildings but also the rich fabric of the more numerous commonplace structures in which people live and work. It is the common streets that provide character in a city - the white terraces and squares of Georgian London, or the brownstones of 19th-century New York. For great cities are the result not only of celebrated master architects but also of the dozens of smaller talents who provided the less dramatic but equally precious background buildings.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000
us,Review/Theater; 1960's Dream of 'Midsummer Nights',"Few plays travel more easily to different times and places than ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' The Public Theater moved it to fin de siecle Brazil to open its Shakespeare Marathon and the Royal Shakespeare Company put it somewhere in limbo in its new staging at Stratford-on-Avon last spring. Now the Musical Theater Works has, with not a few liberties, plopped it down in Laguna Beach, Calif., circa 1965, and set it to music under the title ''Midsummer Nights.'' Like the 60's, the result turns out to be a very mixed bag of tricks. That is not to say ''Midsummer Nights,'' which is being presented at the Theater at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, is without its merits. It is a frothy show with lively tunes by Kevin Kuhn and some sassy and clever lyrics by Bryan D. Leys. But once the game of matching Shakespeare's characters to their namesakes in Laguna Beach is exhausted, there is little to fill the gaps between songs.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Merritt, who served as an enlisted combat engineer in Vietnam, was asked by one of his former teachers to talk to her class about the war. He declined and wrote ''Where the Rivers Ran Backward'' instead. It is a fascinating mosaic of reminiscences about Mr. Merritt's fellow soldiers, their weapons, their travails and training and their war. Mr. Merritt has a zoom lens for an eye and a broadcast-quality tape recorder for an ear. He focuses sharply on people, like a Flying Tiger Airlines stewardess who, when the troop plane arrives at Saigon, gives her soldier passengers the by-rote piffle about having ''an enjoyable stay'' and then bursts into tears. There is also a tank crew washing their monster in a river, apparently to expiate their anger, hatred and despair, and ''cursing God.'' There is even a colonel who, on presenting Mr. Merritt with a Purple Heart, offers congratulations and adds: ''I hope you win many more of these.'' To Mr. Merritt, now an attorney in Portland, Ore., the soldiers' Vietnam in 1968 was a place of scary, lonely night watches and ubiquitous post exchanges (''Places you couldn't go without air cover you could find a PX''). Mr. Merritt's comrades are profane, funny, hyperbolic, frightened, sad and exuberant. Impressions, actions and conversations are set down in the form of short vignettes, laced with snatches of song lyrics and the noise of weapons, and paced like a nasty firefight. ''Where the Rivers Ran Backward'' is a well-crafted evocation of the tragic zaniness of wars and the quiet perseverance of the men who fight them.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

''Even Mississippi'' is the memoir of a white University of Mississippi graduate's work with Robert Clark, a black Mississippi legislator, in his Congressional campaigns of 1982 and 1984 against a race-baiting Republican. Mr. Clark's losses lay the groundwork for Mike Espy's 1986 victory as the state's first black Congressman. This is an eloquent, moving book on several levels. In 1967, when Melany Neilson was 9 years old, Mr. Clark was the first black elected to the state House of Representatives, where he was for several years ostracized. Her reminiscences of childhood on a farm in Mr. Clark's district reveal innocence receding into doubt. ''It was a curious fact about this time that the familiar threat of violence did not make us wonder, and only the silence, the peaceful days, struck us as a strange surprise,'' she writes. In the best of these scenes, the author's father shouts at Chet Huntley and David Brinkley's newscasts in the late 1960's. By 1982 he is openly supporting Mr. Clark. Ms. Neilson's portrait of Mr. Clark is deftly drawn. We see a champion of the poor, a kind, pragmatic man, ever aware of white impressions. There is a priceless scene when C. B. (Buddie) Newman, a segregationist seeking to become Speaker of the Mississippi House, sinks on bended knee, asking Mr. Clark's support. More affecting are the passages recounting Ms. Neilson's evolution as a white among blacks, seeking a new Mississippi.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

(Maslin) The Dream Team 1989. MCA. $89.95. LD, $34.98. CC. 1:53. PG-13. Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Boyle and Stephen Furst play four institutionalized mental patients on their way to a baseball game who are separated from their doctor and chaperone and find themselves on their own in the wilds of Manhattan. The problem with Howard Zeff's comedy is ''that it's not funny too much of the time. On those occasions when it is funny, the humor less often prompts laughter than mute appreciation of the talents of the principal performers.'' (Vincent Canby) Gone With the Wind 1939. MGM/UA $89.95. LD, $49.95. 3:51. CC. G. This is a 50th-anniversary reissue of a film that the Times critic of the day called ''the greatest motion mural we have seen and the most ambitious film-making venture in Hollywood's spectacular history.'' Margaret Mitchell's epic love story of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the handsome soldier of fortune, and Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), the plantation belle, is told against the background of the Civil War and the physical destruction of the South. The Last Days of Pompeii 1935. Turner. $19.98. 1:36. No rating. Preston Foster stars as a blacksmith-turned-gladiator in a biblical drama from the makers of ''King Kong.'' A critic of the day appraised it as an ably managed historical work that loses something by bringing in a foolish little romance. ''But the hero of the occasion is Basil Rathbone,'' the critic added, ''whose Pilate is a fascinating aristocrat, scornful in his hauteur and sly in his reasoning.'' Powwow Highway 1989. Cannon. $89.95. 1:31. R. Two Cheyenne Indians - Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer), a scene-stealing mystical giant, and Buddy Red Bow (A. Martinez), an angry Vietnam veteran - team up for a weeklong journey in Philbert's new jalopy. Philbert is searching for some kind of spiritual core in contemporary American Indian life and Buddy is ostensibly coming to the aid of his sister, arrested on trumped-up drug charges. It aims for a sweetly comic tone and includes some sadly affecting glimpses of life among American Indians who have lost touch with their past, but ''most of the film simply ambles along at a genial pace.''

A delightful, surprisingly absorbing account of a year's labor in a New Hampshire sawmill, ''Parson's Mill'' approaches the gung-ho participatory journalism that George Plimpton performed in his athletic days. Overeducated and underqualified for mainstream white-collar employment, Timothy Lewontin and his wife seek solace and survival in the mountain towns of New Hampshire, where his parents had owned a summer vacation home. An advertisement brings him to a mill that, in his childhood, was a distantly glimpsed symbol of order and simplicity. At Parson's Mill, Mr. Lewontin's painful acquisition of the sawyer's craft grows into a personal, characteristically American quest for integrity in hard labor, told with a lucid sincerity that shimmers with insight. His co-workers, even if they were boorish or bigoted, cast shadows as long as the ash logs they send to the mill's whirling blades. Mr. Lewontin, now a writer living near Boston and the operator of a woodworking shop, waxes cosmic about the various machines, but finds the essence of Yankee enterprise in ''tall, lean, creaky-looking'' Henry Parsons, the mill's tyrannical, saturnine owner. Wise, weird and mystically capable of reading the grain in a virgin log so that it can be cut for maximum profit, Mr. Parsons is a failure at management, the only skill American entrepreneurs still take for granted. ''Parsons could not reconcile his need for laborers with his own belief that every real man ought to be independent,'' Mr. Lewontin writes. ''If he could have run the place himself, he would have.'' Mr. Lewontin uses incidents and events around the mill to contrast the nobility of honest labor with the ignobility of the workers. When the mill ultimately closes and its parts are auctioned off, we share his loss and his gratitude for the privilege of knowing laborers of such dignity, character and strength.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Sincerest Flattery or the Subtlest Form of Dishonor?,"ThE Kimbell Art Museum is Texas's finest postwar building, and one of the nation's. It is a late masterwork of the greatest architect of our time, Louis Kahn, and while it is not by any means a perfect museum, it is very nearly a perfect building. Indeed, it is one of the few museums anywhere that would be pleasurable to visit even if it contained not a single work of art; Kahn's concrete vaults, washed with Texas sun filtered through curved metal reflectors, are at once gentle and powerful, serene and alive. The building's walls are of travertine, set within a frame of concrete; in Kahn's characteristic manner, the rich material and the harsh material enter into a dialogue, as do the oak and aluminum of the interior, each substance bringing greater meaning to the other. The Kimbell is a series of ruminations about the nature of space and light, and it has the ability, so rare among buildings of our age, to challenge us and comfort us at the same time. Although the Kimbell was designed in the late 1960's and finished in 1972, it is in many ways a palazzo as much as it is a museum; with only 20,000 square feet of regular exhibition space on its main floor, its scale is less that of an institution than a great house. Given the impressive quality of the museum's collection, formed by its founding director, Richard Brown, and expanded through significant acquisitions by its director since 1980, Edmund P. Pillsbury, it is not surprising that the Kimbell is often compared to museums like the Frick Collection in New York or the Phillips Collection in Washington; although it does not exist in a former house, as these other institutions do, like them it offers great art in an intimate setting. The Kimbell is now about to break significantly from the model of these institutions, for it is preparing to expand its building. The plans have been drawn not by Kahn, who died in 1974, nor by any of his close associates, but by Romaldo Giurgola, an eminent architect who was a part of Kahn's circle in Philadelphia in the late 1950's and early 1960's. Mr. Giurgola, a former chairman of the department of architecture at Columbia University, has designed numerous large commercial and institutional buildings, including the recently completed Houses of Parliament in Canberra, Australia; his work is widely respected, although it has never, to be sure, engendered the admiration bordering on worship that Kahn's has.",1989-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"Shares for Ex-Mets Q. It hardly seems likely, but suppose that the Mets and the Toronto Blue Jays were to meet in the World Series, with Lee Mazzilli and Mookie Wilson playing against their former Met teammates. Suppose also that Toronto were to win the Series, entitling Mazzilli and Wilson to at least some portion of the winners' shares. But since they joined the Blue Jays on Aug. 1, after playing the first two-thirds of the season with New York, wouldn't Mazzilli and Wilson be eligible for some portion of the losers' shares as well? How would this be resolved? A. For Mazzilli and Wilson, the idea of having your cake and eating it would come down to each player getting a piece of each pie, with one important condition: the player's total share could not exceed a full share of the winning team. According to the rules, any player on a team's roster from June 1 until the end of the season is eligible for a full share. If the player is traded after June 1, he still qualifies for a partial share as voted upon by his teammates. That means Mazzilli and Wilson would be eligible for part of the Mets' losing share and part of the Blue Jays' winning share this season.",1989-09-25T05:00:00+0000

A.Most sliding doors have thin sheaves or narrow wheels set into the bottom of the door and these are what ride on the track. It seems one or more of the doors' sheaves are broken or worn out, or the ball bearings on the inside are shot. Either way, the door must be lifted off the track to get at the bottom and replace the sheaves.

Prices are current. Chantal Cafe * (July 14, 1989), 257 West 55th Street (246-7076) - Chantal Cafe is a modest and moderately priced little bistro where the key to enjoyment is staying with house standards like rack of lamb with rosemary, and steak pommes frites. From Monday to Saturday, a pre-theater menu is served from 5:30 to 7 P.M. (prix fixe, $17.95). Included are an appetizer, entree, salad and dessert. Among the main courses are medallions of monkfish with braised leeks and fennel, and paillard of chicken with green mustard sauce.

Da Tommaso * (Aug. 11, 1989), 908 Eighth Avenue, near 54th Street (265-1890) - Amid the commotion of the Broadway theater district, Da Tommaso is a tranquil spot that offers good traditional food at modest prices, and portions are enormous. Pastas are the high points here. Among the best are angel hair with clams in a bright garlic-fueled broth, and fettuccine with shrimp, radicchio and shallots. Other dependable options are lamb chops in white wine, Cognac and sage, and chicken scarpariello (boned and cooked with white wine, lemon and herbs). The best of the desserts is the attractively presented pear sorbet. Appetizers are $5.50 to $7.50, entrees $13.50 to $20. Dinner served 4:30 P.M. to midnight Monday to Saturday, 1 to 11 P.M. Sunday.

Some of the entrees are sweetbreads with asparagus and truffles, roast duck with kumquats, and halibut in a light vermouth and watercress sauce on a pallet of baby vegetables. The pastry chef produces some excellent desserts, chocolate charlotte and tarte Tatin among them. Pre-theater dinner is $39 prix fixe from 5:30 to 6:45 P.M Monday to Saturday. Symphony Cafe * (April 7, 1989), 950 Eighth Avenue, at 56th Street (397-9595) - Symphony Cafe's unpretentious menu and relatively moderate prices have made it a popular pre-performance restaurant among Carnegie Hall patrons.

us,"Review/Film; From Denmark, a Fairy Tale for Adults","Line Kruse, who plays the 11-year-old title character in the new Danish film ''Emma's Shadow,'' exudes an easygoing, mercurial charm that is the mark of a natural child actor. Portraying the neglected only child of an upper-class Copenhagen family in the 1930's, she has an expression that shifts from innocent curiosity to imperiousness with just a slight raising of the chin and narrowing of the eyes. Not many very young actors have conveyed so unaffectedly a sense of being to the manor born while retaining a childlike freshness. Miss Kruse's wonderfully natural performance accounts for much of the appeal of this modest fairy tale for adults, which opens today at the new Angelika Film Center.",1989-09-29T05:00:00+0000

But because this is Mr. Hill's work, these ingredients are slapped together with high style.

To retain card holders as rates rise, banks have extended periods for interest-free payments to make their cards more attractive, and many have eliminated annual fees. For people who carry over a balance, a low interest rate is desirable. But if you pay off your charges in full each month, look for a card with no annual fee. Many of these have variable rates, generally tied to short-term Government securities, with quarterly adjustments. Remember that since Sept. 1, the Government has required all issuers of credit cards to include full fee and rate details in applications and solicitations. Here are some cards that are among those with the lowest annual percentage rates, two with fixed rates (F) and two with variable rates (V). $ Bank APR Annual Fee People's Bank, Bridgeport, Conn. 13.5 F $25 Empire of America, Amherst, N.Y. 13.75 F $18 USAA Fed Savings, San Antonio 15.21 V None Manufacturers Bank of Wilmington, Del. 16.6 V None Source: Bank Credit Card Observer, Princeton, N.J.",1989-09-30T05:00:00+0000
