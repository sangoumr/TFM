The class will decide who should continue on the show, who should be voted off and who was voted off and should not have been.

Fifteen objects from its Oriental Antiquities Gallery were stolen Friday, it announced, although the loss was discovered by security staff on Saturday. The police said they believed the medieval Chinese jewelry, dating from 700 to 1400, was taken during normal opening hours because no alarms were activated. The easily portable items included hairpins, fingernail guards, earrings, left, and other decorative pieces, taken from a glass cabinet that was forced open. The museum said that the huge gallery was being guarded, but because it is long and segmented by various cases, someone was able to take advantage of an area that wasn't being monitored.

us,"From Page to Screen, an Impossibly Internal Novel","As ""Enduring Love"" enters a world of dark obsession, it lures viewers into a symbiotic dance between a stalker named Jed (the scruffy, blond, helpless-looking Rhys Ifans) and the man he is stalking, Joe (Daniel Craig as his opposite, a broodingly handsome, tough-minded intellectual). Yet this dynamic film is based on Ian McEwan's ambiguous, interior, apparently unadaptable novel. Just imagine all the bad movies that might have come from that. How the book became the film, without costing the novel its soul, is the story of a collaboration that doesn't even sound promising. There's a director who leaves few fingerprints, Roger Michell; a screenwriter best known as a playwright, Joe Penhall; and a novelist who realizes that, as Mr. McEwan put it in a phone conversation last week, ""translating a novel to film is an act of controlled vandalism.""",2004-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Such flooding has been a growing threat to the city of 117 low islets, partly because the marshy region is subsiding as underlying peat compacts and because seas are rising as global warming melts glaciers.

A general surgeon for fifty years, practicing on the South Shore of Long Island, Dr. Hendler started a surgical group in Amityville as well as Hempstead, helped found Freeport and Brunswick General Hospitals and skillfully attended to countless patients. His arduous path to becoming a physician cultivated a profound empathy for patients and his family. Orphaned at 15, he graduated from Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland Medical School despite many hardships. A determined self made man, he applied himself wholeheartedly to all aspects of life. His accomplishments and reputation as a physician were equally matched by his business acumen. Throughout his life many sought his council and few were disappointed by his honest, compassionate and forthright advice. Never one to boast about his own hard earned success, he was a modest man who loved making others laugh. He golfed and played gin as a member of Cold Spring Country Club, and Broken Sound. Hy put his family above all else and we are forever grateful for his profound contemplative generosity. He will be missed and fondly remembered by Ethel, his loving wife of sixty four years.

Monica Salmaso, however, has other ideas. Her luminous voice, tinged with melancholy and calm sensuality, is made for quieter moments. On her albums, including her new one, ""Iai"" (World Village), Ms. Salmaso reaches into the boundless resources of Brazil's musical past. She rediscovers old songs and finds new ones in old styles: bossa novas, old sambas, ballads. Yet she treats them not as purist remakes, but as modern close-ups. Her voice hovers amid a handful of instruments, with flickers of percussion to hint at regional rhythms from across Brazil or woodwinds to recall old dance bands. She sings about a Brazil full of lovers and history, ancient deities and modern rascals, and the songs become intimate and indelible, turning cultural memories into private reveries.

Mr. Cullum plays Cardinal Bernard F. Law, and the centerpiece of Michael Murphy's play is a re-enactment of a deposition given by the cardinal in the course of a lawsuit brought against the archdiocese of Boston by victims of sexual abuse by its priests. Mr. Cullum's cardinal never lets slip his tight grip on his emotions, measuring out carefully considered responses to a lawyer's aggressive questions. Providing telling -- and touching -- contrast to the cardinal's cool are Cynthia Darlow and Dan Daily, the actors who portray numerous witnesses and relatives of victims. Ms. Darlow, in particular, brings admirable depth of feeling, as well as terrific variety, to her performance. The texts she is given are letters sent to the cardinal and his associates by relatives of victims. But the performance could never be mistaken for a dry reading. It is infused with palpable emotion, from feisty outrage to anguish to bitter disillusionment. It is Ms. Darlow's job to embody the devastating emotional cost borne by the victims and their families, a chilling contrast to the obliviousness of the cardinal. She rises to the challenge superbly.

us,PAUL CHAN,"For his debut solo show, ""My Birds . . . Trash . . . The Future,"" Paul Chan has pulled out the stops, offering up a double-channel 17-minute digital cartoon, projected on both sides of a hanging screen, along with charcoal drawings of owls, ravens, hawks and bats, prints and a toy gun with a radio inside that you hear by pointing the barrel at your head. The theme is the apocalypse. Mr. Chan, who's in the current Carnegie International in Pittsburgh and who first generated buzz in a group show here last year with a video riff on the darkling outsider artist Henry Darger, is clearly anxious to impress. Anxiety and war are his main motifs. His cartoon animation (a detail from above) is a bleak, seven-scene saga owing much to Goya, with nods to the Chapman brothers and Leviticus. Lynchings, vultures, orgies and a barren landscape slowly dissolve into a cataclysm of torpid color (from Goya to Rothko), with a soundtrack of hip-hop cellphone rings. The work has the jerky, low-tech quality of an early Nintendo game. It's hypnotic at first, then dull. Slow, it has a roughness that nonetheless sticks strangely in the mind, dovetailing with the subject matter. The accompanying drawings and prints, derived from the animation, are in different modes, as if demonstrating versatility for its own sake. All in all, a mixed bag, disappointing high expectations but worth checking out. (Greene Naftali, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7770, through Nov. 13; free.)

There seems to be little chance that Mr. Bush will retreat from his limits on federal support for such research, and a Congress that has shifted rightward may try, once again, to ban therapeutic cloning, the most promising area of embryonic stem cell research.

His father, a cellist, decided to teach him the cello, and cello won out. But his father cautioned him not to practice too much, lest he become a musician! Still, his father's challenging ways proved highly influential. Every time young Mr. Mork grew fixed in an interpretive idea about a piece, his father would make him think about it differently. This searching quality still characterizes Mr. Mork's adventurous artistry. He has championed contemporary music, but also founded (in 1991) and directed (until last year) an intensive chamber music festival in Stavanger, on the southwest coast of Norway. His playing can surprise you: one moment cool, articulate and classical, the next rhapsodic, throbbing and Romantic. On Sunday afternoon Mr. Mork performs as part of Lincoln Center's ""Virtuoso Recitals"" series, with the pianist Kathryn Stott, and his program is typically intriguing. He will place Prokofiev's Sonata for Cello and Piano in C in context by preceding it with the Sonata in D minor by Nikolai Miaskovsky, a friend and fellow student of Prokofiev's at St. Petersburg Conservatory. Next comes Janacek's ""Pohadka"" and finally Chopin's Cello Sonata in G minor, a teeming, restless work that would be played all the time if the piano part weren't so difficult. More power to Ms. Stott! (Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; tickets are $40.) ANTHONY TOMMASINI",2004-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Consumers, however, seemed unmoved by arguments that the concrete-block building bearing the name of a Wal-Mart subsidiary, Bodega Aurrera, is an affront to Mexican culture. More than 100 lined up hours before the grand opening, eager for bargains, and several told reporters that they were more interested in jobs and lower prices than in ancient culture.

Retired in 1978, he was a consultant to NASA, Boeing, Cessna, Stanford and Cal Tech.

The majority of readers who will be interested in a writer's bio, especially one as long and exhaustive as Edwin Williamson's ''Borges: A Life,'' will be admirers of the writer's work. They will therefore usually be idealizers of that writer and perpetrators (consciously or not) of the intentional fallacy. Part of the appeal of the writer's work for these fans will be the distinctive stamp of that writer's personality, predilections, style, particular tics and obsessions -- the sense that these stories were written by this author and could have been done by no other.* And yet it often seems that the person we encounter in the literary biography could not possibly have written the works we admire. And the more intimate and thorough the bio, the stronger this feeling usually is. In the present case, the Jorge Luis Borges who emerges in Williamson's book -- a vain, timid, pompous mama's boy, given for much of his life to dithery romantic obsessions -- is about as different as one can get from the limpid, witty, pansophical, profoundly adult writer we know from his stories. Rightly or no, anyone who reveres Borges as one of the best and most important fiction writers of the last century will resist this dissonance, and will look, as a way to explain and mitigate it, for obvious defects in Williamson's life study. The book won't disappoint them. ",2004-11-07T05:00:00+0000

In this 1969 satire of the 60's self-enlightenment craze (and the self-righteous proselytizing that often came with it), Bob (Robert Culp), a documentary filmmaker, and his wife, Carol (Natalie Wood), trek to an Esalen-like retreat as research for one of Bob's projects. Although they're skeptical at first -- how could they not be, when one encounter-group denizen announces, ""I'm Myrna -- I came because I want a better orgasm"" -- they end up deeply affected, and return home to share their newfound enlightenment with their best friends, Ted (Elliott Gould) and Alice (Dyan Cannon).",2004-11-07T05:00:00+0000

Located close to the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and not far from the Zocalo, the city's main plaza, it contains a spectacular collection of edibles so beautiful that they're almost a shame to eat (but eat them you will): vibrant chilies, lush mushrooms, strange tropical fruits and gulf shrimp the size of a boomerang.

This four-disc set marking the 65th anniversary of ""Gone With the Wind"" is the real deal, a stunning restoration that corrects decades of abuses made in the name of modernization. One of the extras, ""Restoring a Legend,"" has its share of horror stories and heroes, like the music editor who ignored an order to throw out the old soundtrack. He deliberately mislabeled it, stuck it in a can at the back of a vault and kept track of it for decades. What he saved provides this DVD with the original monaural soundtrack (it can also be played in Dolby digital). But the real hero is the chief technology officer of Warner Brothers, Chris Cookson, who found a way to realign the three strips of film used in the Technicolor process. The result: a more crisply defined image, and a richer one, with luxurious colors and textures. And for once, the extras aren't just filler. They include mini biographies of notable cast members, newsreels of the 1939 Atlanta premiere and film of the 1961 Atlanta revival marking the centennial of the Civil War. And what of the movie itself? For all the weight of its classic status and its epic length, it remains a great feat of movie storytelling, and a hugely satisfying entertainment. And next to ""Cold Mountain,"" with its genteel grotesqueries (Nicole Kidman offering to bring lemonade to the ""Negroes""), the romanticism of ""Gone With the Wind"" seems much more honest.

In the movies, the solitary act of communing with the muse is often portrayed with the forced passion of an obligatory love scene. And the very idea that we want our literary idols humanized is challenged by the reality that it is almost always as disappointing to see a beloved author incarnated on screen as it is to meet him or her in real life.",2004-11-07T05:00:00+0000

The term, synonymous with something middlebrow, is an insult in a culture that celebrates the high and the low. But there is white bread, and then there is white bread. ""It took 50 years for Wonder Bread to come in and out and artisanal bread to come back into style,"" says Amy Scherber, of Amy's Bread. An advocate of healthful whole wheat when she began baking in 1992, she soon saw white's virtues; baguettes and rustic loaves are her best sellers. ""The blank canvas for a bread baker is to make a perfect white loaf,"" she says. At a recent exhibition in Paris, it was the muse for Jean Paul Gaultier, who had bakers and pattern makers design everything from btards to Birkin bags. White bread also inspired the photographer Kevin Van Aelst. For his series ""The Golden Spiral,"" he sliced a piece of Wonder Bread (""iconic of everything American,"" he says) into fractals to explore the philosophical question When does a fish cease to be a fish? Or a loaf cease to be a loaf? When it stops making us hungry . . . that will be the day. CHRISTINE MUHLKE",2004-11-07T05:00:00+0000

I grew up in a suburban Cleveland family with two working parents in the 1980's.

Our dad took weekly business trips; our mom worked days and went to law school nights. There was little alternative but to outsource dinner. We were alarmed when, following Oprah's lead, our mother stopped eating and went on the Optifast diet, drinking only formula until she crashed to a size 6. Of course she gained all the weight back.

Blandness is a virtue here; so is feline companionship. (""Is the cozy mystery taking over,"" an exasperated Marilyn Stasio has asked in these pages, ""or am I just imagining all these cats?"") Davidson's novels, which are about a small-town Colorado caterer and amateur sleuth named Goldy, straddle another genre, too. Like Fannie Flagg in ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"" and Laura Esquivel in ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" Davidson smuggles recipes into her novels. (In ""Double Shot,"" you can learn to make things like ""Got-a-Hunch Brunch Rolls"" and ""Handcuff Croissants."") This novel is the author's 12th about Goldy and her Goldilocks' Catering company, and the fifth in this tepid, microwaveable series to make the Times hardcover list. Davidson's Web site has a short biographical sketch that notes that at Wellesley College ""she lived across the hall from Hillary Rodham (now Clinton), who drafted her into the Young Republicans!""

The ice retreat could also create summertime shipping shortcuts between the Atlantic and Pacific and allow oil and gas exploration in previously ice-cloaked waters.

And indeed, yesterday the crocodile-voiced Mr. Fierstein was seen eating with the director of ""Fiddler,"" David Leveaux, at the popular Broadway bistro Angus McIndoe, on West 44th Street. While some ""Fiddler"" purists might be bewildered by the idea that the world-weary Tevye could be played by Mr. Fierstein -- most recently a Tony Award winner for his colorful turns as Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" -- the show could use the buzz.

JetBlue's chief executive, David Neeleman, canceled an appearance yesterday before a Smith Barney Citigroup transportation conference, where he had been expected to discuss the outlook for the low-fare airline. JetBlue, based in New York, reported a decline in third-quarter earnings last month, missing analysts' estimates, and warned that it might post a small loss for the fourth quarter.

""Gilmore Girls,"" which is having a renaissance in its fifth year, and ""One Tree Hill,"" continued their winning seasons for WB.

The 17th installment of the series, with songs by Ciara, Ashlee Simpson, the Beastie Boys, Nelly, Switchfoot, Franz Ferdinand, Bowling for Soup and 13 others, has reached the top spot in its first week of release, with just over 400,000 copies sold -- about 100,000 less than Vol. 16 sold in its first week of release, in August, but still more than recent chart-toppers by Rod Stewart, George Strait and Rascal Flatts. The full series has sold just over 44 million albums. Jay-Z and R. Kelly's album ""Unfinished Business"" (Jive/Def Jam) was at No.1 last week, despite the ugly public breakdown of the duo's tour -- quickly followed by a lawsuit -- but this week the effect of those troubles has become clear: the album plunged to No.10, with just 71,000 copies sold, a 67 percent drop from last week. The rock group A Perfect Circle's ""Emotive"" (Virgin) reached No.2, and Ray Charles's posthumous duets album, ""Genius Loves Company"" (Concord), continues to sell well, reaching No.3 with sales of 118,000.

Dr. Daniel B. Mark of the Duke Clinical Research Institute reached that conclusion based on a review of the costs of implanting the devices in patients who were part of a previously reported clinical study. That study established that use of the devices in patients with moderately weakened hearts cut death rates by 23 percent in the year after the implant. Defibrillators detect disruptions in the rhythm of the heart and jolt it back to a normal pattern before a full-scale heart attack occurs. Dr. Mark said the devices in the clinical study cost an average of just over $33,000, well below the $50,000 level widely used as a benchmark for cost-effective life-saving therapies. Although Dr. Mark's study has not yet been reviewed by independent researchers or published, doctors who attended the presentation said the study could encourage cardiologists to embrace the implants more rapidly. The implants are made by companies like Medtronic, Guidant and St. Jude Medical. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2004-11-11T05:00:00+0000

BTX, originally created by Intel and made into an industry standard, works to remove a PC's heat more effectively. It arranges the PC's three hottest components -- its processor, chip set and graphics card -- in a row to place them inside an airstream flowing from the machine's front to its back. Other components, like memory, are also repositioned to aid air flow. The airstream -- which Gateway calls the wind tunnel and creates in its 6300 desktop by locating a fan on either end of the chassis -- cools the processor and other components more effectively than that of an ATX motherboard, today's standard board design. The company says that reducing the temperature inside a PC's chassis can increase the lifespan of its components, which can fail if they overheat.",2004-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Under the agreement, which was announced in September, Lucent would get $861 million, which includes $45 million of interest, because of how it reported a loss in 2001. The refund will be booked in Lucent's fourth quarter, which ended on Sept. 30. The company, which is based in Murray Hill, N.J., said that the refund raised its fourth-quarter income to $1.21 billion, or 23 cents a share, from the previously reported $348 million, or 7 cents a share. For all of 2004, Lucent earned $2 billion, or 42 cents a share, rather than the $1.14 billion, or 25 cents a share, it reported before. Ken Belson (NYT)",2004-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Deals: Rogers To Buy Rest Of Cellphone Unit,"Just a month after acquiring AT&T Wireless Services' stake in its cellphone unit for 1.77 billion Canadian dollars, the Toronto-based Rogers Communications said yesterday that it planned to buy out the unit's remaining minority shareholders. In a deal valued at about 774 million Canadian dollars, Rogers is offering minority shareholders of Rogers Wireless Communications 1.75 shares in the nonvoting Class B stock of the parent company for each share they hold. Based on the Rogers Wireless stock price at the time the offer was announced, the proposal represents a 16 percent premium. By Rogers's calculations, the buyout has a 38 percent higher share value than the earlier AT&T deal. Rogers Communications currently holds about 89 percent of the equity of Rogers Wireless. Shares of Rogers Communications traded in the United States fell 47 cents, to $23.58. Ian Austen (NYT)",2004-11-12T05:00:00+0000

The trade paper Radio & Records reported yesterday that John Dimick, a 25-year radio veteran currently working in San Diego, would take over as WQHT's program director in mid-December, succeeding Tracy Cloherty, who has been at the station for 15 years and will now become its programming consultant. In New York's fiercely contested radio wars, WQHT, owned by Emmis Communications, was tied for second place with two other stations in the October Arbitron ratings. Clear Channel's adult contemporary WLTW-FM (106.7) holds the city's No. 1 spot. Mr. Dimick has a history of success in pitting smaller companies like Emmis and his current employer, Jefferson-Pilot, against giants like Clear Channel and Infinity. Emmis, which is based in Indianapolis and owns fewer than 25 stations nationwide compared with Clear Channel's 1,200-plus, has 3 of New York's top 15 stations.

Presiding over his ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians (above Mr. Reich, left, and Russ Hartenberger), he is presenting a three-concert series at the Metropolitan Museum that should allow listeners to take stock of his career. One could also, of course, do that by way of ""Steve Reich: Works 1965-1995,"" an extraordinary 10-CD set from Nonesuch, but the Met series includes works composed since that set appeared -- including the fantastic ""Three Tales"" (2002), a music and video work with which the series ends in April. Plus, there is a visceral quality in live performances of Mr. Reich's work that recordings never entirely capture. A centerpiece of the first installment of the series, tomorrow evening, includes the opening section of one of his true classics, the hypnotic and rhythmically involved ""Drumming"" (1971). Somewhat less celebrated, but just as important in Mr. Reich's canon, is the ""Sextet"" (1984), a work for percussion, piano and synthesizer, and one of several works in which Mr. Reich began to take a fresh look at harmonic movement (in addition to his earlier rhythmic layering). Also on the program are ""New York Counterpoint"" (1985), for clarinet and 10 more taped clarinets; ""Nagoya Marimbas"" (1994), a short work for marimba duet; and the American premiere of ""Dance Patterns,"" a 2002 work for two xylophones, two vibraphones and piano.

us,The Listings; LARS ARRHENIUS,"What if the blocky universal symbols for man and woman, like those designating public restrooms, had lives of their own? In his New York debut at Feigen Contemporary, the Swedish artist Lars Arrhenius provides the answer: They would do the same stuff we do, only in two dimensions and without words. Working with cartoonlike storyboards, on maps or in digital animation, Mr. Arrhenius explores the narrative possibilities of international sign language, pushing it into new, often subversive territory. He gets an amazing amount said about life in general and in particular. His animation ""The Street"" (stills, above) chronicles a day and a night in the life of a crisp black-and-white universe where people live, die, give birth, watch television, go to work, make love and walk the dog, all with machinelike regularity. Much messier narratives unfold side by side in ""A-Z,"" which makes brilliant use of the street map of London; in ""Habitat,"" which depicts the standard daily occurrences in an apartment building, from personal crises to neighbor problems; and in ""The Man Without One Way,"" which spells out the possible risks of walking home in vivid detail. (You don't always get there.) ""WWW"" uses a map of the world to comment on the state of the planet and confirms its title's double meaning: World Wide Web can also mean World Wide War.

Thanks to a massive revitalization project based around new architectural landmarks -- the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels -- and a growing underground art scene in Chinatown, downtown is quickly becoming a destination for culture hounds and lovers of the avant-garde.

One hopes Mr. Redman isn't planning a genre-crosser, yet another argument that jazz can coexist with pop music. He's done that a few times already -- and so have many others, without much to show for it. Perhaps this concert indicates what's to come. It features a new trio, including the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Ali Jackson -- guarantors of good, lean swing. Anyway, Mr. Redman, at his best, has a naturally sunny improvisational flow; he's got the spirit of a pop musician even in his deepest, most serious jazz mode.

Neibacher Jr. and his family, and to her community at Saint Peter's Lutheran Church at Citicorp Center. A native New Yorker and 1969 graduate of Columbia University School of Social Work, Ms. Neibacher dedicated her professional career of more than 30 years to poor and homeless people. She was a consummate social worker who taught at several social work schools in New York City and was active on the Board of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, the New York City Council Legislative Advisory Commission on the Homeless, and several other boards and coalitions. All who had the priviledge of knowing her well will miss her for her wise counsel and warm friendship. In recognition of her many contributions to New York's homeless people and of Susan's persistant leadership in developing a new women's shelter and drop-in center, the Board wishes to announce its intention of naming this facility on Jerome Avenue in the Bronx in her honor. A Mass of the Resurrection and Committal Service will take place at Saint Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue (enter 54th Street) on Thursday, November 18, 2004 at 7:00PM.

Unfortunately, festivals and venues like universities have also often been the only places you could catch up with this rapidly emerging national cinema since many of the best Korean films never secure distribution here. All of which makes the series ""The Newest Tiger: 60 Years of South Korean Cinema,"" which opens today, a must-see event for committed and casual cinephiles alike. Cutting across genres and themes, the 40-film program reaches back to 1949, a year after the establishment of the two separate governments, and works up to the present with the United States premiere of ""Low Life,"" the latest (his 99th!) from the leading auteur Im Kwon-taek. Among other delights not to be missed are ""The Power of Kangwon Province"" (2002) from Hong Song-soo, one of the more essential filmmakers working in movies, and ""The Housemaid"" (1960), a blast from the past from Kim Ki-young, a legendary B-movie maestro whose nom du cinema was Mr. Monster. (""The Newest Tiger,"" which includes ""Take Care of My Cat,"" above, written and directed by Jeong Jae-eun, runs through Dec. 7 at the Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600.

A man beloved by the patients whom he served in a career that spanned 70 years. Dr. Coleman was a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Long Island College of Medicine. He held the position of Attending Surgeon in Otolaryngology at both Manhattan Eye and Ear and New York Hospitals and was a Clinical Professor at Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York City. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Otolaryngology and a Fellow of the American Triological Society and past Vice President of the American Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine. Dr. Coleman trained and guided the careers of many medical students. He was a nationally syndicated columnist for King Features Syndicate writing the ""Speaking of your Health"" column for more than 25 years and the author and narrator of ""A Guide to your Health"" a nationally syndicated radio program. Dr. Coleman created and produced ""Here's to your Health"" an early television series for the Medical Society of New York County and the National Broadcasting Company. He authored several books including ""Freedom from Fear"" which was translated in 12 languages and another widely used children's book ""A Visit to the Hospital"" intended to allay the fears of children facing surgery. Shortly before his retirement in 1999, Dr. Coleman spoke of how gratifying his life in medicine had been made by his patients and how grateful he was to them for their devotion to him. Dr. Coleman is survived by his wife Elizabeth, daughters Lynn Dale and Lisa and his beloved grand-daughter Sarah Elizabeth.

There's been a line of Hollywood stars back to Greer Garson, Grace Kelly and Doris Day. A lot of the younger actresses have inherited that mantle of being decent, not being Frances Farmer, which is sort of what these pictures of Julia court. She's not dressed for going out; she's not dressed for anyone seeing her. These are really haunting pictures. It moves her image in a direction that can speak to me as a connoisseur of New Wave cinema or of the more outsize beauties of the 50's or 60's. They gave me a little dj vu in a way that was more personal almost than historical. When I saw that first one, I said, 'Oh, I know her.'

But for filmmakers like Burnie Burns, who work in the emerging medium of machinima, these features are a mere starting point. Instead of playing Halo as intended, Mr. Burns and a crew of machinima peers exploit the game's software quirks to create their online comedy series, Red vs. Blue, within Halo's virtual world. Since its debut in the spring of 2003, Red vs. Blue has rivaled Halo itself in popularity; fans download new episodes (www.redvsblue.com) at a rate of over 900,000 a week.

That's America's hottest young pastor, Joel Osteen, explaining in his new book, ""Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential,"" that God does not want you to be poor. Osteen's book is at No. 5 on this week's hardcover advice, how-to and miscellaneous list. Osteen, who is 41, runs the Lakewood Church in Houston, which in the last five years has become America's largest church -- some 25,000 people attend services there each weekend. His television show, seen in 150 countries, reaches millions more. Osteen definitely thinks increase: he plans to move his church into the Compaq Center, formerly home to the Houston Rockets, sometime next year -- after he has fitted it out with twin waterfalls. Osteen describes Lakewood as ""a nondenominational charismatic church."" There's no fire-and-brimstone here, or in his book. Osteen has become known as ""the Smiling Preacher,"" and among the themes he hits regularly is the need to shed your ""poverty mentality."" Having trouble at work? ""God may intervene in your situation,"" Osteen writes, ""replacing your supervisor so you can be promoted. One day, you may run that entire company!""",2004-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"June 16, 2005","In more than four decades of steady stage work, Vanessa Redgrave has played 'em all, more or less. Her Chekhov roles have ranged from Nina in ""The Seagull"" to Ranevskaya in ""The Cherry Orchard."" She's portrayed Shakespeare's Rosalind and Cleopatra and even Prospero. Last year she tackled one of the American theater's most formidable challenges, Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" winning her first Tony Award. But her stage rsum, intriguingly, doesn't feature much Greek tragedy. (She was Katharine Hepburn's co-star in Michael Cacoyannis's 1971 movie of Euripides' ""Trojan Women."") It's fitting, then, that for her return to the Royal Shakespeare Company after a four-decade absence -- itself a somewhat historic occasion -- Ms. Redgrave has decided to add a tragic heroine to her repertory. Now 67, she is perhaps beyond the proper age for Euripides' most famously enraged females, Medea and Electra. Instead she'll play the title role in his ""Hecuba,"" a lesser-known but no less bloody tale of a woman exacting vengeance for the loss of her throne and the murder of her children. The production arrives at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on June 16 for a 10-day run.

In the summer after sophomore year, the Riot Group scored a stage at last, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where it performed ""Why I Want to Shoot Ronald Reagan."" The group returned in 1999 with ""Wreck the Airline Barrier,"" which won a Fringe First. The group has since won twice more. So it is not surprising that at 25, Mr. Shaplin has two plays running off Broadway, ""Hell Meets Henry Halfway,"" an adaptation of Witold Gombrowicz's ""Possessed,"" and ""Pugilist Specialist,"" a taut psychological drama about American marines involved in a ""black op"" in the Middle East.",2004-11-14T05:00:00+0000

There is, however, another set of Hollywood statistics of enormous significance, and Tuesday is their day. How important are these numbers? Every Tuesday at lunchtime, Mike Dunn and Peter Staddon, the president and executive vice president, respectively, of 20th Century Fox's home-entertainment division, take the elevator from ther 25th-floor offices at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles down to their cars in the underground parking garage and from there drive out into the noontime traffic on their way to Best Buy, Target, Costco and Wal-Mart. Tuesday is the day new DVD's are released, the day Dunn gets a sense of whether the discs that his team has worked on for months -- or sometimes years -- will sell as well as planned. So the Fox executives wander the aisles of the big retailers. They eavesdrop. They size up the clientele. They take note of what's moving through the cash registers.

Wuornos was convicted of seven murders committed while she made her living as a prostitute on Florida highways. Having contended that she had killed only in self-defense, she changed her story near the end. Mr. Broomfield's conclusion is that she had lost complete touch with reality at that point.

A mix of audacity, talent and, of course, beauty characterizes each of the women photographed here, but it is the complexity of their performances that ultimately sets them apart. Take the English actress Emily Mortimer, who first garnered attention for a scene in ""Lovely and Amazing"" in which she asks her lover to critique her naked body. It is a riveting moment that illustrates Mortimer's ability to balance comedy and pathos -- traits that also define her character as a single mother in the forthcoming ""Dear Frankie."" The Argentine actress Mia Maestro, who stars in ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" will play a deeply religious teacher who seems haunted in ""The Holy Girl""; it's as if devotion had taken possession of her entire being. Similarly, when Marilou Berry, the ignored daughter of a self-absorbed author, breaks into song in the French film ""Look at Me,"" her character is transformed. Aishwarya Rai, the highest-paid actress in Bollywood, dazzles as Lalita, the Elizabeth Bennett character in the U.S.-distributed film ""Bride and Prejudice."" The Beijing-born actress Zhang Ziyi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") can next be seen as a blind, knife-throwing courtesan in the sumptuous ""House of Flying Daggers.""

The annulment of the trial was the latest twist in the chaotic proceedings, which began this month with Mr. Guzmn and his fellow defendants chanting communist slogans in court and raising their fists in victory salutes. Mr. Guzmn, a former provincial university professor, was captured in 1992 and convicted by hooded judges in a secret military tribunal. But new trials were ordered for Mr. Guzmn and other rebel leaders after the country's Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the secret courts were unconstitutional. Shining Path, which began its war against the state in 1980, was officially blamed by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for a majority of the 70,000 deaths Peru suffered in the 20-year conflict.

Revenue rose 30 percent, to 312 billion yen, helped by an increase in orders for machines used to etch circuits on silicon wafers. Profit in Nikon's core camera division fell compared with last year, as a sharp decline in sales of traditional film cameras more than offset a rise in sales of digital cameras. Sales of film cameras are expected to continue falling, and Nikon also warned that it expects the pace of growth in digital cameras to slow later this year. Still, the company kept its profit forecast for the year ending next March unchanged at 28.6 billion yen, compared with 2.4 billion yen last year. Todd Zaun (NYT)",2004-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Justice Laura D. Blackburne of State Supreme Court in Queens ruled in December 2002 that Queens prosecutors had taken more than their allotted six months to bring Mr. Hodges's case to trial and dismissed the attempted murder charges against him. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, who appealed her decision, said yesterday's ruling ""corrects what would have otherwise been a gross miscarriage of justice"" and declared that his office would begin prosecuting Mr. Hodges. The also judge came under criticism in June, after she let a robbery suspect in her courtroom elude detectives by letting him out a back exit. She was then transferred to a civil court from a criminal court. Phone messages left yesterday at her chambers and home were not returned. Corey Kilgannon (NYT)",2004-11-17T05:00:00+0000

After being quoted by an Austrian newspaper in August to the effect that he might have to leave the United States if the president won re-election, Mr. Runnicles has agreed to a three-year extension of his contract as music director of the San Francisco Opera. The contract was to have ended in 2006. Mr. Runnicles told the newspaper, Der Standard: ""I would really have to think about whether I could stay there if Bush wins a second time. The American public can be wrong once, but if they re-elect him, that means they really want him."" The remarks caused a ruckus in Georgia, where Mr. Runnicles is principal guest conductor of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra distanced itself from his words, and the Scottish-born Mr. Runnicles, who lives in San Francisco, apologized. Through a spokesman at the opera, Mr. Runnicles said he had no further comment. The remarks have apparently had little effect on his reputation in California, where the San Francisco Opera presented a 50th-birthday concert and gala for him on Tuesday night. He was presented with the insignia of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, granted by Queen Elizabeth II in June. Mr. Runnicles is also principal conductor of the Orchestra of St. Luke's.

PICTURE THISThe Nikon D70, a six-megapixel digital single-lens-reflex camera, has turned advanced amateurs and professionals into swooning devotees. Highlights of its feature list: zero start-up time, near-zero shutter lag, three-shots-a-second burst mode and a long-life battery. It isn't cheap ($1,000, not including a lens; nikonusa.com), but cameras of this caliber cost $25,000 only four years ago. CNET Review: Nikon D70 Check PricesREADY, STEADY, GOImprovements in zoom lenses mean many photographers can use a single lens in nearly any situation. But at telephoto settings, zooms can produce blurry photos. The Canon EF 28-to-135-millimeter I.S. zoom lens ($480; canonusa.com) uses electronics to overcome the problem. Sensors in the lens trigger motors that counteract shake. The lens, available online, is compatible with Canon single-lens-reflex cameras.

It's also a touch screen, which you use for some advanced controls (a design that can be a blessing and a curse). As long as the light is good, the captured video is bright, colorful and sharp.

There aren't as many programs available for the PocketPC operating system as there are for the Palm OS, but this $450 beauty () is a sweet option if you're in a Microsoft state of mind.FORM AND FUNCTION Logitech's V500 Cordless Notebook Mouse not only makes an artful statement, but speaks volumes about clever engineering. The $70 optical mouse (www.logitech.com) links to a laptop through a small receiver that plugs into a U.S.B. port. When not in use, the receiver stows neatly inside the mouse.The V500 runs on two AAA batteries and features a four-way scroll panel rather than a typical scroll wheel.MEMORABLE PalmOne's latest palmtop lacks a voice recorder, vibrating alarm and Wi-Fi for wireless Internet, but it does something no other palmtop can do: when connected to a Mac or PC by a U.S.B. cable, the T5 ($400) becomes a 160-megabyte flash drive to transfer any kind of file. The bright, crisp screen has the highest resolution of any palmtop, and you can rotate it 90 degrees to read spreadsheets and Web pages.SHARP STORAGE The SwissMemory U.S.B. has the familiar blade, nail file, screwdriver and tiny scissors you would expect in a Swiss Army knife, but it also has a 128-megabyte U.S.B. flash storage drive. More information on the SwissMemory, which has a list price of $82, is at www.victorinox.com. For air travel, the flash drive is detachable so the knife itself can be stowed in a checked bag.CELL CINEMA Why settle for plain old pictures on your wireless phone when you can get them up and moving? With LG's VX7000 phone, you can take 15-second videos and send them to your friends. The phone ($200 at www.verizonwireless.com) has four megabytes of storage space for games, ringtones and other goodies.COOL RUNNING Turning the 12-volt DC power from a car's auxiliary outlet into 120-volt AC for a laptop or cellphone charger usually involves a bulky metal box. Most of that bulk is there to draw off heat from the electronic components. The $45 Xantrex XPower Micro Inverter 175 (www.xantrex.com) uses a tiny cooling fan, making it small enough to plug directly into most car outlets.THUMB CANDY The BlackBerry is a hit with white-collar types. But why should corporate America have all the fun? This new model, offered by T-Mobile, is designed and priced for consumers ($200; www.t-mobile.com). It offers the same real-time e-mail features but looks more like a conventional phone. A complete alphabet is on just 20 roomy keys. You can watch the bright screen as the smart software deduces the word you're trying to type and finishes it for you.NO STRINGS The thumb-size Air Station 54 Mbps wireless adapter from Buffalo Technology brings Wi-Fi connectivity to PC's and laptops, but with an extra measure of portability: plug it into a U.S.B. port and it installs the necessary drivers and software. No installation CD is needed. Available at buy.com for $61, it is compatible with Windows-based PC's and the 802.11g and 802.11b Wi-Fi standards.WHAT AND WHERE Most electronic maps and travel guides online and on CD's are designed with motorists in mind, not tourists making their way on foot. Fodors has bundled electronic versions of nine of its city guide books with maps designed for walkers. Guidebook listings like restaurants are linked to the maps. The packages, which cost $20 and are available for download from www.fodors.com, can be viewed on most PocketPC and Palm OS hand-held computers.STREET SMARTS Computerphobes need not fear the Garmin 2620 StreetPilot - a Global Positioning System navigator that comes with maps of the United States and parts of Canada loaded on its 2.2-gigabyte microdrive. The device can tell you where you are, map a route to your destination, and issue audible directions as you go. Garmin now offers a $100 rebate on the 2620, which can be found online at prices ranging from $950 to $1,500. ",2004-11-18T05:00:00+0000

The assessment was released in Bangkok at a meeting of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a consortium of private conservation groups and government agencies. The tally of species listed as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable grew by 3,000 since 2000. Some species are pulling back from the brink, the report said, including the Mallorcan midwife toad, above, which was shifted from the critically endangered to vulnerable because several hundred captive-bred tadpoles and toads have been reintroduced to the wild.

Mr. Wilkinson, who is now designing headquarters for Google in the Silicon Valley and for J. Walter Thompson in New York, chose water, a scarce resource that dominates this city's imagination, as a primary theme for the project. He transformed ground-floor spaces with 18-foot ceilings in a 1926 building into varied study and meeting spaces. His design includes the aqueous blue pod, top, for design meetings, and a sort of abstracted waterless ""swimming pool,"" above left, with a giant lampshade adorned with palm trees. The walls are lined with a cactus design fabric by Marimekko. Taking suggestions from the young architects in his office, Mr. Wilkinson designed seating that he thought would appeal to the school's students, including the swimming pool itself, for relaxing; the lounge chairs around it, with computers on movable trays; and the flat Japanese-restaurant-style cushions and low tables, above right.

In most binocams, the camera uses its lens rather than the binoculars' for zeroing in on subjects. That can lead to framing errors. In Bushnell's $600 Instant Replay, the camera is integrated into the binoculars. The camera can also record short low-resolution videos.MULTITASKERThe TotalFit from Bell, the maker of protective helmets and other safety gear and accessories, has a double identity.

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, Stelmar's founder and largest shareholder, led opposition to the $703 million offer, which was rejected by shareholders on Tuesday. Mr. Haji-Ioannou demanded the dismissal of Mr. Molaris and the chief executive, Peter Goodfellow, as a condition of his joining the board to lead a new search for a buyer, Stelmar said yesterday. A panel of four independent directors rejected the demand, and Mr. Molaris subsequently resigned, the company said.

Adam Young, a page for the National Broadcasting Company while in his teens who then went on to co-found Young Broadcasting, Inc., one of the country's 25 largest television station groups. A broadcast pioneer who worked in both radio and television during their formative years, Mr. Young spent his entire professional life in the industry, having begun his career at NBC radio at the age of 17. The oldest of eight children, his income was needed to help support the family. During this time he also served as a page for the grand opening of Radio City Music Hall and was involved in NBC's move to its new Rockefeller Center headquarters. He eventually moved from the position of Head Page, through the Programming Department, and on to the Research and Promotion Department, where he developed a flair for mathematics which he successfully applied throughout his career. At night, Mr. Young managed the New Amsterdam Theater for NBC where many of the popular Big Bands of the era performed for live radio broadcasts. In 1936 he left NBC Radio and went into the advertising industry. Within eight years, he started his own business, Adam Young, Inc., representing radio stations in the United States, Canada and around the world. Eventually, with the development of a new broadcast technology, the focus of the Company shifted from representing radio stations to representing television stations. In 1986, Mr. Young co-founded Young Broadcasting Inc. with his son, Vincent, which began with the purchase of two television stations. Today the NASDAQ - traded company owns and operates 10 television stations across the United States. The Young Broadcasting station group includes ABC, CBS and NBC affiliates, as well as the nation's largest independent station--KRONTV in San Francisco. Mr. Young continued to be fully active in the business, and at the time of his death, he was the Treasurer of Young Broadcasting Inc., and President Emeritus of Adam Young Inc. In recognition of his achievement of starting with nothing and building successful radio and television businesses, Mr. Young received the Horatio Alger Association award in 1957. He was a founder of the Station Representative Association and went on to serve as President of the Association from 1955-1957. He served on the Board of Directors of the Television Bureau of Advertising from 1977-1980, and for many years he headed up its Research Committee. He was a board member of the Radio Advertising Bureau and also served as ViceChairman of the Standards Committee of the International Advertising Association.

us,The Listings; ANIMAL COLLECTIVE,"Over the last few years, the musicians known as Avey Tare, above, and Panda Bear have emerged at the center of a scene that prides itself on not having one. The two are the most prominent members of Animal Collective, a loose-knit group made up of singers and noisemakers who are exploring a joyful -- and joyfully light-headed -- mutant strain of folk music. Earlier this year, Animal Collective released ""Sung Tongs"" (Fat Cat), a marvelous CD full of sing-along songs that sound instantly familiar but tantalizingly unrecognizable. Stray voices float by in the distance, guitarists strum energetic but asymmetrical rhythms, small choruses cohere around repeated phrases you can't quite translate. Every once in a while there's a buried joke: ""College"" is a 53-second song in which wordless harmonies give way to a bit of advice, as the singers intone, ""You don't have to go to college."" The Animal Collective empire is expanding. Panda Bear recently released his second solo album, a hushed elegy for his father called ""Young Prayer"" (Paw Tracks). And last month, the group's Paw Tracks record label released its first non-Animal CD, ""The Doldrums,"" by an oblique California singer-songwriter who calls himself Ariel Pink; he dumps dirt on his bruised and warped 70's-style rock ballads, then dares them to shine anyway. You won't be shocked to learn that Animal Collective's live shows can be enthralling or exasperating, depending upon your mood and theirs. But if everything goes pear-shaped, you can always stop by the merchandise table, grab a handful of CD's, go home and get lost. (Animal Collective: Sunday night at 8, with Gang Gang Dance and Oakley Hall; Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; tickets are $12. Ariel Pink: tomorrow night at 8, with Signer and Greg Davis, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503; tickets are $10.)

In other encounters, in Rye and in nearby Greenwich, Conn., the man did not try to force children into the van, but the police called this latest incident an attempted abduction. The boy, who got away, told the police that the van approached him as he walked along Rye Road in the afternoon, and that a white woman with blond hair was driving. A white man with dark curly hair and yellowed teeth occupied the passenger seat, the boy said. The descriptions matched those of earlier incidents, including ones in Rye on Monday and Tuesday. The man asked the boy if he was lost, offered him a ride and then told him to get into the car. As the boy ran, the man tried to grab his sweatshirt. Lisa W. Foderaro (NYT)",2004-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Working like an unusually ambitious and ingenious architectural illustrator, Mr. Edwards creates expansive, kaleidoscopic fusions of Renaissance perspective, Cubism and Pop that measure as much as 11 1/2 feet across. As in ""Immersion,"" above, layered and intersecting architectural structures, streets and corporate logos spread out across the surface and recede into deep perspectival space. On one level the paintings convey feelings of utopian euphoria: the well-designed world is a supremely efficient machine for living; commodities, information, energy and money flow smoothly from place to place; peace and harmony reign. Behind that luminous scrim of beneficently rationalized order, however, lie shadows of anxiety and terror. Such perfection is a fascist's dream.

Oglethorpe set to work, laying out an unusual town based on an elaborate system of 24 public squares. Today the squares, shaded by live oaks and surrounded by stately houses, churches and the columned houses of government, define old Savannah, where shops and cafes occupy mansions and town houses, and tourists and locals stroll at a leisurely pace. Nearby is Bonaventure cemetery, where John Berendt, author of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" sipped martinis as his friend Mary Harty told tales of the departed. While Savannah's builders carelessly flattened a burial mound holding Tomochichi's ancestors, they set aside ample acreage for the city's own dead, and in those graveyards, beneath long gray beards of Spanish moss, restless spirits are said to walk. Most of Oglethorpe's city has passed on to the ghostly realm, too, but his urban-planning legacy remains: a walkable, bikable, town, one of the loveliest haunts in the South.

Which is where a largely unknown actress named Jennifer Hope Wills steps in. Ms. Wills's previous Broadway experience has been limited to appearing in the ensemble of ""Beauty and the Beast,"" while understudying one of the title roles. (Guess which.) But without being obnoxious about it, she here exudes the natural confidence of a girl whose dance card was filled before she learned to walk. Her optimistic easiness turns out to be the ideal foil for the charmingly arch mannerisms of Ms. Shields's would-be sophisticate, just as Ms. Wills's lithe soprano melds in sweet sororal harmony with the older actress's straightforward alto. When this Eileen sings, ""mmmm . . . I'm a little bit in love,"" with the relaxed contentment of a cat in mid-stretch, it's unlikely that anyone in the audience doesn't feel the same about Ms. Wills.

us,The Listings; MEREDITH MONK,"Meredith Monk has been sidling through New York dance for four decades now. An elusive creature, she has managed not to be categorized as the performer, choreographer, composer or filmmaker that she has been over her rich career. But her roots are in dance, or at least in performance art before it was known as such. No one has ever quite matched the intensity of the hyper-real dreamscapes she created from the mid-1960's on, using film, her own vocal music, movement and plain but shimmeringly evocative props to create pieces that existed on several levels of the everyday. A believer in total theater, Ms. Monk combined her dance group, The House, with a new Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble in 1978. And that seemed to open the floodgates of her prodigious imagination to pour out into film, opera and theatrical productions. Eventually she identified herself as a composer first and foremost. But dance is a persistent lover. If it couldn't have Ms. Monk, it could have her music, which has been a cool, eerie and bizarrely evocative staple of avant-gardish choreography ever since. This weekend, in ""Dance to Monk: Choreographers Celebrate the Music of Meredith Monk,"" six dance artists will pay tribute to Ms. Monk in her 40th anniversary season with new and repertory pieces set to scores that include her ""Dolmen Music,"" ""Volcano Songs"" and ""St. Petersburg Waltz."" They are Ann Carlson, Sean Curran, Molissa Fenley, the now rarely seen Dana Reitz, Doug Varone and Bill T. Jones (on film), all as fiercely individualistic as Ms. Monk.

Half of those with such infections die within 18 months; most of the rest are severely brain-damaged.

The decision came out of a case started by the Haida Indians after the province of British Columbia transferred a logging license covering about 25 percent of the Queen Charlotte Islands to the Weyerhaeuser Company of Federal Way, Wash. Those islands and the water surrounding them have been the focus of a century-old ownership claim by the Haida. Much of Canada's resource activity, like Weyerhaeuser's logging, takes place on land owned by provinces. In its unanimous decision, the court said that only governments, not users like Weyerhaeuser, must consult aboriginal groups. While it did not spell out the nature of those consultations, the court turned down a similar appeal yesterday by another native group in British Columbia opposed to the reopening of a mining road. In that case the court found that making the native group part of an environmental review was enough. Ian Austen (NYT)",2004-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"VERSE, NO CHORUS: Thanks to Brad Pitt and the movie ""Troy,"" Reuters has reported, the best-selling poet in England this fall is Homer. In this country, that honor arguably goes to Billy Corgan, whose first book of poems, ""Blinking With Fists,"" has been bouncing happily around the Times extended list (available on the Web) for several weeks, rising as high as No. 24. People are not buying Billy Corgan's book because they are mistaking him for Billy Collins, the winsome former poet laureate. They are buying ""Blinking With Fists"" because Corgan, who led the influential band Smashing Pumpkins during the 1990's, still has a following -- he can seem like a geeky, gothy, brainiac version of Kurt Cobain. Corgan's free verse is the kind of stuff that, if you're skimming through looking for a line or two to ridicule, won't let you down (""I miss you already / Starting for home / The zombies keeping / All of it for themselves""). But at its best, ""Blinking With Fists"" is vivid and angular and not much worse than many first books of poems that arrive with heady praise from the poetry world's burghers. In ""Lost Gray,"" Corgan writes: ""Stir, the crow cackle / Collar high / The angles black against the sides / Splitting in 2's we swing clubs / Old fog rolls and hugs / Back slappin' / Paying dues for crackjaws."" I'm not sure I know what that means, but it beats the oracular utterances in Jim Morrison's poems. Corgan is at work on his first novel.",2004-11-21T05:00:00+0000

The new three-year contract calls for a reduction in the number of full-time jobs, something the players had strenuously opposed in public, and a salary freeze for the first year. According to a statement by the orchestra, the number of permanent players and librarians will drop from 109 to 103 during the term of the contract, and then bounce back to 106 at the end of it. The orchestra stressed that there would be no reduction of forces on stage for concerts.Minimum weekly salaries will rise to $2,200 by the contract's end, compared with the current level of $2,000, which the orchestra said kept it competitive. The musicians will also be contributing more toward their health benefits and agreed to add more Sunday concerts. The contract is in line with those at other major American orchestras that have settled with musicians in recent weeks; a number have had some sort of wage freeze and higher health care costs for the members. The Chicago Symphony also had a temporary reduction in permanent positions. The Philadelphia contract is retroactive to Sept. 20, when the old pact expired. Negotiations were tense, and Mayor John F. Street stepped in to mediate. A tentative agreement was announced on Nov. 16, and the musicians and management worked out the details before the contract was ratified by the musicians this weekend.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the untimely passing of its beloved friend, the renowned American composer and pianist Cy Coleman, on November 18, 2004 in New York City at the age of 75. Mr. Coleman was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for most of his life. An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ""Witchcraft"", ""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""Big Spender"", ""I've Got Your Number"", and ""Hey, Look Me Over"" to his credit. His Broadway scores included ""Sweet Charity"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Will Rogers Follies"", ""On the Twentieth Century"", ""I Love My Wife"" and ""The Life"", to name but a few. Cy Coleman was always at home at the Steinway, and to hear him play was a real joy and, for us, inspiring. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his generous and jaunty persona will be sorely missed by us all. To Shelby and Lilly Cye, we extend our love and our heartfeld condolences.

The Fellows of the Biotechnology Study Center, NYU School of Medicine, mourn the death on Friday, November 19th of Sir John Vane, D.Phil., FRS in Farnborough, Kent, UK. Sir John, a founding Fellow of our Center, was most recently founding director of the prestigious William Harvey Research Institute in London. He was perhaps the most distinguished pharmacologist of his day (1927-2004), receiving the Nobel Prize in 1982 for his work on prostaglandins. He discovered prostacyclin, a protective factor for blood vessels, and went on to show that aspirin-like drugs inhibit the COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes that form prostaglandins. By explaining how low doses of aspirin prevent clots, strokes and heart attacks, he made aspirin one of the most common drugs used to treat and prevent heart disease. Sir John's work also led to captopril, the first of a widely used family of medicines called ACE inhibitors. His discoveries may have saved more lives than any since the polio vaccine; they have revolutionized the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

We sadly mourn the death of our beloved husband, father and friend, who died on November 21, 2004, at the age of 73 after a long and valiant struggle with cancer. Paul will be remembered as warmhearted, generous and outgoing. He made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed in his presence. Until the latter stages of his illness, he enjoyed life to the fullest. Paul was co-owner of Paul Stuart, The Clothing Company, started by his father, Ralph Ostrove. The original store, which opened in 1938, was named after Paul when he was still a boy. Although Paul was formerly in charge of buying and clothing operations, he was best known as the heart and soul of the store. He had a friendly and unpretentious manner that endeared him to everyone. His customers, a great many of whom became personal friends, will sadly miss being greeted and hugged by ""the sweet guy at the top of the stairs."" He never forgot anyone's name or suit size, a remarkable talent given the multitude of people he knew. He began working at the store while he was in high school and always knew that he would go into the family business. After graduating from Colby College in 1953, Paul was in the Army for two years and then began his lifetime work at Paul Stuart. He was an overseer for Colby College from 1994 to 2003, an active member of the Lymphoma Research Foundation, and a member of the North Shore Country Club in Glen Cove, N.Y. Paul was an avid sportsman who especially loved golf, squash and skiing. He is survived by his beloved and devoted wife Estelle. They were about to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 3 weeks. He is also survived by his loving children and their spouses, Gail and Robert Kantor, who live in New York, Michael, who represents the third generation at Paul Stuart, and Lisa Ostrove, David and Lily Ostrove, who live in California, his eight wonderful grandchildren, Danielle, Jason, Zachary, Drew, Ryan, Daniel, Emma and Sophie, his sister Barbara Grodd, his brotherin-law and business partner of many years, Clifford Grodd, and several nieces and nephews. He will be terribly missed by everone who knew and loved him. He will be in our hearts and memories forever. A funeral service will be held at Frank E. Campbell, 81 St at Madison Ave on Wednesday, November 24th at 9:30AM. In lieu of flowers, donations in Paul's memory may be made to the Lymphoma Reserch Foundation, 111 Broadway, 19th floor, New York, N.Y. 10006.",2004-11-23T05:00:00+0000

A new building with restaurants, restrooms and a check room was designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, below, to lead visitors into the complex, on an island in the Spree River in the former Communist east side of the city. Dropping the project would save the cash-strapped federal government $170 million. The recommendation was rejected by the federal culture minister, Christina Weiss, who said the new entrance building was needed to accommodate visitors. ""Those who question the arrangement of visitor flows on Museum Island prevent the museums from entering the 21st century,"" she said in an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Museum Island, which was built in the 19th century and is famous for its Pergamon Altar from Turkey and the Ishtar Gate from Babylon, was badly damaged during World War II, and restoration began only after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Parliament is to vote on the fate of the entrance building in the next few months. KIRSTEN GRIESHABER",2004-11-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"Arts, Briefly; 'Desperate Housewives' Returns to Top Spot","""Desperate Housewives"" wasn't broadcast on Nov. 14, when ABC showed ""American Music Awards,"" an annual special. But the hit series stayed in the news because of its eyebrow-raising promotion on ""Monday Night Football,"" in which an apparently naked Nicollette Sheridan, below, a star of the show, jumped into the arms of the Philadelphia Eagles receiver Terrell Owens. Back on the air this week, ""Desperate Housewives"" easily won the Sunday night ratings race for ABC (along with ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition""), according to the Nielsen overnight ratings. The network's dominance at 9 p.m. continues to mean weakened ratings for ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent,"" and failure for the WB's ""Mountain"" and Fox's ""My Big Fat Obnoxious Boss."" Also troubling for Fox is the slide of ""Arrested Development"" since its premiere two weeks ago. Though the Emmy-winning show continues to do better than it did last year, on Sunday night it lost a third of the audience of ""The Simpsons,"" which preceded it.

An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ""Witchcraft"", ""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""Big Spender"", ""I've Got Your Number"", and ""Hey, Look Me Over"" to his credit. His Broadway scores included ""Sweet Charity"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Will Rogers Follies"", ""On the Twentieth Century"", ""I Love My Wife"" and ""The Life"", to name but a few.

A team of the more than 60 architects, radiologists, chemists and carpenters worked to restore paintings by Le Brun and Delacroix, sculpture by Thomas Regnaudin, Balthasar Marsy and Franois Girardon, as well as the gallery's vaulted 50-foot ceilings, tapestries, stucco and elaborate gilded woodwork. Begun by Louis XIV in 1661 under the direction of the architect Louis Le Vau, the hall was not completed until 1851. The restoration included a security upgrade for one of the gallery's star attractions, the French crown jewels, among them the Rgent, a 140-carat white diamond. HLNE FOUQUET",2004-11-25T05:00:00+0000

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sorrow the untimely passing of its beloved friend, the renowned American composer and pianist Cy Coleman, on November 18, 2004 in New York City at the age of 75. Mr. Coleman was a deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for most of his life. An accomplished and classically trained pianist who made his Carnegie Hall debut at the age of 7, Cy Coleman's musical journey led him to the world of jazz and, of course, to the Great White Way. He was one of this country's greatest and most honored songwriters, with such immortal standards as ""Witchcraft"", ""The Best is Yet to Come"", ""Big Spender"", ""I've Got Your Number"", and ""Hey, Look Me Over"" to his credit. His Broadway scores included ""Sweet Charity"", ""City of Angels"", ""The Will Rogers Follies"", ""On the Twentieth Century"", ""I Love My Wife"" and ""The Life"", to name but a few. Cy Coleman was always at home at the Steinway, and to hear him play was a real joy and, for us, inspiring. Though our lives have been forever enriched by his music, his generous and jaunty persona will be sorely missed by us all. To Shelby and Lily Cye, we extend our love and our heartfeld condolences.

Next month, United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, will have been under bankruptcy protection for two years. In the court filing, United attributed the move in part to the rise in jet fuel prices, saying it would spend $1 billion more than it expected for fuel in 2004 and $7 billion more than it planned through 2010. United also said it wanted to impose a temporary 4 percent pay cut on its workers, beginning in January. Without the cuts, United said it would be unable to maintain adequate cash, meet the terms of its bankruptcy financing, or become a ""competitive and sustainable"" airline.

Ms. Body, 30, creates one-of-a-kind wallpapers by screen printing images of her own drawings and photographs and finishing each piece with a few strokes of her paintbrush, so that no two will be exactly the same. Her muted color palette gives the wallpapers a vintage feel, but even those with familiar motifs, like butterflies and birds, turn out on closer inspection to include unusual elements. ""From a distance it looks like a traditional pattern, but when you get up close you find lots of little things like spiders hanging from roses,"" she said.",2004-11-25T05:00:00+0000

The house was built for Basil Blackwell, the famous Oxford bookseller, and the only alteration was made by Tolkien, then a professor of English language and literature at Oxford, who removed a wall to open up the study and drawing room where he wrote. The building's new status guarantees that any further alterations will be subject to permission from government planning bodies.

Current indie-rock owes a lot to Pavement, a band from Stockton, Calif., whose songs sound perpetually unfinished. Stephen Malkmus's vocals are bleary, tempos fluctuate, instrumental lines dangle like loose threads. Yet the songs on ""Crooked Rain Crooked Rain,"" originally released in 1994, are just right, pondering music and celebrity, friendship and sex, hipness and heart. Its ramshackle structures are fully thought out, spiking melodic California rock with punk's messiness. ""Crooked Rain Crooked Rain"" was acutely self-conscious, looking over its shoulder at a more polished album by a far more popular California band, the Eagles' ""Hotel California,"" but it also sounds unguarded in all its mixed emotions. The reissue is a double album that adds B-sides from singles, stray album tracks and a second CD of unreleased material that's surprisingly strong: rough demo versions and stray songs from 1993 and a live 1994 BBC performance that proclaimed, ""Gettin' cooler but I'm out of of the loop.""

Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, the Vega String Quartet (above) performs two of the loveliest works of the chamber music literature: Beethoven's Quartet Opus 132, with its famously breathtaking slow movement, and Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, a sublime conversation among strings and solo clarinet (played by Ethan Sloane). The locally based Vega Quartet has roots in China, where three of the four players attended the Shanghai Conservatory. Advanced reports suggest a promising young ensemble prepared to give vigorous performances. The group's two concerts are prefaced with a recital tonight by a switch-hitting string player (violin and viola) and college freshman named David Aaron Carpenter.

Little Darlin' was the small Nashville label that gave the world Johnny Paycheck, through a series of phenomenally good singles and albums in the 1960's; there are still some surprises in its vaults. Most of this Christmas CD features the singer Bobby Helms (famous for his late-50's hit ""Fraulein""), working tepidly through standards like ""Silver Bells"" with good hard-country arrangements. But Paycheck's four tracks at the end, recorded in the 60's for a Christmas album that never panned out, are the pearls. In his songs about women and alcohol, Paycheck traded on a passive-aggressive mixture of contempt and shame; incredibly, he extends the same emotions to Christmas. ""If it's not too much trouble/please hurry home on the double/we prayed the same prayer the last 24 days,"" he sings in one song, while the steel guitars weep.

Her current single is ""My Prerogative,"" produced by Bloodshy & Avant (who also produced ""Toxic""): while tabla drums flutter around her, Ms. Spears reduces the two-note chorus to a flat -- and very effective -- snarl.

us,The Listings; 'RAGHUBIR SINGH: RETROSPECTIVE',"The photographer Raghubir Singh (1942-1999) spent as much time in London, Paris and New York as he did in his native India. But India kept pulling him back: it was the primary subject of his extraordinary photographs, 45 of which from the 1960's through the 1990's make up this mini-retrospective. Although his early model was another great photographer of India, Henri Cartier-Bresson, whom he met in 1966, Singh struck out in his own direction by using color photography, disparaged at the time, rather than black and white. More than a dozen books followed, each focused on different parts of urban and rural India; the images in this show are drawn from them. The documentary-style vision that emerges is neither sugarcoated, nor abject, nor controllingly omniscient. As in ""Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu,"" above, India is seen from behind heads in a crowd, through reflections in car windows or pools of monsoon rain. People notice the camera and move on; they are in the middle of life, in a vast country that is, like every country, constantly changing and resisting change. If images of ultramodern corporate India are missing they would surely have found their way eventually into Singh's panoramic India picture: a cultural portrait in which unsentimental realism is a form of love.

His father, Keith Browning, a vice president for sales at the Copeland Corporation, a manufacturer of refrigerator compressors and air-conditioning units in Dayton, Ohio, had paid more than $50,000 for the privilege of fishing on the trout-filled waters controlled by the Spring Ridge Club, probably the country's most exclusive fishing club.",2004-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Greatest Hits, Reissues And Compilations; In a Wide Holiday Groove, From Sinatra to a Remixed 'Messiah'","GEORGE STRAIT, ""50 NUMBER ONES"" -- (MCA Nashville). This enthralling collection brings together 22 years worth of hits by Mr. Strait, along with a new song, ""I Hate Everything,"" which hit No. 1 on Billboard's country charts this fall. Over the years, Mr. Strait's producers made small changes to reflect the times (lots of reverb on the drums in the 1980's, for example), but Mr. Strait's own warm, slightly melancholy style barely changed, whether he was cracking gentle jokes about former lovers (""All My Ex's Live in Texas,"" 1987) or telling a mournful love story (""I Can Still Make Cheyenne,"" 1996). Mr. Strait often adds a subtle quaver or pause, echoing the emotions in the lyrics without quite acting them out -- this restraint, this disinclination to become a character, helps explain why he has lasted so long. Only one complaint: it seems the record company edited some of these songs to make them fit; that's no way treat a 51-hit wonder. KELEFA SANNEH",2004-11-26T05:00:00+0000
us,In Phoenix,"PHOENIX is finally rising. For years, the city sulked in the shadow of sexier 'burbs like Scottsdale, but now it's enjoying a culture boom -- with a young, raw arts scene, well-cooked food and world-class spas. Despite the rumor that ""it's a dry heat,"" the weather is generally pleasant from October to April, and yes, it does rain. If so, ditch the outdoor activities and head to the Heard Museum where, for $7 admission, you can see an expansive collection of Indian art. (The museum shop is also the best place in town to buy gifts.) With a citywide light-rail system still years away, you'll need to rent a car to get around, but Phoenix is built on a grid, so even a first-time visitor won't have trouble navigating.

The Notekillers were a squally, no-vocals band from Philadelphia whose discography consisted solely of a single from 1980. Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, an early fan, arranged this CD retrospective, and it's astonishing. Full of unreleased recordings (otherwise it would be very short indeed), the disc captures the trio making a racket that's ferocious yet surprisingly sprightly. While the rhythm section churns furiously, David First peels off a series of scrambled guitar lines, precise even when he's improvising. His diagonal riffs are marvelously untraceable (Surf-rock? New-wave? Heavy metal? Free jazz? Serialism?), and somehow these dense compositions inevitably come out sounding like party music.

And speaking of democracy, it's probably not necessary to look to the theater these days for angry white guys, but if you didn't get enough of them over the past, oh, 18 months or so, there are a dozen tearing up the stage at the American Airlines Theater these days. Indeed, the carefully contained ire parceled out in neat portions in ""Twelve Angry Men"" is oddly comforting after all the free-floating white-guy angst of recent months. It's actually soothing to watch the waves of aggression build and subside in Jury Room 2A (above from left, Kevin Geer, Tom Aldredge, Mark Blum, Peter Friedman and Boyd Gaines).

Arthur Russell, who died in 1992, was an introverted cellist in love with outgoing pop music; in the late 70's and early 80's, he created ferociously imaginative disco singles like ""Kiss Me Again"" and ""Go Bang,"" and they are what his reputation largely rests on. But he put more of himself into the music, which eventually became an obscure LP called ""World of Echo."" Like Joo Gilberto, he wanted to create a music that was so quiet and intimate it constructed its own highly sensitized fantasy world. Using bits of written melody and long rhythmic improvisations for his soft crooning, accompanied by his own percussively played, fuzzed-up and echoed-out cello, he made something deeply mysterious, original and beautiful. The reissue of the album comes with extra unreleased tracks, as well as a DVD containing films of Russell performing a few of its pieces. BEN RATLIFF",2004-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings; MOE,"Even before Phish played its final concerts in August, Moe was eagerly positioning itself as a successor for the position of America's top jam band. That means an endless tour, though Moe is taking a month off the road after its two shows this weekend at Roseland. Formed in 1990 in Buffalo, Moe has been performing nationwide since the mid-1990's, playing long, freewheeling jams on songs that look back to the Band and the Allman Brothers and over their shoulders at the Dave Matthews Band. Moe had its moment on a major label, Sony, announcing itself with a 1996 single, ""Meat,"" that ran more than 46 minutes. But jam bands tend to focus on performing rather than making radio hits and selling huge numbers of albums, and Moe has since returned to an independent label, its own Fatboy. Moe has the typical strengths and weaknesses of jam bands. It's long on vamps and short on songs, with adequate vocals that are quickly overshadowed by nimble, exuberant instrumentals. Moe's gift is spinning plentiful music from a minimum of material. The pleasure of its songs has far less to do with their two-chord foundations than with the constant flux of the jams they lead to, with two-guitar dialogues and a beat that can evolve from a countryish bounce to driving Southern rock to gospel to funk. ""Just do the things that come to you/ And you""ll always be true,"" the band sings in ""Blue Eyed Son,"" and that's just what happens with Moe onstage. (Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224; tickets are $27.50.) JON PARELES",2004-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"Greatest Hits, Reissues And Compilations; In a Wide Holiday Groove, From Sinatra to a Remixed 'Messiah'","""SACRED STEEL INSTRUMENTALS"" -- (Arhoolie). Before Robert Randolph became a regular on the jam-band circuit, the folklorists of Arhoolie Records went to churches to find performers in the tradition called sacred steel, which makes steel guitar the lead instrument in gospel songs. The sliding notes of lap steel and pedal steel guitars can sound like trombones, singers, bells or birdcalls as they make notes wriggle and chords hover in the air. As church music, sacred steel performances often include singers praising the Lord. But ""Sacred Steel Instrumentals,"" which sifts through Arhoolie's catalog, leaves the proselytizing to the strings. It's rangy and eloquent music, and players like Sonny Treadway, the Campbell Brothers, Aubrey Ghent and Mr. Randolph turn familiar songs -- ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee,"" ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" -- and lesser-known ones into jaunty performances that go skidding and whooping toward an affirmation of faith.

The alleged leader of the coup's advance military team, the South African mercenary Nick du Toit, received a 34-year prison sentence; other accused foreign mercenaries were sentenced to between 14 and 24 years in jail. Observers said the absence of death sentences may have been intended to help Equatorial Guinea in its bid to extradite Mark Thatcher, the son of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who is accused of helping finance the plot. Mr. Thatcher has denied the charge; whether South Africa, which opposes the death penalty, will turn him over to Guinea authorities is unclear. Michael Wines (NYT)",2004-11-27T05:00:00+0000

That's the approach the New York City Opera is taking when it travels to Tokyo and Nagoya in May as part of the American cultural program at the 2005 World Exposition. On the bill is something Japanese, or close to it: ""Madama Butterfly,"" Puccini's tragic love story about an American naval officer and a former geisha. Although popular in Japan, ""Butterfly,"" whose Asianisms were largely a figment of Puccini's imagination, is an opera that American companies often shy away from performing there, said Matthew Price, an executive assistant to the company's artistic director, Paul Kellogg. The conductor will be Atsushi Yamada, a businessman turned musician who is the first Japanese conductor to perform with the company. Audiences looking for a traditionally Western grand operatic spectacle won't find it in Mark Lamos's pared-down production, which has aqua-toned stairs and translucent shoji screens framing the stage and a fleet of naval ships suspended in the air.

The number of unemployed people searching for jobs in the six metropolitan areas surveyed fell 4.1 percent, to 2.3 million, in part because of steep drops in the jobless rate in cities like Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo. But real wages, which are adjusted for inflation, also fell in October from the previous month, slipping 1.2 percent to an average of 900.20 reais, or about $328.50 a month.

us,Lunch Box Outside the Box,"From the moment a child is born -- and sometimes for months before -- the things start to accumulate. Shortly thereafter the things begin to break, or to wear down, or to grate on the nerves, or to require new batteries of nonstandard size. So much of the gear children require seems designed to frustrate. Why can't a car seat be installed without a 45-minute consultation with an instruction booklet? Why do the seams of a lunch box resist cleaning? Why can't a school notebook be both durable and light? When well-designed items come to market, they are swept off the shelves; such is the hunger for something that works. The BabyBjorn carrier, for example, an elegant, simply-stitched, cotton contrivance, revolutionized the way parents travel with their children, combining mobility with cuddling. A smaller version of JanSport's hugely popular backpack gave children a sense of independence and parents a free hand. It ought to be simple, so we asked a number of award-winning industrial, architectural and product designers to fix some of childhood's design flaws.

Benasillo, the president of Studio D, a company in New York that designs and manufactures logos and signs for retail stores, had just attended a talk by McKee, a partner at the Geppetto Group, a New York marketing firm. McKee had discussed the appeal of fictional characters like Harry Potter and, more broadly, how kid culture had saturated consumer society to the extent that it was becoming the central creative marketing force of our era. This is indeed what McKee usually talks about. He says things like ""The lifestyle of kids for the first time in history is something we study."" Or ""Kid culture has become the most intriguing kind of culture around."" In conversation, he tends to pile up the ideas before you, drawing on children's music or comics or (most often) the films of Pixar -- ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles"" -- as examples of the intermingling of kid and adult cultures, a phenomenon that to him suggests children are becoming far more sophisticated about products and entertainment at the same time as adults (he calls them kidults) are increasingly reveling in youth-based content. ""Is it just that the kids want to be older,"" McKee asks, ""or is it that adults want to stay younger longer?""

us,Inside the List,"WOLFE HUNT: Tom Wolfe's new novel, ""I Am Charlotte Simmons,"" enters the fiction list this week at No. 3. It had to run a gantlet to get there; critics have blasted away as if the book were a varmint on literature's manicured front lawn. Wolfe, who is 74, says he is taking his reviews in stride. ""When you're my age, there's two ways to find out if you're still alive,"" he told The Boston Globe. ""One is to feel your pulse. The other is to see if you're having a fight with somebody."" Nearly all of Wolfe's 13 books have made the Times list, beginning with ""The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,"" which had a two-week ride in 1965. (Of his two previous novels, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities,"" published in 1987, made the list for 56 weeks, and ""A Man in Full,"" published in 1998, hung on for 19.) Wolfe may be taking some consolation in the fact that his occasional antagonist, John Updike, did not make the fiction list this fall with ""Villages,"" his elegiac 21st novel. Updike's fiction was once a regular presence on the Times list. Of his first 14 novels, only one -- ""Of the Farm"" (1965) -- did not land on this page. Since 1992, however, Updike has published seven novels and only one of them, ""In the Beauty of the Lilies"" (1996), made an appearance here.",2004-11-28T05:00:00+0000

LaJean Avery was born in Aberdeen, South Dakota, on July 23, 1923, and raised in Huron, South Dakota. After attending Carleton College, she worked for the State Department in Athens, Greece, as part of the postWorld War II Marshall Plan reconstruction of Europe. Jack Clark was born in Springfield, Massachusetts on January 18, 1925. After undergraduate work at Yale University and graduate work at Harvard, he went to work for the Greek government in Athens, where he met and married LaJean. Upon returning to the United States, the Clarks lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, Bethesda, Maryland and La Paz, Bolivia, while Jack worked for the International Monetary Fund. In 1964 he joined First National City Bank (now Citigroup) and the family moved to New Canaan, Connecticut. Jack spent 26 years at Citigroup, working in international finance and retiring as an Executive Vice President. LaJean earned her Masters in Special Education from Fairfield University and returned to work teaching special education and directing the special education department at the New Canaan High School for over a decade. Jack retired in 1990 and LaJean in 1991. During the last 14 years of their lives they spent a great deal of time with their children and grandchildren, traveling extensively around the country and the world, and enjoying gardening, swimming, birdwatching, fine dining, and other activities at their house in New Canaan.

us,'All in the Dances',"IN 1987 I WENT TO LINCOLN CENTER TO WATCH New York City Ballet dance Concerto Barocco, a ballet by George Balanchine set to Bach's Two-Violin Concerto. I knew the music well, having played one of the solo parts in high school, but except for an isolated Nutcracker seen on a college trip to New York, Barocco (as dancers and regular balletgoers call it) was my first Balanchine ballet. Indeed, I hadn't seen very many ballets of any kind, nor was I much impressed with the ones I had seen. So far as I could tell, they consisted for the most part of thin women in white skirts pretending to be birds, fluttering through elaborately costumed pantomime shows whose quaint plots were too silly to take seriously. I didn't know a lot about Balanchine, but I'd just seen a TV documentary about him that led me to believe that his dances were different, so I decided to give Concerto Barocco a try, in much the same spirit of adventure that might have led another person to go to the Museum of Modern Art, or to a jazz club.

But no one would say that he looks, at first glance, like the next Ken Griffey Jr. or Roger Clemens. At 14, Tommy is 5-foot-6 and about 145 pounds. He is still a little soft-looking in the way that many mid-teenage boys are, but his hard work in the weight room has started to build muscle definition, and his mother has changed her way of cooking -- more lean meats and chicken, less starch and fat -- to complement his physical training. He is just an average runner at present, but a more supple body might help make him faster. One thing Tommy has no control over, of course, is his eventual height, but everyone with an interest in his baseball career is eagerly anticipating a pretty good growth spurt, and with some good reason, since his father is 6-foot-2. ""You can't put your finger on how big a kid's going to get,"" said Tommy's coach, Ken Bolek, ""but if he gets as big as his father, I think we'll all be very happy.""",2004-11-28T05:00:00+0000

But what about the 45 million or so other people, on average, who were watching television? Here's another way of looking at the ratings for that week: instead of ranking the broadcast networks, we've ranked the media conglomerates that own them -- and nearly every other outlet on your TiVo grid. The easy winner, predictably, was Viacom, owner of CBS and UPN as well as the MTV cable networks. But other high finishers, like Time Warner and Liberty Media, may be names that television viewers don't normally think of while cruising channels. (For each company, we added up the average viewers for all of the networks and cable channels in which it has a controlling interest; joint ventures were divided evenly among the owners. Only networks whose numbers are made public by Nielsen Media Research, and which met the company's minimum reporting standards, were included.) MIKE HALE",2004-11-28T05:00:00+0000

""Gadar"" tells the story of an Indian Sikh who, to save his kidnapped wife, rampages through Pakistan, leaving the dead bodies of more than a hundred Muslim bad guys in his wake. Since then, a wave of hyperviolent films, often with anti-Pakistani and anti-Muslim themes, have hit Indian cinemas.

In his masterly reworking of this powerful myth, Hillerman creates a kachina for contemporary times -- a hermit who lives in a cave at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and dispenses diamonds (""the symbol of greed,"" according to one wary recipient) that can corrupt anyone who mistakes their cold glitter for true light.",2004-11-28T05:00:00+0000

It is a mind as religious as it is literary -- perhaps more religious than literary -- in which silence is itself a quality, and in which the space around words may be full of noises. A remarkable, deeply unfashionable book of essays, ''The Death of Adam'' (1998), in which Robinson passionately defended John Calvin and American Puritanism, among other topics, suggested that, far from suffering writer's block, Robinson was exploring thinker's flow: she was moving at her own speed, returning repeatedly to theological questions and using the essay to hold certain goods that, for one reason or another, had not yet found domicile in fictional form.

Designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership, the center includes a 1,900-seat theater for opera, theater and dance and was constructed using local materials, like recycled slate and hardwood; its texture and unusual shape have given it the nickname the Armadillo. Opening events involved appearances by a roster of international artists, many of Welsh origin, including the operatic star Bryn Terfel, the crossover singers Charlotte Church and Michael Ball, as well as tributes to the singers Shirley Bassey and Gwyneth Jones and the actors Sian Phillips and Richard Burton.

The prize, to be awarded on Wednesday, recognizes work in anthropology, philosophy, history and the study of religion, for which there are no Nobel prizes. Mr. Pelikan, 80, was the Sterling Professor of History at Yale, the highest academic honor there. His most acclaimed work, ""The Christian Tradition: A History and Development of Doctrine,"" helped to integrate the story of the Eastern Christian tradition into the overall history of Christianity. Mr. Ricoeur, 91, held the chair of general philosophy at the Sorbonne during the 1960's and the chair of the divinity school at the University of Chicago through the 80's. His works, including ""Finitude and Culpability,"" ""Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation"" and ""Time and Narrative,"" contributed to the development of hermeneutics, the study of the interpretation of texts. The winners were selected by a five-member panel of scholars and will share the money. The award was conceived by James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, and financed by the philanthropist John W. Kluge, who gave the library $73 million in 2000 for library projects, including the prizes and a new scholar center.

I.B.M. and Sybase, long competitors in the corporate database market, will jointly market and support Sybase's program, focusing initially on sales to financial institutions where Sybase already has a stronghold. The agreement is unusual for Sybase because it represents the first time the company has struck a partnership for its Linux database with any company other than Sun. For I.B.M. it is significant because I.B.M.'s own relational database software, DB2, is a direct competitor to the Sybase program.

The unit will enter into licensing agreements with makers of games and films, offering downloads to BT's high-speed Internet customers, the London-based company said yesterday. BT, Britain's largest phone company, joins Royal KPN of the Netherlands in offering television on the Web. Phone companies are seeking new sources of sales as their fixed-line businesses shrink. TeliaSonera, based in Stockholm, has said it plans to start the service this year. BT's chief executive, Ben Verwaayen, speaking at a Financial Times conference in London yesterday, said the benefits of beaming live television using the company's network were ""hard to understand,"" costing billions of pounds a year. Offering stored downloads -- a so-called on-demand service -- was more economical, he said. BT's entertainment business, which will start on Jan. 1, will be led by Andrew Burke, currently director of value-added services at BT Retail.
