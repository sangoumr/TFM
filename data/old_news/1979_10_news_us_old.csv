us,Screen: Pal Gabor's 'Angi Vera' From Hungary:Life for the Party,"ONE of the quiet highlights of this year's New York Film Festival is ""Angi Vera,"" a Hungarian film with a sharp sense of purpose and a wealth of vivid, revealing details. The year is 1948, and the setting is a political re-education camp, to which a special selection of workers has been sent for several months' training. The title character  Vera is her first name and Angi her last  has been selected for this training because, while working as a nurse, she had the courage to complain publicly about problems in her hospital. Officials of the Party, far from chastising her for this outburst, have chosen to welcome, even exploit, certain kinds of candor.Life at the camp, which is beautifully detailed by the director, Pal Gabor, is strictly regulated. But only part of that is the Party overseers' doing. The workers, who pretend to a certain merriment, have a more inhibiting effect on one another than outsiders possibly could. Some of this grows out of cowardice, or envy, but the bulk of it seems a byproduct of confusion  the Party is new to Hungary, and people still aren't sure what is required, beyond a certain basic humility. At a group meeting, at which each worker submits to criticism from Party officials, one woman is asked, ""You are too passive  why?"" ""I never know whether what I say is correct or incorrect,"" she says, with obvious embarrassment.Vera, who is played by a frail, mournfully beautiful actress named Veronika Papp, enters this environment fairly innocently. And in the same spirit, she falls in love with her teacher, a married man. But the film charts her discovery that such displays of humanity are unwelcome among comrades, and that renouncing such feelings can be an effective way of currying favor  more effective, even, than not straying from the Party's behavior code at all. After closely observing the self-contradictory attitudes of the other women, and after realizing that modest defiance can amount to obedience, Vera learns a terrible lesson all too well.Mr. Gabor presents this with a delicacy that is astonishing at times, never more so than in a sequence that shows the workers having a modest celebration. There is dancing to music from a hand-cranked Victrola, and everyone gets an apple. A chorus sings, and beer is circulated very cautiously. The highlights of the evening are a couple of contests. In one, the men run past a flask of liquor, and every now and then someone is allowed to take a swig. In another, couples dance forehead-to-forehead, each pair trying to hold up a Ping-Pong ball.Vera and her teacher have their first tryst here and make the most of it, rolling the ball across their faces with an abandon that is, on closer examination, as controlled as the festivities themselves. Although much of Vera's transformation is deduced by the camera rather than demonstrated, this one episode is a subtle, especially well-realized intimation of the ways, both political and sexual, in which she will soon be seduced.""Angi Vera"" will be shown at 6:15 tonight and at 9:30 P.M. on Wednesday.",1979-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Nosferatu,' Herzog's Dracula:Nip on the Nape","IN the filmography of Werner Herzog, that talented West German film maker, ""Nosferatu, the Vampyre"" looks to be a kind of charming diversion. That's not meant to underrate the movie but to acknowledge that it's something less than the voyage of self-discovery that each of Mr. Herzog's earlier, very original films has been, including ""Kasper Hauser,"" ""Heart of Glass,"" ""Stroszek"" and ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God.""Here is an almost gentle evocation of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent-film classic, ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror,"" which was, of course, based on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel, ""Dracula."" The new production is also Mr. Herzog's attempt to strip away some of the sensationalism that has been attached to the Dracula story over the years by those vividly grotesque Hammer films from England (which I've always liked), as well as the camp attitudes manifest in Frank Langella's ""Dracula"" productions, on stage and screen, and especially in something like the facetiously titled ""Love at First Bite.""Mr. Herzog has done what he set out to do, but when you come right down to it, one wonders if it's worth the trouble. Dracula, after all, is not Hamlet or Othello or Macbeth. He's not some profoundly complex character who speaks to us in more voices than most of us care to hear. Dracula is Santa Claus turned mean. He's a fairy-tale character. Though he represents something vestigially scary, he's not endlessly interesting.Having expressed these reservations, I must go on to report that Mr. Herzog's film seems well worth the effort to me. It's funny without being silly, eerie without being foolish and uncommonly beautiful in a way that has nothing to do with mere prettiness.His principal actors  Klaus Kinski as Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as the incredibly pure Lucy whose throat Dracula dreams of and Bruno Ganz, as Lucy's unfortunate husband  often employ the exaggerated gestures of silent films, though the purpose is not to make fun of sentiment but to recall a world of mythical innocence. There's a marvelous moment in the movie when Lucy, seeing the lunatic wreck her husband has become after a trip to Transylvania, goes into a faint that's both comic and touching. The point is that evil of the enormity of Dracula's can exist only in a world where ladies still seriously swoon. When such sensitivity is lost, evil is rendered impotent.Mr. Herzog and Mr. Kinski are somewhat less successful, I think, in their attempts to make moving for us Dracula's loneliness and longing for love. Mr. Kinski is a fascinating figure on screen, but his makeup is so heavy that it seems to remove the actor from his performance as effectively as if he were hiding behind a Greek mask. The makeup itself, however, is part of the entertainment and recalls that worn by Max Schreck in the Murnau film  dead-white face, bald, pointed head, two batlike fangs in the middle of his mouth, deformed, ratlike ears and fingernails that look like bat claws.Yet the film's penultimate sequence is as beautiful and erotic and peculiarly human as anything you've ever seen in a ""Dracula"" film: the virtuous Lucy offers herself to Dracula in order to destroy him. She lies on her bed, strewn with flower petals, serene in her sacrifice, as Dracula drinks. To make sure that he stays until the sun is well up, Lucy insists that he have some more. Dracula hesitates, then obliges, though it's clear he is quite full. It's as if he were being polite to a favorite hostess.Mr. Herzog works some odd variations on the sort of Dracula movies most of us are familiar with. The usually astute Dr. Van Helsing, the vampire specialist, is a foolish old fellow who refuses to think ""the unthinkable."" ""We'll investigate this scientifically,"" he says with maddening self-assurance while pretty ladies are being found dead by the dozens, each with a small, unexplained puncture mark on the neck. This Van Helsing actually is a blood brother in ignorance to the doctor in Mr. Herzog's other new film, ""Woyzeck.""""Nosferatu"" was shot mostly in the ancient Dutch city of Delft, which gives it the look of timeless legend except when you see the television aerials on the roofs of the buildings surrounding the city's magnificent old square. The city's fathers were not, apparently, very helpful to the film maker, though they did put up with thousands of more rats (who appear in the picture) than you or I would.As he always does, Mr. Herzog makes fine use of his musical score, especially in the extended sequence showing us the unlucky Jonathan making his perilous journey to Transylvania. As Jonathan crosses mountains so high they have no peaks and valleys that are beyond measurable depth, the film, largely through the use of music, achieves a kind of crazy grandeur singular in such movies. Another big virtue is Miss Adjani's startlingly perfect beauty, which is as unreal as the fellow who pursues her.""Nosferatu"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center at 9:30 P.M. today and on Wednesday at 6:15 P.M.

us,"Screen: James's 'The Europeans,' at Film Festival:In Victoria's Time","THOSE were the days  when manners were as fixed as incomes, when a stroll around a perfectly manicured lawn might be as fraught with adventure as a journey over the Aips, and when a glance, untimely exchanged over teacups, could wreck a carefully planned matrimonial liance as effectively as a fatal fever.Well-bred Boston gentlemen, who had been at Harvard, might work at the law. If a gentleman was in trade, he wasn't expected to leave evidences of it around the house, unless they were objets d'art brought back from China. Ladies sewed, played the piano and dipped into a collection of sermons or, to keep abreast of things, a volume of Mr. Emerson's essays. When one spoke of ""making love,"" as one often did, one spoke of the kind of delicate court a gentleman paid a lady in full view of approving society.These things certainly account for much of the charm still held for us by ""The Europeans,"" Henry James's third novel, published in 1878, and one of his most effortlessly masterful, about the tumult caused in the Wentworth household when there appear in their midst two not-quite-forgotten, totally alien, European cousins.The cousins are the formidable, bewitching but not beautiful Eugenia, Baroness Munster, the morganic wife of a German princeling who now wants to ditch her, and Felix, her debonair younger brother, who's a second-rate artist but a first-rate fellow. Eugenia and Felix are the remains of a marriage contracted abroad by Mr. Wentworth's half-sister who, it's explained in the manner of scandal, many years before ""turned Roman Catholic and then went to live in Europe.""Eugenia, with Felix as her escort, has journeyed to the New World, as her ancestors did two centuries before, to seek her fortune and freedom from a very specific European tyranny.The 19th-century manners recalled by ""The Europeans,"" with its confrontation between old and new cultures, are charming and funny, but the novel is illuminated  and made important  by the beauty and precision of James's prose that persuades us his characters are as alive today as they were in 1878. There's nothing quaint or picturesque or foolish about them. They are battlers.This is the feeling that's missing from the otherwise remarkably intelligent, careful screen version of ""The Europeans"" that has been adapted with skill by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and directed with affection by James Ivory, whose earlier collaborations include ""Shakespeare Wallah,"" ""The Guru"" and ""Roseland."" Their new film will be screened at the New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center today at 9:30 P.M. and next Sunday at 4:30 P.M. The film begins its regular commercial run here at the Paris Theater next Monday.The achievement of Mr. Ivory and Mrs. Jhabvala is their preservation of so much James, so purely, in what's thought to be a hostile medium. Though the performances range from excellent to barely tolerable, we always hear Henry James even when we don't see him, and when we don't see him it's because of discreet concessions that have been made to the enemy.""The Europeans"" isn't simply pretty, it's so relentlessly pretty it becomes almost boring to watch. Photographed in New England in autumn, it's the sort of riot of colors I associate with those gigantic Kodak photomurals in Grand Central Terminal. You've never seen so many blazing scarlets, golds, yellows and burnt sienas. One makes allowances for the fact that the film makers were forced to work in the autumn, instead of the green, dozy days of summer that, in the novel, counterpoint the action, those polite but deadly serious campaigns of the heart. Yet so much prettiness eventually works against the characters, the actors and the movie. James was not a landscape artist.The cast is also a mixed bag. Lee Remick, a very good actress and an enchantingly pretty one, has a firm jaw that can stiffen perceptibly but she lacks the hints of steel, authority, selfishness and foreignness that set Eugenia apart from her Boston cousins. She might more believably have come up to visit from New Haven. Robin Ellis, as the most worldly member of the Wentworth circle, a rich businessman who has been to China and the man for whom Eugenia sets her cap, moves and speaks with the proper skepticism but his personality has a way of fading into the landscape as soon as he leaves the screen.Much more successful are the performances of Tim Woodward as Eugenia's free-wheeling, exuberantly good-natured brother, Felix, and Lisa Eichhorn (""Yanks"") as the more plain but more sweetly unconventional of the two Wentworth sisters whom Felix woos. They make a delightful couple. Wesley Addy is splendid as the patriarch of the Wentworth clan, as is Helen Stenborg as the resignedly invalid mother of the fellow Eugenia means to marry.It may not be fair to comment on other performances that don't seem to work as well. I've a suspicion that the way in which Mrs. Jhabvala has constructed some of the scenes and the manner in which Mr. Ivory has framed them sometimes undercuts what the actors are doing. The novel is composed of dozens of short scenes that one reads one after another even though they describe simultaneous action, a problem the script attempts to rectify by the kind of cross-cutting one sees in a chase sequence. Instead of creating a single impression, they form a series of tiny anticlimaxes.In scenes involving a number of characters, Mr. Ivory frequently directs our attention with close-ups of individuals, making it impossible for us to enjoy the interplay that is one of the delights of this kind of fiction. Those of us who enjoy James as well as films are old enough to make up our minds about where we want to look.This may well be nit-picking, considering how little James we ever see on the screen. One delights in the film's language, as when Mr. Wentworth says, with extreme gravity, of Felix's wish to paint his portrait, ""You see more in a man's face than I should think of looking for."" In the same way, some of us in the audience search for more in the images of ""The Europeans"" than others will ever miss.",1979-10-02T05:00:00+0000

He was born in Sicily and educated by carpenters, and later went to Milan to study art and work as a cabinetmaker. Now Pino Pedano is having his first show outside Europe. His craft ineludes the lamination, collage and assembly of wood, including French pine, cypress, pitch pine, olive, ebony, rosewood, sandalwood and Douglas fir from the United States, Africa, Finland, France, Japan and Brazil. He thinks of his work more of a research into space than in form. Starting with a small sphere, he moved on to the pyramid, then the beehiveshape, then the flat panel and then the egg.

Once he had the idea, the execution was relatively easy because hardware for this shape fence was already manufactured for Cyclone fences that are topped with barbed wire.

us,Film: Moliere Biography,"THE first image of ""Molire,"" Ariane Mnouchkine's very long French movie about the life and times of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin (1622-73), the dramatist known as Molire, is that of a tired serving woman making her way down a dim corridor. The image turns into what is virtually a sequence, which is the habit of this film that stretches things out without creating tension. The woman comes out of the corridor, crosses the empty arena of the theater and goes up a few steps. Then she walks down another dim corridor. The camera follows her expectantly, as if awaiting some revelation from a silent sigh or an imperceptible limp. It waits. We wait. Nothing. It just goes on.And on.And on.This is terrible way to begin a movie you know is to be 4 hours and 15 minutes long. If it's this empty when, so to speak, it's full, what's it going to be like by the time we reach the end? It's not giving away anything except a warning to reveal that it actually gets not only more boring, but even emptier.One of Miss Mnouchkine's other singular achievements is that she has managed to make such a gargantuan film without stumbling on one original or arresting scene. There's even very little biographical material of interest, and some of what it does contain is open to question. Was the Armande Bjart whom Molire married the younger sister of Madeleine Bjart, Molire's long-time mistress, as I'd always understood, or Madeleine's daughter, as the movie says? I'm asking, but I'm not really that interested.Miss Mnouchkine, who wrote and directed ""Molire,"" her first solo credit, is known in Paris as a theater director. It shows. ""Molire"" is full of the sort of theatrical clichs associated with the once-thought radical theater of improvisation of the 60's. The movie, which covers Molire's life from age 10 until his death, means also to give us a picture of French life in cinematic methods that are sometimes Realistic, sometimes Impressionistic in the manner of failed Fellini.Molire himself, played by Philippe Caubre, remains an impassive figure, taking in, as we do, Miss Mnouchkine's endless succession of tableaux, especially processions and revelries in which the poor people of France always seem to have access to extraordinarily sophisticated costumes, including what look to be pressed plastic masks that the director is especially enamored of. The crowd scenes won't stop, but they don't contain people, only actors busily trying to imitate people by being too jolly or too outraged, or by clutching one another, like extras in an opera.In all of this we are given surprisingly little information about the 17th-century French theater. There seems to be more Corneille recited on stage than Molire, the intention apparently being to send up poor old Corneille. When Molire settles down to his acclaim and censorship problems in Paris, the movie breezes by his greatest plays with a montage of printed titles.History is represented by brief appearances by Louis XIV, Colbert and a speechless Richelieu. Miss Mnouchkine appears to have some thoughts about kingship-as-theater, but nothing to make us forget the austere power of Rossellini's ""The Rise of Louis XIV.""There's a hilarious scene in which Molire and his pals rush off to hear Descartes read from his works, but this Descartes is a letdown. He looks and sounds like that immortal Ernie Kovacs character, Percy Dovetonsils, the bad (and often sloshed) poet. The measure of the movie, though, is most truly revealed in an exchange that takes place near the end. La Grange, an actor in Molire's company, reports that ""Georges Dandin"" is not drawing well and that they need a new play. ""Yes, I know,"" Molire says. ""I've just started one, about a miser.""""Molire"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall today at 7 P.M. and Saturday at 12:30 P.M.",1979-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film Festival: 'Best Boy,' Documentary:Love and Anguish","IRA WOHL'S ""Best Boy"" is a fine, unusually moving example of documentary film making  what Al and David Maysles, two of the most able practitioners of the method, call ""direct cinema""  about three crucial years in the life of Mr. Wohl's cousin Philly, a stocky, cheerful man of 52 who has been mentally retarded since birth.When we first meet Philly he is living with his parents in the small, middle-class Queens house that has been his home all his life, except for two years spent in an institution when he was a boy. Prompted by his sister, his parents and Mr. Wohl, Philly remembers with a good deal of humor the awfulness of those institutional years, his mind, though it's said to be that of a child of 5, recalling events nearly 40 years in the past.That, as much as anything else, demonstrates how little we understand the phenomenon we call mental retardation. Minds so described can not only leap forward and back, making totally unexpected associations and connections, but they also accumulate life-times of memories.Mr. Wohl has given shape to the film as much in his family relationship as Philly's cousin as in his capacity as the film maker. It's at his suggestion that Philly's parents, Pearl, 72, and Max, 78, agree to send Philly to a day-training center and then, two years later, after the death of his father, to a home where Philly can live and continue the life of expanded interests and responsibilities that the school comes to mean for him. ""Best Boy,"" as the film's program notes point out, is about a young man preparing to leave home for the first time. It's a common enough story unless the young man is 52.""Best Boy"" records Philly's first forays away from home, though he is always in the company of his cousin-the-film maker, who carries the camera, and other members of the crew. There are interviews with psychologists, teachers and couselors, all of whom, one understands, would be on their best behavior in front of the camera. I don't think, though, that the camera's presence is the only reason for this film's benign, almost sweet manner. There is Philly himself, whom Mr. Wohl obviously is fond of and concerned about. Philly is a special person, and his efforts toward some kind of self-sufficiency are material of genuine drama.""Best Boy,"" however, is more than the story of Philly. It's about a family. Even more affecting than Philly's first days in school are the scenes we see played  sometimes at the side of the screen  between Philly's mother and father. At first, Max seems self-conscious in the company of the camera, at other times bored or maybe cranky. Slowly we come to recognize his dignity. When Max comes home from the hospital, thin, pale and exhausted after a cataract operation, his unexpected gesture of affection for his wife suddenly cuts through all the self-consciousness and uneasiness that have gone before.Pearl is more of a natural with the camera. Whether she's worried, tired, happy or sad, her spirit is never in doubt. ""If God wants to punish somebody,"" Pearl says at one point, ""He should do it with retarded children.""Life is a confusion of love and anguish.""Best Boy"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall today at 6:15 P.M. and Sunday at 2.",1979-10-05T05:00:00+0000

Dismissed, psychologically unable to fight back and unable to find another job, he is one battered bourgeosie until his wife gets the bank unions to help defend him.Although ""Other People's Money"" has been adapted from a novel based on an actual event, it does not have the essential ring of dramatic truth. Points of conflict are blunted, the pace, as in so many recent European films, is glacial, and the narrative line keeps getting lost in side issue.The director, Christian de Chalonge, who also collaborated on the screenplay, has chosen to tell the story from the point of view of the executive, underscoring his state of mind at times by quasi-Surrealistic techniques. It would have been far better to rely on Mr. Trintignant's acting, which is eloquent in its control, and on a tighter script.The still lovely Miss Deneuve has far too little to do. Claude Brasseur, Michel Serrault and Francois Perrot provide accomplished support as, respectively, the con man who precipitates the scandal and two scarcely less rascally bankers.",1979-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Burt Reynolds As Unmarried Husband:Post-Divorce Blues,"THE newly divorced husband has long been Hollywood's forgotten man. If he ever turned up in a movie at all, chances are he was either hiring a mariachi band to serenade his ex-wife with her favorite song (he got her back that way) or trying to figure out how to run the vacuum cleaner (he got her back that way, too  she couldn't stand to see him suffer). But ""Starting Over"" depicts an abandoned man in all his misery, and still manages to be fast and funny while it breaks new ground. There's a kernel of truth here. There are a lot of good laughs, too.And there is also an important problem, but it doesn't manifest itself until the story is well under way. As the film begins, Phil Potter (Burt Reynolds) is being sent packing by his wife, Jessica (Candice Bergen), who wants to find herself and has the grievously misguided notion that she can sing.To the tune of one of his wife's screechiest compositions, Phil leaves New York and heads for Boston, where he immediately encounters excessive sympathy from family members, suspicious and/or predatory behavior from new women he meets, and a terrible loneliness. There is no question about the fact that Phil is still very much in love with his ex-wife.But because he is lonely, he strikes up a new romance  or, rather, he allows a woman to strike one up for him. Phil isn't enough of a heel to mislead Marilyn, a nursery-school teacher played by Jill Clayburgh. But neither is he self-sufficient enough to turn down the companionship she offers.The screenplay, by the television writer James L. Brooks (one of the creators of the ""Mary Tyler Moore Show""), deals beautifully with Phil's cautiousness and his passivity. And Mr. Reynolds handles this part of the story quite gracefully, wearing an impenetrable, guarded expression and playing everything very close to the vest.The most stinging scene in the movie, and also one of the best-acted, shows Phil and Marilyn sharing a Thanksgiving dinner with Phil's brother, Mickey (Charles Durning), and his excruciatingly compassionate wife, Marva (Frances Sternhagen). Marilyn has spent most of the movie dressed in the kind of cute, padded clothing her little students wear  she always seems to be swathed in a snowsuit. But this time she appears, looking voluptuous, in something green and clingy  an indication of the extent and importance of her involvement with Phil. Then the phone rings, and there, out of the blue, is Jessica. Phil is surprised to hear from her, and excited, too. He tries to whisper, but he doesn't do a very good job of it  in any case, the others are eavesdropping without shame. Who's there? Jessica wants to know. Oh, says Phil, just Mickey and Marva and ... and...one of their friends.Their friend? It goes without saying that Marilyn is angry. But the movie stands or falls upon whether the source of that anger will be acknowledged, and it isn't. Instead of recognizing this, either tacitly or openly, as Phil's declaration that his ex-wife means more to him than Marilyn does, the couple just fight for a spell and then decide to move in together. If Mr. Brooks and Alan J. Pakula, the director, have spent the early part of the story establishing a complicated and difficult situation, they devote the second half of the film to pretending it's something that can be laughed away.Reynolds's performance begins very well, and very seriously  all the laughs are built around him, and he reacts calmly and cannily, with an eye toward self-preservation. When Jessica and Marilyn finally turn up in the same place, though, it's time for Phil to show the strain, or to show the conflict, or to show something  and still Mr. Reynolds lies low.After a meeting with Jessica in her motel room  a meeting that Phil is rescued from by a joke  Phil admits to his comrades in a church-run Divorce Workshop that he has never wanted a woman more than he wanted Jessica right then. If so, there's more of that desire in the script than there is in the performance. Mr. Reynolds plays the motel-room scene as coolly as he plays any other.Miss Clayburgh delivers a particularly sharp characterization that's letter-perfect during the first part of the story and unconvincing in the second, through no fault of her own. Nervous, demanding, high-strung and nevertheless charming, her Marilyn is all wrong for Phil  that's what makes their affair so unexpectedly touching and gives the story so much life. So when the movie begins to insist that these two were made for each other, it gives the lie to all that has gone before. This feeling is intensified by the fact that neither character changes much during the course of the story. It doesn't help that the only amorous interludes occur very early on.One of the comic masterstrokes in ""Starting Over"" is the casting of Candice Bergen as Jessica. New wives dreading ex-wives must invariably summon someone like Miss Bergen to mind.",1979-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: '10' Spoofs Pursuit of Happiness in L.A.:Success Through Failure,"GEORGE (Dudley Moore) is a very successful composer of popular songs, the kind that a member of the Pepsi generation calls ""elevator music,"" though they've made him rich. He has a long-standing, apparently happy relationship with a good, intelligent woman named Sam (Julie Andrews), who has her own career as a singer. He lives in a lovely hilltop house in Los Angeles, lacks nothing, and is thoroughly miserable. George is 42 years old, and in Southern California you don't even have to be old to be ancient. Everything is too easy out there.Blake Edwards's frequently hilarious new film, ""10,"" is the story of George's desperate efforts to come to terms with life in Southern California even though he knows he's inadequate. Everywhere he goes he sees youth, beauty and health. He drives casually down a street and feels assaulted by the sight of joggers. Nobody seems to drive anymore. They don't even walk. Everybody runs. It's as if their lives were on fire.The movie ""10,"" a reference to the scale by which George rates beautiful women, is almost as much a celebration of the comedy talents of Dudley Moore as ""Darling Lili"" was a celebration of Mr. Edwards's admiration for his wife, Miss Andrews. Mr. Edwards, though deeply romantic, never lets that get in the way of comedy. Like George, he just can't help himself.This is the biggest, fattest role Mr. Moore has yet had in American films. Though he's already delighted us in ""Foul Play"" and ""Bedazzled,"" and on the stage in ""Beyond the Fringe"" and, more recently, in ""Good Evening,"" the revue with Peter Cook, he's never done such a relatively straight role in a film before. He's not entirely comfortable as a romantic leading man, but then ""10"" doesn't play its romance straight very much of the time.The frame of the film is George's pursuit of a phantom, a beautiful young woman he spots one day as her limosene pulls alongside his Rolls-Royce at a stoplight. The young woman, whom George rates conservatively as an ""11,"" is dressed in a bridal gown and veil and is on her way to the church, which doesn't inhibit George. He sneaks into the ceremony, hides among the flowers and, just as the couple are exchanging vows, gets stung on the nose by a bee.In Mr. Edwards's comic world, noses are meant to be stung, heads to have hangovers, and beautiful women to be pursued at any cost.Learning that the young woman's father is, as someone says importantly, ""the most exclusive dentist in Beverly Hills,"" George allows himself to have eight teeth filled at one sitting to find out more about his mysterious, temporarily lost love. When the usually understanding Sam loses her temper at his unstable ways, George goes on an epic bender and follows the honeymoon couple to their Mexican resort, an overpoweringly picturesque place with a beach too hot to walk barefoot on, rum drinks that look like fancy garbage cans and rope bridges that aren't easily navigated by someone who's been drinking brandy and is loaded with painkillers.George, who is short in stature compared to the rest of the population of Southern California, is most funny when most in peril, which is psychological as often as it's physical. His principal failing is to embark on an endeavor that, for one reason or another, he cannot complete. Success through failure, though, is the way comedies like ""10"" operate.The movie belongs very much to Mr. Moore, who manages to be funny without ever having to appear stupid. Miss Andrews is on screen for what seems like no time at all, though her no-nonsense presence is essential to much of the comedy, even when she doesn't participate in it. She is the light at the end of the tunnel of George's midlife crisis. A truly magnificent looking young woman named Bo Derek appears as George's phantom-mistress, and she turns out to be almost as funny as Mr. Moore, partly because the character she plays is the only person in the movie who has no doubts about herself.The excellent supporting cast includes Robert Webber as George's song-writing partner, Dee Wallace as a lonely woman who tries to pick up George at the Mexican resort, Max Showalter as the pastor of a fancy Beverly Hills Protestant church and a beautiful blonde named Deborah Rush, who plays the kind of assistant one might expect in the office of the most exclusive dentist in Beverly Hills. She doesn't handle the instruments or prepare the anesthetics. She just sits by the patient's chair and keeps up a running stream of sympathetic moans and winces as the dentist operates.Mr. Edwards's comic gifts haven't been blunted by his recent series of ""Pink Panther"" hits with Peter Sellers. The film ""10"" is loaded with odd surprises. It also contains a routine about a nearly blind old lady serving tea, a variation on a routine that Mr. Moore did in his Broadway show with Mr. Cook. It's classically funny no matter who does it.",1979-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Something Short of Paradise':Young Gentry?,"""SOMETHING Short of Paradise"" is about a romance so whimsical, so fey and so pointless that it almost doesn't exist. The movie confuses bittersweet rue with post-adolescent mopes, although it really is trying to celebrate the new, young gentry of New York. Where are the adults when we need them?The protagonists in this are a young woman who writes for a magazine and a young man who publicizes movies. She is taller than he is, which is supposed to mean they are adorable, but only makes them look awkward instead. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton get away with this, but they have chemistry going for them, too.Here, however, Susan Sarandon, as the magazine writer, and David Steinberg, as the publicist, share nothing except a desire to kill time. They meet, they dawdle, and one night in her darling studio apartment on the West Side the magazine writer says to herself, ""I'm in big trouble."" She means she is falling in love with the publicist. It also means she will have a dreadful time worrying about whether she is ready to make a ""commitment"" and have a ""relationship.""Consequently, the two of them will break up and make up again and again and again. Maybe the director, David Helpern Jr., and the writer, Fred Barron, are saying this is the new sexuality. Maybe they are saying New York is a place of no sexuality at all. Maybe they just made a dumb movie.Miss Sarandon is dewy and pretty in all this, Faye Dunaway, say, without the hard edges. The problem here, though, is that Mr. Steinberg's character is a klutz, or maybe it is that Mr. Steinberg plays him with such wooden solemnity that he only seems like a klutz. Either way, you will not have the slightest idea of why a woman was attracted to him in the first place. The film opens today at Cinema 2.This film is rated PG (parental guidance suggested), apparently because it has a few mild scenes of partial nudity, and some equally mild suggestive language.",1979-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Cocaine Cowboys':Powdery Smugglers,"I GOT no kick from ""Cocaine Cowboys."" For all the energy it generates, the white powder might just as well have been pulverized Sominex.The flimsy story involves members of a rock group that smuggles the nose candy from Colombia to Montauk, L.I., to make expenses while they're waiting for one of their albums to go platinum. Judging by their music, they're lucky to have gone vinyl.Jack Palance, the only professional in the cast, plays the father of a couple of members of the group. He looks fit and keeps his composure admirably as he tries to play scenes with obvious amateurs. Much of the dialogue seems to have been improvised, but it probably wouldn't have been any better if it had been written down.Andy Warhol, at whose white clapboard summer home in Montauk ""Cocaine Cowboys"" was filmed, plays himself, lurking around the premises with a Polaroid camera as though he were afraid his tenants were damaging the premises.Mr. Warhol used to be highly regarded as a film maker in some circles. His listlessness, detachment, anomie or whatever it's called, does not exactly light up the screen. Tom Sullivan, who plays the leader of the group, appears not to have a future in front of the camera.The direction, by Ulli Lommel, who has appeared in 13 R. W. Fassbinder films and directed the West German production ""The Tenderness of Wolves,"" is rudimentary.

us,Screen: Beauty Meets Beasts in 'Romantic Lover':Battle of the Sexes,"JUST JAECKIN, the director of ""The Last Romantic Lover,"" had previously established himself as a director of soft-core porn movies (""Emmanuelle""), with a particular fondness for bondage (""The Story of O""). But this time Mr. Jaeckin has made a battle-of-the-sexes comedy, and a relatively prim one by his previous standards. Can it be a sign of the times? Instead of chronicling the soft-focus exploits of a trussed-up heroine, Mr. Jaeckin now tells the story of a bitchy Modern Woman who is reduced  by the power of Love  to an old-fashioned bundle of pliable pulchritude.This heroine, who is supposed to be the editor of a sex magazine, begins the movie as a hard-working harpy in the Faye Dunaway ""Network"" mode, though the caricature is extreme enough to make Miss Dunaway seem a paragon of mental health by comparison. Elisabeth (Dayle Haddon) is running a beauty pageant for men, and so the first section of the movie follows a parade of reluctant beefcake, as a dozen finalists demonstrate their talents for smooching, dancing and keeping champagne corks from landing in their dates' faces. This is just idiotic enough to be funny, and Mr. Jaeckin handles it with a wit and flamboyance not demonstrated in his oh-so-solemn previous endeavors.The second half of the film follows Elisabeth's adventures after Pierre (Grard Ismael), the contest's surly runner-up, claims her as a kind of door prize. Awarded a 10-day vacation with the woman of his choice, he yanks Elisabeth out of her high-toned surroundings and carries her off to the circus-grounds he calls home. The circus has recently lost its lion, and Pierre has entered the contest only to win enough prize money to buy a new one.He just happens to be the lion tamer. Although he never exactly takes a whip and a chair to Elisabeth, the film's strong implication is that it takes pretty extreme measures to get a woman to act like a woman these days. It is necessary, in order to enjoy ""The Last Romantic Lover"" as a tender, amusing and perfectly fame-brained fairy tale, to let that notion glide right by.Miss Haddon is so much better here than she was in ""North Dallas Forty"" that her problem may simply have been one of a language barrier  she seems infinitely more relaxed speaking French in Mr. Jaeckin's film than she did speaking English. She and Mr. Ismael have similarly pouty good looks, and they make a very attractive team, even in the film's most ridiculous moments  like a torment-the-princess scene pilfered from ""Freaks"" or an episode in which Miss Haddon lies down under an elephant to prove she has spunk.Fernando Rey puts in a delightful appearance as Mr. Ismael's conniving boss, coaxing his young protg into the competition after weeping prodigious crocodile tears at the lion's funeral.

A bigger bond issue might be possible in the future, it is argued, if this one were defeated. In fact, this bond issue would provide the city with vital help for subways and commuter rail lines; its defeat would probably make it harder, not easier, to pass another bond issue later.

us,Film: Australian 'Brilliant Career' by Gillian Armstrong:The Cast,"""My Brilliant Career"" marks the beginning of exactly that for both the film's daring, assured, high-spirited Australian director, Gillian Armstrong, and its rambunctious young star. Adapted from a semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, it offers a turn-of-the-century heroine who seems to have wandered from the pages of a Louisa May Alcott novel into the Australian Outback, where her buoyant sense of mischief takes on the same grand dimensions as the exotic, perpetually surprising terrain.Sybylla Melvyn (played by Judy Davis, making her movie debut) is supposed to be plain. And she's sufficiently strange-looking, by movie-star standards, to strike the viewer as being something less than a ravishing beauty. But that effect lasts only a short while  only for as long as it takes to realize that Miss Davis brings an unconventional vigor to every scene she's in, even in a film that's as consistently animated as this one. Her Sybylla is a coltish creature, creating a merry chaos wherever she goes.Because her mother has been married badly, Sybylla grows up in relatively impoverished surroundings. Then, at the age of 18 or so, she is sent to live with her wealthy grandmother, who is no great advocate of sprightly behavior. Nevertheless, Sybylla flourishes, especially after making the acquaintance of handsome Harry, the most eligible bachelor in the area. If this sounds like the backdrop for something like ""The Thorn Birds,"" well, it plays a bit like an extravagantly old-fashioned romance, too. Sybylla, who has been well warned that someone like Harry (Sam Neill) can never marry someone like her, continues to defy social convention, with her flashing eyes and her wicked smile and her propensity for starting pillow fights in the middle of the afternoon. After a very sweet and feisty courtship, she lands Harry anyhow.However, and unfortunately, she does not want him  she wants to be a writer (hence the title). Never mind the fact that Sybylla has heretofore done her only writing while sitting on a tree branch, with a kitten in her lap. Miss Armstrong suddenly insists on Sybylla's independence, and tosses Harry to the vultures, and more or less knocks the audience on its ear. Is the viewer being hopelessly old-hat in feeling that Harry  who is handsome and nice, and says he would be delighted to see Sybylla pursue her career  isn't such a bad bet? Apparently so.Miss Armstrong does little to prepare her audience for such a radical wrench  especially because the best parts of her film have shown Sybylla to be intelligently, ecstatically, even magically infatuated with this man. Besides, ""My Brilliant Career"" doesn't need to trumpet either its or its heroine's originality this loudly. The facts speak for themselves  and so does the radiance with which Miss Armstrong and Miss Davis invest so many memorable moments.""My Brilliant Career"" will be shown tonight at 9 o'clock and next Saturday at 6 P.M., as part of the New York Film Festival.",1979-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Young Egyptian Dreaming of Hollywood:The Cast,"Yehia, a young Egyptian-Christian growing to maturity in World War II, is dazzled by American movies and movie stars, even by Leo, the lion whose roar announces the start of every M-G-M picture. He dreams of one day going to Hollywood and becoming a famous actor or writer or director. Why, he asks himself, did he have the rotten luck to be born in Alexandria? Hence the title, ""Alexandria . . . Why?"" for the mass-market Egyptian film that will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center today at 6 P.M. and tomorrow at 9:30 P.M.The festival program suggests that Youssef Chahine, the film's 54-year-old director, ""proves that sheer energy and generosity are not inconsiderable virtues,"" though what are described as sheer energy and generosity look more like a confusion of narratives and an uncontrollable desire to snare the widest possible audience in this day of liberated Egyptian policies.""Alexandria . . . Why?"" is a commonplace mess that attempts to fuse the clichs of the popular cinema into a kind of pop epic, but Mr. Chahine doesn't have the talent or the discipline to fuse clichs into anything except a daisy-chain of peculiar events.In addition to the story of Yehia (Mohsen Mohiedine), who attends Victoria College and, like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in ""Babes in Arms,"" decides to ""put on a show,"" the plots of the movie include one about a family (Yehia's) that's about to be dispossessed because the father, a lawyer, refuses to take cases he doesn't believe in; one about an Egyptian-Arab patriot who falls in love with an Egyptian-Jewish girl; one about another young Egyptian fellow who falls in love with the English soldier he was planning to execute for political reasons, and one about the members of an ineffectual Egyptian underground organization who plan to assassinate Churchill.Mr. Chahine directs this material with all of the authority and humor of the driver of a runaway stagecoach. He helps himself to a lot of newsreel footage (shots of Hitler, Churchill, cities being bombed, the various battles of North Africa), which, instead of certifying the fiction, make it look more implausible.I suppose that a movie that includes a love affair between an Arab and a Jew might seem avant-garde in Cairo, but it has the air of something gratuitous to us, especially when the Jewish girl must, in effect, disassociate herself from Israel and Zionism. By way of explaining the troubles that Israel has brought to the world, someone says, ""Every Jew now belongs to a country different from that of his birth."" Even the refugees from the concentration camps.",1979-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Graphic Treatment of a Violent Crime:Rape Dissected,"OF the two films about rape that have opened in the last two weeks, ""Primal Fear"" is the more serious, the more ambitious and the more outrageous. In this latest New York Film Festival entry, as well as in the tepid and talky ""Rape of Love"" (which opened commercially two weeks ago), a rape is depicted graphically early on. Then it is dissected, discussed, plumbed and otherwise analyzed in common-sense terms that, by nature of the crime's very unreasonableness, make no sense at all.""Primal Fear"" also does a lot more. It shows two women filmmakers as they watch footage of the rape, and wonder whether it will have an erotic effect on men in the audience. They raise this vital question but do not satisfactorily answer it, except to say: ""Maybe domination is part of man's sexual power. We must get to know this. Learn to live with it. Make use of it in a positive way.""It also interjects brutal newsreel footage of members of an African tribe as they ceremonially mutilate the sex organs of a prepubscent girl  footage that seems both irrelevant to the crime at hand and, because it is utterly removed from its context, wildly irresponsible.In the same vein, the Canadian director Anne Claire Poirier draws upon scenes of Nazi collaborators as their heads are being shaved, and a chorus of Vietnamese women in wartime, whose situation is identified with that of the Canadian heroine, a nurse. There is also a sequence, with the tenor of a school play, in which masked rape victims address a male judge, telling him of the nature and extent of their suffering. The men who raped these woman are all portrayed by one very unattractive actor, the better to suggest that all men are beastly and all men are the same.In conversation, especially in scenes that show the original rape victim (Julie Vincent) trying to describe her feelings, ""Primal Fear"" deals effectively, if overgenerally, with the shame and confusion associated with the rape victim's experience. Still, any stirrings of sensitivity are quashed by the regular appearances of the Director (Monique Miller) and the Editor (Micheline Lanctot), whose debates about how to present their material are both chilly and unproductive. Their conversations make it eminently clear that ""Primal Fear"" is more eager to seek the solace of platitudes than it is to answer even those questions that it bothers to raise.",1979-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Fassbinder's 'Year of 13 Moons':Unalterable Condition,"VERY early in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""In a Year of 13 Moons,"" Christoph prepare to leaves his hysterically weeping mistress, Elvira. As Christoph gathers his things, Elvira follows him around their flat demanding love and caresses, and receiving, instead, filthy abuse. ""You have no ideas, no will, no interest in anything,"" Christoph yells. ""Your brain is getting smaller and smaller. Somebody should step on you. You're like a bug. Nobody would ever miss you.""Christoph is not entirely wrong, but it's obvious they've had these scenes before, that Christoph has slammed out of the apartment before, that Elvira has wept buckets of tears, and that, eventually, Christoph has returned. This time he doesn't.Every seven years, Mr. Fassbinder tells us in a title card at the beginning of the film, we experience a year with 13 moons, a time, he says, that can lead to catastrophe.Such a year is 1978 for the unlucky Elvira, but then Elvira has known little except catastrophe since she was born, unwanted, as Erwin, raised by nuns, became a butcher, married, fathered a daughter and then decided  more or less on whim  to have a sex-change operation in Casablanca.Erwin had fallen in love with another man who had told him, jokingly, ""Too bad you aren't a girl."" Erwin, as impulsive as the later Elvira, paid the supreme sacrifice to correct the situation, but then never saw the fellow again, that is, until ""In a Year of 13 Moons.""The new movie, which will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Alice Tully Hall today at 9:30 P.M. and tomorrow at 6:15 P.M., is quintessential Fassbinder, a roller-coaster ride through the last unhappy days of Elvira Weishapt, whose quarterback physique can't be transformed by any number of hormones. Elvira fancies she looks like Marlene Dietrich  ""Men are drawn to me, like moths around a flame""  though when she walks down a street, she more closely resembles a gigantic, very dowdy suburban matron on her way to a white sale.""In a Year of 13 Moons"" is not a film to recommend to anyone who isn't familiar with other work by this most bitterly funny, talented and prolific West German director of such films as ""Katzelmacher,"" ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" ""Effi Briest,"" ""Fox and His Friends"" and, most recently, ""Despair."" Without adequate preparation, the uninitiated movie patron might think he was having a nightmare about a nightmare.The movie is grotesque, arbitrary, sentimental and cold as ice. Its only redeeming feature is genius. The 32-year-old film maker has now made more than 30 feature films, most of them in the last 10 years. He has made so many, so quickly, that it's difficult to separate them, as we easily do with the work of lesser talents. Each Fassbinder film is another explosion in what appears to be a single, continuing eruption of talent that shows no signs of subsiding.Though ""In a Year of 13 Moons"" is about humiliation, mutilation, degradation and despair that are beyond the experience of most of us, Mr. Fassbinder takes almost as dim a view as Christoph does of Elvira/Erwin. She/he, magnificently well played by Volker Spengler (who was the red-haired artist in ""Despair""), is a monster. All the reasonable explanations in the world about how she/he got that way are finally beside the point of the present experience. What Mr. Fassbinder is dealing with is an unalterable condition, and the first step toward salvation is the recognition of that condition. That's about as close as I can come at the moment to making a generalization about the collected Fassbinder work.""In a Year of 13 Moons"" is not as easy a film to categorize as even ""Despair."" Scenes of unbearably graphic brutality are mixed with scenes of serene beauty and some of utter nonsense. Because Mr. Fassbinder works so rapidly, one can't always be sure that the nonsense is intentional or a mistake. One has to trust him, even while realizing that one of his methods of operation is to disorient us as thoroughly as possible.There's one very funny, deadly serious scene in which Elvira comes upon a man casually preparing to hang himself because, as he says, ""I don't want things to go on simply because I perceive them."" Elvira notes logically, while turning attention to herself, that even if he does kill himself, she'll be left to carry on the process of perceiving.The movie contains several monologues as extraordinary as anything in the work of Jean-Luc Godard, though they are the unmistakable work of Mr. Fassbinder. One that is especially memorable  by a man who has stood on the same street, on the same corner, looking up at the same 16th-floor window for over a year  goes beyond Godard to evoke Pirandello's ""The Man With the Flower in His Mouth.""Behind and around these curiosities we perceive Mr. Fassbinder's picture of contemporary West Germany, a land of plenty produced by the most devastating war in history, going merrily to hell with every modern comfort, gadget and appliance know to modern man.In addition to Mr. Spengler's eerily perfect performance, there are other notable contributions by Ingrid Caven, as the jolly hooker who takes care of Elvira/Erwin long after she/he has gone around the bend; Gottfried John, as the man whose casual remark to Erwin sent him to Casablanca; Elisabeth Trissenaar, as Erwin's pretty, unusually understanding wife; Eva Mattes as his daughter, and Lilo Pompeit, as the nun who knows the secret of Erwin's furious childhood.""In a Year of 13 Moons"" is one of the highlights of the festival.",1979-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Failed Marriage In Postwar Poland:Politics and Bedfellows,"BECAUSE there have been several rather drastic changes in the Polish political scene since World War II, it's absolutely essential to a complete understanding of a Polish film that we have some idea when it's supposed to be taking place. This is an omission that nags our attention throughout Andrzej Wajda's otherwise involving new film, ""Without Anesthesia,"" which will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center today at 9:30 P.M. and tomorrow at 6:15 P.M.The movie was made last year. Its cars and clothes look completely contemporary though, according to the festival's program notes, the story is based on events in postwar Poland that have been updated to the 1960's. However, there's nothing in the film to indicate this isn't 1979. Since ""Without Anesthesia"" is as much about politics as people, the result is as disorienting as a room that has a built-in tilt.At the center of ""Without Anesthesia"" is Jerzy (Zbigniew Zapasiewicz) an urbane, witty, self-assured political pundit who has gained a good deal of fame at home by traveling abroad to report wars, revolutions and guerrilla movements in the Third World.When we first see him, he is the charming celebrity-guest on a dreadful Polish television program that mixes so-called serious discussion with audience-participation pratfalls. As he has apparently always done to survive, Jerzy accepts the ridiculous situation with grace.Later that evening, when he returns home, he is confronted with a disaster of a sort he's never before faced. His wife has walked out on him, taking their daughter with her, to live with a younger man.On its surface, ""Without Anesthesia"" seems to be about Jerzy's attempts to win back his wife, Ewa (Ewa Dalkowska) and to come to some understanding about what went wrong with their 15-year marriage. But what went wrong is inextricably bound up with politics. Jacek (Andrzej Seweryn), Ewa's lover, is a furious young radical who looks upon the members of Jerzy's generation as ""coffeehouse liberals,"" people who have always known just how far they could go without feeling official heat. Because it's this quality that Ewa loves in Jacek, it's necessary that we know at what point in his career Jerzy began to make adjustments to survive.The events of ""Without Anesthesia"" may be taking place in the 60's, but they reflect the darker days of the early 1950's. As Jerzy's marriage goes down the drain, so does his job. The first inkling Jerzy has that he's no longer considered ""safe"" is when he doesn't receive the office's weekly copies of Newsweek and Stern.There are also hints of the pre-Khrushchev era when Ewa's lawyer tells Jerzy that Ewa will have no trouble getting her divorce even if it's contested. ""It's been my experience,"" the lawyer says blandly, ""that anything can be proved."" In one of their failed attempts at reconciliation, Ewa, laughing, remembers how Jerzy was once very depressed by Polish weather after a long stay in Ethiopia. As she recalls it, Jerzy said testily, ""I can't bear such an inconsistent climate.""Jerzy's growing panic is beautifully illuminated in Mr. Zapasiewicz, who manages to find heroic stature in a character who has always compromised. Miss Dalkowska is lovely as the reticent, intelligent wife.Like Mr. Wajda's ""Man of Marble,"" which was seen in New York briefly this year, ""Without Anesthesia"" may be more fuzzy in its politics than the director would have wished. Yet enough of substance remains to make it one of the more provocative movies of the year to date.",1979-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'The Young Girls of Wilko,' From Poland:A Dark Comedy","WIKTOR, the hero of Andrzej Wajda's fine new comedy, ""The Young Girls of Wilko,"" is as exasperating as he is appealing. He's the kind of man who, in all seriousness, regrets that everything that has passed can be seen only in hindsight. He demands the impossible so that he can reject the possible. Having fought on the Russian front during World War I, he dates his alienation from that time of horror, yet it becomes increasingly clear during ""The Young Girls of Wilko"" that Wiktor has always been slippery in his relations with those he loves. Foremost among these are the five surviving sisters of the six he once courted before the war, discreetly, during lazy summer vacations in the country.Now, after 15 years of absence, Wiktor returns to Wilko. The death of a friend in Warsaw has prompted him to question his own life. Though in his late 30's, Wiktor (Daniel Olbrychski) is still a handsome man. He's trim, fair-haired and has the heavily lidded eyes that often suggest he has mysterious longings when he's really nothing more than bored, detached from the immediate scene.Wiktor's detachment, which even he is beginning to suspect is a certain emptiness, still fires the hearts of the once-young girls of Wilko who, by chance, are all at their country estate when he walks in one evening unannounced. All except Tunia, the youngest, have married, if none too happily. Julia, plump and sweetly pretty in the way that suggests she was ravishing as a girl, is married to the estate manager, a crass, opportunistic man whom Chekhov might have created; Yola is married to a Warsaw businessman from whom she is separated and who writes letters to her that read like official memorandums (""Please be advised that . . .""), while Zosia is the wife of a diplomat who is away most of the time.The girls have not done especially well but they have one another, their children, their elderly mother and an ordered existence.As ""The Young Girls of Wilko"" proceeds in its beautifully circuitous way, Wiktor takes up with each of the sisters, in turn, as, it is apparent, he did many years earlier. The virginal Tunia, who was a small child when he was last there, becomes the surrogate for the missing sister whose death, we come to understand, Wiktor caused without knowing it. It's also apparent that Wiktor has loved them all, as a unit, together, as if each were a different aspect of the same person, much in the way that Antoine Doinel, as a youth, used to fall in love with a nice, middle-class family unit consisting of the girl, her mother and her father.""The Young Girls of Wilko,"" which will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Lincoln Center today at 9:30 P.M. and tomorrow at 6:15 P.M., is one of the wisest, most civilized comedies in a long time. Although it is quite different in tone from ""Without Anesthesia,"" Mr. Wajda's political drama seen at the festival earlier this week, both films are about extremely complex relationships that reveal themselves in subtle ways beyond the reach of most film makers.It was a canny festival decision to show the two films more or less back-to-back. Mr. Wajda, after making a brilliant splash here in the late 1950's and 60's with ""Generation,"" ""Kanal"" and ""Ashes and Diamonds,"" has recently not received the attention he deserves. Not all of the later films have been equally good, though the director who made them always exhibited the same talent. Lately his reputation has been that of someone who makes political films so disguised (and sometimes edited) that Polish authorities cannot take offense. This, however, is to underrate the gifts that are abundantly evident in ""The Young Girls of Wilko.""Among other things, Mr. Wajda is terrifically good with actors. Two of the best performances you're likely to see this year are those of Mr. Olbrychski (who had the lead in Mr. Wajda's elegant ""Landscape After Battle"") as Wiktor in ""Wilko"" and of Zbigniew Zapasiewicz in ""Without Anesthesia."" (Mr. Zapasiewicz also appears in ""Wilko"" as the estate manager.) In addition, ""The Young Girls of Wilko"" features a string of superlative performances by the actresses who play the unlucky sisters, especially the one by Christine Pascal, the French actress, as the beautiful Tunia.Though ""The Young Girls of Wilko"" is a dark comedy about a man who, in the description of one of the sisters, appears to have wilted, it leaves one feeling invigorated, almost like new. Such are the astonishments of art.",1979-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Instead he studied art history for three years in absolute misery, finally deciding that he was most interested in modern design. Encouraged by Lord Reilly, an eminent design spokesman, he decided to write a textbook. The underlying theme of the book, Mr. Bayley said, is that a lot of modern design is more rewarding than modern art. It is refrigerators, typewriters, cars, pens, shavers, television sets, lamps, hair dryers, and telephones  the functional objects of contemporary everyday life  that Mr. Bayley celebrates as industrial design as the legitimate art of the 20th century. His book, In Good Shape: Style in Industrial Products 1900 to 1960, has just been published by the Design Council in England. An American paperback edition (Van Nostrand Reinhold, $12.95) will be available here later this month.

us,Screen: Facts and Propaganda in 'The Wobblies':'One Big Union',"""THE Wobblies"" is a history of the Industrial Workers of the World, researched lovingly and corroborated by the reminiscences of some of the union's former members, who are now in their 80's and 90's.Along with filming interviews with these stalwarts, the directors  Stewart Bird and Deborah Shaffer  have collected songs, posters, portraits and animated and live-action footage of the period. In assembling these ingredients, they divide their attention between actual and exaggerated images of the labor movement  between the facts of its history and the propaganda. The propaganda is so compelling that, even now, it seems to exist on a bolder scale.It works both ways: in addition to all the pro-I.W.W. graphics and the rousing songs, the film makers have unearthed the kinds of anti-Wobbly material that eventually led to the union's decline. One cartoon shows a farmer, drawn to look like Abraham Lincoln, protecting bags of produce from a large rat, identified as an I.W.W. ""Bolshevist.""Another, this one from the Disney studio, is about life at Alice's Egg Plant after the Little Red Henski arrives, direct from Moscow and wearing a cap and beard like Lenin's, to organize the other chickens. The animated hens, with cries of ""Shorter hours!"" and ""Smaller eggs!"" are soon rebelling against Alice. Alice is played by a real little girl, to emphasize either the innocence or frivolousness of management, depending on one's point of view.""The Wobblies"" is particularly vivid in detailing what life was like in the lumber camps. There is footage of lumberjack teams felling trees that are wider than the workers are tall; one still photograph shows a man lying sideways in a cavity in a tree trunk. The loggers are also seen at mealtimes, while one man  in voice-over  recalls that the plates were kept nailed to the tables, so they couldn't be stolen. They couldn't be cleaned, either.The film, for all its accounts of strife, proceeds gently. The film makers have no real access to the passion and violence that marked the turbulent history of the union, which flourished in the early years of the century, except through spoken anecdotes and newspaper headlines. And their organization of information is more diligent than dynamic. The film itself is less spirited than the music on its soundtrack, less grandiose or melodramatic than the posters that call urgently, and overpoweringly, for ""One Big Union.""But this mood, though less fiery than it might have been, is more temperate, more generous, perhaps better suited to the subject in a way. The Wobblies, whose courage and tenacity is documented here over and over again, stood for an egalitarianism that may be better served by research than by rhetoric. When the facts are presented as fully as they have been here, the feelings that accompanied them aren't difficult to imagine.""The Wobblies"" will be shown tonight at 6:15 and tomorrow night at 9:30 as part of the New York Film Festival.",1979-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: A Killer Returns in 'When a Stranger Calls':Killer on Little Cat Feet,"THE gimmick behind ""When a Stranger Calls"" is a scary one, but it's been played for more than it's worth. A babysitter begins receiving annoying phone calls, so she calls the police. Everyone gets annoying phone calls, the police say. Later she complains again, and the calls are traced, and they turn out to be originating at the very house she's in. This time, the police are willing to take the matter more seriously, but it's too late for the children in the house. The man who's been tormenting the babysitter, an escaped mental patient, has long since torn them limb from limb.This isn't the film's denouement, it's just the beginning. Seven years later, the same babysitter has children of her own and the killer is on the loose all over again. He hasn't gotten any nicer with age.""When a Stranger Calls"" is the first feature to be directed by Fred Walton, who originally told this same story  with Steve Feke, his co-screenwriter  in the space of a 20-minute short. But for the sake of a full-length format, they've broadened the plot considerably without digging any deeper. The killer, whose craziness is quite unexplained, now spends the mid-section of the film being pursued by an ex-cop with an all-purpose motive: he saw the first murder, he'll get this guy if it's the last thing he does, and so on. The cop is played by Charles Durning, an excellent actor who looks awfully tubby for the chase scenes and who specializes in less monomanical roles than this film's version of Dirty Harry.Mr. Durning is miscast, but he's not alone. The movie is full of fine actors, but they all seem to have been wedged into the wrong roles. Tony Beckley, a slender, edgy-looking Englishman, doesn't look physically capable of having committed the crime. (It is never explained, incidentally, how he accomplished anything so brutal without making a sound.) Carol Kane does a fine job as the quavery-voiced, terrified babysitter, but when she grows up into a suburban Mom all is not well. Colleen Dewhurst, as a sodden barfly whom the killer begins stalking, looks aglow with a very unbarflylike beauty. She also looks perfectly capable of breaking the arm of Mr. Beckley, who seems much frailer than she.Miss Dewhurst gives a coolly glamorous performance, but hers is the character that makes the least sense of all. Why does this woman spend her days in a place called Torchy's, and why does she make a habit of walking home alone, through the most deserted streets in all of Los Angeles? The first time Miss Dewhurst makes this trip, Mr. Walton fills the soundtrack with echoes, the clickety-clack of her high heels on the pavement as she wends her way through the night. This might pass for style if it didn't later develop that she has been followed home by the killer, whose own footsteps are conveniently soundless. Mr. Walton diminishes his own suspense by letting this already harmless-looking figure pad about on little cat feet.Nevertheless, ""When a Stranger Calls"" is an energetic first film; if Mr. Walton hasn't yet learned his lessons well, he's certainly chosen the right teachers. The frightened-babysitter opening of the movie is marvelously modern, as Mr. Walton demonstrates that a haunted house with an ice-making refrigerator is intrinsically scarier than a house without one. He also makes the most of that fearsome modern weapon, the telephone.The screenplay, by Mr. Walton and Mr. Feke, contains about twice as much small talk as it needed. When a man hires a private detective to find the murderer of his children, and the detective has already said, ""Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but I'll find him,"" why wait for the client to add, ""My accountant will contact you""? Is it absolutely necessary for a doctor to ask the detective, ""Do you want to know how much we really understand of the human mind""?""When a Stranger Calls"" opens today at the National and other theaters.",1979-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Black Stallion',"""The Black Stallion"" is a suffocatingly gorgeous adventure movie, which means it isn't very adventuresome at all. A small boy befriends a large horse during a sea voyage, by placing four sugar cubes very, very neatly on the port-hole window of the horse's cabin. The horse eats three. Then their ship sinks, and the horse saves the boy's life, and they wind up on the most picturesque island you've ever seen. The sea shimmers. The rock formations are fabulous. When the horse peers out to sea from atop a high cliff, as the camera sweeps around him to a trumpeting score, he has all the magnificence of a new Buick atop a promontory in Monument Valley.On the beach, the horse gallops and the movie crawls. The director, Carroll Ballard, and the cinematographer, Caleb Deschanel, have captured so many lavishly beautiful images that the cumulative effect is one of repetition. In another context, this sort of glamour might prove more useful  but the source material for ""The Black Stallion"" is Walter Farley's novel about a young boy's amazing escapades. And it requires more action in the telling, plain and simple.Mr. Ballard's direction, of a story designed to excite the viewer's imagination and curiosity, instead stifles these feelings by emphasizing the cosmetic value of every frame. For all its pretty glimpses of the desert island, the film never offers a clear, overall sense of what the place looks like; neither the camera nor the boy really goes exploring. The boy, played by Kelly Reno, remains quite passive throughout the tale.Later, back home with his mother (Ten Garr) in some unusually perfect version of Small Town, U.S.A., he accepts the loss of one family member (his father, who drowned in the shipwreck) and the addition of another (the horse, now living in the back yard), with so much equanimity he seems a little strange. Freud notwithstanding, the kid ought to be feeling some twinges over the death of his Dad.The best part of ""The Black Stallion,"" which will be shown twice today as part of the New York Film Festival, is the second half, which introduces Mickey Rooney as a retired horse trainer who helps the boy and stallion prepare for a climactic race. Mr. Rooney lends humor and humanity to the proceedings, and he fits surprisingly well into Mr. Ballard's careful scheme.""The Black Stallion,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") contains a few mildly violent episodes that might frighten very young children.",1979-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom':The Cast,"When Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" was originally released in England, in 1960, the critics rose up like a bunch of furious Reverend Davidsons to condemn it on moral grounds. ""It stinks,"" one critic wrote. Another thought it should be flushed down the sewer, and a third dismissed it haughtily as ""perverted nonsense."" There is nothing angrier than a critic when he can be safely outraged.Mr. Powell's film is about a voyeur, a fellow who is obsessed by his movie camera, which he uses to make his own private ""snuff"" films, pictorial records of wanton young women just at the moments of their deaths. The movie's release was one of those rare occasions that allow critics, who are so often accused of promoting smut, righteously to proclaim their decency. The movie died.Now ""Peeping Tom,"" which had an aborted release in this country in a shortened version in the 60's, has been rediscovered, and what was yesterday's garbage is now being heralded by two of today's critics as ""powerful and moving"" and ""at once mischievous and compassionate, ironic and evangelistic, comic and tragic."" The movie was shown at the New York Film Festival yesterday, and will be re-released commercially in the near future by Martin Scorsese and Corinth Films, the billing to be in that order.""Peeping Tom's"" rediscovery, I fear, tells us more about fads in film criticism than it does about art. Only someone madly obsessed with being the first to hail a new auteur, which is always a nice way of calling attention to oneself, could spend the time needed to find genius in the erratic works of Mr. Powell  ""One of Our Aircraft Is Missing,"" ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,"" ""The Red Shoes,"" ""Tales of Hoffman"" and so on, all directed with Emeric Pressberger, and ""Peeping Tom,"" which he directed alone.""Peeping Tom,"" written by Leo Marks, may be one of the limper suspense movies you've ever seen. The audience knows virtually from the first frame that poor Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm), skulking around London with his trusty little movie camera, is a nut and a killer, and no amount of psycho-analytical exposition can make him endearingly complex.We are told that his father, a famous psychologist, ""was interested in the reactions of the nervous system to fear"" and warped his son forever by such tricks as dropping lizards on him in the middle of the night and then photographing the boy's terror. The movie talks about fear in the same way that we heard in William Castle's ""The Tingler"" (1960), much of which was set in a tacky movie theater where fear, in the physical form of something that looked like a soft, white lobster, crawled around under the seats attacking the paying customers.What seems to fascinate ""Peeping Tom's"" new supporters is Mr. Powell's appreciation of the idea that the act of photographing something can be an act of aggression, of violation (of the object photographed), an idea shared by some film makers (including Alfred Hitchcock in portions of his classic ""Rear Window,"" made in 1954), professional thinkers and members of certain other primitive tribes.This fascination dates back to the movie-mad 60's, when movies became Art, film schools began to flourish, and the taking of moving pictures seemed to offer an easy way to self-expression and possibly celebrity. The last word on the foolishness of those times is contained in Jim McBride's uproariously funny and wise pseudodocumentary ""David Holzman's Diary,"" about a fellow who is so preoccupied by filming everything that it becomes a substitute for living. Like the morose Mark Lewis in ""Peeping Tom,"" David Holzman eventually comes to an absolute standstill.I am, perhaps, somewhat prejudiced. As interested as I am in films, the properties of the movie camera are not, for me, a subject of endless fascination. The movie camera is not magical. It's a tool, like a typewriter.I find it difficult to become morally outraged by ""Peeping Tom"" and even more difficult to see this movie as anything more than an excruciatingly schematic, very solemn melodrama, quite badly acted by everyone. Chief among these are Mr. Boehm, who plays the mad killer as an Englishman with a Peter Lorre accent that makes ""birthday"" come out ""birsday""; a very young Anna Massey, who plays Mark's girl in a fashion that evokes all of the worst mannerisms of the theater that gave us ""The Reluctant Debutante,"" and the beautiful Moira Shearer, without her red shoes and thus earthbound, as one of Mark's surprised victims.",1979-10-14T05:00:00+0000

White away from CBS for election commentary. CBS will probably parry soon with its own publicrelations coup.

In The Black Stallion,which was screened at the New York Film Festival last night and enters commercial release on Thursday, the young hero who befriends the horse of the title is shown as resourceful and determined against forces that might defeat grownups. In the current Rich Kids, about children suffering through their parents marital miseries, and A Little Romance, an updated Romeo and Juliet, the protagonists react to love with a fervor that adults have presumably outgrown. And in last summer's tearjerker, The Champ, the emotional focus is on the hearttugging little boy who was first played by Jackie Cooper in the original, more than four decades ago.",1979-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Maria Braun' From Fassbinder:The Cast,"Hitler's Germany is not just collapsing; it's being pulverized from above, though life goes on. Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), a private in the German Army, and his pretty young fiance Maria (Hanna Schygulla), are exchanging their vows in a registrar's office when the air raid becomes increasingly fierce. The small room shudders and shakes, but the ceremony continues. There is an especially loud boom and, when a window shatters, the witnesses bolt for the door, followed by the registrar.The furious Hermann, followed by Maria, runs after the registrar, and together they tackle him. Lying flat on the pavement, the terrified registrar between them, bricks and mortar falling all around them, Hermann and Maria are at last made man and wife.It's a monstrously funny scene  Armageddon as screwball comedy. Only Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the prodigiously talented young West German director (""In a Year of 13 Moons,"" ""Effi Briest"" and so on) would dare begin a movie about total dissolution with with a sequence dramatizing the end of the known world. Where can one go from there?Mr. Fassbinder's ""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" goes on in epic  and epically funny  fashion to trace the rise of postwar Germany in the story of the single-mindedly faithful Maria Braun who becomes, in the words of one of her friends, ""the Mata Hari of the economic miracle."" Never underestimate the power of a woman who loves her husband.After their marriage, Hermann returns to the Russian front where he is reported missing in action. Maria, at first, refuses to believe it. She gets a job in a bar catering to American G.I.'s, but stays true to Hermann until her brother-in-law returns from a prisoner-of-war camp to testify that Hermann is, indeed, dead.Maria drifts into an affair with a black American soldier named Bill, a generous, cheerful, pudgy fellow by whom she becomes pregnant. But wait  Hermann is not dead!As such things tend to go in the realm of farce, Hermann returns one evening just as Maria and Bill are preparing to make love. Maria, with the logic she uses in all crises, explains that although she likes Bill, she loves Hermann. There is a scuffle. Maria hits Bill over the head with a bottle, and in less time than it takes to write these words, Hermann has been packed off to prison and Maria has set off to make a fortune, which the two of them will share when he is released.Watching ""The Marriage of Maria Braun,"" you come to realize that the economic miracle couldn't have happened without either United States aid OR Maria Braun. Her steadfast loyalty, her determination and her total disregard of consequences can move mountains of economic and emotional debris.""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" may be Mr. Fassbinder's most perfectly realized comedy to date, though the movie's last three minutes remain, for me, utter confusion. Everything I have to say about the movie excludes those final moments, about which I will say nothing out of respect for (and fear of) those letter-writers who don't go to see ""Hamlet"" because they know how it all turns out.""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" is both an epic comedy and a romantic ballad, two not especially friendly forms that become seamlessly one in the sweet, tough, brilliantly complex performance of Hanna Schygulla, who is becoming for Mr. Fassbinder what Stephane Audran once was for Claude Chabrol and Anna Karina was for Jean-Luc Godard.Miss Schygulla, the bored, gumchewing amateur tart of ""Katzelmacher"" and the elegantly doomed heroine of ""Effi Briest,"" is the kind of enchanted actress who, at any one moment in a Fassbinder movie, is the sum of all its parts, plus a little more. Though she always remains inside the film (she's not a bravura sort), she effectively represents everything it's about. This, I suppose, has as much to do with her looks and gestures as it does with the mechanics of a particular performance. Whatever it is, it's splendid and mysterious.Something of the same can be said for the film, which, though it often proceeds as if it were a slapstick comedy, is frequently touching in a way that isn't a Fassbinder characteristic. One reason, I suspect, is that there isn't a single, easily defined villain in the entire film. Maria, Hermann and Oswald (Ivan Desny), the rich textile manufacturer who becomes Maria's lover and her introduction to the world of Big Business, are, each one, coping as well as they can with absolutely terrible fates. It's not as if they were sentimental optimists. They are, instead, rather like children who are determined to believe in Santa Claus long after they know better.The German-language screenplay, written by Peter Marthesheimer and Pea Frolich, with additional dialogue by the director, is the most accomplished of any Fassbinder film I've yet seen, with the exception of Tom Stoppard's for ""Despair."" It's of that incredible sharpness that cuts through to the bone without giving immediately apparent pain. Very scary though funny.""The Marriage of Maria Braun"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival in Avery Fisher Hall tonight at 8:30, thus ending this year's festival in the most appropriate way  by reminding us of the still immense possibilities of movies made by masters.",1979-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Al Pacino in '...and Justice for All':Sorts of Breakdowns,"NORMAN JEWISON'S new comedy about the bitter awakening of an idealistic young Baltimore lawyer, "". . . and Justice for All,"" pretends to be about the shortcomings in our judicial system, but it's really an extended introduction in how to lose control, have a nervous breakdown, go crazy, commit suicide and perform other antisocial acts.When we first see Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino), the selfless young lawyer who still believes in the theoretical possibility of justice, he is spending a few hours in the lockup for contempt of court. That afternoon, during a hearing, Arthur had lost his temper and threatened the judge with bodily harm. Clearly Arthur doesn't have a grip on himself. Nor, for that matter, does his friend Judge Rayford (Jack Warden), who is a good jurist but a bad risk. When he's not sitting on the bench, Judge Rayford plays Russian roulette with  among other things  a shotgun because, we are led to believe, a judge's life is such a terrible one. Decisions. Decisions.Then there's Arthur's partner, Jay Porter (Jeffrey Tambor), who, like Arthur, spends his life defending people who are often guilty. Poor Jay once prided himself on winning an acquittal for a man he knew to be guilty of murder. When Jay learns the same man has run right out and disemboweled two small children, he suddenly goes to pieces. First he shaves his head. A few days later, he runs amok in the Criminal Court Building, throwing crockery at the guards, other lawyers, judges, policemen and casual passers-by.With the exception of two old men, one of whom is senile, all of the characters in "" . . . and Justice for All"" have such low thresholds of emotional distress that I wouldn't trust one of them to see ""The Sound of Music"" unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian. They dress sloppily. They talk dirty. Yet they are of an innocence that boggles the mind and sinks the movie.I suspect that Valerie Curtin and Barry Levinson, who wrote the original screenplay, and Mr. Jewison, who directed it, might have conceived "" . . . and Justice for All"" as what Hollywood rather loosely calls ""a black comedy,"" because it attempts to locate humor in matters that are obviously grotesque. I also imagine there were more than a few references to ""Catch-22"" and ""M*A*S*H"" in the course of interminable story conferences. What they've come up with, though, is not a satire, but a demonstration of hysteria that, being hysterical, satirizes nothing, having no direction and no point of view.Everybody in this movie is at his wit's end: Arthur because Judge Fleming (John Forsythe) won't release an innocent prisoner for technical reasons; the innocent prisoner (Thomas Waites) because he has been in prison for almost two years, on a traffic violation, and is getting raped frequently; Judge Fleming because he's psychotyic and has just been charged with the rape of a very young woman; a black transvestite (Robert Christian) because he's being sent to prison for three years on a robbery charge and doesn't want to go, as well as Judge Rayford and Jay Porter for the reasons cited above.Nearly sane are a pretty lawyer (Christine Lahti), though she sleeps with Arthur while sitting on a committee that is investigating Arthur's ethics; Arthur's senile old grandpa (Lee Strasberg), and grandpa's best friend (Sam Levene).The big moral question facing Arthur is whether or not he should defend the rapist-judge. Because the judge has political connections, Arthur is threatened with disbarment if he stands by his principles and refuses. This might be a valid quandary if Arthur weren't such a hyperventillating idiot to start with. In this movie, it's not a moral problem, only one of plot.With the exception of Mr. Strasberg and Mr. Levene, the actors are as hysterical as their material. When the movie opens, Mr. Pacino is behaving as if he were at the end of his rope, which leaves him no place to go except crazy with moral indignation. Miss Lahti is attractive but, along with everyone else, has been directed to play it as if she were in the last act of ""Three Men on a Horse.""The screenplay has one funny exchange. When Arthur is called before the ethics committee, he asks why they have to use microphones when there are only five people in a small room. ""Well,"" one of the inquisitors says, ""this is a hearing.""Other than that, the screenplay and the direction are a complete muddle. If you follow what seems to be the film's feeble point to its logical end, it is that our judicial system is rotten not only because of the people who administer it, but also because it provides safeguards for the accused. The next step, one should think, is a nice, predictable law-and-order state.I can't be sure, however. "" . . . and Justice for All,"" which opens today at Loews Tower East and other theaters, is in the throes of a nervous breakdown from beginning to end.",1979-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Head Over Heels,' Drama, Opens:Bachelor in Love","""HEAD OVER HEELS,"" Joan Micklin Silver's screen adaptation of Ann Beattie's novel ""Chilly Scenes of Winter,"" is a tantalizing movie, seeming to be on the verge of some revelation of profound feeling that, at long last, never comes.By the time we reach the end, we realize that everything we were to learn about its characters we knew in the first 20 minutes. After that, they continue to talk a great deal, laugh a lot and change their minds noisily, but they grow dimmer and dimmer until they've all but disappeared, though the actors remain. As George S. Kaufman once said on meeting a friend who was supposed to have left town, ""Forgotten but not gone.""One possible problem is Mrs. Silver's fidelity to the scope of the novel and even to her dialogue, which might read better than it plays. Such fidelity appears to prevent the movie from developing any style or momentum of its own. There's also something wrong when we're well into a movie before we know where it's taking place. Are those tall buildings in New York? No. There's a lot of snow around, so it might be Minneapolis. No again. We look for landmarks and wonder. There's a reference to someone's working for the state of Utah, but the reference goes by so quickly we think the job could be in a New York public-relations firm. It isn't. The setting really is Salt Lake City, but we've wasted a lot of time that could have been better spent elsewhere.The principal characters are a bachelor named Charles (John Heard), who has a boring job as a ""reports analyst"" for Utah, and Laura (Mary Beth Hurt), the young woman he falls in love with while she's temporarily separated from her husband.Charles worships Laura. He tells her she's more beautiful than a movie star and a better cook than a professional chef, which makes Laura angry because she feels inadequate. Laura is the sort of woman who is more at ease with a husband who doesn't appreciate her enough than she does with Charles, who appreciates her too much.When Laura returns to her husband and to the stepdaughter she adores, Charles becomes obsessed with getting her back. He begins to behave strangely. He builds a dollhouse replica of her A-frame house and staffs it with little figures representing Laura, her husband and the child. At night he parks outside the A-frame and waits until all the lights go off.For a while it seems as if Charles might be certifiably nuts. After all, his mother (Gloria Grahame) is the sort of neurotic who sits, fully clothed, in a bathtub full of water and threatens to commit suicide. His grandfather did commit suicide. ""He went out in the morning for grouse,"" Charles says laconically. ""In the afternoon he went out for himself.""Such details  novelistic details  keep us hooked to the film. There must be more to Charles and Laura than the two rather average, slightly mixedup people we see on the screen. The movie goes on, through one mild crisis after another but Charles and Laura become tiresome instead of more interesting. It's not because of the performances. Mr. Heard and Miss Hurt (""Interiors"") are two of our best young actors, but the material is either thin and unfocused or rich but beside the point. The most appealing characters in the movie, though seen only briefly, are Charles's mother and the stepfather (Kenneth McMillan) who attempts to protect her unreliable sanity.Mrs. Silver tries to cover a lot of ground by having much of the movie unfold in chronological flashbacks, with Charles talking to us directly, but the past is so much like the present you forget where you are. One begins to dread Charles's confidential asides to the audience, knowing that we are again going back in time when all we want to do is get on with it. Further, there is a recurring gag with a blind news dealer that is progressively oppressive, not because it's in bad taste but because it is what the entire movie eventually becomes  mercilessly arch.Even so, there's not a false performance in the film. Miss Grahame and Mr. McMillan are especially fine, but there are other noteworthy contributions by Peter Riegert, Nora Heflin, Tarah Hunter and Griffin Dunne (one of the film's producers), who's very funny as the sort of fellow who, when asked if he'd like a glass of milk, totes up the amount of calcium he's already consumed that day.The film opens today at the Trans-Lux East.""Head Over Heels,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some slightly vulgar dialogue.",1979-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'Meteor,' a Disaster Tale, Opens:Menace From the Blue","""OUTER space  limitless and timeless  an infinite playground for that occasional blazing visitor, the comet,"" says a somber narrator at the beginning of ""Meteor."" This is a fine warm-up to a movie in which the terrible, hurtling menace of the title looks like a big hunk of week-old bread. The earth can be saved only through the diplomatic efforts of Henry Fonda, who plays the President, and Karl Malden, still wearing his ""What will you do?"" hat. Together, they negotiate with the Russians, who say things like ""the Volga is about to overflow its banks, and we are discussing swimming lessons!"" They also send over their ace interpreter and trouble-shooter, Natalie Wood.In a heartwarming gesture of cooperation, the Soviet and American Governments agree to reposition the missiles that each nation had previously aimed at the other (theirs is called Peter the Great), and instead blow the meteor to smithereens. The director, Ronald Neame  also responsible for ""The Poseidon Adventure""  accompanies each Big Bad Missile shot with theme music that sounds a bit like ""She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain When She Comes."" This, plus the fact that the missiles look like undernourished bowling pins, makes them considerably less formidable than they might have been.Mr. Neame's specialty is, of course, the underwater scene, and he doesn't come into his own  in this film that opened today at the Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters  until Manhattan has been squashed and the survivors, huddling in a subway, are bathed in ugly brown-green muck. Before that, he devotes too much attention to lifeless shots of computers and arguments between National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials and military personnel, who bellow at the tops of their lungs. There are also occasional glimpses of monitors saying things like ""Time to impact  Days: 2."" These signs don't inspire confidence in the scientific talent that has been brought in on the case.The chief American scientist is played by Sean Connery, who, of course, sounds like a Scotsman. And Miss Wood, who is accompanying a Soviet bigwig played by Brian Keith, seems to have resurrected her ""West Side Story"" Spanish. If only love had a chance to bloom between these two, perhaps the movie would have a bit of momentum. As it is, the suspense is sludgy and the character development nil; even the inadvertent comedy is spotty. The spectacle of Manhattan's demolition is interesting enough, but there's a lot of time-killing before the city actually goes up in flames.Actors in movies like ""Meteor,"" which is standard disaster fare, don't give real performances  they just do time. Miss Wood and Mr. Connery are pleasant but unremarkable, much less riveting than Martin Landau, who seems absolutely unhinged as the general who does all the hollering. Mr. Keith is genial and funny in a role that involves no English dialogue, except for one rude remark about the Dodgers. Mr. Fonda has played the President so often he ought to run.""Meteor"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

Indeed, though the Abe Polonsky screenplay is based on a novel by Colin Forbes, the story about United States and Soviet agents, set mostly aboard a European train, seems to have been lifted from Sir Lew's ""The Cassandra Crossing, but why anyone would want it is difficult to fathom. The movie opens today at the Forum and other theaters.With Lee Marvin, the late Robert Shaw, Maximilian Schell, Mike Connors, Horst Bucholz, Linda Evans and a very sheepish looking Joe Namath, the movie has as many so-called name actors as different locales  Basle, Zurich, Milan, Moscow and the coastal waters off that part of the Netherlands that has mountains.""Avalanche Express"" hasn't any wit but it has a few laughs, such as the sight of Mr. Namath reacting when one actor delivers some startling information to another actor. Apparently told to do something, Joe looks hurt and surprised, as if no one wanted his autograph.The other actors are also at a loss. My favorite scene, though, is the one in which several Central Intelligence Agency men disguise themselves in voluminous monks' habits so as not to attract attention on a sightseeing tour of La Scala. As Maxwell Smart might exclaim, ""The old monks'-habit bit!"" Nobody has had the nerve to use the old monks' habit bit since Robin Hood and his merry men employed it to gain entrance to the archery contest at Prince John's castle.The movie was produced and directed by Mark Robson, and was his last work.

us,"Film: 'French Postcards,' Traps-Atlantic Comedy:Greenhorns in France","THE best parts of ""French Postcards"" are those episodes that capitalize on the characters' sweet navet. They're a group of American college students spending a year in France, and the early section of the movie makes the most of their status as greenhorns. There are subtitles that lovingly translate their wretched French (""Yesterday, we suffer the weather wet . . . but today everything is chestnuts""). There is one boy's alarm as his teacher proudly shows him a room she has decorated in a style she calls ""Eisenhower-50's,"" and identifies one coffee table as ""early Formica.""This teacher, played delectably by Marie-France Pisier, intends to found branches of her institute in every major European city. ""Then what will you do?"" the boy inquires. ""Move to Los Angeles,"" she says sweetly. At moments like this, the movie hones in on the cultural cross-pollenization that has created such phenomena as Le Blue Jean or the French versions of American rock songs that turn up on the soundtrack. It also makes it eminently clear that the Americans' culture- and experience-mongering (""There are 212 important sights in the Michelin Guide, so I don't have time for self-pity,"" one girl writes home) constitutes an utterly hopeless undertaking.The gentle, moderate tone of these touches is perhaps too mild to keep the movie going; in any case, it's a tone that the film makers, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, aren't content to maintain. Midway through the story, which they wrote (Miss Katz produced the film, and Mr. Huyck directed it), the plot dissolves into a series of wild coincidences. It winds up on the night-before-graduation note of ""American Graffiti,"" which Miss Katz and Mr. Huyck also wrote. But it never develops a comparable poignancy, perhaps because the characters' fates have become so implausible.Miss Pisier's schoolmistress, for example, is a very strange creation indeed. The early parts of the film show her to be wonderfully attractive, married to a man (Jean Rochefort) who pays more attention to his mistress, and developing an extracurricular interest in a very handsome, intense student named Alex (David Marshall Grant). Then, perhaps to keep the film from devoting itself to too many dewy romances, her feelings for the boy are made to disappear. Alex, in turn, is sent back-packing through Spain, and when he returns, he becomes conveniently enamored of the screenplay's one leftover young woman. The wheel of fortune does some very loud creaking as it spins.Nevertheless, parts of ""French Postcards,"" which opens today at the Baronet, have considerable charm, even if it is charm with the consistency of bunny-fluff. And the movie introduces some very appealing new players, among them Mr. Grant and Valrie Quennessen, who makes an irresistible French gamine. She is wooed and won by Miles Chapin, who does a funny job with what would have been the Richard Dreyfuss role, before Miss Katz and Mr. Huyck helped make Mr. Dreyfuss famous.Blanche Baker, as the group stick-in-the-mud, is more unyielding than the others, and seems to have less of a flair for comedy than the rest of the cast. But she gets involved in at least one funny episode, as Mandy Patinkin, playing an Iranian travel agent, offers to squire her to a Medieval Culture festival, then kidnaps her in his Cadillac and comes close to killing her with caviar.""French Postcards"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

This pattern continued across the Alleghenies and the Mississippi, and northward from the long chain of Hispanic pueblos, presidios and missions between the Gulf Coast and California. Without such strong points to serve as markets and supply bases, even when military protection was no longer necessary, neither farming nor mining could flourish.

Many of his best photographs of the 20's  his most creative decade  are pure distillations of the Cubist esthetic, which he applied to photography with a good deal of originality and success. Yet, the purity of form we find in those pictures was, for Outerbridge, only one interest among many.

us,ataroo,"Memories. The Times They Are AChangin  were the words with which Bob Dylan won the hearts American youth back in 1963. Now, on the eve of the 1980's, Dylan's declaration seems to be timely once more. The last products of the postwar baby boom, the generation that came of age to the rock n roll Dylan and Elvis Presley, are old enough to be joining the Establishment. Rock may survive in altered forms, but the recent precipitous drop in record album sales and the failure of many concerts to sell out suggest that the end of an era has been reached and the old stars have become proper subjects for nostalgia. These thoughts are prompted by the essays with which Angie Errigo and Steve Leaning have larded The Illustrated History of Rock Album Art (Mayflower, $9.95), one of two handsome Justpublished paperbacks about the world that was rock. Through reproductions of the covers of some 200 albums, beginning with the matter-of-fact mug shots of the in the mid50s through the gimmick-and-joke efforts of Andy Warhol and others in the late 60's to the art-tor-art's sake efforts of the past few years, Miss Errigo and Mr. Leaning document the evolution of the unique form of pop art that pop music inspired. (The quintessential rock album cover reproduced to the right introduced the Beatles to British youth in 1963.

But while such singleminded devotion to bodily movement may not sound like very fertile ground for the development of artistry, funk has become, in the late 1970's, the chosen idiom of some of the most talented and creative contemporary pop musicians.

That prophesied son  Ved Mehta's maternal grandfather, Babuji  led the family out of squalor and superstition, gained wealth and a title, fathered 15 children and died a centenarian in 1973. Mamaji closes in the year 1938 with the author, only 3 and already blind from the effects of meningitis, being taken by his mother (Babuji's daughter, Mamaji) on furtive missions to seers and healers. Despite being a doctor's wife and a lawyer's daughter, she remained convinced, at least in an active part of her, that blindness was a spell to be lifted by prayer and flagellation. But we are now in the modern world, Daddyji's world of Western medicine.

us,W. H. Auden at Oxford,"AUDEN'S beautifully proportioned, oakpanelled rooms [at Oxford) were in the northwest comer of Peckwater Quadrangle (known as Peck), on the third floor. In addition to his sittingroom and bedroom, there was a small cupboardlike space into which a piano had been squeezed and whose walls had been covered by a previous occupant with a startling mural of scarlet and black cubist design, described in due course by Christopher Isherwood as apparently representing a series of railway accidents and copulations between traction engines and pyramids. It was in these rooms that Auden would hold court with the small group of acolytes who began to assemble around him, reading aloud his own poems and those of other poets whose work impressed him. In middle age, Auden tended not so much to converse as to lecture, and even at the age of eighteen his discussions of the poetry of, say, Emily Dickinson or Wilfred Owen were, more often than not, monologues. They were, however, monologues which his listeners found quite fascinating, occasionally as much for the oddly impressive, somewhat portentous manner of his delivery as for his actual words. [John] Betjeman was impressed by Auden's oracular and master and lecturer. He was equally impressed by Auden's refusal to adopt the fashionable undergraduate pose of looking down on one's parents as boring philistines: this young man spoke with af fection and respect of his parents, and of Birmingham and the country around it with interest and, almost, nostalgia.

Indeed, the locals still sometimes refer them as wethers. As we now know, they are the stranded relics of a long geological process that began 40 million years ago. In earlier ages they puzzled and fascinated men. Sir Christopher Wren thought they were cast up by some volcanic explosion; Pepys believed they grew out of the ground, organically. It's not surprising that primitive men felt they had magical potency, for in the dawn mist, or as night falls, they assume strange and terrifying shapes. With enormous labor, using vast gangs of men and primitive sledges, prehistoric societies dragged some these megaliths into rectangular processional avepues, leading to ceremonial circles. Once In place, the massive stones were upended and sunk into shallow pits.
