us,Film: 'Gemini' Transferred to Screen:Growing Pains,"THOUGH Richard Benner's ""Happy Birthday, Gemini,"" which opens at the Beekman and other theaters today, is an exceptionally vulgar screen version of Albert Innaurato's hit Broadway play, ""Gemini,"" it at least raises some interesting questions about what passes for realism on our commercial stage.When the play opened three years ago, it was hailed as an uproarious, realistic comedy, the sort that takes place in a reasonable facsimile of an actual place (a lower-middle-class backyard in South Philadelphia) and is about characters who represent nothing more than their own easily recognized personalities. There are differences between people in real life and characters in such plays, but these differences (including a tendency to talk faster than we do and to bear down hard on punch lines) are simply conventions that stand for realism in the theater. Or so we've been led to believe.It isn't until such a play is transferred to the screen  badly  that we can note that the so-called realistic theater has far less to do with realism than it does with fantasy of a not very liberating sort.This is the service performed by Mr. Benner, who both adapted and directed the movie. Having what I assume were nothing but good intentions, Mr. Benner has ""opened up"" the Innaurato play by moving a lot of the stage action inside the adjoining houses and to other areas in the neighborhood and in downtown Philadelphia. Scenes that are described in the play are dramatized, and characters who are only talked about in the play appear on the screen.Being faithful to the spirit of the stage production, Mr. Benner has also seen fit to preserve a hyperactive style of theatrical performance, which passes for realism on the stage. This not only looks outlandish on the screen, but it also calls fatal attention to the artificial ellipses and exaggerations in what was once a tightly constructed theatrical piece.The result is a disaster. Instead of opening up the Innaurato play, Mr. Benner has effectively dismembered it.This is a film of assorted bits and pieces of characters who originate not in life, but in literature, some of it not of the first freshness.There is the sensitive hero, Francis Geminiani (Alan Rosenberg), a Harvard-educated, opera-loving fellow who, on the eve of his 21st birthday, fears he may be homosexual. Surrounding him are his father (Robert Viharo), a sexually robust, cheek-pinching Sicilian; his father's sharp-talking mistress (Rita Moreno); Francis's two best friends from Harvard (Sarah Holcomb and David Marshall Grant), who are sister and brother and for both of whom Francis has sexual feelings as well as fondness, and the neighborhood's good-time girl (Madeline Kahn), who once played Sadie Thompson in a community theater production of ""Rain"" and has never forgotten the bright lights.Mr. Benner, who won some acclaim a couple of years ago with the Canadian film ""Outrageous,"" seeks both laughter and tears in Francis's quest for a sexual identity, but finds neither. This is possibly because his direction is so insistent, so pushy, we are never allowed to discover anything for ourselves.If the actors aren't overstressing their lines, the camera is picking up lighting effects that scream the mood we're supposed to be feeling. When all else fails, the soundtrack music takes over like a noisy tour guide who won't shut up.The performances are less terrible, I suspect, than evidence of the director's wrongheadedness. This is apparent in scene after scene in which actors we know and respect from other films perform with an intensity and abandon that cannot be supported by the film that surrounds them here. This is especially true of Miss Kahn, Miss Moreno and Mr. Viharo, who is so good in James Caan's ""Hide in Plain Sight.""There is one thing to be said in favor of this movie  it isn't likely to steal business from the play, which is now in its fourth year at the Little Theater on 44th Street.",1980-05-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'On the Nickel' Takes Look at Two Alcoholics:The Cast,"""On the Nickel,"" which opens today at Cinema 2, takes a look at skid-row alcoholism that is sometimes sensitive and almost always sentimental. Directed by Ralph Waite of ""The Waltons,"" the film traces a friendship between two alcoholics, only one of whom is drinking as the story unfolds. Sam (Donald Moffat) has tried to straighten out, although he can't help missing the companionship of his sloshed and streetwise friends. He returns to skid row to try to save C. G., his dearest friend, who is played by Mr. Waite.C. G. is probably past saving, as the film makes clear from the very first. But Sam's return offers Mr. Waite, who also wrote and produced the film, a way of dramatizing the fatal allure of skid-row life. Much of the film has the vague suggestion of a documentary, as it examines the customs of this subculture. Mr. Waite handles this material with generosity and understanding, though he is not always able to lend it shape effectively. Often enough, the movie is as garrulous and rambling as its characters.But eventually C. G.'s predicament becomes dire, and at this point the film perks up. Oddly enough, it has its peppiest moments at a crematorium, where C. G.'s friends execute a bizarre commando raid of sorts, making for an episode that is macabre and funny. The film eventually comes to a lively but maudlin end, once the story line Mr. Waite painstakingly sets up has begun to move along. The early parts of the film have noticeable trouble presenting information and maintaining their momentum at the same time.""On the Nickel,"" which proceeds gently at a low-keyed pace, has been photographed in pretty pastel hues by Ric Waite. Though the subject matter is at times deeply distressing, the film's tone is mild enough to make this prettiness seem perfectly appropriate. Similarly, the fact that the actors playing skid-row characters, notably Penelope Allen, Hal Williams and Jack Kehoe, all seem to be in the bloom of good health, though their makeup looks faintly smudgy, isn't as distracting as it might be in a harder-edged effort.",1980-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'To Fly,' Irresistible Fantasy","THE longest-running and most universally popular film of the last five years was made as a public service, was never entered for an Oscar, is rarely discussed by cinema buffs and has never been shown in a commercial movie house. People come out of the theater convinced that they will never forget it, and all that the you need to see it, even today, is a flat 50 cents in every part of the very large house.The film in question is called ""To Fly,"" and it has been showing since July 1, 1976, at the National Air and Space Museum in the capital. It begins quietly and on a normal-size screen as a mustached balloonist in period costume holds forth in period language about the potential of his strange new hot-air apparatus. And then in no time at all, and across the full stretch of the IMAX screen, which is five stories high and 75 feet wide, we see Vermont as the balloonist saw it nearly 200 years ago.We sway as he swayed. We swing as he swung. When he dips and eddies toward a church tower or flies low over a pair of unsuspecting lovers, we feel as if we could stroke the bells in the steeple, and we smile at the lovers' discomfiture. We float free above an America untouched by the Industrial Revolution, an America in which every leaf in the forest has been brushed and combed for our inspection and never an ugly thing is in sight.It's heady stuff, and it goes on from better to best. We almost but not quite get run down by steam trains that look as if they had come straight from the paint shop. We drive in old automobiles that roll through flawless landscapes with never a jolt or a creak. There is a covered wagon in which everybody has clean clothes and a look of wholesome endeavor. But what matters above all is that we fly. If it is man's destiny to fly, as the commentator assures us, that destiny is fulfilled in ideal conditions throughout the 27-minute run of the film.During that short time, and rarely have minutes passed faster in front of a screen, we fly the right way and very fast, we fly upside-down, a hallucinating sequence, and we roll over and over against backdrops of mountain and ocean, mesa and interminable plain. We fly backward, low and very slowly, downstream over Niagara Falls, and we hang-glide over Hawaii. When the commentator tells us that flying is ""like the opening of a new eye,"" he carries us with him. It is as if the world itself had been made over and we were free to explore it in ways that were also new.""To Fly"" is a poem to noiseless, disinterested, infallible one-person flight. The sound of engines is rarely heard. All flights are for fun, moreover. Those jet fighters have no target in mind as they frolic like mettlesome toys above a paradisical landscape. Just once we glimpse that slave-ship of the 1980's, the commercial airliner, but we never get to see inside it. As for mechanical failure of the kind which in real life brings great enterprises to nought, it is taboo. ""To Fly"" is about the ways in which one privileged person can get a new hold on the world, and very seductive it is, too.""To Fly"" is also about the uncontaminated America that we all long to see and have so much trouble finding. Somebody has done a great job of editing out the deteriorations of which we are daily more conscious at ground level. Not so much as a dead tree, an untidy beach or a blemished ear of wheat gets past the censor. The weather is always perfect. We never get to see a rundown city, a huge and outmoded industrial complex or a countryside that has been ruined forever. What we see is what the historians call ""nature's nation,"" and everywhere and at all times we see it in perfect shapes. For our 50 cents we get to see Wonderland.As for the flying machines that make it possible, they are presented as entirely pacific, puppies with wings, one might say. And if Tom Wolfe in his ""The Real Stuff"" has given you a new idea of what experimental flying is like, do not expect to see that new look foreshadowed here. ""To Fly"" is about flying, not frying.This irresistible fantasy was conceived by Francis Thompson and directed and photographed by James Freeman and Greg MacGillivray, who are old and tried hands at aerial photography. It was financed by Conoco Inc., which has earned for itself the gratitude of vacationers beyond number and will doubtless continue to do so.",1980-05-08T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Charles and Lucie':Bankruptcy Can Be Fun,"CHARLES and Lucie are a middle-aged couple, cranky and impoverished until the day their fortunes magically change. A stranger tells Lucie that a remote relative has died, leaving her a villa in the south of France. He shows her a picture of this dream house, a photograph in which the most prominent details are a keyhole-shaped swimming pool and a large beach ball. She is entranced, and promptly risks her paltry savings to secure the house, which of course does not exist. All this might seem sad if it weren't for the whimsical fashion in which ""Charles and Lucie"" unfolds. It might seem humdrum if it weren't for the beach ball.Nelly Kaplan's ""Charles and Lucie,"" which opens today at the Festival, sometimes strikes a cheerfully absurd note, although just as often its fancifulness falls flat. The film follows Charles and Lucie, played affably by Daniel Ceccaldi and Ginette Garcin, through a series of post-bankruptcy predicaments, even an episode in which they literally lose their shirts and wind up stealing clothes from a scarecrow.These segments aren't closely interwoven, and they don't come to much, but the best of them have a merry irrationality that can be charming. The film is funniest at its most relaxed, and thinnest when it strains for allegory.After they have lost everything  even Nutsy, Lucie's pet squirrel, who Lucie decides to set free in a moment of ill-founded enthusiasm  Charles and Lucie run afoul of the law, then find themselves lost at sea. They eventually return to an Adam-and-Eve-like condition, something Miss Kaplan demonstrates none too ironically by providing them with an apple tree and a snake. After that, they strike it rich and make a last-minute foray into show business.Near the story's awkward ending, Miss Kaplan herself arrives on the scene, playing a fortuneteller who lives in a lavender van. She tells Charles and Lucie they will come into money, although the date of their windfall is something she cannot predict.This development, when it does occur, seems more improbable than absurd, and it doesn't much fit with the rest of the material. The film has an easier time with light comedy than it does with political or economic satire.Mr. Ceccaldi and Miss Garcin both emphasize the comic vitality of their characters and neither player strays into overstatement. While Miss Garcin's Lucie frets and bustles furiously, Mr. Ceccaldi exudes a supreme laziness tempered by concern. The movie's sweetest scene finds Charles and Lucie in a bathhouse, which Lucie has bargained their way into by giving away a gold necklace, her only valuable possession. At the end of the scene, Charles discovers what Lucie has done, and the poignancy of the moment seems forced. Before that, as Lucie lies exhausted in the tub, nearly sleeping, and Charles looks on with quiet concern, the scene exerts an emotional pull that feels much more real.",1980-05-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Maxwell Smart Returns in 'Nude Bomb':Clothing in Peril Chinese Dance Program at St. John's,"WHEN KAOS, the dread international terrorist ring, threatens to destroy the world's clothing with what becomes known as ""the nude bomb,"" the second person you think of is Maxwell Smart (Don Adams), Agent 86, who for five years (1965-69) saved mankind from similar sorts of disasters on the hugely popular half-hour television series ""Get Smart.""Of course, the first person you think of is James Bond, the fellow Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created Maxwell Smart to send up, but that was back in the days when it was still possible to send up the Ian Fleming character, before James Bond had rendered parody suddenly neutral by assuming that task himself.Now for reasons not entirely sound, though they are cheerful enough, a lot of nice people have put their heads together to bring Maxwell Smart/Don Adams to the theater screen in a feature-length motion picture, ""The Nude Bomb,"" which opens today at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters. It's not a question of too little, too late, but of too much, too long. The really awful truth is that ""The Nude Bomb"" isn't as funny as ""Moonraker,"" the most recent Bond movie that came out last summer.Though Mr. Adams is a very winning comic actor, the bumbling Maxwell Smart isn't strong enough to carry any film that's anything less than one long inspiration, which ""The Nude Bomb"" isn't. The script, written by Arne Sultan, Bill Dana and Leonard B. Stern and directed by Clive Donner, relies much of the time on parodies of James Bond's gadgets, which are difficult to do without a James Bond-sized production budget, on badly timed slapstick routines, and on the kind of mildly vulgar dialogue that would have been unthinkable in the far-off era of the 60's in which Maxwell Smart is forever stuck.The movie opens promisingly with a sky-diving sequence that effectively recalls the even wilder opening of ""Moonraker."" There are some attractive people in the supporting cast and every now and then a situation or a speech that summons up some of the lunacy of the original Brooks-Henry collaboration.This includes a solemnly hilarious explanation by Larabee (Robert Karvelas), one of Maxwell Smart's aides who's even dumber than he is, of why, should worst come to worst, there would be a silver lining in any cloud created by the detonation of a nude bomb. ""Then,"" says Larabee, ""people might start to wear food!"" His reasoning is, actually, rather good.I also liked a speech in which a villain, played earnestly by Vittorio Gassman, turns on Mr. Big, who is supposed to be all of Bond's Mr. Bigs rolled together, and says with haughty impatience, ""You lost your eye, your arm, your leg and your larnyx. What IS wrong with you?""However, the movie has very little blood of its own. This is most apparent in the big, badly staged comic sequences, including a comic chase around the Universal Pictures backlot, which goes on much longer than a commercial should, and the climactic confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the laboratory of the would-be nude-bomb launchers.Mr. Adams is best in short takes. He's funny when he's demonstrating his idea of ""the fireman's carry,"" which means to push someone like a wheel barrow, but the character is so shadow-thin you keep seeing through it to the mechanics of the movie. That is not fun.I'm also impatient with any Maxwell Smart movie without the beautiful, gifted Barbara Feldon, who is as much responsible for our fond memories of ""Get Smart"" as Mr. Adams. Note: She can be seen now on the New York stage in the new play ""Past Tense.""""The Nude Bomb,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains vulgar language.Traditional Chinese dance and a blend of Eastern and Western dance will be performed by the Chinese Dance Company tomorrow at 8 P.M. at St. John's University, Union Turnpike and Utopia Parkway, Queens. The 30-member troupe will perform six varieties of folk and classical dances, including the harvest dance, the white snake dance and the ribbon dance. They will also perform a dance that merges traditional Chinese and modern American styles. A show of acrobatics is planned as well. Tickets are $3.50 ($2 for students and the elderly). Information: 969-8000, extension 582.The performance coincides with ""Monkey King: A Celestial Heritage,"" a free exhibition of 150 objects connected with Chinese performing arts from the 18th to the 20th century. On view are musical instruments, puppets and costumes. The exhibition, in Sun Yat-sen Hall, is open 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. today, tomorrow and Sunday.",1980-05-09T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Friday the 13th,' Horror At Middle-Class Summer Camp:The Cast","Betsy Palmer has star billing in ""Friday the 13th,"" but she doesn't appear until the end of the movie. Why is that so? I'm going to let the cat out of the bag, because the casting is telltale anyhow, and because it may save someone wear and tear. Miss Palmer plays the murderer, and by the time she has materialized on screen she has already killed a half dozen nubile young camp counselors, for reasons it would be futile to try to explain. All these nice kids have been perforated in various ways on the day of the title, and yet Miss Palmer appears in a pale sweater that is very, very clean. Movie magic!In view of the above disclosure, it may not be necessary for anyone to wait for Miss Palmer to be beheaded in the movie's denouement, although she does at last get her sweater dirty in this scene. The same goes for the post-finale, a kind of sneaky coda, which anyone who saw ""Carrie"" will find phenomenally familiar.""Friday the 13th,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, was produced and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who is known as the producer of ""Last House on the Left,"" except in those circles where he isn't known at all. Mr. Cunningham's brand of horror is reasonably suspenseful, though none too new: a nice young counselor wanders away from the other counselors, and the audience waits nervously for the ax to fall. It falls smack into somebody's forehead on at least one memorable occasion.More interesting than the bloodshed, somehow, is the middle-class ordinariness with which Mr. Cunningham invests the characters' conversations; they seem to be inciting the killer's fury by chatting about vitamins and playing Monopoly. The counselors are played by a cast of pleasant newcomers, and what happens to them really is a shame.Mr. Cunningham often zeroes in closely on his victims from the killer's point of view, but he doesn't always use this device fairly. Sometimes the camera really does turn out to represent the standpoint of a diabolical crackpot. Sometimes it's just a camera.",1980-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Max Linder Shorts:Pre-Chaplin,"THE program at the Film Forum is a tribute to the rakish Max Linder, a pioneer of silent-film comedy who was credited as a major influence by Charlie Chaplin. The show, entitled ""Max,"" consists of three short films dating from the early 1920's, and there are parts of it that readily justify Mr. Linder's reputation. The program will be shown from tonight through Sunday at 7:45 P.M., and next week from Thursday through Sunday at the same time.""Be My Wife"" and ""Seven Years' Bad Luck"" are the funnier films, both made in Hollywood in 1921 (Mr. Linder, a Frenchman who died in 1925, did much of his work in his native land before going to California). Mr. Linder, who produced, wrote, directed and also stars in these films, plays a mustachioed fellow at once more elegant and more coarse than the Little Tramp. Stylishly dressed, and with a gentlemanly air  at the happy ending of ""Be My Wife,"" he is followed by seven tiny offspring, all of them in top hats  Mr. Linder also played something of a roughneck. And he could combine these qualities deftly. In this same film, he abruptly hides a poodle in a water pitcher, after the dog has interfered with his courtship of a demure young lady.He also begins a mirror-image routine, apparently a forerunner of the Marx Brothers' mirror gag in ""Duck Soup,"" by showing his relief when a crashing noise is identified as the sound of the man next door jumping out a window  at least this means his expensive new mirror hasn't broken. But it has, it turns out. And Mr. Linder's servants take turns behind the empty frame, mimicking his movements to convince him the mirror is intact. This segment is executed with remarkable comic finesse, as is a later episode in which Mr. Linder copies a larger man's walk, trying to wangle a free train ride. He even turns corners without being seen.The third film, ""The Three Must-Get-Theres,"" is much broader than the others, and Mr. Linder's funny foppishness is used to less successful advantage. All three films are introduced by some brief remarks from Ren Clair, and accompanied by Gerald Calvi's sometimes overly emphatic score.",1980-05-15T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film 'Fame' Opens, Bubbling With Life:The Long, Long Road","""FAME"" is a jubilant, hugely entertaining movie by a man whose principal directing experience has been the making of commercials, and so it is happier, sexier and a little bit livelier than life. That's no problem, most of the way through; it simply makes ""Fame"" a film to be enjoyed and taken lightly.The cast is full of glowing newcomers, the score is emphatically upbeat, and the action moves swiftly from character to character, stringing together a lot of subplots in quick succession.""Fame"" runs into trouble only when it tries to turn wistful. Alan Parker, its director, seems to know everything about making his characters superficially appealing and little about what makes them tick.""Fame,"" which opens today at the Ziegfeld theater, is set at the High School of Performing Arts, where it follows a big, rambling band of characters from their first auditions to graduation day. The audition sequence that begins the film lasts nearly half an hour, and it is spectacular, the best thing ""Fame"" has to offer. Mr. Parker moves nimbly from one hilariously hair-raising tryout to another, capturing these teenagers' hopes, their silliness, their promise.One girl gets through an acting audition by playing 0. J. Simpson's role as he waited for an elevator in ""The Towering Inferno."" A boy with an impenetrable New York accent stumbles his way through ""Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"" until a weary acting teacher lets him know he's reading the girl's part. A budding composer arrives for a music tryout trailing six pieces of a synthesizer and half his family. Mr. Parker makes all of this deliciously funny, and it races along flawlessly, without missing a beat. The actors aren't uncommonly handsome, but they're all photographed in a style that makes them beautiful, so near it seems you can reach right out and touch them, and bathed in a warm, sunny light. All of ""Fame"" looks like this; all of a Coca-Cola ad looks like this, too. Whatever ""Fame"" is selling, it comes in the prettiest, shiniest package the movies have lately seen.Each of Mr. Parker's two previous features, ""Bugsy Malone"" and ""Midnight Express,"" had its own overpowering sense of style. ""Fame,"" which is by far Mr. Parker's most successful effort, has a comparably impenetrable quality, but the surface is so slick an audience simply glides along as the movie juggles its vignettes. Ralph (Barry Miller) sometimes imagines he's Freddie Prinze. Doris (Maureen Teefy) has a stage mother and a blossoming ambition. Coco (Irene Cara) wants desperately to be a singer, and her talent is so evident she seems well on her way. Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray) is a showstopping dancer and the Don Juan of the classroom, but he may not make it through high school if he does not learn how to read.""Fame"" whirls past dozens of incidental characters, like the pretty young teacher (Debbie Allen) who nearly swoons at Leroy's audition, or the sterner, more experienced teacher (Anne Meara) whose tart tongue and unflinching manner keep her classes in line. It also frequently breaks into song, into big, noisy, raucous musical interludes to which Mr. Parker brings his utmost flair. These numbers don't always fit the film, but no one seems to care. ""Hot Lunch,"" set in the school cafeteria, is a routine everyone breaks into with no particular spontaneity  even though the film's style has been fairly naturalistic up until this point, and the sight of dozens of dancers executing Louis Falco's choreography utterly ruptures the mood.Eventually, Mr. Parker winds up playing some unnecessary tricks. Coco, who has been seen sitting in a Howard Johnson's in Times Square at the beginning of her freshman year, is approached in the very same restaurant several years later by a bogus Frenchman, who tries to lure her into a pornographic film; she would have to be trs stupid to fall for this, but by now the movie is determined to turn sad. Montgomerey (Paul McCrane) announces and bemoans his homosexuality, in a speech so self-pitying it drew hisses at one screening. Lisa (Laura Dean) appears to jump in front of a subway train after a teacher dresses her down  only she doesn't jump, she isn't even thinking of jumping. This is just Mr. Parker's notion of an ironic twist.",1980-05-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'The Long Riders,' With Gangs of the West:Oh Brothers!","WALTER HILL'S trick of casting teams of brothers in ""The Long Riders"" is almost as eye-catching as his identically costumed gang members in ""The Warriors."" And this time Mr. Hill may have done a better job of building a whole film upon what is essentially a gimmick. ""The Long Riders"" isn't as showy as ""The Warriors,"" but its best segments have a distinctive rhythm. Even its languid moments hold a certain fascination, what with Ric Waite's handsome photography and a cast that Noah might envy.The film is slow and only vaguely speculative, though, without much story to give it shape. The James brothers, played by Stacy and James Keach, and the Youngers (David, Keith and Robert Carradine), with their cohorts the Millers (Randy and Dennis Quaid), are eventually done in by the Fords (Christopher and Nicholas Guest). Though it culminates in an extravagant slow-motion bloodbath, the film largely concentrates on small, symmetrical details in the gang members' lives. They are seen romancing women who strangely resemble them, or rising from their various beds on the same morning, or engaging in a night's recreation at the local saloon. Mr. Hill weaves their gestures together with a portentous elegance that promises a great deal that it never delivers.""The Long Riders,"" which opens today at the Manhattan 1 and other theaters, has at its heart a question about the resonance of legends. But this matter is addressed uncertainly, by a terse screenplay and by a few key performances that are problematically stony. The best parts of the film are those that simply summon up an atmosphere and let the actors revel in one another's company. The Carradines are particularly skillful at this, especially David, whose long-haired, sardonic Cole Younger is the movie's grand old man. ""I'm writing a book about my exploits as a gentleman and a lover,"" he announces to Frank James, played by Stacy Keach. ""I expect a free copy,"" James replies. ""You gotta pay, Frank,"" drawls Younger. ""You gotta pay.""The James gang, on the lam during much of the movie, is cornered in a barn for a shootout that marks one or the most startling and effective sequences here. Superbly edited by David Holden, it has a prelude that shows the gang members inside the barn, trading quick remarks that say little but establish a sharp, vigorous rhythm. When the gunplay begins, the same rhythm seems to escalate a beat, until the episode takes on a breathless urgency. It moves at a thrilling rate, although where it's going remains indeterminate. The chief virtues of ""The Long Riders""  a physical loveliness, attention to historical detail, the intermingling of all those matching faces, Ry Cooder's rousing score  make its underlying opaqueness a real disappointment.""The Long Riders"" has the kind of studied simplicity that is only arrived at circuitously. And in the process Mr. Hill somehow manages to silence himself; the film has a choked feeling, as if it can't quite bring itself to take a stand. ""The Warriors"" had a similar air, and a wilder bravado, and it seemed more like a clash of violent extremes. This time, the mixture is gentler, and it allows the actors more room, which is a tremendous help. In roles that are only barely distinguishable from one another, these bands of famous brothers posture exquisitely, and the camera plays wonderful tricks with their faces. All of this works well enough, but ""The Long Riders"" needed something more.",1980-05-16T05:00:00+0000

Some of it looks like ""Animal House,"" some of it looks like ""American Graffiti,"" and none of it looks like anything new. This film is so crazily derivative that for a while it seems to have comic prospects, though they come to nothing in a hurry. Sadly enough, Mr. Mutrux doesn't seem to be fooling.""The Hollywood Knights,"" which opened Friday at Loews State and other theaters, mingles blond surfers and New York suburban types in a setting that, though it's called Beverly Hills, is probably somewhere in Ohio. The year is 1965, the night is Halloween, and most of the jokes are of the bathroom variety. Midway through the movie, four members of the title fraternity relieve themselves in a punch bowl at a party, and that's about as hilarious as ""Hollywood Knights"" ever gets.Mr. Mutrux has assembled a record number of unrelated subplots, the better to foster the illusion that his film has a story. One Knight (Gary Graham) is supposed to be leaving for Vietnam the next day, and this is an occasion for his buddies to look soggy and present him with a new hot-rod, a going-away present. (Will he be needing a car in combat?) Another Knight (Tony Danza) is having a long, serious, boring discussion with his gorgeous girlfriend about their future. She doesn't want to be a carhop forever, she says, although hers is the movie's most interesting occupation by a mile.In the strangest of the subplots, four white Knight pledges are sent to Watts naked and told they must persuade a Watts disc jockey to play a dedication to Tubby's, the fraternity's favorite drive-in restaurant, which (who says this movie isn't sad?) is going to close forever the next day. Well, these fellows steal dresses and sheets from a few Watts clotheslines and then they meet four black men singing a song, a capella, in the street.The singers, who may or may not be a reminder of Mr. Mutrux's far more palatable ""American Hot Wax,"" stand by quizzically while the fraternity boys explain about hazing and burgers and Beverly Hills. It seems unimaginable that they will trot right off to the radio station to oblige these privileged idiots, but that's what Mr. Mutrux has them do.",1980-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Robots Return In 'Empire Strikes':'Star Wars' Sequel,"IF George Lucas makes good on his promise to turn ""Star Wars"" into a parade of nine films and spend several years on the making of each of them, we may all be pretty long in the tooth before this story gets told. However, on the evidence of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" we won't be bored. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is very much a sequel, which is to say that it expands on the first film but never outstrips it, and that it can't stand alone. But on its own terms, it's a success, because ""Star Wars"" was such an uncommonly hard act to follow. It's no small wonder that the first film has been followed at all.""The Empire Strikes Back,"" which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters, finds the ""Star Wars"" regulars retrenching for the long haul. Instead of trying to match the original film's momentum, the present effort concentrates on laying groundwork for a more extended story. So it offers hints and clues and riddles that may take eons to unravel, in exchange for the first film's happy-go-lucky humor. The jokes seem more closely geared to children this time, and there aren't nearly as many of them. Compared to its predecessor, the present film is just as polished and technically proficient, but seldom as lighthearted and seldom as much fun.The plot, which asks more insistently to be taken seriously this time, first finds the three human principals and their two robots and one Wookie on an ice planet, where the film's most spectacular battle scene takes place, very early in the story, because the new film takes little trouble to establish its own beginning, middle and end. This battle involves an attack by war machines that look like metal dinosaurs, and it is resolved when Luke Skywalker runs a tiny cord around the legs of one of these behemoths, causing it to trip.Aside from featuring some of the new film's fanciest special effects, this sequence has a welcome touch of the old ""Star Wars"" impishness, which is strangely absent from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" too much of the time. The first film's offhanded gags have virtually been cast in bronze; the comic shabbiness of all the space gadgetry, for example, has been expanded from a casual giggle to a full-scale running gag. And the dialogue, fueled with a heightened spirit of adventure the first time around, is more wooden now. Luke Skywalker and a fellow warrior, talking on the eve of a battle: ""Right now I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself."" ""I know what you mean.""Irvin Kershner, who directed the present film, and Mr. Lucas, who produced it and was an adviser, have made the only sensible choice between the alternatives of imitating ""Star Wars"" or trying to outdistance it: they aim for a little of both. So some of the space-flight sequences or other special effects recall the first film, and others, like the visit with Yoda, are marked departures. Yoda is a two-foot gnome  he looks like the kind of tiny figure one might find in a novelty shop, with an inscription reading ""Have a Lousy Day""  and his pointy, mobile ears are one of the movie's great marvels. Just as clever, and just as noticeably different from the first film's highlights, are a race through an asteroid shower and a mysterious cavern that licks its chops as our heroes zoom away.Much of the dialogue concerns Luke Skywalker and his sacred mission, the full shape of which will not be made clear until a future episode. But Luke, as played by Mark Hamill, can be a ponderous fellow, and this time Harrison Ford's Han Solo steals the show. Mr. Ford slips easily into the film's comic-book conversational style, and he also brings a real air of tragedy to Han's fate, which is another thing we won't exactly know about until next time.So he goes to what may or may not be his doom with a grand show of nobility, flinging his head back and staring bravely ahead. For this alone he seems to deserve Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), with whom he has a flirtation fraught with pre-adolescent sarcasm. (""Kiss you? I'd sooner kiss a Wookie!"" ""That can be arranged."") Princess Leia, bright-eyed and snappish as ever, is seen fixing equipment and driving the spaceship from time to time, as if someone were concerned with offering positive role models for children in the audience.Accordingly, it's too bad that the character played by Billy Dee Williams, the story's only black principal (with the possible exception of Darth Vader, whose voice is supplied most effectively by James Earl Jones), is exaggeratedly unctuous, untrustworthy and loaded with jive.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is often grainier and grimier looking than its predecessor. It's also considerably more violent, what with one shot of a space-creature's intestines and a couple of bloodless amputations that no one seems to mind. Luke Skywalker, for instance, loses his hand in one sequence, and gets a new hand soon after, without even complaining about his injury. Perhaps small children in the audience will find this hard to understand. I know I did.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a few violent episodes, as mentioned above.",1980-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Die Laughing' With Robby Benson:Monkey Business,"THE best that can be said for ""Die Laughing"" is that it's a mystifying thing, because Robby Benson is co-writer, co-producer and star in a film that shows him off to so little advantage. Mr. Benson, in what must have been intended as a combination thriller-comedy-love story-musical, manages to make himself seem ill-suited to any of these genres, let alone a messy mlange of them all.""Die Laughing,"" which opens today at Loews State and other theaters, features Mr. Benson as a taxi driver whose dream is to sing. He is a terrible taxi driver; we know that because his cab has a dangling fender and because his first taxi-driving sequence shows him pulling up onto a curb, in a gesture too broadly dopey for most television sit-coms. He is also not much of a singer, although the film's point is otherwise. It features a number of his songs, including one that wins him a talent competition, though the punk band that plays before him sounds considerably better.Mr. Benson's cabby falls into a furiously frivolous story involving murder, intrigue and the kidnapping of a monkey that has memorized a scientific formula that can wreck the world. The archvillain of the piece is Bud Cort, dismally overplaying an effete meanie, and among Mr. Cort's cohorts are a lineup of unappealing bit players specially chosen for their nasty faces. This is perhaps meant to contrast unfavorably with Mr. Benson and his romantic co-star (Linda Grovenor), since they both have pert profiles and the fluffiest of hair. But Mr. Benson's adorableness becomes such a weight upon the film that the heavies begin to seem a welcome relief.""Die Laughing"" has been directed at a hysterical pitch by Jeff Werner so that Mr. Benson's most feverishly dramatic scenes almost look like silent-movie comedy. The soundtrack is full of loud, shocking noises. Most of them turn out to be the sound of the monkey leaping pleasantly onto someone's neck.""Die Laughing"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It features a number of violent incidents.",1980-05-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie: McQueen Stars in 'Tom Horn':One of a Dying Breed,"""TOM HORN"" has a number of things to recommend it, chief among them the redoubtable Steve McQueen. Mr. McQueen makes his return to the screen after too long a hiatus, as he moves sternly and gracefully through the role of a former frontiersman who can't make his peace with the new gentility of the old West. The film itself is schematic and often slow, and nothing else about it has the idiosyncratic fire of Mr. McQueen's performance. But its slack stretches are fairly negligible, and the best episodes are worth waiting for.The director, William Wiard, has an exhausting fondness for sunsets, and a predilection for fancy effects he can't quite manage; all of the film's more ambitiously eye-catching moments wind up calling undue attention to themselves. The setting for ""Tom Horn,"" which opens today at the New York I and other theaters, is an enormous, mountain-ringed plain, and the film begins as Mr. McQueen rides into this lovely locale, casting a tall shadow and so forth.He is quickly established as an Indian tracker whose legend precedes him, and as a man who approaches trouble with a wry confidence. No sooner has he arrived in town than Gentleman Jim Corbett, the prizefighter, challenges him to a bout. Tom Horn sounds dubious, and asks, ""If I win this fight, then am I the champion of the world?""""You're not big enough,"" says Gentleman Jim.""Well then, what're you pickin' on a little feller like me for?"" Horn inquires.The movie turns dull and shapeless during a long portion about Horn's career foiling rustlers; he is hired by one of the town's foremost ranchers, played sturdily by Richard Farnsworth, to protect cattle. Eventually, Horn falls in love with a stunning schoolmarm (played by Linda Evans) and is framed for a murder, events neither Mr. Wiard's direction nor the wisecracking screenplay (by Thomas McGuane and Bud Shrake) can comfortably connect. Horn, who has been incarcerated once before, long ago  ""for invasion of Mexico,"" he explains  is jailed and tried. ""They say he's runnin' for office again, and if he convicts you, he'll be a big hero,"" someone says of the prosecutor. ""He needs to hang you to get elected.""The year is 1903, and Tom Horn is part of a dying breed and knows it. Mr. McQueen lends Horn a grace and resignation that stay understated even when the film turns clumsily emphatic. And the sadness he brings to the role is quietly, effectively pervasive. He seems at once on a grander and smaller scale than the rest of the movie, offering tiny, pared-down gestures against those grand landscapes. And even when the film's relative ordinariness does little to aggrandize his character, he rises to heroic stature.",1980-05-23T05:00:00+0000

During that time, it and its spinoff, ""The $1.98 Beauty Show,"" which has also been canceled, retired television's bad-taste trophy.Even so, there were connoisseurs of low, or lowest, comedy who found them at least intermittently hilarious, and the same can be said of ""The Gong Show Movie,"" which opened Friday at the National and other theaters.The story, which tends to disappear frequently in a swamp of vulgarity, is at least true to life. Everywhere he goes, Chuck Barris, one of the creators of ""The Gong Show,"" its producer and master of ceremonies, who plays himself, is surrounded by people who want to do their numbers for him.At the same time, he is being bullied by a network executive who keeps warning him about the show's grossness, and comforted by Robin Altman, his girlfriend on-screen and off.Facing an emotional breakdown, Mr. Barris flees to the center of the Sahara. In a scene that echoes the ending of Federico Fellini's ""8,"" he imagines himself surrounded by the most freakish of the acts he has been presenting.As a director and actor, Mr. Barris is stunningly amateurish. Seldom have such poor camera placement, lighting and sound been encountered in a major studio film. However, his supporting players and many of the television show's most vile acts keep the laughs coming.James B. Douglas plays the network executive with the proper coating of smarm. Mabel King, as Mr. Barris's secretary, Jaye P. Morgan as one of the judges on the show, and Murray Langston, a comic who wears a paper bag over his head, all perform creditably.Robert Downey, who was responsible for ""Greaser's Palace"" and ""Putney Swope"" among other offbeat films, collaborated with Mr. Barris on the screenplay. It seems likely that at least some of the more lunatic moments in ""The Gong Show Movie"" should be attributed to him.",1980-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Canterbury Tales':Chaucer a la Pasolini,"PIER PAOLO PASOLINI'S ""The Canterbury Tales"" is so totally confused one can't be sure whether the film that opens today at Cinema II is really Mr. Pasolini's or whether essential bits and pieces have been lost or cut since it was made eight years ago, and when it took the top prize at the 1972 Berlin Film Festival.One thing is verifiable: ""The Canterbury Tales"" is the second of the three multinarrative films made by Mr. Pasolini in the first half of the 70's. The first  and by far the most successful  was ""The Decameron"" (1971) and the last ""A Thousand and One Nights (1974), a series of mostly homoerotic fantasies that are of interest principally for the way Mr. Pasolini once attempted to justify them as attacks on contemporary Western European decadence.As is apparent to anyone who sat through ""Salo,"" Mr. Pasolini's adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's ""120 Days in Sodom,"" which he completed in 1975, shortly before he was murdered, this curious Italian director's last films are virtually spellbound by their depictions of the depravity made possible by the social and political institutions he abhorred.Though ""The Canterbury Tales"" is X-rated, it's not pornographic in the hard-core way of ""Deep Throat."" There are a lot of nudity (mostly of young men who have the air of male hustlers) and a good deal of emphasis on scatology that, in Chaucer, is bawdily comic but, in this film, is aggressively infantile. The movie ends with a vision of hell that borrows  though not very successfully  from Hieronymus Bosch, whose fantasies were clearly of more immediate interest to Mr. Pasolini than Chaucer's tales.The movie, being released in New York in its English-language version, uses eight of the more familiar tales, and unreels behind an almost impenetrable sound barrier. Though Mr. Pasolini shot much of the film in England with a cast of English and Italian actors, both professional and amateur, the voices of everyone, from Hugh Griffith and Alan Webb to Laura Betti and Ninetto Davoli, have been very sloppily postsynchronized. Adding to the confusion is the narrative continuity, which is so slapdash one can't always be sure when one tale has ended and another has begun.Nor do Chaucer's euphemisms and his courtly, mock-distaste for the not-so-shocking details he must disclose have much to do with Mr. Pasolini's method. This is to show everything possible, short of hard-core porn, embellished with 20th-century kinkinesses that are the director's own obsessions.Because of the terrible soundtrack, it's impossible to judge the performances fairly, though Mr. Griffith and Josephine Chaplin work very energetically in ""The Merchant's Tale,"" and Miss Betti, even if she's badly miscast, is a most appealing, though very tiny, Wife of Bath.Mr. Davoli, an Italian actor without wit or charm, comes close to being offensive in ""The Cook's Tale,"" a segment of the film apparently meant to be an homage to Charlie Chaplin but looks, instead, like a low blow to the memory of a great comedian.Mr. Pasolini himself shows up from time to time as Chaucer, sitting in front of a writing desk, smiling unpleasantly as he takes quill in hand to record yet another failed joke.",1980-05-30T05:00:00+0000
