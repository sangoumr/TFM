The first-base coach, Tony Perez, has replaced DeMars, whom Rose picked in 1985.

DeMars, who is reportedly paid about $80,000 a year as one of the major leagues' best-paid hitting coaches, announced last weekend he was leaving when the season ends after Bill Bergesch, the general manager, asked Perez to help work with some of the team's hitters. Bergesch said that he had approached DeMars about giving up some of his role to Perez.

Martinho Da Vila, the renowned Brazilian samba master, kicks off a monthlong World Music Festival celebrating S.O.B.'s fifth anniversary with a three-night engagement beginning this evening. Mr. Da Vila started his career in 1957, at the age of 19, by composing the popular samba ''Carlos Gomes.'' In 1969, he recorded the first of 19 highly successful albums, during the course of which he perfected the intimate lyrical style of samba known as ''partido alto.'' The music on his newest album, ''Batuqueiro,'' is a deliciously festive exploration of different styles of Brazilian party music. Show times are 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. tonight and tomorrow and at 10 P.M. and midnight on Sunday. Tickets are $16.50 through Ticketron and $18.50 at the door. Information: 243-4940 The Brandos, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street (982-4452). The Brandos, a rising young rock quartet, make sturdy, grim-spirited guitar-based rock in the mold of Creedence Clearwater Revival. Their song ''Walk on the Water'' is included on their debut album, ''Honor Among Thieves'' (Relativity). Among other downbeat subjects, the band's songs deal with wife-beating (''A Matter of Survival''), the horrors of war (''Gettysburg''), poverty and theft (''Honor Among Thieves''), and killers on the loose (''Nothing to Fear''). The group's lead singer, guitarist and chief songwriter, Dave Kinkaid, has an appropriately gritty snarl, and the arrangements are taut and gleaming. The Brandos are headlining a four-act bill that includes J. J. Jumpers, Rude Buddha and Mercy Land. Show time is tomorrow at 10:30 P.M., and tickets are $7. Information: 982-4052. John Abercrombie Trio and Azimuth, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 27th Street (533-7902). A guitar lyricist whose style retains an echo of the blues, John Abercrombie is leading a trio that includes Marc Johnson, a bassist, and Peter Erskine, a drummer. Long, liquid guitar lines and gently shaded dynamics make for luxuriantly cerebral jazz. Azimuth (Norma Winstone, vocalist; Kenny Wheeler, trumpeter and fluegelhornist, and John Taylor, pianist) offers moody, impressionistic set pieces that have the meandering flow of pleasant daydreams. Show times tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight and on Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M. There is a $12.50 music charge and a $7.50 minimum. Pop Album of the Week: Susannah McCorkle: ''Dream'' (Pausa). Susannah McCorkle, the silky-voiced pop-jazz singer whose lingering phrases recall Billie Holiday, is the rare saloon singer whose ear is equally well attuned to pre-rock standards and contemporary songs. The title song of her latest album is the Johnny Mercer standard, treated here to a wistfully languid pop-jazz interpretation. The record's most revelatory performance is of Paul Simon's ''Train in the Distance,'' which Ms. McCorkle reveals to be a natural jazz ballad, delivering its ''grass-is-always-greener'' philosophy in sly, looping vocal lines. Other high points are a deeply torchy ''Just for a Thrill'' and Leiber and Stoller's little-known slice of American nostalgia ''Longings for a Simpler Time.'' The album personnel include Ben Aronovo, a pianist; Steve LaSpina, a bassist; Joe Cocuzzo, a drummer; Gene Bertoncini, a guitarist, and Frank Wess, a tenor saxophonist.",1987-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Hatcher Suspended,"A. Bartlett Giamatti, president of the National League, issued a 10-day suspension to Billy Hatcher of the Houston Astros yesterday for using an altered bat. Hatcher was not available for comment, but Dick Wagner, the general manager, said Hatcher had told him he would not appeal the suspension, which took effect immediately. Manager Hal Lanier of the Astros was fined an undisclosed sum because Giamatti holds that a manager is responsible for illegal equipment used by his players. Hatcher was ejected from the game against the Chicago Cubs Tuesday after his bat splintered, revealing cork in the center. Hatcher, the team's leading hitter, will miss eight games, including a crucial three-game series beginning Monday against the division-leading San Francisco Giants. Kevin Gross of the Philadelphia Phillies and Joe Niekro of the American League Minnesota Twins were suspended earlier this season for 10 days after sandpaper was discovered in their possession. Meanwhile, both major leagues have rejected a Texas firm's pitch to use its high-tech scanning equipment to check for cork, rubber and other foreign substances in baseball bats. The offer came from Scientific Management Systems Inc., an Austin firm that uses computer industrial tomography to check jet engine turbines, automobile engine blocks, space shuttle parts and other equipment. The system is an X-ray-like process that produces an inside look at an item without damaging it. Jim Kay, the company's vice president, said the process is better than medical X-rays, such as the ones used by the leagues, for bat checking. The company offered to check suspected bats at no charge.",1987-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Out Guide; Labor Day Weekend,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. BRIDGE CAFE, #279 Water Street (227-3344) - *(Jan. 27, 1984) Choosing a restaurant on a holiday weekend poses some difficulties, but this one -situated at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, not far from the South Street Seaport - is open for lunch and dinner throughout. You might start with chicken quenelles with shrimp fume; sea scallops in puff pastry with fresh mint and tarragon, or soft-shell crabs - with scallion butter - which can be ordered either as an appetizer or entree. Main dishes include roast duck with green peppercorn sauce; pan-fried brook trout with white wine, saffron and chives, and cold poached halibut with mustard, orange and fresh coriander dressing. Dinner entrees $11.50 to $15.95. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, noon to 3:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, noon to 3:30 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.; Labor Day, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight. DOCKS, #2427 Broadway, near 90th Street (724-5588) - *(Feb. 6, 1987) This sparkling black-and-white tiled fish house on upper Broadway might answer your needs this holiday weekend. It is an ambitious place that offers an ever-changing assortment of fish - from fresh tuna and mako shark to jackfish and Mediterranean rouget - as well as a broad sampling of clams and oysters. Recommended dishes are light and crisp calamari rings with a smoky cumin-laced hot sauce; steamed giant New Zealand mussels in a saffron cream broth; grilled Norwegian salmon, and the special bouillabaisse-type dishes that are sometimes featured. Dinner entrees $8 to $18. Fridays and Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to 1 A.M.; Sundays, 10:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.; Labor Day, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight. PETALUMA, #1356 First Avenue, at 73d Street (772-8800) - *(May 3, 1985) This expansive multitiered peach-colored restaurant with a long bar and open kitchen is a convivial East Side dining spot. Appetizer options include smoked tuna with marinated artichokes; antipasto, and a combination of fried mozzarella with fried zucchini. For a main course, you might select a pasta of gnocchi with a creamy tomato sauce; grilled swordfish with tomatoes and capers; grilled red snapper with fresh herbs, or veal chop sauteed with fresh sage.

PIG HEAVEN, #1540 Second Avenue, at 80th Street (744-4333) - **(Dec. 28, 1984) The whimsy of the barnyard motif, from the giant wooden piglet holding a menu card at the front door to the frieze of pigs all around the dining room, belies the seriousness and authenticity of the Chinese food offered here. You might start with dumplings, fried, boiled or steamed; cold hacked chicken in a combination of sesame paste and hot oil, or sesame-flavored scallion pancakes. Good main-dish selections are the Cantonese-style suckling pig with its brittle skin and juicy meat; minced pork sauteed with corn, bell peppers and pine nuts; whole braised carp with hot bean sauce, and braised red snapper with whole garlic cloves. Entrees $10 to $15. Fridays through Sundays and Labor Day, noon to midnight. QUATORZE, #240 West 14th Street (206-7006) - **(Sept. 28, 1984) The shiny red enameled entrance to Quatorze casts a welcoming glow, which extends past the marble-topped bar and old-fashioned tiled floor to the dining room with its red banquettes and bold posters and prints. First course options include oysters, available by the piece, in an invigorating mignonette sauce; smoked chicken breast with horseradish cream, and a salad of chicory with smoked bacon and croutons in hot vinaigrette. Fish dishes are prepared with finesse and you might order flounder fillet grilled or meuniere, or salmon in a creamy sauce choron. Another good main-dish option is the calf's liver in a shallot sauce with balsamic vinegar. Entrees $15 to $22.50. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 6 P.M. to midnight; Sundays and Labor Day, 5 to 11 P.M. WATER CLUB, East River at 30th Street (683-3333) - *(July 19, 1985) Dining while enjoying the panoramic view of Queens and Manhattan on this glass-enclosed barge might brighten your holiday weekend. On deck, the al fresco bar serves a light grill menu from noon to midnight on Labor Day. The three-tiered main dining room is wrapped in glass, offering views from every table. Starters are icy and glistening fresh oysters and clams; smoked fish with blinis and caviar, or one of the half-dozen or more specials. Main dishes include some of the best crab cakes in town, golden brown disks loaded with well-seasoned crabmeat; tuna steak in a soy-based sauce; prime ribs of beef, and steamed or grilled Maine lobsters. Dinner entrees $18 to $36. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 2:45 P.M. and 6 to 11:45 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11:30 A.M to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11:45 P.M.; Labor Day, noon to 3 P.M. and 5:30 to 11:30 P.M.

us,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,"El Gran Combo, the 12th New York Salsa Festival, Madison Square Garden (563-8300). Puerto Rico's most dependably incendiary salsa band is sleek, well-rehearsed, still energetic and vital after 25 years. In addition to El Gran Combo, the New York Salsa Festival's major concert extravaganza this year will also feature some of the music's virtuoso vocalists -Celia Cruz, Cheo Feliciano, Hector La Voe and Oscar D'Leon - plus the grand master of the timbales, Tito Puente. Tickets for the concert, which begins tomorrow at 8 P.M., are $15, $20 and $25 at the Madison Square Garden box office, or through Ticketron (399-4444). Pheeroan Ak Laff, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street (673-5576). Pheeroan Ak Laff is so many band leaders' drummer of choice, he's likely to turn up almost anywhere. He is fastidious, a percussive perfectionist who plays with crisp, pinpoint definition and always goes for the groove. His own band, with John Stubblefield, a formidable tenor saxophonist, is playing tonight at Visiones, a Spanish restaurant and an increasingly important live-music venue in the Village. Sets are around 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1:15 A.M. There is a $7 minimum in the dining room, or a one-drink minimum at the bar. Johnny Copeland, Tramps, 125 East 15th Street (777-5077). Records haven't begun to capture the electricity and gritty authenticity this Texas blues-and-soul man projects in a club. Johnny Copeland plays sharp, biting guitar, and sings about hard knocks and hoping against hope in a voice that sounds like it could shear steel. He knows how to pace a show, building excitement, grabbing the audience by the collar and gradually tightening his grip. He isn't so much an entertainer as an experience. Shows are around 9:30 and midnight tonight and tomorrow night. There is a $10 cover charge and a $5 minimum. Jazz Album of the Week: ''Shades,'' Andrew Hill Trio and Quartet (Soul Note-Polygram Special Imports). The music on this exemplary new album from the elusive pianist Andrew Hill is deeply felt. It's also been painstakingly crafted and carefully programmed to provide a kaleidoscopic and uncommonly satisfying listening experience. The subject is jazz as language. On the first side, four tightly (if eccentrically) structured compositions explore some of the ways the music can express ideas through metaphor. ''Tripping'' is a painterly study of shape, flow, color and nuance; ''Ball Square,'' presented as a series of conversational gambits between Mr. Hill's piano and Ben Riley's thoughtfully melodic drumming, is a composition about cycles, and cycles within cycles. The album's second side consists of two long, relaxed quartet performances, with Clifford Jordan's supple tenor saxophone sinuously winding its way through Mr. Hill's dapplings of light and shade. Here jazz itself is the metaphor, and playing well is its own reward.",1987-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE MOURNFUL DEMEANOUR OF LIEUTENANT BORUVKA. By Josef Skvorecky. Translated by Rosemary Kavan, Kaca Polackova and George Theiner. (Norton, $15.95.) Lieutenant Boruvka, the detective of the doleful countenance, takes a warm and nurturing approach to crime-solving. Unlike his eager-beaver assistant, Sergeant Malek, who is infatuated with the latest scientific techniques, this Czechoslovak police officer relies on good old-fashioned observation and deduction, supplemented by an understanding of the human heart. He is too sensitive to fire a gun. He doesn't like the death penalty. Upon solving a crime, he always experiences a profound sadness. Readers of Mr. Skvorecky's epic, freewheeling political novel, ''The Engineer of Human Souls,'' will find no comparable sustenance in these 12 linked detective stories written before the author immigrated to Canada in 1968 from his native Czechoslovakia. Boruvka exhibits a bit too much of the bogus humanism associated with the Socialist Realist school - even though Mr. Skvorecky tries to round out his hero by having him botch a case, and, while married, fall in love with a female subordinate. These tales reveal little flair for mystery writing, relying on intricate plots that annoy rather than challenge. One puzzle requires that we decipher musical notation - hardly fair. Intermittent pleasures come from such witty touches as the character who takes umbrage at not being suspected and protests, ''You don't regard me as a man, sir?'' But on the whole this first of four scheduled Boruvka collections amounts to no more than a hobby of the author. The less than idiomatic translation (one character refers to Boruvka as a ''disbelieving Thomas'') doesn't help.",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

Considering the complex ironies of the Elvis legend - the hillbilly who became ''the King'' - it's surprising so few intellectuals have tried to figure out what it all means. Now Jane and Michael Stern begin to fill this gap with a wonderful little gold mine of Americana called ''Elvis World.'' Cleverly disguised as a coffeetable book, it is actually an illustrated essay defining the elements of the Elvis mythology. ''Elvis has always been an issue way beyond his art,'' the Sterns tell us, and take us on a tour of the fantastic Presley universe - the homes, the shrines (''any place he shopped, ate, bought cars or guns or diamond rings''), the awful movies, the fans who keep his cult stronger than ever 10 years after his death. With Flaubertian precision they pile on the details (''to understand the Elvis mystique, you must know details''): the famous sneer that so threatened American morality in the 1950's, the hideous lamps he collected, the contents of his pantry (food looms large in the Elvis legend). The key to Elvis's power seems to be the duality of his character.",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

Reading this book is like meeting an avuncular sort of fellow on a long train ride and hearing stories, many of them trivial, about the great men he has known. By the end of the ride, although you may be bored, you might find you have learned a thing or two. In these pages, Maurice Friedman, an expert on Martin Buber and a professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, analyzes the lives and works of two people with whom he has had friendships: Abraham Joshua Heschel, the great Jewish philosopher and social activist who died in 1972, and Elie Wiesel, the chronicler of the Holocaust and Nobel laureate. Probably to establish his personal ties with the two men, Mr. Friedman throws in the trivia. He tells how he used to walk home with Heschel and ''stop and have an orange juice along the way,'' or how he bought a cowboy suit as a present for Mr. Wiesel's son. ('' 'He will be the first Hasidic cowboy,' Elie remarked to me, much amused,'' Mr. Friedman reports.) With the personal details out of the way, Mr. Friedman provides a useful summary of Heschel's philosophy and shows how that philosophy motivated his civil rights and peace activities. The author does a less credible job of summarizing Mr. Wiesel's works, relying too heavily on quotation and on the critics. He also has the irritating habit of quoting at length from his own works, especially the autobiographical ''Touchstones of Reality.'' If you were indeed riding a train instead of reading a book, you'd probably change your seat.",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

us,The Cost of Money Is Going Up Again,"Interest rates have been creeping up in several sectors and the Federal Reserve, in part to support the dollar, gave in to the pressure by raising the discount rate to 6 percent, from 5 1/2 percent. Since rates were already rising, the Fed move to nudge them further could help to stabilize the dollar - in part by attracting more foreign money into United States securities - without causing an inflationary spurt at home. The move was the first by the new Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, but the immediate reaction was a negative one - stocks continued to drop sharply and the dollar barely moved. That led some analysts to predict that another increase could be in the offing. Banks immediately responded, though, with an increase in their prime rates, to 8 3/4 percent in most cases, and consumer rates are sure to follow. In the credit markets, where traders show their view of the future, bond prices have already dropped sharply and yields are at or near yearly highs.

From his first baseball job in 1933, through his adventures as a franchise owner in Milwaukee, Cleveland, St. Louis and Chicago, until his death in 1986 at the age of 71, Veeck had a knack for revitalizing the fortunes of his teams and simultaneously scandalizing his business colleagues. In this biography a veteran New York Times sportswriter, Gerald Eskenazi, presents the many facets of Veeck's complex character - spirited entrepreneur, opportunist, altruist. Veeck may be best known as the publicity-seeking club owner who made the 3-foot-7-inch Eddie Gaedel a member of the 1951 St. Louis Browns. As the owner of a minor league team in Milwaukee, he also adopted the practice of moving the outfield fences according to the hitting capacity of the opposing teams. But there was more to the man than a gift for outrageous gags. In 1947, as owner of the Cleveland Indians, Veeck was the first American League owner to hire a black baseball player, Larry Doby. Acts like this and his own struggles against injuries and illness earned Veeck a reputation as a humanitarian, yet he seems to have virtually disregarded the existence of his children by his first wife. Who was the real Bill Veeck? Mr. Eskenazi provides no definitive answers, but his numerous interviews and anecdotes provide an entertaining portrait of a maverick who refused to be pinned down by anyone, including his biographer.",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

us,The Presidential Contenders Seek to Make Their Mark,"BY tradition, Labor Day is the opening day for general election campaigns. Labor Day of the Presidential election year, that is. The primary season begins some months earlier, when the primaries do, and the pre-primary period at some undefined time before that, generally the previous fall. But this time, in part because the election industry has become a perpetual motion machine, and in part because the primary schedule has been accelerated, the 1988 Presidential cycle has begun early - very early. Not every candidate has formally announced, more may yet enter - events might still attract some, like Governor Cuomo of New York, who have said they are not candidates - and more will drop out. But the field is crowded early, and all summer, people who aspire to the Presidency have been stumping the country, telling voters that Election Day 1988 will produce a leader for the next decade, perhaps even set the tone for the next century. Candidates who have experience have been emphasizing it. Sometimes, they have also talked about the issues - subjects that are constants, such as the economy and the farm problem, and subjects that have been thrown up by current events, such as the Bork nomination and the AIDS epidemic. What follows is an outline of the issues and highlights of what the candidates have been saying about them. THE CONSTANTS Farm Policy",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ERNESTO. By Umberto Saba. Translated by Mark Thompson. (Carcanet, $15.95.) ''I knew as soon as I'd written the first sentence that this wouldn't be for publication.'' So wrote Umberto Saba, the prominent Italian poet, of this short, highly autobiographical novel about an adolescent boy in fin-de-siecle Trieste. Saba, who left the novel unfinished at his death in 1957, believed his characters' blunt language would work against it. Equally problematic for the public of that time would have been his frank descriptions of homosexual and heterosexual lovemaking. In ''Ernesto'' - now annotated and in a straightforward English translation for the first time - Saba presents his hero's emotional education (through a series of encounters with a day laborer, a prostitute and a younger boy) with a forthrightness that would certainly have raised eyebrows back then. Anyone reading these scenes today, however, will probably find their sexually explicit content redeemed by the unfailingly affectionate tone. The author's intent in this novel, as he has said of a previous work, is ''to describe, with serene innocence, the marvelous world.'' Of course, this kind of endeavor has its pitfalls; Saba's ''serenely innocent'' style can occasionally sour, turning into a mannered ingenuousness that is just one step away from sentimentality. But there are remarkably shrewd social and psychological insights beneath the simplicity of Ernesto's encounters. And in the early flirtation scene between the boy and the day laborer, for instance, Saba truly achieves his goal, with a style of storytelling that is direct, honest and - in its own quiet way - even courageous.",1987-09-06T05:00:00+0000

Joe Browne, a spokesman for the league, said yesterday that Sileo wouldn't be allowed to play or practice with Tampa Bay ''subject to a review of his contract by our office.'' Joe Martinez, Sileo's lawyer, has said that Sileo did not enter the regular draft last spring because he didn't know he would be eligible for the N.F.L. and that now he is legitimately a free agent. Under N.F.L. rules, a player declared ineligible for further college play is usually required to go through a supplemental draft, in which all 28 teams are given a chance at selecting him.

Viacheslav Bykov, Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov also scored for the Russians. On Friday in Montreal, the Soviet Union will play the winner of tonight's semifinal between Canada and Czechoslovakia. Jonas Bergqvist and Peter Andersson scored Sweden's goals. The Soviets led 1-0 after the first period on the strength of a power-play goal by Krutov and the outstanding goaltending of Sergei Mylnikov, who was back in the nets after being replaced by Evgeny Belosheikin in a 3-3 tie with Canada. (AP) Track and Field Lewis and Johnson Win: In separate 100-meter races, Carl Lewis had a better time than the world champion Ben Johnson, 10.05 seconds to 10.35, yesterday in Rieti, Italy. Johnson refused to race with Lewis, saying he was too tired and did not want tough competition. Lewis said he was disappointed at Johnson's decision. In the world championships in Rome last week, Johnson set a world record of 9.83 in beating Lewis. Said Aouita of Morocco won the 1,500-meters in 3 minutes 32.71 seconds, three seconds off his world record. The disappointment of the meet was the pole vaulter Sergei Bubka of the Soviet Union. The world champion and world-record holder failed to clear in his three starting attempts at 18 feet 4 1/2 inches and was eliminated. Earl Bell of the United States was the winner at 18-8 1/4.

us,Q&A,"Q. The poured concrete wall in my basement developed a couple of vertical cracks less than an eighth of an inch wide and several feet long. They seemed to get no worse, but water leaked in after a heavy rain so I filled them with patching cement. However, after a few months the cement seems to be cracking or falling out. What did I do wrong? A. You probably did not fill the cracks properly. You should first cut the cracks to make them a bit wider inside than on the surface; this insures a better bond between the old and new cement. Wet the crack and pack in the new cement with a trowel. A hydraulic patching cement is better than a conventional sand-mix patching cement; it expands in curing, making it more resistant to water pressure. Q. Our 1919 house has had a problem for 25 years: the wallpaper in the second-floor study is stained by water whenever it rains. The study is not on an outside wall, but a wall backed by a chimney. Contractors have redone the flashing around the chimney, topped the chimney with a cap and rebuilt the chimney from the roof up. Nothing has worked. Have you any suggestions? A. Water is obviously entering through the chimney, so I suspect that one of the measures was done incorrectly. The most common culprit in such leaks is defective flashing around the chimney; it would probably pay to have another contractor check it. The flashing must go into the joint between the first or second course of bricks and must extend well below the roofing material. Have the chimney cap rechecked for cracks in the cement; patch any that are found. Q. My three-year-old town house has white cement steps in front. The metal railings have rusted, leaving a trail on the cement. How can I remove this rust and prevent it from returning? A. Removing the rust completely is almost impossible, but you can lighten the stains with a commercial rust remover sold in hardware stores. Apply liberally several times. Persistent stains can be lightened still more by bleaching with oxalic acid, also sold in hardware stores. To prevent a recurrence, clean and paint the railings. Remove all loose rust, and coat with a rust converter or a rust-inhibiting metal primer. Be sure to coat all sides and edges. Then paint with a rust-resistant outside enamel. Q. A long cabinet with a matte lacquer finish was built under the living-room windows. Whenever I leave the windows open I get a fine soot on top of the cabinet. The soot often leaves streaks when I wipe it off, and I have to use a damp cloth to wipe the streaks off. I'm afraid this will scratch the fine finish. Can I put a coat of wax on the finish to protect it? A. Yes you can - and you should.",1987-09-10T05:00:00+0000

Ueberroth, who has unilateral power to levy the fine, asked clubs this year to have players returning from drug rehabilitation remain in the minor leagues for 60 to 90 days to make sure they have their problem under control before elevating them on a major league team. A spokesman for Ueberroth said thaat even if a fine had been levied, it would not be announced. The fine would be the second largest ordered by a baseball commissioner.

Largely self-taught, and unaided by a European tour, Blakelock made a substantial and highly personal contribution to the evolution of landscape painting. His best work, done in the last two decades of the 19th century, is conservative when compared to that of van Gogh or Cezanne. Blakelock is more credible when seen as an eccentric, belated offshoot of the Hudson River or Barbizon Schools. Still, in looking at the 46 canvases on view at the Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, it is possible to grasp that, for his time and place, Blakelock was something of a radical artist in terms of both subject matter and painting surface. With their flattened, subtly psychologized surfaces, the woodland scenes and the images of dark trees silhouetted against moonlit skies for which he is best known can strike us as incipiently modern, a peculiar blend of Impressionism and Symbolism.",1987-09-11T05:00:00+0000

And then, living in Chicago, she discovered the blues of Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey and Helen Humes, and she started sitting in with the blues bands that hold forth regularly on Chicago's South and North Sides. With her lung power and her taste for feisty, no-nonsense songs, she quickly gained a reputation as one of Chicago's best young blues singers, a reputation that's starting to extend to New York City. She'll bring a band of Chicago musicians to Tramps tonight and tomorrow. Sets are at 9:30 and midnight; there is a $10 cover and a two-drink minimum. Hugo Largo, the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street (219-3055). Using two electric basses, a violin and the clear voice of Mimi Goese - nothing more - Hugo Largo's music floats on the far fringe of rock. The songs are deep-toned and unhurried, like something absent-mindedly hummed by a sleeping giant; on stage, Ms. Goese could be dreaming with open eyes, singing words and sounds with bemused grace. Its sustained, sonorous calm is just about the last thing anyone would expect from a New York band. Jo Andres, a dancer, will perform with the band tonight at 9 and 11; admission is $6. New Music at Summerstage, Central Park Band Shell, 72d Street in mid-park (860-1335). New York new music tunes in the world, almost literally, at this weekend's three Summerstage concerts. Tonight at 8, there's a performance event directed by Travis Preston that will include 50 teen-agers carrying radios and a 50-member speaking chorus; sharing a double bill is an ensemble led by Butch Morris, a composer and cornetist whose ''conductions,'' or conducted improvisations, are full of melody and wit. Tomorrow at 3 P.M., the A. Leroy Invitation will present new pieces for eight winds and six percussion, a lineup Mr. Leroy calls a ''stationary marching band.'' Mr. Leroy and the other composers -Scott Johnson, Lenny Pickett, Steve Elson, Peter Zummo and Bill Obrecht - have their fingers in rock, jazz and classical music; they know James Brown is an arch-minimalist and Steve Reich can get funky, and their pieces often strut along like dancers with big ideas. On Sunday at 3 P.M., Glen Velez will lead a quartet that includes Steve Gorn on Indian flute, Larry Karush on keyboards and Layne Redmond on vocals. Mr. Velez is a virtuoso on frame drums, the far-flung relatives of the tambourine; last year, he made a brilliant, austere, mostly solo album, ''Internal Combustion'' (CMP Records), that showed just how many sounds and rhythms can be made with fingers on stretched skin. All three concerts are free. Rock Album of the Week: The dB's: ''The Sound of Music'' (I.R.S./ M.C.A.). Sometimes - actually, most of the time - love gets more complicated than the scenarios proffered by typical pop songs. So adults who love the pop-song form have to decide whether to keep things simple or to bend the rules. The dB's, a long-running New York band that has just released its fourth album, decided to tell realistic love stories, conflicts and all - but still keep things catchy. On ''The Sound of Music,'' Peter Holsapple's songs sketch love affairs that are fraying at the edges: ''She was on her way out of town and she wanted to know if I'd gone insane/Well I might but I doubt if it changes things,'' the band sings in ''Molly Says.'' All that contains the strife and yearning are melodies with the twang of Buddy Holly, the pop sense of vintage Tommy James and the Shondells, and the urgency of Elvis Costello. The dB's pull no punches, but the songs are designed to set toes tapping.",1987-09-11T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CHEZ LOUIS, 1016 Second Avenue, near 53d Street (752-1400) - **(Feb. 13, 1987) This simply appointed, comfortable bistro has French posters on the walls and a large glass wall in back overlooking a cluster of trees, and larger groups of 8 to 10 are welcome. Portions are for big eaters, and you might be wise to go lightly on appetizers: roasted wild mushrooms and garlic cloves or endive and watercress salad with walnuts and Roquefort. The kitchen specializes in roasting, and the results can be wonderful - from the herb-flecked whole chicken for two to the roast baby lamb. Other good main-dish options are grilled giant shrimp with beurre blanc and grilled fresh tuna, depending upon availability, as well as a club dish for those watching their weight: boneless breast of chicken with roasted garlic sauce, or sole with fresh tomato basil sauce. Dinner entrees $13.95 to $28.95. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 6 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 6 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 5 to 10 P.M. DEVON HOUSE, 1316 Madison Avenue, at 93d Street (860-8294) - **(May 24, 1985) An understated restaurant with two small and graceful dining rooms, Devon House can accommodate groups of up to 56. The food is essentially Continental with a dash of West Indian salsa. First-course selections include escargot, without shells, in a satiny garlic-tinged cream sauce with bits of tomatoes and scallions; mushrooms on toast with fine herbs, and sweetbreads with Madeira. Main-dish options are fresh salmon braised in fresh lime, white wine and Jamaican peppers; roast Cornish hen with a sauce of pineapple, green peppercorns, lime and Grand Marnier, and filet of beef in a Pickapepper sauce (a condiment bottled in Jamaica) with green peppercorns. Entrees $24.50 to $29.50. Fridays through Sundays, 6 to 11 P.M. MITSUKOSHI, 461 Park Avenue, at 57th Street (935-6444) - ***(March 8, 1985) Below the porcelain and pottery shop of the same name is this polished Japanese restaurant with sushi bar, main dining room and private tatami rooms - Westernized with a sunken well under the table to dangle your feet below - where groups of up to 18 people can be accommodated. The seafood, both raw and cooked, is of the highest quality. The sushi and sashimi are recommended; and other options are light and brittle tempura of vegetables, shrimp and whitefish in tangy ginger dipping sauce; grilled fish of the day, usually red snapper or salmon, perfectly charred and moist, and shabu shabu, a caldron of simmering broth in which diners cook their own food, including lean beef, Chinese cabbage, mushrooms, scallions, carrots and rice cabbage. Complete dinners $22 to $75. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M.; closed Sundays, PALIO, 151 West 51st Street (245-4850) - **(May 2, 1986) From the awe-inspiring wraparound bar and wall mural on the first floor to the plush, high-ceilinged dining room, spacious and comfortable, this stylish Italian restaurant is a knockout. Private rooms are available for dinner parties of up to 14, 25 and 40 people. A multipage menu offers hot and cold appetizers, soups, pastas, meat and seafood entrees and desserts. Among the recommended dishes are carpaccio with vinegar and foie gras; fresh mussels in saffron broth; fettuccine in Bolognese sauce and gnocchi with garlic-infused morsels of frogs legs; rolled salmon fillets with a sauce of black olives, spinach and pink peppercorns, and poached breast of capon stuffed with prosciutto over a green sauce. Pre-theater dinner $35; dinner entrees $26 to $32.50. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 4:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. ''21'' CLUB, 21 West 52d Street (582-7200) - **(June 19, 1987) In addition to the clubby and comfortable formal upstairs dining room and the famous wood-paneled barroom downstairs, this legendary restaurant offers a number of private dining rooms for parties. The recent refurbishing has made the patrician town house more beguiling than ever: The food is vastly improved and service is holding up reasonably well. Starter selections are foie-gras terrine flecked with black truffles, and marinated sea scallops over mixed greens. Among the entrees are red snapper fillet atop risotto; Black Angus steak in hot mustard crust, and roasted monkfish with beef marrow in light red wine fume with spinach. Dinner entrees $23 to $36. Fridays, noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 6 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. UNION SQUARE CAFE, 21 East 16th Street (243-4020) - **(Jan. 24, 1986) One of the most appealing restaurants in the area is this low-key cafe with a long, handsome bar up front and a cozy room in back with double height ceiling and murals on the walls. Private rooms are available for groups of up to 22, 45 and 75. The food is eclectic and straddles the border between France and Italy. First-course choices are black-bean soup with lemon and Australian cherries; papardelle of zucchini with tomato, shallots, white wine and cream sauce, and deep-fried calamari with graham-cracker crumbs and anchovy mayonnaise. For a main dish, you might have grilled fillet of tuna; broiled swordfish with citrus and green peppercorn sauce, or grilled loin lamb chops with basil mint butter sauce and red-pepper custard. Dinner entrees $14 to $21. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 11:45 P.M.; closed Sundays. What the stars mean, page C2O.",1987-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,"Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street (662-2133). Billed as a 20th-anniversary celebration of the Liberation Music Orchestra, this concert isn't likely to confine itself to the band's original arrangements of Spanish Civil War songs and musical evocations of 60's political turbulence. There is new music, including compositions from Nicaragua and Cuba. Charlie Haden, the orchestra's bassist and leader, has assembled an impressive mixture of original players - Dewey Redman, Paul Motian - and some of the New York scene's outstanding younger musicians, including Geri Allen, Craig Harris and Herb Robertson. The concert is tomorrow at 8 P.M. Tickets are $10 and $15 at the cathedral or from Ticketmaster (307-7171). The Saheb Sarbib Unit, the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway (718-638-5000, extension 232). Like Charlie Haden, Jean (Saheb) Sarbib is a bass-playing bandleader who anchors his groups, and helps shape his soloists' improvisations, with a big sound, a firm beat and an agile imagination. He is playing Sunday at 3 P.M.; the concert is free with museum admission, which is $3 for adults, $1.50 for students and $1 for the elderly. Olu Dara, Carlos 1, 432 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets (982-3260). Olu Dara's comprehensive trumpet style is a link between the New Orleans tradition, the blues and flash of the old-time Southern tent-show circuit, rhythm and blues, and new jazz. Why isn't this man making records? At least he can be enjoyed in person. He is playing through Sunday, beginning around 9:30 P.M., at this Caribbean restaurant and club. There is a $10 music charge and a $7 minimum. Jazz Album of the Week: ''Cool Struttin','' Sonny Clark (Blue Note LP and CD). Sonny Clark's definition of ''soul'' in jazz is worth pondering. ''Your soul is your conception,'' he said, ''and you begin to have it in your playing when the way you strike a note, the sound you get and your phrasing come out of you yourself and no one else.'' On ''Cool Struttin','' recorded in 1958 and recently reissued by Blue Note, Mr. Clark, a pianist, transformed elements that countless ''blowing session'' albums were reducing to formula - compatible musicians, lengthy solos on simple blues and pop-song structures, minimal unison themes - and came up with something enduring. Art Farmer's harmonic sophistication and concern for detail and structure on the trumpet provide the perfect foil for Jackie McLean's emotional urgency and deep blues feeling on saxophone. The pianist's own solos flow with a sparkling, liquid grace, and his tone is as indelible as Teddy Wilson's. Paul Chambers's bass and Philly Joe Jones's drums are brisk, interactive, always appropriate. The additional tunes on the compact disk include some of the session's most heated playing, and one of the most incendiary Art Farmer solos of all time. ''Cool Struttin' '' is a classic.",1987-09-11T05:00:00+0000

us,THE CAREFUL SHOPPER,"All of the Answers To Teachers' Wants The Teachers' Room, which expanded in July with a move to Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains, is crowded this month with teachers gathering their specialized supplies for the new year - record books and bulletin-board decorations, reward stickers for achievements and good behavior, tools for teaching and items for learning incentives. Parents also use the store's supplies for gifts to children of all ages at home or while traveling, beginning with the simplest books, games, puzzles and puppets. When a teacher's purchases mount to $50, a coupon is given entitling the purchaser to a monthly special. Stickers are available for identifying cubbyholes, team members and belongings for nonreading preschoolers - dinosaurs, animals and birds can be recognized easily by shape and color. These cost $1.25 to $2.50 for batches of 30 or 50. There is also a supply of ''brag tags,'' good-work stamps and ''I'm on a Field Trip'' name badges to help round up lost or strayed pupils. Good News Grams are small pads for brief notes to students or their parents and more complex books holding three-part worksheets for a record of notes sent home, the message sent and reply space on the same sheet helping to insure communication. The design of bulletin boards is explained in numerous advice books that sell for $3.95 (a ditto book on borders) to $10.95 (language arts as a theme), and there are paper crafts and prescalloped corrugated strips or sheets in many colors and designs. Other class supplies reflect the seasons, holidays, presidents, patriotic themes, our changing earth, the solar system, weather choices, simple machines, magnets and electricity, heat, light and sound. Charts can be simple one-color designs for $1, animal and alphabet combinations for $1.50, or two-sided in full color for $2 - other subjects are food groups, insects, animals, flags of the world, five senses, human body, prefixes and suffixes, explorers, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., international children, sign language alphabet, how to write a letter or understand numbers concepts. Books are available on teaching poetry, writing, drama, science, thinking skills, logic, reading and language experiences. Mathematics and word problems and handwriting workbooks are here, too.

Many small items are suitable for loot bag fillers, birthday gifts and decorations. The wipe-off cards and crayons favored in nursery schools work on both sides and cost $6.95 - the ''See It, Make It'' side suggests shapes, or a path, a maze or the alphabet. The reverse side allows for original designs. Home workbooks for $2.50 have alphabets, puzzles or hidden pictures, and other books help with prereading or early-reading skills. A rubber stamp kit featuring jungle animals sells for $5.95 and color charts are $8.95. The Lace-a-Saurus for $6.50 is a precut felt puppet to be sewn and stuffed - the blunt needle and yarn are included in the package.

Leavey Jr. Essay by Gregory L. Ulmer. Foreword by Jacques Derrida. 320 pp. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. $50. JACQUES DERRIDA is a teacher of philosophy in Paris, and for some years he wrote only the sort of books that a French philosophy professor of inordinate brilliance might be expected to write - difficult books to say the least, but conventionally philosophical so far as the language they were written in went. They advanced a radical thesis about language, however: when we use it we cannot expect it to mean only what we want it to mean, because it has a semantic life of its own, and its meanings escape from us. There can be no such thing as a mastery of language. Worse, language is sounds and forms before it is concepts, and when we write or speak sounds and forms will come into our minds uninvited because one word can but lead to others. So, it is as much to the resources of the language as to our own proud genius that we owe ''our'' concepts. All of which is the blackest heresy for a philospher, of course, because rational thought is in peril if the thinker cannot be seen as being in full command of his utterances. Irresponsible views such as Mr. Derrida's are better left to poets, who may positively welcome such voluptuous surrender to the surfaces of language.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

And at a time when men's wear has struck a decisively cosmopolitan note, they may be the first visible signals of the wearer's savoir-faire. The peripatetic life consisting of coast-to-coast commutes and business weekends abroad calls for this kind of cultural camouflage. Accordingly, even the most rigidly chauvinistic dresser may bend from time to time, donning, if he's Italian, an English spread collar, or, if he's American, a rope-shoulder coat. For in fashion's expanding lexicon, such refinements, once thought showy or exotic, have become increasingly acceptable. The world has grown smaller, some experts maintain. And so, while ventless jackets and similar innovations may still seem foreign to some, they have gained credibility.

Following are excerpts from that article: ''The problem may be illustrated by Griswold v. Connecticut, in many ways a typical decision of the Warren Court. Griswold struck down Connecticut's statute making it a crime, even for married couples, to use contraceptive devices. If we take the principle of the decision to be a statement that Government may not interfere with any acts done in private, we need not even ask about the principle's dubious origin for we know at once that the Court will not apply it neutrally.

In his book ''Less Than Words Can Say,'' and his journal ''The Underground Grammarian,'' Richard Mitchell, a professor of classics at Glassboro State College in New Jersey, has fired broadsides at literary obfuscation. With these 12 linked essays, he attempts something different - to define education. Mr. Mitchell's title is an allusion to Aeschylus: the mythic fire Prometheus gave to humanity was more than actual fire; it was ''the mind's grasp of itself,'' the power ''not only to think, but to think about thinking.'' True education, likewise, is more than learning to solve problems. Education means learning to weigh values and master oneself. It is that which makes us ''able to be good.'' Teaching is not lecturing or role-modeling. It is providing ''an irresistible impulse to thoughtfulness.'' But teaching can only encourage learning; the real impetus must come from within. The examined life, the rearing of the unthinking child within the reasoning adult, is not ''set aside for some temporary purpose and put aside at a certain age. It is the principal business of life.'' These essays could have been more closely reasoned, and some of the examples may have helped the author work out his thoughts more than they will help readers trying to follow him. Even so, this book should educate many.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

Other galleries in the state are also presenting versions of the theme, and a national exhibition of ''American Women Artists, 1830 to 1930,'' organized by the new National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., arrives at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford next Sunday. The Marlborough show includes the works of such 19th-century artists as Fanny and Jenny Burr, Dorothea Litzinger, Anna Hyatt Huntington, Bessie Potter Vonnah and Ruth Nickerson Greacen. Also featured are works by such contemporary Connecticut artists as Carol Anthony, Ilse Getz, Elizabeth MacDonald and Judith Streeter. At a reception from 1 to 5 P.M. today the Arioso Trio will perform works by female composers, and there will be discussions by Helen Fusscas, the gallery's owner, and Deborah Frizzell, its director. Additional discussions and films are scheduled through Oct. 11, when the show closes. The Connecticut Gallery is at 4 Austin Drive. Daily viewing hours are from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and from 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday (295-9544). A list of participating galleries in ''American Women Artists'' and information about lectures, concerts and other performances may be obtained by calling the Wadsworth Atheneum at 278-2670, ext. 361.

With no licensing requirements in Connecticut, the Power Squadron offers an opportunity for learning how to safely operate a boat. The course applies to outboard, inboard or sailing craft. It is conducted by an expert volunteer, covering such topics as boat handling under adverse conditions, rules of the road, compass and chart basics, boat trailering, seamanship and common emergencies, running lights and equipment and in-land boating. Registration will be held before the first class at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday. A $15 fee is charged for course materials and text. For more information call 744-5844.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE INHUMAN CONDITION, by Clive Barker. (Pocket, $3.95.) In ''The Body Politic,'' one of five tales here by Clive Barker, the young British writer of horror stories, two hands sever themselves from their owner and lead a bloody revolution, liberating their oppressed brothers and sisters. ''It's a measure of Mr. Barker's cool control that he makes this bad dream seem not only creepily disturbing but plausible,'' Ken Tucker said here last year. ''Try to imagine 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' with a screenplay by V. S. Pritchett.'' SILENT PARTNERS: The Legacy of the Ape Language Experiments, by Eugene Linden. (Ballantine, $3.95.) When disillusionment, bickering and recent cutbacks in Federal funding undermined the attempt to teach sign language to our fellow primates, laboratories were faced with a difficult disposal problem: what to do with unwanted specimens that many scientist-trainers had come to think of as friends. In this sad story of what happened to the apes, Eugene Linden tempts us to stretch our definition of who, or what, deserves the rights accorded to the sentient. ''Kind, quiet and fair, Mr. Linden's book is not only a diagnosis of the cruelty and confusion it describes, but also an antidote,'' our reviewer, Ursula K. Le Guin, wrote in 1986. TONGUES OF FLAME, by Mary Ward Brown. (Washington Square Press/Pocket Books, $5.95.) The author, who has spent her life in Alabama, writes short stories about Southerners whose ingrained, carefully delineated world views have left them unequipped for the modern world. Last year our reviewer, Kathryn Morton, said these tales are ''well written'' and ''delivered in a measured, caring voice''; they won for their author the Hemingway Award for Best First Fiction. LYNDON: An Oral Biography, by Merle Miller. (Ballantine, $5.95.) Some critics have called ''oral biography'' an easy way out: journalism becomes tape-recording and what emerges is stenography, not prose. This new edition of Merle Miller's life of Lyndon B. Johnson is a reminder that, when used well, the technique can produce what Anthony Lewis, writing here in 1980, called ''a coherent, sensitive, fascinating biography.'' THE BOOK OF ABRAHAM, by Marek Halter. Translated by Lowell Bair. (Dell, $4.95.) Spanning two millenniums of Jewish history through the story of one family, this impassioned novel ''suffers from its wide reach,'' Frederic Morton said here last year, but still it is ''spectacular.'' Marek Halter's ''ethical instincts help unify the book, drawing together parts that in the hands of another writer would be disparate. . . . Only an imagination as learned, as indomitable as Mr. Halter's could have even conceived 'The Book of Abraham.' '' DREAMGIRL: My Life as a Supreme, by Mary Wilson with Patricia Romanowski and Ahrgus Juilliard. (St. Martin's, $4.95.) The singer's bittersweet memoir, in which her fellow Supreme, Diana Ross, is cast as an overpowering prima donna, ''keeps nostalgic gush and embittered polemic to a minimum,'' Milo Miles wrote here last year. ''Never [ before ] has a Motown veteran spoken out as a first-person witness from inside Hitsville.'' The same publisher is also reissuing Nelson George's WHERE DID OUR LOVE GO: The Rise & Fall of the Motown Sound ($9.95). In 1986, our reviewer, Larry Birnbaum, said that Mr. George's style is too breezy, but that he admired the book's ''skillful interweaving of artistic and commercial history.'' TAILOR'S DUMMY, by Irving Weinman. (Fawcett/ Crest, $3.95.) When a wealthy New York art dealer is found dead in a Brooklyn warehouse, the detective assigned to the case is a magna cum laude Harvard University graduate married to an art historian. His erudite investigation makes for a novel that is ''fast-moving and clear,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. THE PROFESSOR AND THE PROSTITUTE: And Other True Tales of Murder and Madness, by Linda Wolfe. (Ballantine, $3.95.) Attempting to make ''real events read like invented tales,'' the author tells nine bizarre true stories. It is the ''fascinating'' title selection, about a rotund Tufts University medical professor and his obsession with a manipulative young prostitute (whom he later kills), that makes this collection worthwhile, Jonathan Coleman said here in 1986. THEOPHILUS NORTH, by Thornton Wilder. (Carroll & Graf, $4.95.) Through a combination of chance and indecision, an unemployed schoolteacher finds himself in Newport, R.I., where he becomes a tutor to the children of the rich and the town's much-needed spiritual adviser. This episodic novel, which turned out to be Thornton Wilder's last, is ''extraordinarily entertaining,'' Granville Hicks said here in 1973, though ''sometimes it comes recklessly close to sentimentality.'' THE SOVIET PARADOX: External Expansion, Internal Decline, by Seweryn Bialer. (Vintage, $9.95.) Written before the word glasnost became commonly known in this country, this book by a respected Columbia University authority on the Soviet Union argues that bureaucratic inertia and an entrenched elite will keep Mikhail S. Gorbachev from initiating the radical decentralization necessary to save his country's overmanaged economy. Last year our reviewer, Peter Reddaway, said that this ''penetrating, often brilliant analysis'' should provide American leaders with ''a major instrument'' for preparing the public for the prolonged United States-Soviet political conflict that lies ahead. IN THE MIRO DISTRICT, by Peter Taylor. (Carroll & Graf, $3.95.) The author of ''A Summons to Memphis'' won the Pulitzer Prize for his fiction about aristocratic Tennesseans. These short stories are written with the ''authority . . . of someone who has been doing his job well for years,'' John Leonard said in 1977 in The Times.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CUISINE NOVELLA. By Antoine Laurent. (Viking, $17.95.) This first novel dealing with the relationship between cooking and storytelling is indeed an original, although it finds honorable antecedents in the fiction of John Fowles and Robertson Davies. Annabelle Fleury, a chic young Parisian fashion designer, meets the mysterious Marquis de St. Lyre in a Boulevard St. Germain brasserie. He commiserates with her over a disastrous champignons a la provencale, and a strange proposition follows: he will teach her the secrets of haute cuisine if she will accompany him to a restaurant he owns in the south of France. Aboard the Mistral the lessons begin. It soon becomes clear that Annabelle is being given more than cooking instructions; she is also receiving a crash course in the mysteries of storytelling. The principles governing both, the Marquis insists, are quite the same. Annabelle's instructions during the overnight journey grow increasingly bizarre and magical as the Marquis's curriculum in fantastic transformations through time and space unfolds. Finally, Annabelle must tell a story of her own. Antoine Laurent's concept is an audacious one but he quickly paints - or writes - himself into a corner. In a narrative so obsessed with the techniques of storytelling, his own story must be brilliant, and unfortunately it is not. Poorly paced, at times confusing and full of half-baked theories, ''Cuisine Novella'' never quite achieves the quality of ''sympathy'' the author sees as essential to a story's success. Yet in its mellifluous flow of language it is an elegant, literate achievement that marks Mr. Laurent as a writer of unusual gifts.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

We also agreed that a 2 percent handling fee would be charged on the escrow account containing the security deposit. Now my tenant claims that these clauses are illegal. Is this true? . . . H. S., West Windsor, N.J. Answer: Late fees are permissible for residential leases as long as they are reasonable. According to David L. Smith, a lawyer who specializes in real-estate matters, in general, a charge of no more than 5 percent of the monthly rent is considered reasonable. Mr. Smith noted, for example, that in a 1982 case in Spring Valley, N.Y., a County Court held that a landlord's charge of a $50 late fee on a monthly rent of $405 a month was excessive.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

The concern is not so much over Chad, which has little to buy and sell in the world, but with its enemy's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The Libyan leader's heavily equipped armed forces have been occupying parts of a disputed desert area of northern Chad. From time to time there are battles, and victories for Chad are interpreted as humiliating defeats for Colonel Qaddafi. Last weekend Chad reported that its troops had raided Libya for the first time: a foray to the Matan as Sarra air base 60 miles across the border, killing 1,713 Libyan soldiers. On Monday, Libya responded by sending warplanes over Ndjamena, Chad's capital, formerly Fort Lamy, and one of them was reportedly shot down by French forces. At week's end, Libya and Chad agreed to a cease-fire proposed by the Organization of African Unity, then almost immediately the Chadian embassy in Paris claimed that Libya had violated it.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

There are almost 24,000 nursing homes in the United States housing 2 million people and, with the population steadily aging, the health care business is booming. ''Harvest Moon'' is the portrait of a well-run institution in the Pacific Northwest, where the author, Sallie Tisdale, lives. It is staffed by compassionate, overworked and underpaid people. Some patients are young, victims of crippling accidents or degenerative sickness, but most are old, and the book is about them, the staff and the bonding between them. As a registered nurse and the author of one previous book, ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice: Tales of the Modern Hospital,'' Ms. Tisdale speaks knowledgeably about reforming Medicare and Medicaid regulations that bewilder patients and frustrate administrators. She also tackles tough ethical questions involved in caring for the terminally ill, and she even shares her thoughts about why she and others were drawn toward working in a nursing home. In her narrative, a young nurse's aide suggests that everyone in high school do her kind of work for one month, saying, ''They'd look at elderly people in a different way, they would know more about themselves and how life really goes.'' Short of that, there is ''Harvest Moon.''",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

This early, sharply negative reaction came as Secretary of State George P. Shultz advocated the proposal Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He contended that unless the United States continued to support the insurgents, or contras, the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua would have little incentive to adhere to the provisions of a peace-process accord signed last month in Guatemala by the presidents of five Central American countries, including Nicaragua. The accord, which calls for cease-fires, amnesties and a restoration of democratic rights, is to take effect beginning Nov. 7.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SINGING ON THE TITANIC. By Perry Glasser. (University of Illinois, $11.95.) As the Titanic sank, the passengers on board sang hymns - surely an affirmative act in the face of impossible odds. And in almost all the stories in Perry Glasser's second collection the characters respond with the same optimism, their actions colored by the experience of loss or by the precariousness of their inner balance. At no time, however, do Mr. Glasser's characters sink. In ''Mexico,'' for instance, Doralee Jackson, a simple young woman from Iowa, has hooked herself up with the wrong man and driven to Mexico; she sings, or at least swaggers, when I wouldn't have thought it possible, and the author's sure prose and humanitarian spirit guide her out of a tight spot. Somewhat bleaker are ''Away Out and Over'' and ''What Doesn't Kill Me.'' Written from the point of view of desperate women, these pieces leave lasting impressions of bitterness; it is as if the author feels compelled to show some dark vision but must restrain his natural buoyancy to do so. Mr. Glasser does better with male narrators, as in ''Steering Clear,'' in which a father struggles to comfort his small daughters and himself when they are brought up short by another person's unhappiness. However, the writing can be uneven, occasionally forced, as in the title story: ''Eventually I had ten chocolate bars of varying degrees of nuttiness, six sandwiches of which only one had to be liverwurst. . . . Carrying all of it in my jacket, I felt like a shoplifting kangaroo.'' But the perceptions are usually acute. I only wish the author had been more playful, more daring -he's got the sense of story down, and of character; he just needs to let it all fly.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ST. JOHN DE CREVECOEUR: The Life of an American Farmer. By Gay Wilson Allen and Roger Asselineau. (Viking, $19.95.) From Tocqueville and Chateaubriand to Romain Gary and Jean-Francois Revel, French writers have paid celebratory and caustic attention to America. Two distinguished students of American culture have now collaborated on an agreeably written study of an 18th-century Frenchman, Michel-Guillaume Saint-Jean de Crevecoeur, who is the most interesting precursor of the better-known commentators who came after him. Crevecoeur came to North America as an officer in his king's army during the Seven Years' War, and after leaving military service under murky circumstances, settled in the Hudson Valley. He became, and proclaimed himself in a series of letters published to wide acclaim, an ''American farmer.'' The letters are a remarkable record of the mind of a member of the lesser European nobility - restless within both the prescribed limits and privileges of his rank - as he encounters the frontier experience in its idyllic and brutal aspects. The lacunae in Crevecoeur's written recollections of his life make it difficult for the authors to answer some of the more intriguing questions: why did he choose the uncertainty of farming in a remote country over the comfort of his inheritance in Normandy? Why did his early Anglophilia give way to a preference for upstart American republicans? The book also situates Crevecoeur less firmly than it might within the currents of contemporary French thought on the American phenomenon: how, for instance, did he judge the theory of Volney and Buffon that the climate and terrain of the American continent could never support an advanced civilization? Despite its limits, mostly enforced by the paucity of documents, this is a deft and unpretentious work; it gives a sense of the boisterous young nation through the eyes of a fascinated visitor who became an American himself.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

Doreen Willox, chairman of the Herb Fair to be held by the New York State unit from 11 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Thursday at the Old Race Track on Baxter Road in North Salem. During the brief hours that this unusual event takes place, visitors may purchase products grown or made by some of the 85 members. ''It's not like a rose society where you can join by paying dues,'' said Mrs. Willox, chairman of the fair. ''You have to be invited, and while you don't need to have your own herb garden, you must be knowledgable about herbs, attend at least three meetings a year and be willing to work on the fair.'' The society's motto is ''for use and delight,'' referring to the medicinal, culinary and aromatic properties of various herbs. Perennial herbs that may be purchased and planted at this time of year include sage, chives, wormwood (which Mrs. Willox noted was the base for absinthe and made a potent punch), thyme, lemon balm, sorrel and salvia, which she explained was one of 700 varieties and was in the sage family. Annuals, such as rosemary and some of the basils will be available in pots to keep indoors. A selection of herb breads, vinegars, mustards, jams, relishes and jellies will be for sale, along with dried arrangements, books, fragrances, crafts and such mementos as napkins, aprons and tote bags bearing the Herb Society logo. An educational exhibit and a raffle for tickets to a Broadway show, an Elizabeth yellow magnolia or a stone statue are additional features of the fair. For lunch, the members will serve hot soup, sandwiches, dessert and beverages. Because everything is under cover, the fair will be held rain or shine. To reach the site take I-684 to Exit 7, Purdys, then Route 116 east to North Salem Center and follow the signs. Parking and admission are free. For a copy of the Herb Society's unusual recipe book, send $10 to The Herb Society of America, 2 Independence Court, Concord, Mass. 07042.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

us,'No Bunk About Bogie',"Katharine Hepburn's unmistakable voice is in every word of THE MAKING OF THE AFRICAN QUEEN: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind (Knopf, $15.95). This slim memoir is as spirited, appealing and shrewdly elusive as its author. Writing in a talkative style full of detours and oh dear's, she looks back 36 years and recalls weeks in the former Belgian Congo, where her hut had straw matting over a mud floor and she was thrilled to have a better view than the Bogarts. ''Don't pretend. I know what you're wanting to know. Bogie. What was he like,'' she says. ''He liked to drink. He drank. . . . There was no bunk about Bogie.'' More often, we hear a jungle story of fire ants and polluted water. The richest memories sneak up on the reader -perhaps on the writer. Her friendship with John Huston - who died two weeks ago - was slow starting. She complained about the script; he showed off his riding boots to distract her. In time, though, they went elephant hunting together. This is the Hepburn we know: the woman who leaves ''Betty Bogart'' behind to fix the crew's lunch while she tracks elephants, who has the wit to see herself in a ''sort of white planter's suit,'' looking like a ''freckled female impersonator.'' The 45 black-and-white photographs include some of her in that suit and many nostalgic movie-set views. But the best are less familiar off-the-set shots. Bogart and Lauren Bacall eat breakfast in their robes, Hepburn and Huston ride a bike, in poses that suit the memoir's tone: artfully casual and happy.",1987-09-13T05:00:00+0000

But in a recent interview with the columnist Carl T. Rowan, Ms. McCorvey said it wasn't true. She was not raped at all, she said, but was so frustrated and bitter at being denied an abortion that she made up a compelling circumstance. A 21-year-old waitress at the time, too poor to go to a state with more liberal abortion laws, she gave birth and put her baby up for adoption. She never made the rape allegation in her suit, which led to the legalization of abortion in all 50 states.

The accord sets up a second Moscow-Washington communications link. Page A1 An office associated with the P.L.O. was ordered to cease operation and divest itself of its property within 30 days by the State Department. The action is certain to be challenged in the courts. A1 France's leading far-right politician and a candidate for the French presidency, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has caused an uproar with a statement that the Nazi gas chambers were ''a minor point'' of history. A3 Northern Nicaraguan authorities hope many United States-backed guerrillas will lay down their arms under terms of a new amnesty, but so far few have done so. Residents say there has been no lull in fighting since the accord was signed. A10 News analysis: Leaving Iraq with no sign of a breakthrough, the United Nations Secretary General ended an effort to still the war between that country and Iran. Damascus faces a conundrum that some say is of its own creation. A14 Hunger is spreading in Ethiopia again, the former head of that country's famine relief effort said. ''It appears there are now about five million people affected by famine, and we don't know how bad it may get,'' he said. A6 A computer network run by NASA was broken into by a group of West German computer hobbyists, who rummaged freely among the data for at least three months before they were discovered, computer enthusiasts and network users said. A12 I.B.M. and Fujitsu Ltd. were ordered to share a vast amount of programming data by an arbitration panel, settling a dispute over the Japanese company's right to base its computer designs on American-developed technology.

A1 News analysis: Judge Bork found himself on the defensive almost as soon as the Senate Judiciary Committee began its exploration of his fitness to serve on the court despite stirring testimonials for him. A26 Some of Joseph Biden's speeches are the focus of a growing controversy in Washington. In a number of cases, politicians of both parties are pointing out, Senator Biden has used passages from others' speeches without attribution. A1 The Pope met Hollywood leaders and urged them to shun obscene depictions of sex and violence. He told the media and entertainment figures they have ''marvelous tools which others lack.'' A24 Pat Robertson will run for President. Mr. Robertson will announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination on Oct. 1. He said he would continue a petition drive to add four million names to the three million people who have already expressed support. D30 Mr. Robertson won another victory over Vice President Bush, triumphing in a key procedural test that could determine how Michigan will cast its votes at the Republican National Convention next year.

The indictments came after a yearlong investigation of suspected payroll abuses in the Legislature. A1 A slick of waste that washed ashore in New Jersey this summer may have come from New York City. Federal officials said there was ''overwhelming evidence'' that the city was the source of much of the slick of hospital waste and timber. A1 New York City's jail population, while still dangerously high, is not reaching the peak previously estimated for next month, the city's correction commissioner said. ''We're a little more hopeful than we were before,'' he said. B1 Meade Esposito still carries himself as the boss of Brooklyn politics. But spending his days on charges of bribery sitting before a judge instead of ''making'' them, as he boasted of in days gone by, is taking its toll. B1 In the Howard Beach murder trial, defense lawyers said they were not following a policy of excluding blacks from the jury but wanted to be sure that any blacks chosen would be fair and impartial. B1 News analysis: The U.S. Open final between Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander was the longest in the tournament's history, lasting 4 hours 47 minutes. But is more necessarily better in tennis?

Since most of the inmates, who pass their time imbibing reefer smoke and loud noises from their boom boxes, necking, negotiating drug sales and beating up on one another, have been kicked out of other schools, expulsion holds no fears. Also, they lack a healthy self-image. As one says, ''Garbage never leaves the dump.''",1987-09-18T05:00:00+0000

May 1960 Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev go to Paris, but the Russian uses the shooting down of the American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union to scotch the meeting. Results: Increased tensions. June 1961 Mr. Khrushchev and President Kennedy, in Vienna, have heated exchanges. Results: No formal agreements.

Results: Though United States Senate never approves treaty, both sides agree to observe limits informally. November 1985 President Reagan and Mikhail S.

us,Journey to a Joint Understanding,"June 9, 1977 NATO reports the Soviet Union has been deploying the SS-20, a three-warhead, intermediate-range ballistic missile, in its western regions. Oct. 28, 1977 In a speech in London on the dangers of an escalating arms race, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany expresses particular concern about the SS-20. Dec. 12, 1979 NATO's Council of Ministers adopts ''dual track'' approach: The U.S. will begin deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing 2's in 1983; negotiations will be held between U.S. and Soviet Union on limiting medium-range arms. Nov. 18, 1981 President Reagan announces his ''zero-zero'' proposal, which cancels planned deployment of cruise missiles and Pershing 2's in Europe if Soviet dismantles its SS-20's, SS-4's and SS-5's. Included is freeze on shorter-range missiles. Does not include British and French nuclear forces or U.S. aircraft. February-March 1982 Russians reject ''zero-zero'' proposal, countering with call for phased reduction in NATO and Warsaw Pact medium-range missiles and nuclear-armed aircraft to 600 systems by 1985 and 300 by 1990. Leonid I. Brezhnev also announces moratorium on SS-20 deployment in Europe. Nov. 23, 1983 First Pershing 2's are delivered to Europe and Russians walk out of negotiations without setting date for resumption of talks. March 12, 1985 Medium-range arms talks resume as one part of negotiations in Geneva on nuclear and space arms. U.S. offers version of ''zero-zero'' proposal and Soviet calls for freeze of all new missile deployments, offering to reduce SS-20's in Europe in exchange for elimination of U.S. medium-range missiles. Jan. 15, 1986 Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposes to eliminate all U.S. and Soviet medium-range missiles in Europe over next five to seven years. British and French forces would not be allowed any buildup. Proposal is not linked to other Geneva arms talks. February 1986 U.S. responds with proposal that would eliminate medium-range missiles in Europe by 1990 along with proportional reductions in Soviet SS-20's in Asia. During reduction period, separate and equal limits would be set for warheads. Again, British and French forces are not included. U.S. proposal includes technical details for verification procedures, including on-site inspection, marked deployment areas and procedures for destruction of missiles. Oct. 11-12, 1986 At summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, both sides agree to elimination of all European-based medium-range missiles and equal limits of 100 on warheads outside European theater. Plan rejected because Soviet Union insists on making it part of overall arms deal. Feb. 28, 1987 Mr. Gorbachev announces Soviet willingness to sign ''without delay'' an agreement to eliminate Soviet and U.S. medium-range forces in Europe over next five years. Offer is first time since Reykjavik that Soviet Union has been willing to negotiate separately on medium-range missiles. Proposal identical to one on the table at Reykjavik. March 3, 1987 President Reagan directs U.S. arms negotiators to begin drafting treaty on medium-range missiles in response to Mr. Gorbachev's earlier announcement, and says he welcomes chance to have medium-range arms treaty separate from other arms talks in Geneva. July 22, 1987 Mr. Gorbachev accepts U.S. plan on worldwide elimination of all medium-range missiles, removing his previous requirement of dealing only with such missiles in Europe. Aug. 26, 1987 Chancellor Helmut Kohl announces West Germany will eliminate its 72 Pershing 1A's, with American-owned warheads, if Soviet Union and U.S. agree to plan to scrap all medium- and shorter-range missiles. Sept. 18, 1987 After three days of talks, U.S. and Soviet reach agreement in principle to conclude accord on global elimination of medium- and shorter-range missiles. Details of timing of elimination and verification procedures remain to be worked out. Source: Arms Control Association",1987-09-19T05:00:00+0000

''We may be aware of their historical, political and military significance, but it's important to remember how invigorated America has been by the artistic and intellectual exchanges.'' ''Reciprocities: Paris-New York'' will be led by six scholars who are acknowledged experts on the subject of the artists they will be lecturing about. Ulla E. Dydo, professor of English at City University of New York, will talk Tuesday about the difference between Gertrude Stein the writer and Gertrude Stein the flamboyant public personality. The film, ''Gertrude Stein: When You See This, Remember Me,'' produced in 1971 by Perry Miller Adato and containing filmed footage of Miss Stein and many of her celebrated contemporaries, will be shown. On Sept. 29 Arthur King Peters will discuss the unconventional works of Jean Cocteau in film, poetry, painting, design and music. A seldom-seen film based on an early Cocteau novel called ''Thomas the Imposter,'' produced in 1965, will be screened featuring Jean Marais, Cocteau's longtime companion, as narrator. Future programs are to focus on Jean-Louis Barrault, the distinguished actor, mime and director; Albert Camus, the novelist and member of the French resistance movement in World War II; Andre Malraux, the novelist, essayist and outspoken anti-Fascist, and Simone de Beauvoir, an early feminist and companion of the existential writer Jean-Paul Sartre. Leading these programs will be Muriel Balash, film producer, writer and director; Lionel Abel, professor emeritus of English at State University of New York at Buffalo; and Francoise Dorenlot and Rosette C.

Jobson beat Pelle Petterson of Sweden in the first two races of the two-of-three-race semifinal series, and Gilmour beat Edward Warden Owen in his first two match races. But protests were filed in all four races, leaving the results undecided until an international jury hears the cases today. Gilmour moved into a semifinal position by edging Chris Dickson of New Zealand over a protest earlier in the day, the third of the four-day regatta in New York Harbor. Eight international skippers have been competing, each with a crew of four, in identical 30-foot sloops.

Readers of Christina Stead's masterful chronicle of family life, ''The Man Who Loved Children,'' will immediately recognize the exuberance of style and imagination in the Australian novelist's last major work, left unfinished at her death in 1983 and now edited by R. G. Geering, her literary executor. Like ''The Man Who Loved Children,'' it was inspired by her 10-year residence in America. Caught in a tragic web of familial and political conflict, Emily and Stephen Howard embody what Stead calls the ''American dilemma'' - which is ''that you want to be free and break new ground, speak your mind, fear no man, have the neighbors acknowledge that you're a good man; and at the same time you want to be a success, make money, join the country club, get the votes and kick the other man in the teeth and off the ladder.'' Thus, they are members of both the Communist Party and Hollywood's ''fashionable leftist society''; they decry the rich, yet must depend on periodic handouts from Stephen's wealthy mother; and they have little trouble setting aside their high literary ideals when they discover Emily's gift for making money as a writer of domestic potboilers. ''I'm Dying Laughing'' forcefully portrays the poisonous betrayals of the McCarthy years and the way the most principled-seeming person, ground down by life's compromises, may yield to cynicism. These larger themes are obscured, however, by the attention given to the smallest details of the Howards' daily life, and by a rambling plot that follows the couple through three decades and across Europe and America. By turns fascinating and irritating, the novel is one of those loose and baggy monsters that can try one's patience even as it impresses itself in memory.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

Shortly after ''Katharine the Great'' was first published in 1979, its publisher, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, withdrew it and shredded thousands of copies after reviewing complaints regarding the book's accuracy from Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company, and Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of the newspaper. The book's author, Deborah Davis, filed suit against Harcourt Brace for breach of contract and received a $100,000 settlement in 1983. The new ''Katharine the Great,'' which is essentially the same as the original, is an unauthorized account of Mrs. Graham's life, including her marriage to the brilliant and mentally troubled Philip Graham, who committed suicide in 1963. At his death, Mrs. Graham took charge of The Washington Post, which had been acquired by her father in 1933, and the book tells of her transformation from a bright housewife into what Ms. Davis portrays as a powerful, sometimes ruthless, press mogul. The book offers detail, but it is weakened by an absence of footnotes, though some general sources are mentioned in an appendix. Ms. Davis takes a shot at identifying ''Deep Throat,'' the primary source of The Post's Watergate coverage. She says it was Richard Ober, a Harvard classmate of Mr. Bradlee and a former C.I.A. operative. One of Ms. Davis's central themes is that for many years the C.I.A. has manipulated The Washington Post, as well as other news organizations. For instance, she says that the Watergate scandal was essentially created by the C.I.A. to discredit President Nixon, who was, in turn, trying to discredit the agency. New to this edition is an appendix charging that Mr. Bradlee was part of what Ms. Davis characterizes as a C.I.A.-sponsored propaganda effort in the early 50's to bolster support for the espionage convictions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Mr. Bradlee was press attache at the United States Embassy in Paris at the time, and - in a letter to Ms. Davis included in the appendix - says that as ''the embassy's expert on the case'' he prepared ''a 30,000 word witness-by-witness account of the crime.'' In the same letter, he also says that all Ms. Davis's allegations about his association with the C.I.A. are false.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

Its hero is Bear Belladaywic, a perpetually soused fellow ''addicted to having things happen to him.'' This 34-year-old attorney from Portland, Ore., is a 6-foot-5 blond ex-athlete gone to epic bloated seed. He hasn't had an innocent client in his four years of practice. He is currently representing Joey Holtzman, the leader of a ''27-piece heavy metal marching band'' - a slack-jawed punk accused of gunning down two narcotics officers during a drug raid. Bear is infatuated with Joey's sister Cindy, a local emergency room nurse and the stoic mother of Bear's illegitimate son. As he researches Joey's case, Bear downs kegs of Blitz beer, seduces nubile receptionists and smashes and abandons luxury vehicles. At one point he maneuvers a Sherman tank, serves time in a country club-style penitentiary and samples Master Smack, a drug so potent it is destined to become ''number three on everybody's list. Right behind air and water.'' The novel peaks at Joey's trial, when Bear is set against his own father, a legendary Oregonian prosecutor and beloved Congressman, ''a Clarence Darrow from 1,500,000 B.C.'' Painted as a grand cartoon of slovenly New Wave machismo bent on both salvaging the planet and remaining drunkenly irresponsible, Bear becomes the center of the book's satirical thrust. The plotting of the novel, particularly in its political meanderings, unfortunately, becomes incoherent. A hero like Bear might have been better served by a less dizzyingly haywire framework.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

The traveling show, which is organized by the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, is making its only stop in the Northeast at the Atheneum, where it will remain until Nov. 15. Most of the 118 works executed between 1830 and 1930 are portraits, ''reflecting the fact that women who painted nudes, climbed scaffolding, or traveled alone were socially unacceptable,'' according to the Atheneum's publicist, Claudia Bell. Eleanor Tufts, curator of the show, will give a free lecture at 3 P.M. today. Talks by the director of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Anne-Imelda Radice, and by an art historian, William Gerdts, are scheduled on Oct. 11 and Nov. 8. A number of events related to the show include an original one-act play about Georgia O'Keeffe to be presented at the Hartford Stage Company, 8 P.M. Oct. 23 and 24, and 3 P.M. Oct. 25; a film series at 2 P.M. on four Saturdays in October about the lives of Mary Cassatt, Georgia O'Keeffe, Louise Nevelson and Helen Frankenthaler, and a special children's program on Nov. 14, at the Atheneum. Among other coordinated events and exhibitions around the state is ''American Women Artists of Old Lyme, 1900-40,'' on view Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and 1 to 5 P.M.

us,FICTION,"CUSTOMS VIOLATION. By Janice Weber. (Donald I. Fine, $17.95.) Sexual rancor can be extremely amusing, and luckily a few writers know it. Harold Pinter is one, and another is Janice Weber, who exploits the jolly mental state in her second novel, ''Customs Violation.'' Combatants in her tale of misogyny include customs officials operating out of northern New Jersey, the principals of a lingerie house, a feminist veterinarian, two testy Swiss nationals, and a dog that has undergone a sex change. Ms. Weber shakes them up and sets them loose in locations as various as mountain lakes, Carnegie Hall, Dumpsters and, eventually, an Alpine dining room as it is about to go up in flames. Behind it all is the novelist's interest in whether it is feasible for love actually to exist in a world where men and women find so many causes to dislike one another. Connecting the comic bile are Floyd, an overqualified customs agent on leave in Switzerland to learn how to make an exotic wurst, and (the partly eponymous?) Viola, a woman who only means to make men happy. The big question is whether Floyd and Viola will get together permanently. Ms. Weber supplies a surprising answer, as well as plenty of smiles, chuckles and belly laughs, although devout members of the women's movement may see no cause for guffawing, since her subliminal message seems to be that feminism is on the wane. Also, not all readers will survive the overabundance of forced similes; Ms. Weber's writing is too clever by at least a quarter. Not a big problem, but a problem nonetheless. Call it craft violation.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

This book, by the New York financial bureau chief of The Washington Post, could be read as a cautionary tale about what happens when a big deal goes bad. After all, giant Texaco was forced into bankruptcy by the $10.53 billion verdict levied against the company by a Houston jury. Remember, Pennzoil sued Texaco for buying Getty Oil just four days after Pennzoil thought it had its own agreement to acquire Getty. But despite the fact that much of Pennzoil's case rested on the lack of ethics on Wall Street, the mergers-and-acquisitions boom goes on at the same pace, with little or no regard for what the jury found. Companies take poison pills, targets get hugged by bears and the sharks are still looking for blood, to mix a few metaphors from the world of high and fast finance. Texaco's problems will probably end up as an interesting footnote in the history of the major corporate reorganization this country has undergone as a result of these giant mergers, and it will be a singularly well-annotated footnote. ''The Taking of Getty Oil'' is the second book to come out this summer on this messy financial and legal battle. The first book, ''Oil & Honor'' by Thomas Petzinger Jr., a Wall Street Journal reporter, used a fast-paced thriller style that kept the action moving through the complex legal issues. Steve Coll, while also making use of recollected and reconstructed dialogue to enliven the story, writes a less dramatic, but in many cases more clear, version of the deal. Both authors had great material to work with. Gordon Getty, the absent-minded composer who happened to end up with control of 40 percent of one billion barrels of oil, is an effective foil for some of the most aggressive deal makers in the financial world. Narrative nonfiction was originally used to tell stories of great crime, like Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood.'' Now that writers are giving business the same treatment, the arcane world of finance is becoming more accessible to the rest of us. We may still gasp at the multimillion-dollar fees involved in investment banking, but now we know more about who is earning them and how.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

These behemoths in blue, so hollow of character, are too busy penning biographies, shooting commercials and basking in the eight-month-old limelight to fulfill their true potential. From juggernauts to jugheads, the Giants are not this decade's dynasty; they are only this season's overrated team. WARREN ETHEREDGE New York, N.Y.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"Color photos delineating ancient tribal ruins, rocks sculpted by the winds and striations in the Southwestern desert sands are juxtaposed in this book with pictures of ancient and contemporary coiled basketry, Navajo rugs and Pueblo pottery. Earth tones and textures reverberate from the land to the crafts in HARMONY BY HAND: Art of the Southwest Indians -Basketry, Weaving, Pottery (Chronicle Books, Cloth, $30; Paper, $16.95). The authors - Patrick Houlihan, Jerold L. Collings, Sarah Nestor and Jonathan Batkin, all experts on the culture of the American Southwest - use rare black-and-white portraits as well, many from the turn of the century, showing the artisans at work. The text is less enticing. Technology and the history of these tribal crafts are discussed in phrases that tend to be as dry as the desert winds. For centuries Indian craftsmen have believed in the spiritual qualities of the materials they employ; their designs can often be traced back to distant ancestors; and there is, among a few other oases in the book, an explanation of the spirit path, a broken line in the design that allows the artists' spirits to escape from their basketry, weaving or pottery. So it is hard to understand how the intricate patterning of men and beasts on a masterly basketry bowl could be dismissed here as designs that are ''merely decorative and have no particular symbolic significance.'' Perhaps the artists feared that sharing mystical secrets with museum experts would disturb the harmonies these talented hands created.",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

Blessed and cursed with an absurdly acute olfactory lobe, an 18th-century maker of perfumes named Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is both a vampire, who kills young women for their scents, and an artist, who creates invisible sculptures of smells. Translated from the German, this novel, a ''meditation on the nature of death, desire and decay'' is a ''remarkable debut,'' our reviewer, Peter Ackroyd, said last year. CADILLAC DESERT: The American West and Its Disappearing Water, by Marc Reisner. (Penguin, $8.95.) To the author, the American West is a vast, expensively maintained Disneyland - a synthetic fantasy world whose dependence on heroic feats of hydraulic engineering makes it as likely to endure as a flash flood in a desert arroyo. This ''revealing, absorbing, often amusing and alarming report . . . recounts how huge sums have been spent to benefit small numbers of influential people,'' Gladwin Hill said here in 1986, ''and suggests painful days of reckoning lie ahead.'' WHERE YOU'LL FIND ME: And Other Stories, by Ann Beattie. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) Ann Beattie's spare stories are peopled with survivors of the 60's and 70's who feel disconnected from one another and from reality itself, as they wait around for their real lives to begin. While a few of these stories ''pursue economy to the point of inconclusiveness,'' Thomas R. Edwards said here last year, ''most of them have the sensitive elegance one hopes for from this remarkably gifted writer.'' BIRD OF LIFE, BIRD OF DEATH: A Naturalist's Journey Through a Land of Political Turmoil, by Jonathan Evan Maslow. (Laurel/Dell, $6.95.) When the author, a naturalist whose previous book was ''The Owl Papers,'' set out in search of the sacred quetzal bird, he found not only a species endangered but a country as well. His portrait of Guatemala, where mountainous beauty clashes with human suffering, is ''wonderful,'' our reviewer, Graeme Gibson, said last year. ''His touch is sure.'' DESSA ROSE, by Sherley Anne Williams. (Berkley, $3.95.) The poet Sherley Anne Williams thought it was sad that two obscure historical figures - a pregnant black woman who led a slave revolt and a lonely white North Carolina woman who gave refuge to runaway slaves - had never met. She remedied the oversight in a novel that our reviewer, David Bradley, last year called ''an absorbing fusion that is both elegant poetry and powerful fiction.'' ON MODERN MARRIAGE: And Other Observations, by Isak Dinesen. Translated by Anne Born. (St. Martin's, $7.95.) After her husband had given her syphilis and she had begun her affair with Denys Finch Hatton, Karen Blixen wrote an essay comparing marriage (''mutual mental cannibalism'') and the virtues of free love. Written before the author took the name Isak Dinesen and produced her stories and memoirs of Africa, the book ''poignantly illuminates this adventurous woman's passionate refusal to be possessed or possessive,'' Susan Gubar wrote here in 1986. SAFE HOUSES, by Lynne Alexander. (Dell, $4.50.) Gerda, forced into prostitution by her father during World War II, does not know if her daughter, now living with her in a Brooklyn tenement, was fathered by a murderer, Adolf Eichmann, or a hero, Raoul Wallenberg. In 1985 our reviewer, Laurel Graeber, praised the novel for offering ''a stark and unsentimental view that is disturbing and often affecting.'' DESCARTES' DREAM: The World According to Mathematics, by Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh. (Houghton Mifflin, $12.95.) The technocrats' belief that nothing is real that can't be quantified is often traced to the 17th-century philosopher Rene Descartes, who dreamed of a world in which all questions could be answered computationally. In this book of essays, the authors of ''The Mathematical Experience'' offer ''an antidote to the Cartesian view that mathematical and scientific knowledge will suffice to solve the central problems of human existence,'' our reviewer, Daniel Gorenstein, said last year. SEVEN RIVERS WEST, by Edward Hoagland. (Penguin, $6.95.) In the 1880's, Cecil Roop, hoping to capture grizzly bears and train them to perform in vaudeville, leaves home to explore the West. Edward Hoagland, known for his essays on wildlife and wilderness, not only tells a good adventure story but also ''makes the reader grieve for the lost beauty he describes,'' our reviewer, John Irving, wrote in 1986. ''The book aches with melancholy for our past.'' MYTHS OF GENDER: Biological Theories About Women and Men, by Anne Fausto-Sterling. (Basic, $9.95.) Attributing differences between the sexes to biology is not only bad science but an attempt to shore up an oppressive status quo, argues the author, a developmental geneticist at Brown University. Save for an occasional dubious pronouncement, she has ''given us a temperate, judiciously argued book that makes its complicated subjects accessible in clear and uncomplicated prose,'' Daniel J. Kevles said here in 1985. THE WELL, by Elizabeth Jolley. (Penguin, $6.95.) Set in rural Australia, this novel tells of the idyllic relationship between a lonely, crippled spinster and a young orphan girl, and how it is brought to ruin when reality - in the form of a mysterious stranger - intrudes. Last year our reviewer, Robert Coover, criticized the author for being ''more witty than profound'' but admired the way her lines seem to ''radiate with the pleasure she'd had in writing them.''",1987-09-20T05:00:00+0000

Then, after intermission, singers, dancers and musicians will join forces in Nicolas Bernier's ''Apollon, Comus et la Nuit,'' a fanciful divertissement commissioned in 1715 by the Duchesse de Maine, a celebrated insomniac who, to while away her sleepless nights, held all-night parties at her castle in Sceaux, where she staged musical and dance works as part of the festivities.

Page A1 Sanctions against Iran should be adopted if the Iranian President does not ''clearly and unequivocally state'' if his country accepts a cease-fire resolution, President Reagan said at the United Nations. A1 Man in the News: Peter Florin, the East German who is presiding over the 42d General Assembly, is an aristocrat who owes his high position in Eastern Europe to the accident of birth and the luck of a remarkable education. A14 An American Jewish organization supported an international peace conference to break the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was an unusual move for the mainstream Jewish organization, the American Jewish Congress. A1 South Africa might sign a treaty intended to curb the spread of nuclear weapons, officials said. The countryhas been faced with the threat of expulsion from an international atomic agency for failing to sign it. A1 Iraq is facing a war from within waged by Kurdish guerrillas in the north and by a shadowy underground movement drawn from its Shiite Moslem population, diplomats say. Both adversaries, officials say, are sponsored by Iran. A6 Managua bid to censor reported A3 U.S. praises Soviet on pact A3 Listvyanka journal A4 North's testimony questioned A7 Libya recruits Druse militiamen A8 Italian wanted in bank collapse and bombing surrenders A10 Aquino rebukes military leaders A12 U.S. presses Pakistan on nuclear inspections A14 NATIONAL A16-28, B6-7 Baseball's club owners conspired following the 1985 season to block free agents' movements, violating their labor agreement with the players, an arbitrator ruled. It was perhaps the most significant decision since free agency was created. A1 N.F.L. players went on strike after they failed to reach a settlement with the league's owners. The strike of the 1,500 players, whose average salary is $230,000 a year, is the union's second since 1982. A1 Senator Bob Packwood will oppose Judge Robert H. Bork's confirmation to the Supreme Court. The first Senate Republican to oppose the nomination, Mr. Packwood said he believed that the judge would threaten the rights to privacy and abortion. A1 At the Bork hearings, prominent lawyers and political figures testified forcefully and with feeling both for and against the controvertial Supreme Court nomination. B6 The Federal deficit will be smaller than last month's estimate of nearly $160 billion for the fiscal year, Treasury officials said. And contrary to other forecasts, the deficit could also decline next year, they added. D1 Concern is rising in Los Angeles that the city is reaching its capacity to absorb more people. ''This city, which for 100 years grew out, has filled up,'' one city official said. A16 Joseph Biden misstated several facts about his past last April in a campaign appearance in New Hampshire, he acknowledged. But he insisted that many of disputed statements he made then were true. A26 An execution took place in Georgia. Timothy W. McCorquodale was electrocuted for the 1974 torture and murder of a runaway teen-age girl, a murder he said he could not remember. He was the fifth man to be executed in Georgia this year. A24 Chemists are using explosions to create a host of extraordinary new substances likely to play key roles in 21st-century technology. Scientists are borrowing techniques developed for nuclear weapons programs for the process. C1 Minneapolis journal A16 Screening of jurors begins in LaRouche trial A17 Ex-customs aides guilty in slaying A25 Cuomo stands with Moscow, for a time A26 Broad AIDS laws signed in Illinois B7 Washington Talk A28 Reagan still a top campaigner So who's afraid of the White House press corps? REGIONAL B1-4 In the Howard Beach murder trial, the judge ruled that the defense lawyers were seeking to exclude blacks from the jury. He said he would seek to halt the practice by curbing the lawyers' challenges against prospective black jurors. A1 Peremptory jury challenges stir increasing debate B4 Cable television will be available after Mayor Koch approved a company to begin wiring for homes in the Bronx and eastern Brooklyn, a project long delayed by criminal investigations into bidding for New York City's cable franchise. A1 Concerns of firefighters in New York City about job security and pay parity are reflected in the feuding between the city's police and fire agencies over departmental jurisdiction at emergencies. B1 Many AIDS patients are trapped in the city's hospitals because they have no place else to go, even though they are physically well enough to care for themselves. B1 An imaginary baseball league is the source of a deep rift between Governor Cuomo and a former trusted aide. The issue: Mr. Cuomo's baseball team is in eighth place in the rotisserie league. B1 A police officer who was paralyzed from the neck down by a gunman's bullet in the summer of 1986 will move into a specially equipped renovated house on Long Island. Builders and engineers donated their time and materials for the job. B1 A Federal board questioned Lilco on its contention that state and local governments that have refused to participate in emergency planning would indeed respond to a true emergency at the Shoreham nuclear plant.

He has continued his ''iron man'' performance, and had reached No. 2,192 last night as the Carp played the Yomiuri Giants. It was clear that Kinugasa, 40 years old and in his 23d season, had stayed on longer than he had wanted only because of the chance to surpass Gehrig. ''Retirement has been a big problem for me since the end of the 1984 season,'' he said at a news conference in Hiroshima. After a good start this year, he had slumped to a .246 batting average in 106 games with only 40 runs batted in. Even worse, he said, he worried about his fielding and about his level of endurance for next year. ''My confidence in continuing playing has collapsed,'' Kinugasa said.",1987-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who captured gold medals in the heptathlon and the long jump at the recent world track and field championships in Rome, was honored as the McDonald's amateur sportswoman of the year. Ironically, Joyner-Kersee, the amateur - who also won the long jump gold medal at the Pan American Games in Indianapolis last month - probably will profit (in the form of money deposited in her trust fund) far more than Butcher, the professional. The 32-year-old Butcher was awarded $50,000 for her first-place finish at Nome on March 18. But until yesterday, she had received only half that amount. After leaving a news conference at the Plaza Hotel in Manhatten, she received a telegram saying the remaining $25,000 of her purse had been deposited in her bank account. Butcher, who lives with her husband and 150 sled dogs in the sub-zero Alaskan bush country, said she disdains money and the soft life. ''I'm totally dedicated to mushing dogs,'' she said. ''I don't care about anything else. I don't use a clock or a calendar and I don't see many people. I'm not dependent on anyone for anything. Even the threat of nuclear war doesn't frighten me.

At least one or two of the singers must be identifiable at sight as certified semipopular celebrities, artistic considerations aside.

Last evening's Metropolitan opening, a performance of ''Otello'' in Franco Zeffirelli's ponderous 1972 staging, fulfilled all those expectations. Happily, however, everything went off more smoothly, both vocally and as sheer theater, than might have been expected, even if the evening never came close to being the riveting experience that Verdi's masterly account of the Shakespearean drama can be in inspired hands, or throats.",1987-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Among the references were 19th-century garden pieces, American Shaker designs, 18th-century French furniture and styles recalling the 50's and 60's. Even at Memphis, the quirky avant-garde movement founded by Ettore Sottsass six years ago, some designs were nostalgic. Hard-edge minimalism, always a staple at the fair, was well represented, too.

The work of this West German painter, who died in 1977 at the age of 34, is intriguing for its suggestion that geometric abstraction can be made out of anything, provided it is properly considered and presented. One of the best paintings among the 14 to be seen at Sperone Westwater is from Mr. Palermo's ''Stoffbild'' (or material painting) series of the late 60's. Mr. Palermo made it by simply sewing together two widths of solid-colored fabric (a narrow band of aqua blue and a much wider one of true blue) and affixing the resulting square to stretcher bars whose thinness balanced that of the cloth. The blue against blue field suggests a thoroughly distilled Mediterranean landscape, but it is also, primarily, a glowing optical unit that is recognizably a painting but that does not disguise the everyday quality of its origins.",1987-09-25T05:00:00+0000

A Chicago regulation barring night games at the ballpark remained in effect, but there wasn't any chance of postseason play there this year anyway since the Cubs were in last place in the National League East. ''My approval . . . removes the problem of meeting network television demands for nighttime playoff and All-Star games at Wrigley Field in the future,'' Thompson said.

us,Dining Out Guide; Pre-Theater,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. CHEZ NAPOLEON, #365 West 50th Street (265-6980) - *(Nov. 18, 1983) Just west of Eighth Avenue is this French bistro in two tiny pleasantly seedy dining rooms with a kitchen that offers some enjoyable bourgeois cooking. The best starters are the traditional ones: moules marinieres in a creamy, garlicky, slightly peppery sauce; well-seasoned chunky pate, and onion soup made with deep rich stock brimming over with onions and cheese. Main-dish choices include blood sausage; frogs' legs laced with garlic, and bouillabaisse made with four different fish, lobster, clams and mussels. Dinner entrees $10 to $18. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. JEZEBEL, #630 Ninth Avenue, at 45th Street (582-1045) - **(Aug. 28, 1987) The intriguing setting for this soul-food restaurant is a cross between a leafy nightclub and a vintage clothing boutique with assorted foliage, multicolored shawls hanging from ceiling pipes and a potpourri of Oriental rugs and vintage posters. There are two seatings nightly, and if you have theater tickets, they make a point of getting you out on time. To start, you might choose smothered garlic shrimp in a zesty red sauce; rib bits, which are morsels of sweetly coated pork ribs, or Charleston she-crab soup. Entrees are generous and include a fine fried chicken, succulent and mildly peppery with collard greens; chicken waffles, roasted chicken under pan-dripping gravy with golden waffles and butter, as well as curried goat in a brassy sauce with cayenne pepper with rice, beans and collard greens. Entrees $13.75 to $18.75. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 11:45 P.M.; closed Sundays. LATTANZI, #361 West 46th Street (315-0980) - *(Sept. 14, 1984) Exposed brick walls and small hanging varicolored lights provide the decor for this pleasant, simply decorated restaurant in the heart of the theater district. You might start with carciofo alla Giudea, which is baby artichoke in olive oil and garlic; tortellini, in appetizer portion, in a zesty tomato sauce, or cappellini primavera, with perfectly cooked vegetables. For a main dish, options include veal with mushrooms broiled with the flavor of sage; osso bucco, a special; scampi with garlic and wine, and browned nuggets of chicken in a creamy, lightly spiced tomato sauce. Entrees $13.95 to $21.95. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays, 5 P.M. to midnight; closed Sundays. RUSSIAN SAMOVAR, #256 West 52d Street (757-0168) - *(March 6, 1987) This understated and moderately priced restaurant in the theater district has well-spaced tables with long banquettes and walls covered with straw-colored fabric. The kitchen offers a standard repertory of Russian dishes, and if you are in the mood for a jolt of good vodka and perhaps a plate of grilled lamb or seafood, this is a good place to go. You might begin with eggplant Samovar, grilled eggplant sprinkled with coriander and ground walnuts, or spicy Georgian dried beef rubbed with hot paprika with cucumber-and-onion salad in yogurt. The best main dishes are karski shashlik, which is marinated lamb chops with cabbage salad; salmon shashlik, cubes of salmon in a light white wine sauce with dill potatoes and onions; grilled and deboned Cornish hen, and chicken Kiev. Pre-theater dinner $19.95; entrees $11.95 to 18.95. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. and 5 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 5 P.M. to midnight. What the stars mean, page C28.",1987-09-25T05:00:00+0000

There's a little-known drama that began with the stock market crash of 1929 and ended with the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939 - the political awakening of scientists in America, documented here by Peter Kuznick, who teaches history at the American University in Washington. During the Depression, scientists, blamed for the technologies that put people out of work, were forced to see themselves as enmeshed in society and politics. And American scientists found two vivid examples of the entwining of science and society outside this country, in the Soviet Union's attempt to build an industrial society on the rational foundation of science, and in Nazi Germany's ghastly twisting of science for fascist ends. So American scientists, or rather a prominent handful of them, became fervent anti-fascists and sometimes socialists. In the mold of the already radicalized British scientific associations, they established the American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom, the American Association of Scientific Workers, and the Science and Society movement within the American Association for the Advancement of Science. After this invigorating dip into politics, however, they woke to a much colder reality - the signing of the Nazi-Soviet pact. That cut short their idealization of the Soviet Union, but not, luckily, the hope for a humanitarian society based on rationality. Mr. Kuznick packs into his book details about so many committees, meetings and manifestoes that this dramatic decade sometimes blurs in a bureaucratic haze. Nonetheless, the story is certainly worth telling.",1987-09-27T05:00:00+0000

His theory, which laid the foundation for quantum electrodynamics, won him the Nobel Prize in Physics five years later, in 1933.As to those lovely stories, most involve both Dirac's reticence - rooted, it is said, in his domineering father's insistence on being spoken to in French - and his quality of mind. One related by several contributors concerns dinner with E. M. Forster. Dirac asks Forster what really happened in the cave in Forster's novel, ''Passage to India'' and Forster's answer varies in different versions. In a chapter called ''Some thought Dirac odd,'' Rudolph Peierls of Oxford says Dirac asked: ''Could there not have been a third person in the cave?'' ''Absolutely not,'' Forster replied. ''As usual,'' says Mr. Peierls, ''Dirac had thought of an interesting possibility which had occured to nobody else.''",1987-09-27T05:00:00+0000

The author, a biologist formerly with the New York City Parks Department, is struggling for survival with such tough established species as John Kieran's ''Natural History of New York City.'' No fear, there is a niche for ''The Urban Naturalist.'' As well as describing (with the help of Jerome Lo's rather sketchy illustrations) a lot of plants and animals that manage to inhabit American cities, Mr. Garber addresses the environmental pressures and opportunities that make them do so. Many of these cases are familiar; for instance the pigeon, which nests on the ledges of metropolitan cliffs and prospers on a diet of baked goods. Some are less so, like the snapping turtle, which survives in any kind of water and lays eggs near park ponds at night. Generous in his sympathies, Mr. Garber admires the unconquerable ailanthus: ''When in seed, some of these trees are absolutely stunning. . . . More power to them.'' There are mysteries in the urban ecology; we see that ''some plants thrive on disturbed soils when just a few miles out of town these species are virtually nonexistent.'' I am grateful to the author for his sections on lowly urban plants, too often neglected by city naturalists for noble creatures like the peregrine falcon. The common reed Phragmites and the purple loosestrife are moving in on us, with consequences to our soggier soils we cannot now guess. Fortunately the loosestrife is beautiful and the reed edible (Mr. Garber tells us how). I wish he had included the pokeweed, which abounds in these parts and furnishes fine salads in the spring. But I'm glad he omits fungi; the fewer people who know which New York City mushrooms to eat, the better for me.",1987-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Unfortunately for him, all references to professional pedigrees are forbidden on the Kentucky ballot. So Mr. Mead changed his legal name to Robert Mead C.P.A. He - Mr. C.P.A., that is - won in a landslide. The electoral triumph is good news for C.P.A.'s, but it doesn't exactly establish a precedent many will follow. While pleased with their reputation for probity, some accountants around the nation are interested in changing other aspects of their stereotypical image.

us,IN SHORT,"NUCLEAR IMPERATIVES AND PUBLIC TRUST: Dealing With Radioactive Waste. By Luther J. Carter. (Resources for the Future/Johns Hopkins University, $25.) The problem of stemming the global flood of garbage is increasingly intractable. When the refuse in question consists of waste from nuclear reactors, it threatens the lives and welfare of our descendants millenniums hence. Luther J. Carter, a science reporter formerly with Science magazine, spent eight years in the investigation that led to this book. In spare, fact-laden prose, he traces the roots of the radioactive-waste dilemma and calls for an urgent halt to 30 years of governmental dithering. Not only does he outline solutions for the disposal of spent reactor fuel that seem practical and effective, but his treatment of the subject is refreshingly free of the partisanship that generally clouds public discussions of nuclear power. Even if the United States were never to build another reactor, he reports, this country will have accumulated 41,500 tons of high-level radioactive waste by the year 2000. Nuclear power will not disappear, at least not quickly, he says, so the real issue is to make it safer. He concludes that the best way to dispose of nuclear waste is by deep burial, and he believes that entombment within Yucca Mountain, Nevada, one of the sites under consideration by the Department of Energy, would present the fewest problems. Objections by people living near a disposal site should be met, he says, not only by stringent safeguards against accidents, but also by remuneration; China, he reports, offered three years ago to accept and bury reactor waste from West Germany on payment to Peking of $1,512 per kilogram - surely one of the highest garbage disposal fees ever levied. .",1987-09-27T05:00:00+0000

He's got catching duties, he's calling pitches and he's trying to throw out runners. That's what makes it so amazing.'' Santiago, 22 years old, hit a single to left-center field in the fifth inning on an 0-2 pitch by Bob Welch of the Dodgers. That extended the National League's longest batting streak this season and broke the major league record for a rookie set by James Williams of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1899 and equaled by Santiago on Friday night. In that game, Santiago lined an opposite-field single to right in the first inning off Tim Belcher to break the modern record for a rookie set by Guy Curtright of the Chicago White Sox in 1943. Santiago is batting .345 during the streak (40 for 116) and has raised his season average to .298. ''It's really exciting,'' Santiago said after Friday night's game.

The 36-year-old actor has grown a beard for the occasion and will wear a contemporary costume - as will the rest of the cast. Mark Lamos, Hartford Stage's director, has put the King in a military uniform and the Queen in clothes that might suit Nancy Reagan or Margaret Thatcher. ''Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern will have a 'Miami Vice' look,'' said the company public-relations representative, Howard Sherman, ''or something equally trendy that young men are wearing today.'' This interpretation of Shakespeare's classic will have no ramparts, crenelated towers, thrones, portieres or weighty silver goblets. The stage will be the set, with scaffolding and various implements of construction as the only furnishings. ''It will be a 1930's theater in the process of renovation,'' said Mr. Sherman. ''Some ordinary chairs will be scattered around.'' But the text will remain inviolate. Monique Fowler has the role of Ophelia; Richard Poe is the King; Pamela Payton-Wright plays the Queen, and Polonius is Robert Gerringer. Mr. Thomas has distinguished himself on Broadway in ''Fifth of July'' and ''The Front Page.'' Mr. Lamos returns to ''Hamlet'' after staging it in 1980 at the California Shakespearean Festival. Performances are scheduled at 7:30 P.M. Tuesday through Thursday, 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday, 2:30 and 7:30 P.M. Sunday and a 2 P.M. matinee on Wednesdays. Tickets are $22 Friday and Saturday and $16.50 for all other performances. Tickets for preview performances Saturday through Oct. 8 cost $11.

Several members of Congress have offered bills that would restrict discrimination and guarantee the confidentiality of the results of tests for infection with the virus.

Now 64, and a naturalized British citizen since 1939, Freud was born and raised in Berlin. When Hitler came to power in 1933, the family went to London as refugees. Freud has always been a difficult, disconcerting and resolutely private artist. He has never had, nor sought, a large constituency, either in this country or anywhere else. But in England he has been unmistakably there, as a disquieting and often worrisome presence, ever since April 1940, when a self-portrait drawing of him was reproduced in the third issue of ''Horizon,'' a monthly magazine edited by Cyril Connolly. In the London of that day, in which World War II seemed likely to take an ever more terrible turn, Freud at 17 and 18 began to be spoken of as the equivalent of Tadzio in Thomas Mann's ''Death in Venice'' -the magnetic adolescent who, to his admirer, seemed by his very presence to keep the plague at bay.

us,IN SHORT,"THE WORLD OF PHYSICS: A Small Library of the Literature of Physics From Antiquity to the Present. Three Volumes. By Jefferson Hane Weaver. (Simon & Schuster, $29.95 each; boxed set, $90.) It is not always impossible for general readers to understand physicists; in fact, they can often be read with pleasure, as you will find in many of the 182 pieces collected from writings of a gross of scientists in Jefferson Hane Weaver's compendium. (Its three volumes are subtitled ''The Aristotelian Cosmos and the Newtonian System,'' ''The Einstein Universe and the Bohr Atom'' and ''The Evolutionary Cosmos and the Limits of Science.'') Some essays resort in places to the mother tongue of physics, mathematics, and will baffle even the ''educated novice'' Mr. Weaver wants to read his book. Not surprisingly, some of the most lucid essays are by the giants, such as Max Planck and Einstein (there is, however, a howler in a Latin phrase in one of his). From Pythagoras to Newton to Richard Feynman, these physicists reveal a beautiful universe and an exciting science. Roger Penrose is concise, clear, even comic, about black holes in plain English. About the mother tongue of physics Eugene P. Wigner is quite witty in ''The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.'' Werner Heisenberg argues eloquently that there is no way to talk about atomic reality in ordinary language, but Gustav Bergmann offers an empiricist philosophy of physics which proves there are no atoms anyway - and thereby reveals how physicists, and philosophers, think. The mischievous John von Neumann's ''Self-Reproducing Automata'' may leave you wondering who you are, or whether, or how many. But turn to that quantum genius Erwin Schrodinger on ''What Is Life?'' and you will learn with the thrill of recognition how alive the physical universe is. There is much more to enchant the educated novice, or even the untutored amateur, with this strange world.",1987-09-27T05:00:00+0000

A crowd of 5,000 watched the match, which lasted 4 hours 12 minutes. Jaite, 22 years old, earned $39,440 for his victory. The 23-year-old Wilander earned $19,720.(AP) An Easy Triumph for Graf: Top-seeded Steffi Graf of West Germany defeated Isabel Cueto of West Germany, 6-2, 6-2, in the final of the $150,000 Virginia Slims tournament in Hamburg, West Germany. The 18-year-old Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, said the triumph was the easiest of her nine tournament victories this year. (AP) Edberg Surprised by Pate: David Pate of Las Vegas, Nev., defeated the No. 2 player in the world, Stefan Edberg of Sweden, 6-4, 6-4, to capture the $315,000 Volvo tournament in Los Angeles. Pate, ranked 19th in the world, won his first title of the year and the second of his career, earning $50,000.(AP) Auto Racing Mansell Closes In on Piquet: Nigel Mansell kept alive his slim chance of catching Nelson Piquet of Brazil, his Williams-Honda teammate, for the Formula One driving title yesterday by cruising to victory in the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez de la Frontera. Mansell's 22.225-second margin over Alain Prost of France gave the Briton his fifth victory of the season and the 12th of his career. He moved into second place in the drivers' standing with 52 points. Piquet, the leader with 70 points, gained 3 points for finishing fourth. With three races left, Mansell has a chance to pass Piquet. Only the 11 top finishes from the 16 Grand Prix races count in the standing, and Piquet already has three firsts, six seconds, a third and a fourth. Mansell has scored points in only eight races, so his finishes in the final three events will count fully, while Piquet must do better than fourth. (AP) Waltrip Breaks Losing Streak: Darrell Waltrip steered through a last-lap tangle involving Dale Earnhardt and Terry Labonte and scored his first victory of the season in the Goody's 500 Nascar Winston Cup race at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia. Waltrip broke a 27-race streak without a victory. He averaged 76.410 miles an hour and led five times in the race for a total of 138 laps, but the day seemed to belong to Earnhardt, who passed Waltrip on the outside on lap 381 and began building an enormous lead until a late caution bunched the field. Earnhardt, Labonte and Waltrip all made pit stops and came out bumper to bumper. Labonte, trying to take the lead, bumped with Earnhardt and scraped the wall on the backstretch. Going into the third turn on the last lap, Waltrip nudged the nose of his car inside the left rear of Labonte's. The cars made contact. Labonte spun out, and Earnhardt wavered, allowing Waltrip to speed by on the inside.(AP) Golf One-Stroke Victory for Pate: Steve Pate emerged from a tense fight with four other golfers with a five-under-par 67 yesterday and won the $400,000 Southwest Classic in Abilene, Tex., by one stroke. The 26-year-old Californian secured his first PGA Tour victory and the $72,000 top prize with a five-foot par putt on the final hole. His total of 15-under-par 273 gave him the edge over the third-round leader, David Edwards, and Bob Eastwood, Dan Halldorson and Mark O'Meara in the wind-swept finale.(AP) 2d Straight for Stephenson: Jan Stephenson fired a seven-under-par 65 yesterday to win the Konica San Jose Classic by five strokes with a record-setting 54-hole total of 11-under-par 205. The victory was the second straight for Stephenson on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour. She won the Safeco Classic last week. (AP) Barber Wins in Newport: Miller Barber sank a 13-foot birdie putt on the 14th hole to take the lead for good yesterday as he shot a seven-under-par 65 for a three-stroke victory over Bruce Crampton in the $200,000 Newport Cup. Barber finished the 54-hole tournament with a score of 14-under 202 on the 6,566-yard Newport (R.I.) Country Club course. He earned $30,000 for the victory, his 21st on the PGA Senior Tour. Crampton, who had a final-round 67, finished at 205, two strokes ahead of Bob Charles, whose final-round 64 was the best score of the tournament. Gary Player of South Africa, who shot 65 yesterday, finished fourth at 208. (AP) Dog Show Poodle Is Best: An elegant black standard poodle, Ch.
