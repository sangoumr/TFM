Could the old lion lie down with the young lamb? Was it conceivable that these two mutually suspicious, competing and opposing systems could establish a fruitful liaison, despite their traditional differences? It was certainly obvious from the flirtatious manner in which nonprofit theater representatives were being treated a this conference, most conspicuously by representatives from the League of Broadway Theaters, that they were being courted for romantic purposes, and if marriage wasn't being considered, then some kind of tentative commonlaw relationship was about to be ??.",1974-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Roughly half of the works in this new volume by the New Yorker writer are Americanuppermiddleclass exurban New York; the other half are Irishlowermiddleclass County Wexford. Perhaps some contrast is intended between the styles and values of the two cultures. If so, the point of the contrast is lost in the extreme artistic disparity between the two groups of stories. The American pieces are shallow, obvious, illcomposed and all but devoid of fresh observation, intellectual subtlety and emotional depth.

us,California Split' Deals Winning Hand,"Robert Altman's ""California Split,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema I, is a fascinating, vivid movie, not quite comparable to any other movie that I can immediately think of. Nor is it easily categorized.It's the story of several weeks in the lives of two compulsive gamblers who meet in a Los Angeles poker parlor and become fast friends, more or less as a result of being jointly mugged in a parking lot.Charlie Waters (Elliott Gould) is your classic little league bettor, debonaire and incurably sloppy, existing happily on the brink of small-scale financial disaster. More to have company than because of emotional involvement, he sleeps in the apartment of two sweet, pretty Los Angeles girls who probably would be serious hookers if they had any ambition.Bill Denny (George Segal) is another kind of gambler. He's an upper middle-class fellow (a magazine editor) whose compulsion appears to be well on the way to wrecking his life. He's separated from his wife, in debt to his bookie and, in the course of the film, ready to sell everything he hascamera, tape-recorder, car and real estatein order to get the stake he needs to play poker with the big boys at the casino in Reno.Like Charlie Waters and Bill Denny, ""California Split"" spends a great deal of its time in poker parlors, at race tracks, in casinos and barrooms, mostly seedy places, smoky, overcrowded, either much too bright or dark as tombs. The sounds of these places  the voices of the croupiers, gamblers and hangers-on, and the songs of Phyllis Shotwell who belts out boozy ballads at a piano barare never long from the soundtrack. Even when Charlie and Bill go into the straight world, these sounds follow them.Mr. Altman has been quoted as saying that ""California Split"" is ""a celebration of gambling,"" which is, I think, to underrate it, at least so it seems to someone who is not a gambling nut. The director, his screenwriter Joseph Walsh and the actors have created a movie of so many associations that it's impossible not to see ""California Split"" as something much more complex and disturbing.Most of the gambling here doesn't really look like much fun. It's as desperate as the woman at the track who furiously throws her pocketbook and several oranges at Elliott Gould because he's touted her off a winner.""California Split"" is sometimes very funny, but the world it depicts is as bleak as a landscape composed entirely of used-car lots. The present tense for everyone in the film is grim. The clocks are out of sync. A character has Fruit Loops and beer for breakfast. Someone says of a poker game: ""It just got started yesterday.""All hopes are pinned on tomorrow. Even those of the two would-be hookers (marvelously well played by Ann Prentiss and Gwen Welles), who have been promised a trip to Hawaii by a couple of otherwise unpromising johns. For the two gamblers, tomorrow is another visit to the track, another game. In the meantime one bets the other that he can't name all seven dwarfs.Like all Altman films, ""California Split"" is dense with fine, idiosyncratic detail, a lot of which is supplied by Mr. Gould and Mr. Segal as well as by members of the excellent supporting cast. Bert Remsen, who was the aging bank robber in ""Thieves Like Us,"" apears briefly and hilariously as a fearful old transvestite much like Scobie, the ex-seaman who became a Muslim saint in Lawrence Durrell's ""Justine"" novels.Up to a certain point, ""California Split"" is, I suppose, a celebration of gambling. It's a movie that avoids as much as possible any simplified Freudian explanations. I say up to a point, because the ending has the effect of making us think back over everything we've seen earlier. To win at poker or anything else can sometimes be as devastating as losing.The compulsive gambler will put up with any loss or indignity in the hope of recouping later, thus placing a terrible burden on the future. For once he does win, everything is over.",1974-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Lee Directs 'Return of the Dragon',"Kicking an enemy into oblivion with his flying feet, grunting and screaming triumphantly, achieving suspenseful pauses between blows, the late Bruce Lee is a pleasure to watch in his last kung fu picture, ""Return of the Dragon,"" which opened Wednesday at neighborhood theaters. Lee's small compact face reveals a flurry of responses as he sends his opponents' torsos hurtling through the air, and he specializes in unpredictable movements.The picture concerns a Chinese restaurant in Rome which is menaced by gangsters who want to buy the property. On behalf of the owners, Mr. Lee has a duel with a vast American karate champion in the Roman forum. Unlike its predecessor, ""Enter the Dragon,"" which was praised as a well-made movie, this picture is dreadfully slow and feeble whenever the cast isn't fighting. So you yearn for each battle, just as you wait impatiently for the songs or dances in a tedious musical. Mr. Lee scripted and directed this picture, and his dialogue  ""Make some tea."" ""Sure, right away""wasn't up to his choreography.There's little bloodshed beyond a couple of discreet nosebleeds, and this brand of meticulous hand-to-hand combat seems rather refreshing, compared to our splashiest gun-flicks, such as ""Magnum Force."" Here, the audience cheers for quick wits instead of weapons, and skill defeats sadism. And it's regrettable that Mr. Lee didn't appear in some more substantial movies, since he did perform so nicely as a furniture-smashing villian in ""Marlowe"" in 1969.",1974-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Graham, the director, has refreshed a tired story; but the performances tend toward unevenness, and one yearns for a more gifted directorial hand when the killer stalks the sole witness to the crime, a little boy struck mute by what he has seen.Preaching cooperation, brotherhood and a sense of obligation while stopping short of advocating vigilante justice, ""Together Brothers"" has its heart in the right place. Street-wise older children might find it to their taste; but all the new trappings cannot disguise the fact that ""Together Brothers"" is an old story, being retold perhaps wisely, but not exceptionally well.",1974-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Chabrol's 'Ophelia':The Cast,"When it takes 12 years for a renowned director's movie to reach our screens, the product is apt to be a jewel or a dog. Claude Chabrol's ""Ophelia,"" made in 1962, has just emerged from the kennel, and although the picture has a bit of historical interest, much of it strays far from the film maker's own talents. ""Ophelia"" opened yesterday at the Playboy Theater.A wealthy young provincial suspects his mother (Alida Valli, a study in bitter restraint) and his uncle of having killed his father in order to marry each other. Clutching some clues from ""Hamlet,"" he tries to expose them by shouting accusations at meals, pretending to be crazy, and by making a short movie about an incestuous crime. Obsessed with seeming and being, denouncing humanity at large, he trots about in the woods in a business suit and tie, hugging his divine discontentMeanwhile, he attempts to force a young woman (Juliette Mayniel) into the role of his Ophelia. Their relationship mainly consists of his murmuring claptrap about the beauties of nature into her ear, while she laughs skittishly and favors him with somber or demure smiles. Eventually, her father  who is of course labeled Polonius  dies in a tree after one of the funniest heart attacks I've seen in years. The quasi-Hamlet remarks that trees bear strange fruit these days.The movie is equally boring and pretentious, because of the characterization of the tormented hero. Played by Andr Jocelyn, he comes across as a huffy bundle of affectations, and between the bouts of hollering, his style is stiff and vapid.However, there are moments that will reward some students of Chabrol, such as the theme of individuals feeling guilty when they're innocent. The elegant camera-work lifts the woodland episodes above the general banality, and the formal meal scenes contain some of Mr. Chabrol's choicer observations of people chewing and swallowing while their pleasure in food is spoiled by the anger in the air. And there are a couple of nice thugs. But ""Ophelia"" hardly evokes Mr. Chabrol's best films, such as ""La Femme Infidle""; instead, it recalls his creakiest earlier work, like ""Les Cousins"" and ""Landru.""",1974-08-08T05:00:00+0000

The action centers about Bradley Pearson, an aging British novelist whose work on his great book is interrupted by a dozen frantic callers, complicating and tangling his life and art calamitously. The way Miss Murdoch tells it obliges the reader to keep revising and reevaluating what he hears, to himself play a role in a kind of epistemological detective story.

us,What's Doing in SARATOGA,"THE LEGEND OF SARATOGAThe curious charm of Saratoga life to a student of human nature is the fact that beyond any other American resort it is a social microcosm in which our distinctive national traits are happily juxtaposed in miniature. Thus wrote one observer in the late 1800's when Saratoga, in upstate New York, was Queen of the Spas, rivaled only by Newport, R.I. But Saratoga was different: its social life centered on cavernous hotels, mineral waters, gambling casinos and race tracks, not in the millionaires' cottages that made Newport famous. Saratoga was impious, opulent and exuberant. Today, however, the gambling casino is a museum; the old hotelsincluding the United States Hotel where President Ulysses S. Grant liked to give partiesare almost all gone, replaced by modern, sleek homogenized motels; the mineral waters still flow but their consumption has dropped because of a controversy about radioactive materials; and the road that leads into town is the same strip of motels, gas stations and fastsnack places that desecrate most American cities. But Saratogaor Saratoga Springs, to give it its official nameis a good place to visit, a small city with a magnificent center for the performing arts, a famous spa, the site where one of the decisive battles of the world was fought, and many fine restaurants. And, in a throwback to its raffish past, for one month of the yearwhen the thoroughbreds return each AugustSaratoga is different againcrowded, gay, exultant, expensive.",1974-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Conversely, Borges, known largely for his ficciones, has now published his fifth volume of poems, a unified sequence of profound observations about people and things, dreams and darkness, showing that Borges, in giving primacy to poetry, is right. Yet with typical shiftiness, Borges also claims there is really no difference between his ficciones and his poems, that anyway he would like to be remembered less as a poet than as a friend, that he too dislikes them [the poems], and finally, reversing himself, he speaks about the book which in the end may justify [him].",1974-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Roughly the size and shape of my SmithCorona typewriter, Mitchell's custommade instrument connects to his scalp with small electrodes to register the four basic rhythms of the human brainalpha, beta, theta and delta. Between beta, the routine wakeful state of everyday consciousness, and delta, the rhythm of deep unconscious sleep, lie alpha and theta, the slower cycles registered in the state of meditation.

Alfredo Garcia"" begins ???liantly, especially because ??? the pacing. Knowing ??? when to speed the action ??? or slow it down, Mr. Peck???pah grabs our total attention. Then the movie disintegrates rapidly. ""Garcia"" opened ???terday at Cinerama, and ??? East 59th Street Twin 2 and the RKO 86th Street Twin 2 theaters.???ly, you fear for ??? hunted man-???above all because this is a Peckinpah picture. But it's quickly explained that Garcia is already ???-???of drunken drivi??? which seems about as ??? as dying of vic???. Without Garcia as ??? victim, the plot has almost ???where to go. Theref??? ???dom episodes are slung ??? the narrative, includ??? one of the silliest near-r??? scenes I've ever seen. The wo??? ??? supposed to welcome ???e, and the acting ??? ???h a phony lyricism: the ???ailant fo???s with her hair, ???ich inspires her to kiss ???. But even this gratuitous ???bage can't prevent the ???vie from dragging.""Garcia"" focuses on Ben???, (Warren Oates), an American obsessed with locating Garcia's corpse and pocketing the loot. He lurches through Mexico with a testy though super-submissive girlfriend (Isela Vega, a study in wood), who dissolves into sodden, doggy gratitude when he says he loves her.Bennie guns down anyone who gets in the way; often, ???seems to kill out of sheer ??? temper. Among the repetitive shoot-outs, there's one fine moment which re??? Mr. Peckinpah's best ??? after a large family ??? been wiped out at a roadside, one old man survives, his hands meekly raised while the murderers turn on one another and ignore the pa??? figure that's waiting to ???-???or die.Corpses are roughly treated throughout this movie: Bennie ??? a couple of shots into a ??? stiff ""because it feels ??? goddam good!"" Meanwhile ??? seems like a spoo??? on ???. After Garcia's grave is robbed, his severed head becomes the leading character in the picture. Bennie chats to it, pours booze on it, and it even gets a shower. When the thing is eventually brought to the christening of Garcia's newborn child, the camera dwells on the baby's head: a close-up that's repeated just in case you missed the point.The movie isn't as bloody as some of Mr. Peckinpah's others. Instead, it's profoundly pessimistic -??? because of the empasis on obscene acts committed merely for money. Bennie is momentarily made to rebel against the many deaths. But we can't believe him, since he had to kill all those people simply to flesh out this movie.Warren Oates is blustery, sometimes frantic, and Isela Vega gives the most awkward performance by an actress since Kerima played the primitive in ""An Outcast of the Islands."" Gig Young, Kris Kristofferson and Helmut Dantine are wasted in roles that give them little chance to act.

For stand-bys, there are several crunching fights and a good old cattle stampede. The Hawaiian locale (the island of Lauai) makes an exotic, often luscious backdrop.

Nixon to James D. St. Clair. ""Confessions of a Police Captain"", directed by Damiano Damiani, was made in Italy in 1971, but it's nicely up to date on the questions of political cover-ups, bribery and immunity. The movie is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room.Martin Balsam has a brash, brisk authority as a police captain obsessed with nailing criminals who have stayed above the law, thanks to the aid of local politicians. He and Franco Nero, as the elegant District Attorney, both initially suspect each other of shielding the Mafia, which controls the construction trade. Meanwhile, official corruption flourishes, and uncooperative witnesses tend to wind up in cement.The elaborate plot is occasionally confusing. But this thoughtful, modest movie about the perversion of justice is worth seeingespecially for Mr. Balsam's performance as a man accused of fanaticism. This actor is always good at losing his temper, and he brings subtlety to a complex character who has come to feel that the police are the instruments of the gangsters and who breaks the law because he has lost all faith in the courts.",1974-08-16T05:00:00+0000

What mystifies the swimmingpool industry is that pool construction has also gone upby 35 per cent in the first six months of the year.

But yet, one wonders if the high price of gasoline or the hike in air fares means that much to people who are willing to spend from $10,000 to $50,000 to build and landscape an inground pool, One reason may be that pools are much more attractive, these days as architects and designers give them serious thought.

The pictorial result ranges in quality from picture postcard, to album cover.Since its principals possess neither interesting personalities nor captivating philosophies, it is fortunate that the bulk of the film is given over to their music. It is unfortunate that their music, which ranges from traditional rock to sci-fi, fails the test one of the group sets for itmoving the listenerdespite the array of electronic equipment marshaled in its behalf.""Pink Floyd"" may be for Pink Floyd fans.

Some are the too-familiar urban Westerns  where the city cop stands in for the local sheriff, while the Indians are replaced by drug dealers  and they tend to be pitifully poor of plot, with almost no suspense to link the shoot-outs or chases. In fact, I'd love to learn why many action movies have to be so dull.""Newman's Law,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, trots out the mossy formula that should be given at least one month's rest: an incorruptible detective is accused of being on the take and is therefore suspended. Hence the outraged law-lover continues to investigate the case on his own. There's hardly an episode in this picture that you haven't seen before, from the man with a gun on top of a vast tank (a bumbling reference to James Cagney's great moment in Raoul Walsh's ""White Heat"") to a stabbed waterbed (""The Terminal Man""), and much of it resembles ""McQ,"" John Wayne's dud of last winter Still, there is one original detail: a man who's been beaten by thugs falls bleading onto a pile of giant toy pandas.It's disheartening to see George Peppard playing the quasi-Serpico. I've always had a soft spot for this actor, partly because he often makes one feel that he's more intelligent or sensitive than the characters he personifies. But in recent years, he's shown a gift for picking dreary scripts. Here, he hardly bothers to act. Below the blazing blue eyes, he grits his teeth, clenches his jaw, wipes his mouth with the back of his wrist (a gesture that means tension), or flares his nostrils  all in all, he seems to be auditioning for a parody of the warm-hearted hard head.

us,Screen: 'The Longest Yard' With Burt Reynolds:Prisoners and Guards in Football Match The Cast Film Turns on Violence and Humiliation,"Perhaps we'll get a substantial movie about contemporary prisons and prisoners one of these daysa picture that can actually tell us what it means to be a captive. Meanwhile, we're stuck with splashy fabrications, such as Robert Aldrich's ""The Longest Yard,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State 1 and Loews Orpheum. While we know that prisons throng with sadistic guards, the ones in this movie behave like leering sci-fi monsterswhich makes it easy to forget that atrocities occur off screen as well as on.The picture dwells on the preparations for a ferocious football game between prisoners and guards. Both sides look forward eagerly to mangling one another. Burt Reynolds, as an imprisoned former football star who coaches the convicts' team, contends with Warden Eddie Albert, who's determined that the guards must win and that the prisoners must be humiliated.I suspect that Mr. Reynolds may have watched ""On the Waterfront"" at least a dozen times just before this movie was shot, since he apes Marlon Brando's performance all through ""The Yard."" Pursing or smacking his lips, chewing gum or smirking or wrinkling his nose, he surpasses flattery with his lumbering imitation. Mr. Reynolds departs from mimicry only in his style of wearing clothes: he manages to make even the prison chains look like fashionable men's wear, as though he were modeling the latest in metal accessories.The discomfort of watching Mr. Reynolds is alleviated by Eddie Albert's sly, silky characterization of the sinister warden. He comes on like a restrained but toothy college dean who's welcoming the freshmen""It's nice to have you here""smiles especially when he's angry, and recoils with an academic's sternness when he doesn't like what he hears.Though ""The Yard"" is a terrible picture, I'll admit to having unwillingly enjoyed some of the football practice and parts of the final gameeven though it's much too long. There's no thrill in the sport, since it's the movie director who decides who wins or loses. But the plot does yield some dramatic tensionbecause of what winning or losing represents. The prisoners are playing for their dignity, and even the most reluctant spectator is forced to respond to that theme.Some may want to ponder Mr. Aldrich's appeals to the baser instinctswith references to his ""The Dirty Dozen."" But that seems like an unnecessary exercise, since the issue itself can be better discussed in light of other recent movies. Still, this picture will enlarge the director's dossier of nasty buildups to violence: a man we know will become a human torch delays that torching by pausing to comb his hair before the inevitable explosion, and it's one of the cheaper tricks to grace our screens of late.",1974-08-22T05:00:00+0000

And in this summer of '74, a trip to the springand the classof '48 in rural Georgia is being offered in the form of a film called ""Buster and Billie,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia II and neighborhood theaters.""Buster and Billie"" is at once an alluring and fiercely disappointing movie that leaves one full of regret for what might have been. Chief among its virtues, at a time when so many film makers, either through sloth or contempt, treat originality with disdain, is the focus of its story.Billie (Joan Goodfellow) is an unusual heroine. Bovine in her submissiveness, she is the silent and undemanding dispenser of ultimate sexual favors for the coterie of her teen-age high-schoolmates who surround Buster (Jan-Michael Vincent).Unlike his fellow members of Tomorrow's Farmers of America, Buster, an otherwise unexceptional youth, does not seek out Billieat least at first. He is faithful to, if, not content with, his fiance, Margie (Pamela Sue Martin), who allows him frustrating liberties but busily preserves her virginity during their contortions at night in the front of his little truck.And then, one day, Buster decides to seek out Billie, at first furtively and for the same reason as his classmates; later he dates her openly, to the disapproving astonishment of his townsfolk and because he has come to cherish her as a person. Billie has changed, but the townspeople, especially Buster's classmates, remain the same, with disastrous consequences.But if art resides in the quality of revelation, ""Buster and Billie"" is a failure. For all that the movie suggests, Billie's past is a side effect of impoverished and laconic parents in a community no table neither for its riches nor the garrulousness of its inhabitants.In dealing with Buster and Billie and their schoolmates, Daniel Petrie, the director, and Ron Turbeville, the screen writer, have contended themselves with types, observed keenly but unexplained, remote rather than real, remembered but not revealed. The film suffers, too, from a monotony of judgment that assigns each scene an equal value, whether it is a trimmable segment involving a softball game or a fatal encounter.It's too bad. One wishes this film were less like the early Billieto be visited because it's available  and more like the laterto be cherished because it's special.",1974-08-22T05:00:00+0000

Without racking my brain too much I could have come up with the names of other writers of equal reputation: Barth, Pynchon, Barthelme and so on. Mr. Vonnegut's was the surest. One could admire the others, but the author of ""Player Piano"" and ""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,"" one enjoyed. And nothing in literature lasts that is not enjoyed. Not that Mr. Vonnegut's work was exactly cheering: with all its freewheeling manner, if involved readers in a conspiracy of doom that was perversely calming--what's left to be done after the funeral?

""The Goat's Horn"" is a Bulgarian film, made two years ago in black and white with English subtitles by Methodi Andonov, one of those increasingly rare film makers, capable of telling a story by pictures alone. ""The Goat's Horn"" is an eloquent film with little dialogue. Set in 17th-century Bulgaria, it begins with the rape of a young mother by a band of Turks as her little daughter watches in horror.Determined to spare his child her mother's fate, her father, a burly goatherd, takes her to live high in the hills. Telling her there is no place for woman in their world, he shears her hair and raises her as a manskilled in the deadly uses of the staff, the dagger, the blunderbuss. Together, they extract vengeance from the Turks. And then, into her unchanging life, comes a young shepherd and a love that shatters everything.The performances, especially by Katia Paskaleva as the girl and by Anton Gortchev as her unsparing father, are brilliantly expressive.",1974-08-23T05:00:00+0000

They bought it, and the cost of transforming it into a charming cottage was less than $10,000. How did they do it? By tackling every inch of the work themselves. The decrepit little house in Sag Harbor, L. I., was only 22 feet wide and 50 long, and it contained a warren of tiny rooms with every wall papered in a different pattern and every floor buried under layers of linoleum. The roof leaked, the plumbing was archaic and the wiring dangerous. There were doors everywhere, five in the bedroom alone, Mrs. Fink said. Every time Lou walked out of the house, he had a door under his arm. Wherever possible, they removed walls as well as doors. Taking down the wall between the living and dining rooms created a spacious openplan living area. A new eatin kitchen, a small study and bath complete the ground floor. Two bedrooms and a second bathroom are upstairs. Builders claimed that a steel beam would have to be installed to shore up the second story when the livingroom wall was removed, but Mr. Fink devised a postandbeam method to hold it up at a fraction of the cost. Their ingenuity extended to the furnishings. A builtin banquette in the living room uses the space more efficiently than a sofa. A wallhung cabinet provides storage and also serves as a buffet. Mr. Fink built and installed the kitchen cabinets. I'm really a frustrated architect, he says. I loved the challenge of solving the problems.

There is little in this biography, which concentrates on the years of the Nixon Administration, to challenge his assessment. Kissinger, by two noted C.B.S. correspondents, is the most detailed study yet of American diplomacy in the post coldwar era: it is worshipful, gravely flawed and indispensable.

Fortunately, even if the House action is sustained, seatbelts will still continue to be mandatory equipment.

Nixon appointed Ford Vice President, although he knew that this would make his own impeachment more likely, while Ford did everything possible to defend Nixon.

us,Screen: 'The Saphead':Buster Keaton Shines in 1920 Feature The Cast,"Waiting for someone who will never come: it makes an easy poignancy on screena solitary, expectant figure who grows mutely more forlorn can milk almost any spectator's fears of rejection. The image recalls Charlie Chaplin in ""The Gold Rush"" (1925), as he waits for the girl who won't be coming to dinner. The Chaplin scene is sheer pathos. But Buster Keaton in the same situation is far funnier, thanks to the kind of mistake that's so easy to make: the beloved's train arrives at Grand Central, while he stands with his armful of flowers at Penn Station. It's one of the passages worth cherishing in ""The Saphead,"" which is playing today to Saturday at the Elgin Cinema.The movie was made in 1920, anddue to a snarl of legal problems  it hasn't been shown for almost 50 years. It was Keaton's first feature-length film, and was adapted from a Broadway-play of 1913 that was based on a play of 1887. The print is marvelously clear.""The Saphead"" is a fairly straight melodrama that drags occasionally, but there are some choice glimpses of Keaton. He plays a rich young drone who's convinced that the woman he loves will spurn him unless he's a wild sport. He studies a manual on ""How to Win the Modern Girl,"" which advises that women prefer daredevils. Striving for decadence in his oriental morning costume, trying and failing to get arrested in a gambling palace, lighting a huge cigar that he can't manage, he makes a most unlikely rake. Now and then, he seems like a forebear of Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate.""Even though Keaton was only 25 years old when ""The Saphead"" was made, his genius for impassivity was already flourishingthere's no response when the love-object embraces him, not even when she has twins. The sublime somersaults and the stoicism enhance a hazing scene where men knock one another's hats off on the floor of the Stock Exchangea refreshing view of that institution.The theme of Keaton's role is solitude  of being alone when someone else should be with him. When his marriage is briefly foiled, he's doused with rice though he's still brideless, and the grains remain on his hair and shoulders as he sits down to eat his wedding feast alone. But where others might have played for pity, Keaton maintains what James Agee called his ""mulish imperturbability.""Also on the program are two fine shorts: ""Convict 13"" (1920) and ""The Bellboy"" (directed by Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle in 1918). The latter evokes a world of disasters where elevator cables snap, cars and trolleys run through buildings, and a bystander can be hurled into the air and find himself seated on a giant stuffed moosehead upon a hotel wall.",1974-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The movie, which is more concerned with the right to fight, opened yesterday at the Penthouse and RKO 86th Street Twin I theaters.Entangled in a plot of staggering complexity, three women ""subversives""including an American dropout from the Social Registerwage the revolution on a nameless leafy island. The inhabitants of this mango republic appear to be the result of an awesome genetic break-through: some seem Oriental, some Latin-American, and others suggest Arabs. Reeling in pursuit of a million dollars that no one wants to share is John Ashley, the co-producer as well as a member of the movie cast. His voice rises frequently to a squawk, and that desperate note sounds like an anticipation of the rushes.Jail is the place for sexual games, and no woman can wield a rifle unless her shirt's unbuttoned. But the movie's just too silly to be offensive. If forgiveness is the national mood of August, 1974, we might as well extend some to ""Savage Sisters.""",1974-08-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Action and Mockery In '99 and 44/100% Dead',"A lot of talent has gone into making ""99 and 44/100% Dead"" the sort of movie that wants to have its cake and eat it, too.The film, playing on Broadway at the Victoria and at other theaters in and around the city, is directed by John Frankenheimer, boasts a sardonic score by Henry Mancini and has a cast headed by Richard Harris, Edmond O'Brien, Bradford Dillman and Chuck Connors.On one level it is a shoot-'em-up of comic-strip proportions. Mr. Harris as the granite-visaged Harry Crown and Mr. Connors as Marvin (The Claw) Zuckerman, equipped with an artificial left arm fitted with a hilarious array of implements, play the professional killers who are the champions in a gang war between Mr. O'Brien (Uncle Frank) and Mr. Dillman (Big Eddie).On this level ""99"" overflows with corpses in cement pedestals, black-suited, black-hatted henchmen, ambushes, gunplay and wholesale killing, chases and the plentiful trashing of expensive cars, to say almost nothing of the presence of a copious supply of beautiful women, who make handy sex objects and hostages.On another level, ""99"" mocks the whole genre, and some of the touches are superb. Marvin's artificial arm, with its shiny scissors, its whip, its feather duster; an excursion through a sewer where those legendary alligators flushed down toilets have grown to full length; an underwater gardens of corpses; a final shoot-out in a laundry, where all the workers go about their business as though nothing extraordinary were happening.Moviegoers who insist on utter fealty to the demands of the shoot-'em-up are going to be disturbed by the strong undercurrent of irreverence. Those who find the shoot-'em-up immoral in the first place won't be satisfied by the injection of humor as an antidote.It may not be dumb enough to be the flawless action movie and it may not be sharp enough to be a sparkling spoof, but in a summer when so much witless trash is being dumped on the movie market, ""99"" merits praise for its ambitiousness more than derision for its shortcomings.",1974-08-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Marketa Lazarova' Opens:Czech Production Is a Medieval Hodgepodge The Cast Savage Koslik Clan Is Noted for Brutality,"Ever wonder who is responsible for the sorry state of the world? Well, the answer is: the Kosliks.At least, that is, according to ""Marketa Lazarova,"" a Czechoslovak film of epic grasp and butter fingers playing today and tomorrow at noon and midnight at the First Avenue Screening Room.""Marketa Lazarova"" is a colossaland very nearly interminablehodgepodge of medieval mayhem and myth, leaden symbolism and bloated piety directed by Frantisek Vlacil and photographed by Bedrich Batka as though they had taken vows to supersede the dictionary as the ultimate source of definition for the word ""excess.""As for the Kosliks, and the pageant of brutish half-wits who people their retinue, they are a 13th-century Bohemian clan of such unmitigated savagery that next to them the Visigoths would resemble a Red Cross mercy mission.For a Koslik, nothing is too bad. Robbery, murder, kidnapping, rape and incest are to the list of Koslik baseness what two handkerchiefs, a couple of undershirts and a pair of socks are to a Sears, Roebuck catalogue.The business of ""Marketa Lazarova"" originates from the kidnapping of a young German traveler named Christian, who is destined to become a bishopif the Kosliks do not gut him first. This leads in turn to the kidnapping and rape of the daughter of the Kosliks' smarmy neighbor, Lazar. The daughter, Marketa, as pious as she is beauteous, is headed for the nun's life, until carried off and ravished by one of the Koslik boys, Nikolas, while Christian yields up his virtue to one of the Koslik girls, Alexandra.All this ruttishness to the neglect of fouler deeds so enrages old man Koslik that he forces its addicts to sleep chained on the ground outside his redoubt during the melty season.The melty season is one of the two seasons during which the action of ""Marketa Lazarova"" takes place. The other season is the snowy season, and sometimes the seasons change every five minutes.During the snowy season the camera never misses a chance to show stark figures against the white landscape or the shadow of a horse against the snow. During the melty season, the sun slants through bare branches onto the forest floor. Sometimes it snows during the melty season, mainly when snow will look good on someone's face or hair.During both seasons, the camera likes to peep at everyone through slats or closing doors, and occasionally it wanders down a corridor in search of a good-looking shadow. Sometimes it goes looking for a symbol. Snakes, hawks and stags are favorites.Busy though it is, the camera finds time for other things. The High Sheriff mounts a campaign against the Kosliks; nuns sing; a holy man wanders over the landscape accompanied by a lamb until the lamb encounters the Kosliks and is served for dinner. The holy man then acquires a goat, which wanders off while he is attempting to induce Marketa to wander the world with him.Marketa, by this time, is a pregnant widow, her lover having been skewered while attempting to free old man Koslik from prison. With the old man in attendance, the High Sheriff marries Marketa to Nikolas who thereupon keeps a long overdue date with the local headsman. Christian's love, Alexandra, is also pregnant. Christian is also dead, having been rewarded for searching for Alexandra after her father's capture by having her dash his brains out with a handy rock.A postscript to all this tells us that the children of Marketa and Alexandra were boys, and in them  and in the generations of mankind that followed themwere mixed both love and cruelty.""Marketa Lazarova"" is a lesson to us all.",1974-08-30T05:00:00+0000
