us,Film Festival: Truffaut Comedy:'The Man Who Loved Women' Full of Double-Edged Wit,"Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner) is a bachelor in his early 40's. He lives in Monpellier in southern France, where he makes a decent if not great living in a testing laboratory. Bertrand is polite, intelligent and sensitive, but mostly he is obsessed by women. Pretty ones, beautiful ones, plain ones, old ones, young ones. There are also one he never sees (the voice of the telephone operator who awakens him in the morning) and one he hasn't seen for many yearshis mother.When Bertrand dies, which is the way Francois Truffaut begins his lighthearted, wise new comedy, ""The Man Who Loved Women,"" the mourners who push through the winter chill to the cemetery are, without exception, women. Though Bertrand was obsessed by women and though he might have felt guilty about using them at times, it is not an untypical Truffaut reversal that Bertrand was as much used by them, not meanly but, after all, a man who loves women with such persistence (which is not to be confused with fidelity) is rare these days, worthy of having attention paid.""The Man Who Loved Women"" will be shown at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center tonight at 9 and Monday evening at 6:15. It will go into regular theatrical release here later this month.In this new film, Mr. Truffaut's 16th feature since ""The 400 Blows"" in 1959, the director is working in a vein usually thought to be frivolous to examine the serious, primary game that men and women play, an ancient pastime whose rules are changing, as one of his characters notes. I suppose there's always been a little of the late Ernest Lubitsch in all Truffaut comedies, though I wouldn't want to have to prove it, but there is more than I've ever seen before in ""The Man Who Loved Women.""It's full of the double-edged wit of the self-aware. Although it's a comedy about the sexes, it's less sexist; essentially, than Agnes Varda's liberation ode,"" ""One Sings, the Other Doesn't."" I don't mean to impose a heavier burden on ""The Man Who Loved Women"" than it can carry, but the Truffaut comedy, in the way it appreciates women in their infinite variety and understands what they're up against, is infinitely more liberated than most liberated films, which reduce women to abstract concepts.Enough of that sort of talk, though.The movie is a supremely humane, sophisticated comedy that is as much fun to watch for the variations Mr. Truffaut works on classic man-woman routines as for the routines themselves. The narrative line is so gossamer-thin it barely sustains the sentence that describes it: Bertrand, in his memoirs completed shortly before he's killed in an accident, remembers all the women he's loved, and a number he hasn't, trying in this fashion to understand why he has never been able to settle down.There are, among others, Nicole, the theater usher who first caught his attention by the seductive noise of one silk-stockinged leg crossing the other; Helene, a woman of his age who turns him down because she's only attracted to young men; Liliane, the head-strong waitress with whom he never slept and who, he says, is his ""evidence that a man and a woman can be just friends.""Most hilariously there is Delphine (Nelly Borgeaud), a married woman whose deepest passions are unlocked by the unsuspecting Bertrand and who has a way of maneuvering him into situations in which they are threatened with public exposure. ""Oh,"" says the overheated Delphine, tearing off her clothes in the car, ""the things you make me do!""There is also  in the film's most marvelous, most surprising sequence  an encounter with Vera, beautifully played by Leslie Caron, a woman with whom he had an extended affair some years before. It's a scene that lasts no more than four or five minutes, but it's so remarkably well played and written that an entire love affair, from the beginning to the middle and the end, is movingly evoked through what is really just exposition.The film's style is so economical it seems almost terse. The flashback to Bertrand's childhood, in which the boy was made the go-between for his mother in her affairs, suggests the young Antoine of ""The 400 Blows,"" while Bertrand's funny, sweet encounter with a little girl he finds crying on a stairway recalls the Antoine of ""Love at Twenty."" Bertrand asks the little girl why she's crying and finally gets her to concede that there is a certain amount of pleasure in being so unhappy, which makes her brighten immediately.Brigitte Fossey plays Bertrand's literary editor, the one person, you feel, who might have straightened him out if she had taken him as seriously as he had begun to take her. Perhaps not. The film is open-ended on this.Charles Denner is very, very funny, as Bertrand, a fellow who has the same single-minded purpose as the rat-exterminiator he played in ""Such a Gorgeous Kid Like Me,"" as well as the delicacy of touch of Antoine Doinel on his best behavior.It's not the Truffaut way to make movies that contain flat statements. Like almost every film he's ever done, ""The Man Who Loved Women"" considers some of the aspects and manifestations of love and then shakes its headin a mixture of wonder, delight and sadness.",1977-10-01T05:00:00+0000

The boy was convicted and sentenced to prison for nine years, seven months and 10 days. Mr. Pasolini, said Michelangelo Antonioni, ""was the victim of his own characters.""If Mr. Pasolini really was the victim of his own characters, then his most significant film must be his last, ""Salo, 120 Days of Sodom,"" Mr. Pasolini's transposition of the Marquis de Sade's 18th-century novel to Italy (1944), and the puppet government set up at Salo in northern Italy when Mussolini was briefly free after his rescue by the Nazis from Italian partisans.Mr. Pasolini, a poet and novelist as well as a film maker, an ardent Marxist who early on had been thrown out of the Communist Party for his homosexuality, made controversial films throughout his career, but none to equal ""Salo,"" which was completed shortly before his death.De Sade's novel has the small distinction of being the only novel I couldn't bring myself to finish reading. Indeed, de Sade himself hardly finished writing itthe last half being no more than a plan for the humiliations and tortures he wished to describe in greater detail when he had the time, which he never had.De Sade saw his work, about the epic 120-day debauch of four pillars of French society, as a revolutionary act, designed to bring down the old order so that a new one might be established. As he described the debauch, though, he also indulged his own fantasies that passed through more or less commonplace sexual perversions to coprophilia, necrophilia and explicit torture of the young women and young men who had been kidnapped to share the hosts' pleasures.Mr. Pasolini has made a very significant change in updating this work, however. The four hoststhe duke, the president, the magistrate and the bishopare now Fascists, expressing their ultimate desires as the world is crumbling around them in the last days of the fascist regime. They are no longer rebelling against God. They are demonstrating the evil of the human spirit, which is something else entirely, though I can't help but feel that de Sade and Mr. Pasolini share a peculiar delight in speculating about the specific details of this evil.For all of Mr. Pasolini's desire to make ""Salo"" an abstract statement, one cannot look at images of people being scalped, whipped, gouged, slashed, covered with excrement and sometimes eating it and react abstractedly unless one shares the director's obsessions.Far from being the ""agonized scream of total despair"" the New York Film Festival calls the film, it is a demonstration of nearly absolute impotency, if there is such a thing. Ideas get lost in a spectacle of such immediate reality and cruelty.""Salo"" will be shown at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center today at 1 P.M. and repeated there tomorrow evening at 6. It opens its regular commercial engagement Monday at the Festival Theater.""Salo"" is, I think, a perfect example of the kind of material that, theoretically, anyway, can be acceptable on paper but becomes so repugnant when visualized on the screen that it further dehumanizes the human spirit, which is supposed to be the artist's concern. When one reads, one exercises all kinds of intellectual processes that are absent when one looks at pictures. An image frequently says less than a thousand words. It's of especially limited use when dealing with the kind of ideas that Mr. Pasolini was playing with here.The new film has no conventional story, being an allegory composed of tableaux in which we see the four hosts making their compact, their victims being rounded up and inspected, and finally the revels themselves. These begin with some simulated sex and move on to the series of parties in which the hosts carry coprophilia as far as it can go, and then begin their elaborate, tortures, In between, a lot of high-toned talk about how the domination of one person by another is a metaphor for the capitalist's treatment of the working man, and how murder is the logical extension of such power.The words are not nonsensical, but they are feeble in conjunction with the ferocity and explicitness of the images. The film is not without style in its settingslots of Mussolini-era dcoror in several of its performances, including that of Caterina Boratto, who plays one of the madams who attempt to arouse the four hosts by telling them lewd stories with a piano accompaniment. Yet it all finally seems thin and superficial.Throughout his career as a film maker, Mr. Pasolini was very good at intellectualizing. after the fact, what he was doing on the screen. His best films""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"" and ""Accatone""can stand alone. His later films, even the rambunctious ""fable films"" (""Decameron"" and ""A Thousand and One Nights"") require a certain amount of rationalizing to be acceptable.As Mr. Pasolini's vision of the world became increasingly bleak, his films became more arid. ""Salo"" is the bitter, empty end.",1977-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"One by Werner Herzog Soars, but 2d Doesn't","""La Sourfrire"" is only 30 minutes long, but it is one of Werner Herzog's most exquisite efforts, a perfect distillation of his talents. Made in 1976, the film is a serene, strangely clear-headed documentary about the end of the world.""La Sourfrire"" is the name of a volcano on Guadeloupe that threatened to erupt about a year ago; Mr. Herzog learned of the near-catastrophe only by chance, spotting a newspaper item about a native man who refused to leave the area after everyone else had been evacuated.Thirty-six hours later, Mr. Herzog and two cameramen had arrived in the town of Basse-Terre, at the foot of a mountain that had begun to spew forth white clouds of sulfurous steam.Mr. Herzog's narration deliberately skirts the question of whether he and his crew were afraid, but the implication is that they have passed beyond fear into a state of purely objective curiosity. When one of the cameramen lost his glasses, said Mr. Herzog, ""we decided to pick them up the next day, if the mountain still existed by then.""The town is deserted, ""just a few doors banging in the wind and water dripping."" The sea is full of drowned snakes, which have been driven out of the mountains where they normally dwell. A shot of a civic monument becomes wonderfully ironic, because the town is now a monument in its own right. The police station, like everything else, is silent and deserted: ""It was great not to have the law hanging around."" Even the scientists have fled. Mr. Herzog had every reason to expect, as he says, that these pictures of the town were the last ones that would ever be taken.The crew finds the peasant man, who is lying on the ground, waiting peacefully; turning his palms upward, he shows them the position in which he plans to die. He talks confidently about God's will, and explains that he has no fear. At Mr. Herzog's prompting, he sings a love song.The film includes an extraordinary anecdote, about a city on the neighboring island of Martinique that was destroyed in a volcanic eruption in 1902. There was no lava, only a burst of flame""the whole thing can only have taken seconds,"" Mr. Herzog explains, showing a photograph of vultures circling the next day. There was only one survivor in a population of 32,000, and he was the town's most evil man, a convict who had been put in solitary confinement underground. He eventually became a sideshow attraction in an American circus.La Soufrire never erupted even though the warning signs were definite enough almost to guarantee that it would. Mr. Herzog is doubtless glad to have survived, but the film reflects only his disappointment. ""It all ended up a dead loss and a laughing stock,"" he said, almost angrily.""La Sourfrire,"" one of the foremost attractions of the New York Film Festival (it will be shown tonight at 6 o'clock and Monday evening at 9:30), is on a bill with ""Heart of Glass,"" a feature by Mr. Herzog that is far less successful. Mr. Herzog hypnotized his entire cast to film a parable about a medieval town that has thrived by producing ruby-colored glass, until the only man who knows the formula dies. After that, the town goes mad trying to recapture its lost glory.In its own way, ""Heart of Glass"" is as much about the end of the world as is ""La Soufrire,"" but the longer film is much less accessible, and often obscure. The actors' trance is contagious, and the film has some genuinely mesmerizing moments, as when the town seer, whose words have made little sense, suddenly begins to predict an alarmingly familiar future in which ""no man will like another man."" Mr. Herzog seems not to be working with real actors, but rather with apparitions.At times, the script reads like a collection of nonsequiturs. Do you want our people to eat oatmeal bread again, that gives them headaches?"" asks one character. ""Rats will bite your earlobes,"" someone swears. Even the film's meticulousnessevery trace of red anywhere, even on a goose's head, is clearly plannedis not entirely decipherable.The elusiveness of ""Heart of Glass"" makes it something of a disappointment. But it is too mysteriously lovely to be regarded as a failure.",1977-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Look at Pele, he's getting out of soccer now while people remember the best. He came over to see me at my hotel. He invited me to his game. He got to me. I was going to get to him, but he got me first. But he's right. It's important for the people to remember the best. The world's two most famous athletes had never met until the 36yearold soccer player visited the 35yearold heavyweight champion. And if there is anything that might convince Muhammad Ali to retire, at least until he makes a comeback sooner or later, it might be watching the celebration of Pele's departure. The difference is that PeI6, organized and wealthy, can afford to retire, while Muhammad Ali, disorganized and a man who will always need another big payday, really can't afford to retire despite having earned more than $40 million in the ring. Ali isn't broke. He won't wind up like Joe Louis did. But the way he lives, he'll always need big money.

The setting the film, though, is confined entirely to a modern workingclass apartment block of terrifying drabness.

She slops the coffee remains from several cups into one, sits at the littered table and sips the coffee while surveying the incredible kitchen mess. She doesn't anticipate the morning's chores with any pleasure, but she still can enjoy the momentary peace. Suddenly this peace is broken by the cry of the family's pet mynah bird who, though it can talk, always gets her name wrong.

It's as if they'd been put under a spell by the music of the old-time swing band, whose anonymous players, their faces as expresionless as death-masks, pump and blow and beat away night-after-night-after-night, plus two afternoons a week.""Roseland"" is a stunt that comes offthree interlocking stories, set almost entirely within New York's famous Roseland Ballroom, about essentially lonely people who live their lives (and sometimes end them) to nonstop Waltzes, fox-trots and occasional hustles. Considering that most of the earlier efforts of the Ivory-Jhablava-Merchant team (""Shakespere Wallah,"" ""The Guru"" and ""Bombay Talkie,"" among others) have been set in India, the success of ""Roseland"" is all the more dramatic.The film will be shown at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center tonight at 9 o'clock and Tuesday evening at 6:15. It will open its regular commercial engagement at the Columbia 1 Theater Oct. 16.Most remarkable to me is Mrs. Jhablava's ear for New York speech, such as the genteel mannerisms affected by someone like May (Teresa Wright) a middle-aged widow who bores everyone with stories about her late husband, Ed. (""He wouldn't wear anything with a spot on it . . . he always had to be spotless.""But Mrs. Jhablava is equally good with the dialogue of the elderly, heavily made-up former cook, Rosa (Lilia Skala), who wants only to win ""the Champagne Hour"" dance contest, and the desperate, self-deprecating lines of Pauline (Joan Copeland), a rich, uncertain woman who fusses over her gigolo and says, after making the smallest, most timid demand of him, ""Oh, darling Russel, I'm spoiling your whole day!""The ear is accurate, but the effect of the film is less real than surreal, less slice-of-life than so romantic that Mr. Ivory makes us accept, in the concluding episode, an explosion of outrageously overblown sentiment.The film's enclosed settingthe dance hall, its bar, lobby and rest roomsas well as the dominating vulgarity of its dcor and the music contribute to an eerie, confined ""Outward Bound"" atmosphere that's maintained even when Mr. Ivory allows the camera to go outside on a couple of occasions.The performers have a ball with the kind of roles that allow them to get on and off the screen fast, thus to leave vivid impressions. Among the best are Miss Wright, Miss Copeland and Miss Skala, who more or less star in their own vignettes. There are also Helen Gallagher, the Roseland dance teacher whose commentary provides continuity; Lou Jacobi, as Miss Wright's no-nonsense suitor; Christopher Walken (in his best screen role to date) as Miss Colepland's gigolo; Geraldine Chaplin, as a divorcee who spends some time briefly at the dance hall before fleeing with her sanity, and David Thomas, who is especially fine as Miss Skala's aging suitor, an old man who simply can't remember to smile while counting out the dancesteps.Don De Natale, Roseland's real-life master-of-ceremonies, a young man with a patent-leather look and the kind of patter that Pal Joey would have admired, hovers over the show, so persistently cheerful that, finally, he becomes macabre, which is, I suspect, exactly what Mr. Ivory intended.",1977-10-02T05:00:00+0000

As it turns out, the backandforths through which the biographer invents his author and the author his biographer stir the mind and agitate the emotions as unexpectedly as do the ins and outs through which nature and art invent each other in Nabokovthrough which, for example, the critic Kinbote and the poet John Shade invent each other in Pale Fire. Millhauser's demonstration that the preadolescent imagination is a lost genius within us all provides the Nabokovian note of pathos. That the author's name is so close to his character's (Millhauser/Mullhouse) adds reflections for us to reflect upon.

us,A Generous Sampling,"RARAPHRASING an observation of Proust's, Rebecca West writes in the prologue to Black Lamb and Grey Falcon about the tendency of a banal action to become wonderful if it is performed long enough: a simple walk down hundred yards of village street is wonderful if it made every Sunday by an old lady of eighty. So is with many writers who go on performing after fashion into old age. Too often, a celebration the sort represented by this volume is a patronizing tribute to longevity rather than to the sustained high quality of an author's work. Fortunately, it is impossible to condescend in this way to Rebecca West, who was born in 1892. Whatever the weaknesses of her writing (and there are a number, along with great strengths), banality has never been among them. Nor is there the slightest sign of any diminution of her intellectual and artistic vitality. The hitherto unpublished excerpt included in A Celebration from her novel in progress, This Real Night, seems to me more supple, more intimately at ease with its characters and situation than any of her previous fiction. I shall not be surprised if the completed novel turns out to be her best, surpassing The Fountain Overflows (1956), to which it is a sequel, and The Birds Fall Down (1966), written when she was already in her 70's.",1977-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,'Julia' Tries to Define Friendship:Jane Fonda Stars With Vanessa Redgrave,"Friendship is the most difficult of all relationships to define in films that are not caper movies or adventure melodramas, in which action is the emotion, or in romances that lead to sexual fulfillment. Friendship is profound and mysterious. It defies close examination. In a movie, friendship is anticlimactic.This is the principal difficulty that faced Fred Zinnemann, the director, and Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay, when they came to adapt ""Julia,"" one of the stories from Lillian Hellman's best-selling memoir, ""Pentimento.""""Julia"" is Miss Hellman's moving recollection of her childhood friend who was a rebel in the nursery, an angry recorder (with her Brownie) of the peasant's unfortunate lot when she toured Egypt as an adolescent, and a full-fledged anti-Fascist by the time she was a young woman studying medicine in Vienna when Hitler came to power.""Pentimento"" moves back and forth in time and place as we do in good conversation, without self-consciousness, the main thread (and the real urgency) being the need to get some grip on feeling and, possibly, the truth.Removed from this frame, the story of Julia, a rich young woman with a heedless, title-marrying mother and venal grandparents, becomes an illusive narrative fragment in desperate need of further amplification. Mr. Sargent and Mr. Zinneman have amplified the story with solemn care, in good taste (which is not always desirable), and have come forth with a film that is both well-meaning and on the side of the angels but with the exception of a half-dozen scenes, lifeless.""Julia,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1, tells us both too much and not enough. It opens with the mature Lillian Hellman, played by Jane Fonda, her back to the camera, recollecting her friendship with Julia as a little girl, alternating with later recollections of them both before Julia went off to study at Oxford and then Vienna. When Vanessa Redgrave plays the grown-up Julia to Miss Fonda's grown-up Lillian, in their comparatively few scenes together, the movie begins to build some emotional momentum.But this more or less contemporary story, which has to do with Lillian's attempts to help Julia, the freedom fighter in the late 1930's (and particularly in a good cloak-and-dagger bit when Lillian smuggles $50,000 to Julia in Hitler's Berlin), is constantly interrupted by further flashbacks meant to demonstrate the relationship of the two girls.Only one film maker I know of (Carlos Saura in his recent ""Cousin Angelica"") has successfully managed to suggest on film the complex bundle of associations that an adult brings to the memories of childhood. Mr. Saura's way was to have the adult actor play those scenes as if he had wandered into a place where everyone else had been frozen in time. The middle-aged Saura character thus played scenes with parents younger than he was.This isn't the only way to handle such a problem, but almost anything might be better than the conventionally styled, soft-focus flashbacks that Mr. Zinnemann and Mr. Sargent employ with child actors who look and behave like numbingly literate, talking dolls, always ready to say or do something that has an immediate, weighty relevance to the present. This sort of thing hasn't much to do with good moviemaking and less to do with childhood.To flesh out the story further, Mr. Sargent has included some sequences dramatizing Miss Hellman's long, tumultuous, sometimes agonizing relationship with Dashiell Hammett, who was her lover, friend and most severe critic. With Jason Robards as Hammett, these scenes are so good and occasionally so tough that one wishes the film were about Hellman and Hammett rather than Lillian and Julia, the meaning of whose friendship mostly escapes the movie.There is a single exception, the meeting between Lillian and Julia in Hitler's Berlin, just after Lillian has successfully brought the $50,000 through Nazi customs to deliver to the now-crippled but still valiant Julia. Miss Fonda and Miss Redgrave are marvelous and true, and even the small echoes of English speech cadences one hears in Miss Fonda's voice are moving, as if she were in some fashion bowing to her English co-star (though Miss Redgrave's Julia is supposed to be an American).There are two other memorable moments. In one Maximilian Schell, as a courier sent by Julia to reach Lillian in Paris, seems actually to have reduced himself in size to play a man of physical frailty and immense courage. The other scene, in which Lillian is having dinner with Sammy (John Glover), a gross, drunken friend from her childhood, does more to suggest the social, economic and emotional backgrounds of Lillian and Julia than all of the flashbacks combined. In addition it's very funny.This may be hair-splitting but I also found the very elegance of the physical productionincluding the well-upholstered period sets and costumes and automobilesto be at war with the film's subject. The movie looks soft, which has nothing to do with the Hellman flintiness, guts, self-mockery, wisdom, above all, impatience with cant. As Julia might have said, ""Something else is needed.""""Julia,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some violence but young children will probably fall to sleep long before anything untoward is shown on the screen.",1977-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,'Hot Tomorrows' Is Grim Film,"The best thing about ""Hot Tomorrows"" is its title, which is so full of promise and urgency but has precious little bearing upon the film at hand. Martin Brest's first feature, which he wrote, produced and directed on a minuscule budget, is a 72-minute black-and-white portrait of a young man who is so artily obsessed with death that he decorates his room with a life-size Grim Reaper.Michael (Ken Lerner), the young man, is not quite as ghoulish as this might lead one to imagine, and so he has friends. His closest buddy, a Bronx alumnus named Louis (Ray Sharkey), joins him for a night-long adventure in Hollywood one Christmas Eve. The two of them travel to the Paradise Ballroom, which is deserted except for a few carefully chosen oddballs, and then they head for a mortuary, where Michael encounters his first corpse. At the club, an eerie-looking combo in heavymakeup is playing ""St. James infirmary,"" and en route to the mortuary Michael and Louis hear traffic-fatality predictions on the radio. Nothing in ""Hot Tomorrows"" happens without its being more than adequately preordained.After Michael finally experiences the close brush with death toward which the film has been ponderously building, he wanders around dumbstruck, finally arriving at a nursing home, where the sight of a group of elderly women only amplifies his grief and arouses his horror. Michael seems an extraordinarily humorless and self-absorbed soul, and Mr. Brest's direction all too effectively echoes his character's insensitivity.Incidentally, Michael is a writer (""Right now, I'm working on a couple of short stories about my great-aunt and her encounters with death"") and a movie buff; one thing that interests him about film is that it offers the opportunity to watch people, like Laurel and Hardy, who are actually dead. ""Hot Tomorrows"" concludes, in a flash of unexpected originality, with a Bushy Berkeley-styled musical number in which the deceased are reunited with the living.On the same bill at the New York Film Festival, is ""My Grandmother,"" a 1929 Russian film that has only recently been recirculated. The title is a colloquial reference to patronage, and the film is about the foibles of various one-dimensional bureaucrats, including a corrupt, hook-nosed production manager who is dismissed and tries to regain his job through favoritism. A Lenin-like party representative, photographed from the ground up so that he looks 10 feet tall, reprimands this bourgeois nogoodnik at the film's end.""My Grandmother"" is most interesting as a compendium of every type of trick photography that could be executed at the time it was made, and for the startling.",1977-10-04T05:00:00+0000

Still, one has to wonder upon taking up Robert Frost: The Work of Knowing: What do Robert Frost and the Beatles have in common that would prompt Mr. Poirier to include them in the focus of his interest?",1977-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 2 'Women' With Same Sorrow,"WHEN her mother dies at the beginning of Marta Meszaros's reflective quietly intelligent ""Women,"" Mari (Marina Vlady) is pained but she barely cries. Man is a big, beautiful, fortyish woman with an air of unnatural serenity and almost no lines on her face, and the film has little interest in explaining how she came to be that way. Instead, it wakes up along with her, in an empathetic and purposefully somnolent style, as Mari's friendship with a younger and less patient woman helps her to realize how much of her life has parsed her by.The important thing about the friendship, as it is presented here, is its galvanizing effect. Juli (Lili Monori) is a high-strung young mother who has left her husband and moved into the workers' hotel managed by Mari, and something about Juli's presence makes the older woman begin to wonder about her own 20-year marriage. Mari's husband is a dull and thoughtless sort""Now you'll believe me when I say you're far from old,"" he observes, when his wife confesses she has been kissing another man.Juli's husband is a handsome young alcoholic, and their affair is still, after several years, too hot to handle. Though their situations may seem opposite, the two wives turn out to have more in common than they at first realize. Whatever their reasons they both assume the same tearful, terribly resigned stare when they make love.""Women"" is set in clean, antiseptically modern places that have a frustrating effect rather then a revealing one; the film deliberately stays within the boundaries of its characters' imaginations, articulating their malaise rather than explaining it Miss Mszros's direction is correspondingly stern: The film looks so beautiful, and yet so barren, that the women's deprivation becomes palpable after a while. The characters, settings and script are beautifully integrated, working together to demonstrate that sometimes numbness is the worst kind of pain.Miss Mszros's approach has certain limitations, particularly when it comes to the husbands. Janos (Jan Nowicki), married to Juli, is as clearly drawn as she, but Mari's husband Feri (Miklos Tolnay) is one of those soulless male ciphers who can give women's films or fiction a partisan air.""Women"" doesn't have a happy ending; it hardly has an ending at all, just a hint of what the future will be. Both women take a few tentative steps away from their mates, but the breaks are not decisive. Still. Juli is unwilling to visit her husband in an alcoholics' clinic, so Marl goes instead, taking Juli's little daughter. Afterwards, Mari assures Juli that everything is fine. ""It isn't,"" cries the little girl, startlingly. ""You all tell lies."" ",1977-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Beatrice doesn't have any passions of her own. She's not coldshe's undiscovered, to herself as well as to others. She's also very pretty in an idealized way, having the sort of looks that are so undefined they accept any interpretation. In an earlier era, she woud have been a D. W. Griffith heroine.In ""the Lacemaker,"" Mr. Goretta's third film (after ""The Invitation"" and ""That Wonderful Crook"") to be seen in this country, the Swiss director has made a rather solemnly beautiful film to expose the dark side of what is, essentially, a silly, romantic notion.""The Lacemaker"" will be shown at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center at 9:30 and tomorrow evening at 6:15. It will begin its regular commercial engagement at the Fine Arts Theater Saturday.The film is the story of Beatrice's inevitably unhappy affair with Franois (Yves Beneyton), a tall, lanky, decentmannered university student who wins Beatrice's maidenhead and subsequently comes to realize, with a sinking heart, that she only exists for him to be around him, to reflect his love.Beatrice has no ambition, no interest in the world, no identity except as an ideal, an abstraction, someone who says the film's epilogue, a painter would have made the subject of a genre painting, as a seamstress or a water girl or a lacemaker.Beatrice is a blank canvas, which as Mr. Goretta seems to be saying may be fine for painters but leaves something to be desired as the companion of one's life. She seldom talks or expresses any feeling except affection. As Franois says in frustration at one point, ""I don't know what goes on in your mind . . . you never ask questions.""It's not difficult to understand why Franois decides they have to splitliving with her is like living with a sweet-natured mannequina decision she accepts with her usual passivity and that ultimately leads to tragic consequences.Just what Mr. Goretta is up to here I'm not sure. As he has shown in his earlier films, he is a director of delicacy who appreciates the odd variation on conventional behavior, the unexpected wisdom within the banal pronouncement.""The Lacemaker,"" though it is nicely acted and set, is only interesting and moving in a theoretical way. Miss Huppert is all too believable as a figure of idealized innocence who would drive, any ordinary man out of his mind with boredom and then, in a final irony leave him feeling guilty for not having sufficiently appreciated the rare gift that briefly had been his.",1977-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Lincoln Conspiracy',"IT IS the contention of ""The Lincoln Conspiracy,"" which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, that traditional beliefs about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln are wrongthe result of a high level cover-up.True, John Wilkes Booth shot and mortally wounded the President. But the movie, whose makers maintain that their thesis is the product of costly new research, depicts Lincoln as the target of another, concurrent conspiracy.This one involved, among others, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Col. Lafayette C. Baker, the head of what today would be the Secret Service; a Senator and a Representative  all united by opposition to Lincoln's emphasis on post-Civil-War unification and their fear that his reconstruction policy would lead to Democratic domination of Congress.To that end, the movie has it, they decided to remove Lincoln from the scene by kidnapping him. Although Booth was involved in a similar plot, he was regarded as a bungler. Warned off by the Stanton group, he nevertheless ""proceeded to move against the President: and uring his escape, he left behind a diary containing incriminating evidence against some of the Stanton group.It then became necessary for them to insure that Booth never lived to testify. The movie maintains that a man believed to be Booth was killed; and once word that Booth was dead had been flashed to the public, the Stanton plotters had no recourse but to abandon the hunt and to proceed to frame the individuals they had already seized as Booth's co-conspirators.The movie says that Booth was ultimately traced to New York, where his trail vanished.As a movie, ""The Lincoln Conspiracy"" is a competent enough piece of work. Low-key and tending toward ponderous exposition (it employs both a narrator and a noticeable amount of explanatory dialogue), it can boast a cast of tried and true professionals: Bradford Dillman as the determined but inept Booth; John Dehner as Col. Baker, the prime mover in the events depicted; Robert Middleton, beneath a flowing chinpiece, as Stanton; and John Anderson as Lincoln, radiating compassion and homespun dignity under his makeup.The trouble with ""The Lincoln Conspiracy"" is that, as film, it is a one-sided case. Although a documentary sources list is provided at the conclusion. ""The Lincoln Conspiracy"" cannot help but leave anyone seriously interested in the subject wondering about the tangible proofs for the arguments it advances. A book on the subject has been issued in conjunction with the release of the movie, and this may be one case where ten thousand words are worth one picture.",1977-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Vital Nureyev Upstages 'Valentino',"THERE'S ONLY one scene in Ken Russell's ""Valentino"" that is as viscerally offensive as Mr. Russell, at his best and most headstrong, can be. Midway through the movie, Valentino is arrested and forced to spend the night, in a jail cell where the jailer denies him bathroom privileges and the other prisoners maul him and taunt him about his virility.This episode is very much in the mode of Mr. Russell's most overpowering moments those that have simultaneously provoked admiration and outrage, but it has no place in an effort as a typically tame as this one. ""Valentino"" is Mr. Russell's least disturbing movie since ""The Boy Friend"": That should come as a relief to his distractors and as a slight disappointment to those who respect and appreciate his abrasive energy.To a large extent, the film's relative ordinariness is attributable to Valentino's. For all of his glamour, he was a bland figure, more of a star than he was an actor, and Mr. Russell's best films have been about artists, such as Henri Gaudier Brzeska in ""Savage Messiah"" and Tchaikovsky in ""The Music Lovers,"" whose lives were governed by their unruly talent. Valentino's greatest dream was to leave Hollywood and became an orange grower, so there isn't room for the grandiose ambition that animated ""Tommy."" Valentino's sexuality was nil, at least as far as Mr. Russell's interpretation is concerned, so these is no place for the tortured erotic wrangling that amounts to another Russell specialty.The most intriguing thing about Valentino, as he appears here, is his old-world notion of manly honor, but even that poses minor problems. When Oliver Reed, as a besieged priest in Mr. Russell's ""The Devils,"" was subjected to public humiliation, he looked properly humiliated. When Rudolf Nureyev, who plays Valentino with a fierce sense of style, is abused or insulted, he looks magnificent. The screenplay represents Valentino as a fairly meek character but, as played by Mr. Nureyev, he seems positively to thrive upon affronts to his dignity.The best parts of the film are those that pit Valentino against Hollywood, which both he and Mr. Russell seem to see as the biggest affront of them all. Whether he is courting a starlet (Carol Kane) who serves a huge tureen of French fries and ketchup on a silver tray, or dressing up in a Yale sweater and knickers in hopes of being cast as me all-American boy. Valentino is surrounded by (and a party to) the most aggressive kind of vulgarity. The screenplay, by Mr. Russell has no ear far American speech. ""Everyday is Halloween in Tinseltown,"" says one charactertwice.The dialogue is compounded by Mr. Nureyev's uncertain accent (mostly Russian, but he hums a few bars of ""O Sole Mio"" from time to time). Mr. Nureyev has trouble delivering snappy patter with much conviction, and so do the other European members of the cast. Michele Phillips, suitably steely-eyed as Valentino's conniving wife, Natasha Rambova, often sounds even less authentic than these others.But Leslie Caron, as Valentino's benefactor Alla Nazimova (there also seems to be a touch of Pola Negri to the role), copes admirably with the script's strangeness by reading her lines more peculiarly than is necessary, shouting and waving her arm all the while. There are a number of excellent small performances hereCarol Kane's dopey chorine, Felicity Kendall's studio liaison, Seymour Cassel's plain-suited shysterbut Miss Carol's is the most enjoyable outlandish of the lot.And Mr. Nureyev's is, of course, the most graceful. It should certainly come as to no surprise that Mr. Nureyev is incapable of making an uninteresting gesture, whether he is daily sipping a vanilla malted out of a champagne glass or reeling dizzily in a boxing ring. More surprising is Mr. Nureyev's malleability, and the apparent effortlessness with which he adapts himself to fit into the film's varied tableaux. He is at his most stunning as he tangoes in a dimly lit nightclub of the film), and fighting for his life in a noisy, crowded area one wall of which hangs a tattered American flag.These are only two of the better looking sequences in an extremely handsome film, whose look of overripe 20's opulence provides an ironic running commentary upon its characters. Even when Mr. Russell's verbal wit is not up to snuff, his visual jokes are alive and well. As Valentino and Rambova squabble with a studio head (played by Huntz Hall), a ridiculous little western is being filmed in the background. When Valentino attempts to seduce Natasha in his movie-set sheik's tent, the two shed their wraps and then Natasha, as is her wont, begins carping about business matters. But the couple continue to behave so romantically, and so incongruously with their real thoughts, that the scene becomeswell, ravishingly funny.",1977-10-06T05:00:00+0000

As all Anglophiles know, the hotel chambermaid or steward raps gently on your door at a predetermined morning hour and glides in with a tray holding a steaming pot of hot water, fragrant pot of freshly brewed tea, milk or lemon, and sugar. Now the British have arranged it so that you can have early tea (or instant coffee, if you insist) at your own bedside. The magic is accomplished by a device that's been around for decades in England but is new here: the Teasmade. The white plastic box: shaped machine comes with a metal teakettle that sits on an electric element and is activated by a builtin alarm system. You set the alarm for the time you want to be awakened. Twelve minutes before the buzzer goes off, the electricity goes on and the kettle starts to heat. First the steam and then the boiling water is ejected through a narrow spout into a white earthenware teapot that sits alongside it (the cut tea or teabags have already been put in the teapot, of course). By the time the alarm awakens you, the tea is ready. The alarm section of the unit can be used separately, as can the builtin night light. There's also a button you can push to make tea at any time.

The Lord, in the form of George Burns, chooses a Tarzana, Calif., super-market manager (Mr. Denver) to spread the message that ""what we have down here can work."" Mr. Burns, who makes a number of house calls, wears a fishing cap and tennis shoes and says things like ""so help me, me"" when he is sworn in at a concluding trial sequence. Mr. Denver, when he is asked why the Lord chose him as a messenger, says things like ""God only knowsI mean . . ."" Though it isn't much of a contest, Mr. Burns readily emerges as the funnierIn all fairness, neither actor has the kind of part that can be played strictly for laughs. Mr. Denver, who is compared by the screenplay with Moses, Jesus, Einstein and Joan of Arc, asks some decidedly unfunny Big Questions: ""If you're so involved with us, how can you permit all the suffering that goes on in the world?"" Mr. Burns doesn't exactly supply the corresponding Big Answers, but he does provide a modicum of spiritual guidance. ""You have the strength that comes from knowing,"" he tells his protg.Mr. Burns also makes a lot of wisecracks, which aren't entirely compatible with the movie's underlying sanctimoniousness. God doesn't look forward to Doomsday, Mr. Burns says; there will be ""a lot of yelling and screaming, and I don't need that any more than you do.""As directed by Carl Reiner, ""Oh, God!"" is an uneasy amalgam or inconsistent attitudes, without enough humor or zaniness to divert attention from its questionable premise. But Mr. Burns is amusing even when his material is substandard. And Mr. Denver, though he is unable to convey any emotion more complex than enthusiasm, is obviously trying.Mr. Reiner has marshaled an impressive supporting cast, including Ralph Bellamy as a trial lawyer and Teri Garr as Mr. Denver's frazzled wife, who lives with him in a cluttered suburban house where all the domestic debris looks brand new. The religious leaders of the world are played by Barry Sullivan, Donald Pleasence, Jeff Corey and Paul Sorvino, but of these only Mr. Sorvino has been given anything to do. He plays an evangelist in white shoes who boasts of having ""personally . . . been chosen to render the benediction at this year's Super Bowl.""The film's only other dashes of genuine levity come when Mr. Burns scares up a rainstorm inside Mr. Denver's compact car and when Mr. Denver appears on the ""Dinah Shore Show"" and tries with the help of a police artist, to come up with God's portrait.""Oh, God!"" is rated PG ""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because Mr. Burns made a few harmless jokes about Adam and Eve, and because Mr. Denver appears barechested several times.

us,'Piece of the Action' Is on Side of the Angels,"Sidney Poitier has done it again. What he has done again is his hit movie ""To Sir, With Love."" But he has done it with a difference, an obvious social purpose and a new name: ""A Piece of the Action.""This movie, which opened yesterday at the Criterion, 86th Street East and Eastside Cinema theaters is, at heart, a candy-coated training film, four-square in favor of industry, honesty, courtesy, matrimony and culture; dead-set against wasted lives, ignorance, defeatism, sloth, senseless impudence, drugs and organized crime.The candy-coating consists of a caper plot that enmeshes Mr. Poitier and Bill Cosby as a pair of independent, ingenious and hugely successful thieves with angry and vengeful underworld victims and with crooked and manipulative police.Set inside the candy-coating is the training film: ""To Sir, With Love,"" recycled for domestic identification and trans-shipped from a school in a London slum to a black-operated community center in a rundown neighborhood in Chicago.There, Mr. Poitier and Mr. Cosby, each blackmailed by an unknown man who apparently knows enough about their crimes to send them to prison, find themselves reluctant volunteer members of the staff.Mr. Cosby works in the administrative end, where he finds a good deal of amelioration of his plight in the form of Lila French, the center's director, vivaciously portrayed by Denise Nichols. And Mr. Poitier, thanks to a coin flip, finds himself in a familiar classroom.Here are 30 rambunctious young black men and women for whom he and Mr. Cosby must find jobs although they are clearly less than prime candidates for employment.Well, Mr. Poitier has been here before. As star and director, he knows precisely what to do with them, He uses them for little performing tours de forceto frighten and wound with their toughness; to amuse with their street talk, their irreverence, their flippancy; to wrench tears with their vulnerability; and, of course, to bend to his will, absorb his lessons about self-esteem and consideration for others and ultimately to serve as illustrations that adversity can be overcome.When all the didacticism threatens to reduce the pace to that of sludge, Mr. Poitier takes advantage of several options: he can concern himself and Mr. Cosby with unraveling the mystery of their blackmailer (it gives away nothing to reveal him to be James Earl Jones, playing a retired policeman whose late wife founded the community center); he can strike a slightly grudging blow for matrimony by arranging for an unexpected visit from the dismayed, religious parents of the woman he has been living with; he can espouse culture by tossing in a dressy night on the town that takes him, Mr. Cosby and their dates to a performance by the Dance Theater of Harlem; or he can stir up suspense by looking in on the Mafia types who are determined to kill him for robbing them.In short, Mr. Poitier has provided something for just about everyone, including those who might be concerned about the question of all this moralizing coming from a character who is introduced as a criminal.""A Piece of the Action"" is firmly on the side of the angels. It is possible to criticize its lack of originality and its transparent slickness; but these are flaws that must be balanced against its evident craftsmanship, its entertainment and its social conscience.The PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"" rating seems primarily attributable to the street language.",1977-10-08T05:00:00+0000

But there are now whole areas of artor what, in our reluctance to impose restrictive definitions, we agree to call art even if we do not always experience it as suchthat are very far both in conception and execution from anything the art historian has ever had to face in the past. In the case of certain forms of Conceptual art, for example, there will be little or nothing left for the future art historian to examine.

Sixtyfour years later the famous Alice sold the manuscript book, and for 20 years after that it led a peripatetic life: it crossed the Atlantic twice, was twice sold at public auction and passed through the hands of many eminent dealers and collectors. In 1948 it finally, came to rest in the British Museum. It is almost impossible to believe, but it seems to be true, that through all those years that Alice owned the manuscript and through the 20 years of its travels it concealed a secret; one that Dodgson apparently carried to the grave when he died in 1898.

It restores one's common sense and one's appreciation for the fantastic, and it reminds us of the profound possibilities of film in the hands of someone we now acknowledge to be an authentic master.""That Obscure Object of Desire"" is Buuel's ""Don Giovanni."" It combines the effervescence and gaiety of ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" with the dark wit of ""Tristana."" and though it continues to explore themes we recognize from these and other Buuel films, it is something quite other.Most obviously, I suppose, ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" is an upside-down romance in which love, Buuel seems to be telling us, is ""a devastating act of subversion."" The setting is the easily recognizable contemporary world, but a world that is a half-degree off its axis and fast going to pieces, though everyone displays the fastidious manners of the members of a society that will last forever.Just beyond the horizon of the film, which is set in Paris and in Seville, chaos reigns. Through newspaper headlines and radio broadcasts we learn. that terrorism is rampant. Planes are being hijacked and innocents slaughtered. A mysterious virus is nearing Barcelona and a guerrilla group that calls itself the Revolutionary Army of the Infant Jesus has attempted to assassinate the Archbishop of Sienna. Even the Communists are outraged by the anarchic state of things.Seemingly unruffled by all this (though he is impatient when a booby-trapped automobile in front of his explodes and forces his car to make a detour) is the charming, literate, wealthy Mathieu (Fernando Rey), Bufiuel's Don, a French businessman whose life is in perfect order until the day that the beautiful Conchita enters it, dressed as a maid.Though he has been a widower for seven years, Mathieu is no ordinary lecher. As he tells his brother, the judge (Julien Betheau), Mathieu can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he has ever made love to a woman whom he didn't love passionately. From the minute he sees Conchita, Mathie is in the throes of an uncontrollable passion.Conchita, though, is not someone whose measure he can get, and who eludes him even he gets her into bed. Conchita flees his house, only to turn up a few months afterwards traveling through Switzerland with a group of musicians. Later Mathieu makes a deal with Conchita's pious mother to set up Conchita as his mistress. Again she runs away. Each time they meet again, she leads him further into the recesses of his obsession, always promising him the moon (in the form of her virginity), then suddenly changing her mind.As Mathieu sees her, Conchita is so changeable that Buuel has cast two lovely new actresses to play herCarole Bouquet, who looks a little like a young Rita Hayworth, as the coolly enigmatic Conchita, and Angela Molina as the earthy, flamenco-dancing Conchita whom he follows to Seville.Poor old Mathieu. The night he succeeds in getting Conchita to his country house, where she has promised to be his mistress, the Conchita who goes into the bathroom to change, changes not only her clothes. Miss Bouquet goes in but Miss Molina comes out.Mathieou huffs, puffs and groans in his agony. He leaves Conchita a dozen times but always is lured back. At one point he persuades her to live with him and to share his bed, though no sexual contact can be made. When the judge asks his brother why he doesn't marry her, Mathieu answers earnestly that if he married her, he would be helpless. At another point, when Mathieu upbraids Conchita for her maddening ways, she answers, ""You only want what I refuse. That's not all or me. . . .""Who really loves whom? Though Conchita at first seems to be the classic coquette, she becomes, as the film progresses, the true lover, while Mathieu becomes the coquette, a reversal of roles that is, nevertheless, not to be taken as the last word.""That Obscure Object of Desire"" is beatifully played by its small, impeccably chosen cast, beginning with Mr. Rey who, at this point in his career, is virtually a projection of Buuel's artistic personalitygentle, polite, self-aware incapable of the superfluous gestures, and driven. Miss Bouquet and Miss Molina are enchantingI don't think Buuel has ever before been so successful with neophyte actresses.There are further delights in the performances of Mr. Bertheau (who played the ""worker bishop"" in ""The Discreet Charm""), of Andre Weber, as Mathieu's all-wise valet, and of Pieral, a dwarf who plays the psychologist to whom Mathieu pours out his sad story on the train from Seville to Paris, which provides the frame for the film.""That Obscure Object of Desire"" is a lot more open-ended and surreal than I've indicated, but these are pleasures that one should discover for oneself. To attempt to interpret them in this sort of review would be as gross as giving away the ending of a whodunit. One particular prop, though, I would suggest that you watch out for. It's an ordinary, but apparently well-stuffed burlap sack that the always-well-groomed Mathieu carries with him.With an effortlessness matched by no other director today, Buuel creates a vision of a world as logical as a theorem, as mysterious as a dream, and as funny as a vaudeville gag. I especially like the response of a waiter in a posh restaurant when an insect turns up in Mathieu's martini. ""A fly,"" the waiter exclaims. ""I've been after that one for days, and he had to fall into your glass!""",1977-10-09T05:00:00+0000

I quote the theater more to reassure myself than to inform the reader, because frankly, there were many moments that didn't seem to fit in with the theme announced. Actually, one should be grateful for that because the leadin idea is essentially a onejoke affair that can lead at best to brief snorted laughter when the sketch moves from historical situation to contemporary song.

They were certainly not the classy pinstripe gentlemen that Joe McCarthy or Casey Stengel led. Still, they won 100 games (while the Mets were lucky not to lose 100) so they became at least interesting. And finally, incredibly, they were more than interesting.

And then, to make matters worse, there was that pointyheaded bureaucrat who allegedly called opponents of the Federal flood program rednecks. So the Missouri Congressmen attached to a major housing bill the pointyheaded bureaucrat elimination amendment.

us,Film: Portugal's Blocs Vie in 'Class Struggle',"SCENES from the Class Struggle in Portugal,"" the new documentary feature at the Whitney Museum of American Art, may be of more cinematic than political interest here, having been directed (with Philip Spinelli) by Robert Kramer, the young man who made two impressive fiction films (""Ice"" and ""The Edge"") dealing with America's militant left in the late 1960's and early 70's.In Portugal, where nearly 50 years of a fascist dictatorship was over-thrown in 1974, Mr. Kramer found the sort of revolutionary struggle in progress that ""Ice"" and ""The Edge"" predict (so far, fruitlessly) for the United States. There was something extremely invigorating going in Portugal, but alsothis film seems to say without being entirely aware of itsomething that wasn't following the neat plans of the theoreticians.In Portugal, where the film is being distributed as a kind of teaching tool in factories, on farms and in neighborhoods, the title is ""Will the Revolution Triumph?"" The American title better describes the movie's content for those of us who aren't knowledgeable about the power blocs struggling for control in Portugal.It is a film of isolated scenesinterviews, newsreel footage, demonstrations, paradesall designed to present the case for one of the most militant of Portugal's political parties, the Proletarian Revolutionary Party, with no attempt to hide the film makers' biases. If one doesn't share the film makers' particular Marxist way of looking at the world, much of what the two narrators (one man, one woman) tell us is likely to be received with skepticism, though their analyses of Portugal's past seem sound enough.""Scenes from the Class Struggle"" means to inform, not to entertain. Even so, it's a handsome film to look at, a collage of footage in color, in blackand-white and in monochromes. Its tone is meant to be as high and firm as the clenched fist of the Communist salute, but the final effect of the pictures we are shown is one of chaos, confusion, of people being polarized into political positions they don't even understand.",1977-10-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: New Thinking In Mao's China,"THERE IS a heated confrontation near the end of ""Breaking With Old Ideas,"" a 1975 feature made in China and now at the Film Forum, that is as familiar in tone as it is foreign in substance. One night, the students at a rural branch of the Communist Labor College are worrying about the next day's big exam when they receive word that insects are devouring the rice crop. Should they keep on studying, like good little crypto-bourgeois bookworms, or should they take practical action?One student leader, a pretty young woman who never seems to stop frowning, makes an impassioned plea for the latter option. In this situation, she insists, fumigation would be in accordance with the teachings of Chairman Mao. With that, the group is won over, and the sequence ends happliy: Everyone marches out to the fields and commences spraying.""Breaking With Old Ideas,"" reported to be the first Chinese feature released here commercially, is fascinating in its often-successful efforts to combine didacticism with entertainment. In order to explain the Party's attitude toward educationan attitude that has been substantially altered since this film was made, by the waythe film tells the story of Principal Lung, who in 1958 is appointed head of an agricultural college in a mountainous region. Lung believes in Mao's notion that education should be freely available to everyone, and that it is important for students to acquire both practical and political knowledge, ""to become both Red and expert.""But some of the older, stuffier faculty members resist the changes Lung institutes, upholding their older, stuffier ideas about entrance exams and course requirements. They teach Lung's all-peasant student body about the functions of a horse's tail instead of how to cure a sick water-buffalo. They don't entirely renounce the elitism of Confucius. They aren't even smart enough to schedule their lessons on seedlings for crop-planting time.One of the more amusing things about the film is the way it treats its villains. These reactionary teachers scheme and connive like the wickedest of fiends, but a film about the joys of enlightenment can't advocate revenge without seeming small-minded. So at the finale these soreheads publicly confess to the error of their ways, and the students forgive them. Then Mao sends a letter telling the students they were right all along, and everyone cheers euphorically.Shot in fading color and translated rather strangely at times (""'How did you get here so quickly?' 'I came at great-leap-forward speed'""), ""Breaking With Old Ideas"" is a lot more warm and animated than it may sound. The characters are sketched broadly, without much human detail, and en masse they tend to shout things in unison, like the students at Billy Jack's Freedom"" School. But their ferver is so palpable, and their earnestness so affecting, that there is almost as much liveliness and drama here as there is propaganda.",1977-10-14T05:00:00+0000

Charles Rane (William Devane) returns home to a small town in Texas to be greeeted as a hero with a Cadillac convertible and couple thousand dollars in silver dollars (donated by a supermarket), one for each day of his imprisonment, plus one for luck. He accepts the car and the money in much the same manner as he accepts his wife's news that she's fallen in love with another manimpassively.Nothing seems to move Charlie, though he cares for his young son and he is something of a physical fitness nut. He tells himself that it's as if he'd died when he was captured. One survives years of torture, he says, if ""you learn to love the ropethat's how you beat them.""Charlie, as written in the screenplay by Paul Schrader and Heywood Gould, and as acted by Mr. Devane, is such a tough, complicated, explosive character that one keeps wishing that ""Rolling Thunder,"" the film that contains him, were a match for him. It isn't. The movie, which opened yesterday at the Cincerama I and other theaters, has some good things, but in the way it has been directed by John Flynn it moves so easily and sort of foolishly toward its violent climax that all the tension within Charlie has long since escaped the film.""Rolling Thunder,"" written in 1973, a year after Mr. Schrader wrote the screenplay for ""Taxi Driver,"" gives evidence of having once been something much more complex than the neo-""Death Wish"" this film is. There are a number of similarities between Charlie, the seemingly cool, unnervingly collected vet of ""Rolling Thunder,"" and the psychotic Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver."" Within each is a small vial of nitroglycerine ready to go off.The event that detonates Charlie is a brutal holdup in which a gang of thugs invades his house looking for his silver dollars. Not knowing Charlie's secret for survival, they torture him. They grind up his right hand in the garbage disposal unit, then murder his wife, his son and, they think, Charlie.The manner in which Charlie, now equipped with a metal claw for a hand, goes about tracking down the murderers is such a model of efficiencyand he seems so cheerful about the taskthat the complicated, seething character of the film's opening sequences appears to have become not much more interesting than the fellow played by Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish.""I can't believe that it was Mr. Schrader's idea merely to have Charlie reliving his Vietnam duty (and, anyway, Charlie was a flier, not a ground soldier) when he sets up the bloody series of executions that conclude the movie. This, however, seems to be the point. Something is missing, but what it is, I'm not sure.Though ""Rolling Thunder"" appears to have been made primarily for what is loosely called ""the action market,"" which will take violence, blood and gore over sex any day, it has a nice feeling for the way small-town America looks and sounds and it has several excellent performances.In addition to Mr. Devane's, there are those of Linda Haynes, as a young blond cocktail waitress who manages simultaneously to look beautiful and slightly ravaged (something that it took Ava Gardner years to achieve), and Tommy Lee Jones, as a fellow who shared Charlie's time in the P.O.W. camp and effectively suggests a man who, though he pretends to be like anyone else, now lives in a small closet in the back of his soul. Like Charlie, he is haunted but ever-alertand armed to the teeth.",1977-10-15T05:00:00+0000

us,'Equus': Film of a Different Color,"When ""Equus,"" Peter Shaffer's psychological mystery play, was originally staged on Broadway, I was inclined to credit its great emotional impact to the stunning performances by Anthony Hopkins and Peter Firth and to the spectacular, highly stylized theatrical effects devised by Mr. Shaffer and John Dexter, who directed the production. On stage, ""Equus"" was a breathtaking experience of light, sound, performance and text, more or less, I thought, in that order of importance. Later, however, when I saw other actors take over the leads, the production suffered hardly at all.Now, after seeing Sidney Lumet's comparatively realistic film version, it's possible to appreciate Mr. Shaffer's text for what it isan extraordinarily skillful, passionate inquiry into the entire Freudian methodwithout being distracted by dazzling theatricality.My problem, though, doctor, is that as much as I respect Mr. Shaffer's script (and his screenplay), I like being distracted by dazzling theatricality. Indeed, I prefer it.This new ""Equus,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East, is probably about as good as one can get on film. It represents intelligent decisions. It's beautifully, sometimes almost grandly acted, by Richard Burton as the troubled psychiatrist attempting to bring back to sanity a young man who, in a fit of furious passion, has blinded six horses in a riding stable where he worked.Peter Firth repeats his stage role as the boy, with Joan Plowright as his mother, Colin Blakely as his dad, Eileen Atkins as the judge who brings the boy to the doctor's care and Jenny Agutter as the pretty girl who indirectly triggers his furious breakdown. There's not a thoughtless or uninteresting performance in the film.Mr. Lumet manages to suggest some of the play's theatricality in the up-tempoed pacing of these performances and by retaining the doctor's agonizing monologues as speeches spoken directly to the camera. Yet something is missingspecifically, our need to use our imaginations to fill in the visual and emotional gaps in the stories of Dr. Martin Dysart, the psychiatrist, and Alan Strang, his patient.Although Mr. Shaffer's screenplay does not differ in any marked way from the play, the film seems to exclude us by doing all the work for us. It shows and tells us everything there is to know about the doctor and his patient. In great plays, what happens offstage demands our attention as much as anything that happens on.In Mr. Lumet's ""Equus,"" there's no such thing as an off-screen space, no privacy that we can invade, in effect, at our own risk. Everything mentioned in the play's text, or recalled through a mimed, re-created moment, happens front and center, on the screen. The movie exhausts us with information. We see the unhappily married doctor with his dentist wife, though everything we have to know about her and their relationship is carefully evoked in dialogue or monologues. The images are redundant.We are shown young Alan's bedroom at home, a sacred place where he created his private religion devoted to the worship of Equus, the vengeful, demanding horse-god. When Alan takes off on his clandestine midnight rideshis psychosexual communion riteswe watch a naked young man riding a real horse bareback through a real countryside. We are as likely to worry about his catching pneumonia as to wonder about his emotional state.What once was poetic and mysterious becomes, when seen in this literal detail, banal, anticlimactic.Yet this may well seem like hairsplitting to anyone seeing ""Equus"" for the first time, for, behind all of this realistic scenery, the play remains intact, and it's a good one. It's the most interesting, most serious appraisal of psychiatry that we've ever had in a commercial filman appraisal that probably has infuriated quite as many psychiatrists as it has pleased. It's the terrible suspicion of Mr. Shaffer's Dr. Dysart that, by removing Alan Strang's demons, by returning him to ""normal"" life, he has removed the boy's passion forever, emotionally lobotomized him.Though the film is held together by the mystery of Alan Strang's behavior, the unraveling of which provides the narrative line, it's Mr. Burton's performance as the psychiatrist that dominates the movie, whether or not you agree with his fears that he cuts from his patients ""their portions of individuality."" This is the best Burton performance since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" He receives excellent support, especially from Mr. Firth, but the film, which is otherwise in the siege of commonplace realism, becomes bigger than life in the presence of this self-mocking, troubled, still-searching miracle-worker.",1977-10-17T05:00:00+0000

For several seasons, sharp store buyers have been on to the Milan gold mine and have been increasing their orders accordingly.

Some of them design for several different manufacturers. For instance, Versace (pronounced Versaachi) produces collections for three different companiesCallaghan, Complice and Jenny. But soon these names will be as familiar and easy to toss around as Saint Laurent, Kenzo, or Calvin Klein. Here are a few examples of the kinds of clothes they design for men and womencompletely modern, unstructured, uncluttered, in superb sheer linens, cottons, silks and wools that fall free as a breeze against the body.

us,The Screen: A Curious Biography:Filled With Demons,"WRITERS ARE notoriously poor subjects for biographical study. If the writer's life warrants close scrutiny at all, chances are that he or she was articulate enough to have dealt with the most interesting facets already, and that few biographers will be canny enough to develop a perspective more valuable than the author's. Malcolm Lowry is a case in point: Mr. Lowry captured a far more vivid sense of his own demons in ""Under the Volcano,"" his one great novel, than the one evidenced by a new film biography entitled ""Volcano: An Inquiry Into the Life of Malcolm Lowry.""The film, made by Donald Brittain with John Kramer and showing at Cinema III, documents Mr. Lowry's life in a curious manner. Key events, such as the 1957 inquest that deemed his having choked drunkenly on his own vomit as ""death by misadventure,"" are re-enacted for the camera, but they are staged too vaguely to have much impact, and too literally to cast any new light. To illustrate the fact that Mr. Lowry's house burned down, for example, the camera simply lingers over footage of another modern-day house on fire. To show that his book was successful, the camera whisks across rows of shelves filled with paperback copies.As the film often indicates, Mr. Lowry was a difficult character, an alcoholic so desperate that he would drink after-shave lotion when nothing more palatable was at hand. He was a hard man for even his friends and family to love, but his talents were extraordinary enough to make people forgive him his drunken excesses.The film attempts to suggest the scope of Mr. Lowry's writing, mostly through unidentified voice-over passages read eloquently by Richard Burton, but it in no way makes the genius seem as palpable as the unpleasantness. What remains is the portrait of a tragic and disagreeable man with many patient, all-forgiving friends.Mr. Brittain has made other biographical films, about people as diverse as Leonard Cohen and Henry Ford 2d, and he has also worked as a police reporter. His experience in the latter field is apparent in the thoroughness with which he reels off details of limited consequence: an old schoolmaster of Mr. Lowry's recalls that the boy slouched in class, and Mr. Brittain's narration adds that Mr. Lowry had small hands, was chronically constipated, and had a physique that made him a figure of fun on bath night among the other boys at school.Mr. Brittain's attention to fact, combined with his obvious desire to lend the film an impressionistic air, produces a strange sort of sloppiness. Chronology is sometimes sketchy, and many of the numerous people interviewed in the film go unidentified. Often this doesn't matter, but it does pose problems at times. ""He chose to live as he did, and he produced 'Under the Volcano,'"" says one man. ""I chose to live differently, and I didn't produce anything much."" ""Well, that's not true,"" insists another voice off-screen. Maybe not, but how can we be sure if the man we're watching hasn't been properly introduced?""Volcano"" presupposes a certain knowledge of Mr. Lowry's work on the part of the viewer, but it isn't really a film for Lowry scholars: there are few photos of the man here, little new information, and no insights not already provided by his work. Some of the interviews, notably one with Margerie Lowry, the author's widow, are quite moving at times, and the images of Mr. Lowry at his most grotesque are stark and mesmerizing. But a viewer who knew nothing about Mr. Lowry at the outset might come away wondering at the disparity between the caliber of the man's work and the wretchedness of his life. Mr. Brittain's ""Inquiry"" never satisfactorily addresses his single most important issue.",1977-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Zola Adaptation Manquee,"EMILE ZOLA'S ""La Faute de L'Abb Mouret,"" written in 1875, is not, as far as I can learn, in print in English at the moment, but if it were. I doubt that the title would be ""The Demise of Father Mouret."" This is what the American distributors are calling Georges Franju's 1970 French film adaptation that opened yesterday at the Renoir Cinema.Most often ""faute"" is translated as ""mistake,"" ""shortcoming,"" ""defect,"" and, I suppose, if the word were pushed, it could even mean ""sin."" To freight it with the finality of ""demise"" is really too much. It seems to be just another in a series of wrong decisions that began with Mr. Franju's desire to make the movie, which is a sort of fairy-tale version of the Adam and Eve story updated to the France of the Second Empire.Mr. Franju is not a well-known film maker in this country, perhaps because he is at his best when he is being what most critics think of as frivolous, though he's not a frivolous man. His fine horror film, ""Eyes Without a Face,"" received few reviews when it opened here in a badly English-dubbed version in the mid-60's, though his more solemn, ambitious films, ""Thrse Desqueyroux"" and ""Thomas the Imposter"" have been reviewed, if not ecstatically.""Judex,"" Mr. Franju's homage to Louis Feuillade, the creator of the great French silent serials ""Fantomas"" and ""Les Vampires,"" simply baffled everyone not sharing the Franju opinion of Feuillade.""The Demise of Father Mouret"" is not likely to win him new friends, though I've no doubt that the film may be faithful to the novel, which I haven't read, and to Zola, whose occasional flights into a kind of naturalized romanticism haven't worn well.""The Demise of Father Mouret"" is a mixture of social realism and Walt Disney, about a delicate young French priest, Father Mouret (Francis Huster), who elects to take a parish in the provinces where the peasants have long since embraced every sin there is. The priest himself successfully sublimates his own lustful thoughts in prayer until one day he meets a strange young woman, Albine (Gillian Hills), who lives with her atheistic uncle in the remains of an old chateau set in the middle of a magic garden.Well, one thing leads to another and poor Father Mouret loses his memory long enough to lose himself to worldly pleasures in the garden with Albine, who, like Eve, tempts the man, though in this case the author is clearly in favor of apple-eating. Things go very badly for the couple. The priest returns to his church and Albine commits suicide in a way that is unique in my movie-going memory: She smothers herself to death with calla lilies.The actors are steadfastly unconvincing. The one interesting character in the film is an old lady we meet only after her deathsomeone, we're told in shocked tones, who, during the Revolution, posed naked as a living-statue of Reason.",1977-10-21T05:00:00+0000
