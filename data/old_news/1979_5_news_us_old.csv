The two women decided to put something together to offer prospective house builders, plans for a house with a certain craftsmanship that would develop their own sense of detail, and allow them to participate in the design and construction processes. Nothing happened for years, until someone came along and thought it should be a book. With its publication, Mrs. Armstrong, who had never written a book before, said she has satisfied her evangelical need to introduce the terminology of architectural design to the layman.

us,"Screen: 'Age of Medici,' Trilogy by Rossellini:First Family of Florence","IN the very last scene of ""The Age of the Medici,"" Roberto Rossellini's extraordinary trilogy about the great Florentine family of the Renaissance, Leon Battista Alberti, the architect, is lecturing the young Lorenzo de Medici, the grandson of Cosimo de Medici who would one day be known to history as Lorenzo the Magnificent. ""Why do we live in such a marvelous time?"" Alberti asks, and then answers, ""Because we wish to be intelligent.""I suspect that Alberti comes very close to being a spokesman for the Roberto Rossellini some of us came to know in the last years of his life when he was engaged in the production of a series of remarkable films for television designed to record, with as little artifice and editorial comment as possible, the ideas and the events that give direction to Western civilization. When he died three years ago, Rossellini had completed 40 hours of films in this series, two of which, ""Socrates"" and ""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" have been commercially released in this country.""The Age of the Medici,"" which consists (in chronological order) of ""Cosimo de Medici,"" ""The Power of Cosimo"" and ""Leon Battista Alberti: Humanism,"" is now being presented at Joseph Papp's Public Theater. ""Cosimo de Medici"" is playing through Sunday; ""The Power of Cosimo,"" Tuesday through May 13, and ""Leon Battista Alberti,"" May 15-20. My only quibble with the Public Theater's presentation is that it's not possible  should one wish it  to see the three films in a marathon (four hours and 12 minutes) screening, plus appropriate intermissions.The films are not difficult and certainly they are not ambiguous. However, their austere style, as well as Rossellini's total lack of concern for what might be called performance, take some getting used to. Yet once you've grasped the method and the rhythm of the films, they are a ravishingly beautiful experience that shouldn't be interrupted.More than ""Socrates"" and much more than ""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" the Medici films speak most eleoquently of what was on Rossellini's mind when he turned away from the commercial cinema to what he called, for lack of any suitable euphemism, teaching films. In his book, ""Un Esprit Libre,"" published in France the year he died, he devoted a chapter to what he saw as the need for ""an integral education,"" meaning a kind of continuing, all-round education by which modern man would be freed from the terrible dangers of specialization, which he saw as as another form of ignorance. ""We are neither ants, nor bees, nor spiders,"" he wrote, ""and yet we have become regimented, stereotyped. . . .""Rossellini's impatience with contemporary education was founded on his belief that most educational systems have the effect of ""fixing and maintaining"" what is already established in a society. He also found ridiculous educational methods that fill brains with facts while suffocating all interest into the why's of life and the world.In ""The Age of the Medici"" Rossellini documents the explosion in the sciences and the arts in the Renaissance under the influence of the Medicis, the quintessential bourgeois family whose banking and business interests shaped the economic, political and social life of what became the modern world.In these films we see Cosimo wheeling and dealing to bring an end to a costly and foolish war, not because of moral reasons but because war is bad for business. Cosimo is not above bribery, conspiracy and murder in what he deems the public interest, which is also his. When necessary, the church is available to sanctify skulduggery. The arts are patronized, the past is examined for what it can yield to the present, and an unbiased science is a universal discipline.Though the trilogy takes the name of the Medicis, Leon Battista Alberti is its most important figure. Alberti is the true Renaissance man, an architect, scholar, humanist, a fellow who never stopped seeking, inquiring, speculating, someone, clearly, whom Rossellini could identify with.The visual style of ""The Age of the Medici"" is modestly elegant. Shot in color and 16 millimeter, mostly in and around Florence, the films have a form dictated by their function, which is to tell us as much as possible, as efficiently as possible, about the life and thought of the times.The actors make few attempts to act. They recite as they walk about magnificent locations, sounding and looking like ferociously gifted dress-extras. The talk has been rather flatly dubbed into English so that it's not always possible to tell who is speaking.Forget these problems, though. The film is about what is being said and what you can see around and behind these figures. When you connect with ""The Age of the Medici,"" it has the effect of reducing every other film you've seen recently to the status of an ornament.",1979-05-03T05:00:00+0000

This style emphasized playing wide open, frequently leaving blots (exposed men) in order to rapidly bring men into play. As a result, more complicated games developed, with many men being sent back on each side. In the last year or two a new trend has emerged among some of the better young players.

us,Screen: Sophia Loren Starring in 'Firepower':A Tossed Salad,"EQUIPPED only with an appreciation of Sophia Loren's dreaminess and a stopwatchthe kind that demands a car chase or a house afire every 10.6 minutesMichael Winner has thrown together ""Firepower."" Mr. Winner directs movies the way others toss salads, which means that ""Firepower"" is best appreciated at a kind of mental half-mast. A lot happens. None of it makes sense. It all takes place in the tropics, though, amid scenery almost as sensational looking as the leading lady. Well, things could be worse.The idea, foggy as it may be, is that Miss Loren is the wife of a chemist, who is blown up in the film's first minute or two, which makes her a widow. A Howard Hughes type ordered the murder of the chemist, or so Miss Loren thinks. So when the Federal Government, which would like to get its hooks on the Hughes figure, asks her to smoke him out of his Caribbean lair, she doesn't mind the prospect of sashaying magnificently around a couple of islands. James Coburn and O. J. Simpson are also enlisted. Since delicacy is not essential to their project, the first thing they do is set fire to the Hughes type's house.Mr. Coburn is supposed to be an expert gardener, which in a movie like this means he is once seen sitting in a flower bed, and once he remarks to his potential employer (Eli Wallach) that the ""Ming aralias"" in the man's office need watering. In another broad stroke of character establishing, Mr. Coburn is shown to have an identical twin brother, who is primed to play a crucial role in the story and is never mentioned again.Some of the performances Mr. Winner gets from his supporting players are rip-roaringly awful, as is Gato Barbieri's loud and schlocky score. However, there's a nice chemistry in the teaming of Miss Loren, Mr. Coburn and Mr. Simpson, each of whom has an unusually physical presence on the screen. Together, they generate an air of friendliness and cooperation, which makes up for the lack of romantic spark between Mr. Coburn and Miss Loren. The closest these two get to a love scene is when Miss Loren has to make a quick trip somewhere without her luggage, and Mr. Coburn gallantly shops for her once they get there. He is thoughtful enough to come up with an evening gown and about $12 million worth of diamonds.""Firepower,"" which opens today at the Loew's State I and other theaters, includes enough violent episodes to have earned it an R rating. But the killings are perfunctory, and the blood-shed virtually nil, despite Mr. Winner's formidable reputation in that department (""Death Wish"" is a notable example of the director at his goriest). Still, a message is in evidence, as when one character sneers ""I've always noticed it's you rich, soft, pampered people who are so in love with violence. You've never experienced it. You just want to see it done.""This time the emphasis is on sheer spectacle, as when Mr. Coburn drives a bulldozer through an entire house, reducing it to rubble. But the film's ingenuity in cooking up such episodes is disappointing. It should not be necessary, during various chase sequences, to see the actors upset a truck filled with oranges and a truck filled with bananas in the same movie.",1979-05-04T05:00:00+0000

Hannan, who works for a top-secret government bureau that may or may not be the Central Intelligence Agency, goes to Mexico to meet a contact in a cantina just over the border from El Paso and, instead, meets an ambush in which his wife is assassinated. Is somebody trying to tell him something?His suspicions are further reinforced when, after a stay in a Connecticut sanitarium, he is standing in a suburban railroad station and is almost pushed into the path of an incoming train. Is he simply high strung and nervous? Later he receives a letter that is definitely not junk mail. It's a note written in ancient Hebrew and signed ""Avenger of Blood."" Is Harry mad?If you know your movies, you can be sure he isn't. The principal pleasure of Jonathan Demme's ""Last Embrace"" is noting the way the director is able to keep this very slim tale moving forward without totally alienating common sense. The secret is impeccable casting.More than any other new director Mr. Demme recognizes good actors and knows how to use them. As the besieged Harry Hannan, Mr. Scheider is like an uncertainly delicate watch spring. You can never be sure if one more turn of the screw will be smooth or if it will result in a total crackup. No other leading actor can create so much tension out of such modest material. As the young woman who befriends Harry Hannan, Janet Margolin is unexpectedly fine, but it's the sort of role that offers a good deal more than is originally promised.The supporting cast is made up of some of the best actors available in New York and Hollywood, including Sam Levene, John Glover, the Oscar-winning Christopher Walken, David Margulies and Lou Gilbert, as well as Charles Napier and Marcia Rodd, who were so memorably lunatic in Mr. Demme's ""Handle With Care.""""Last Embrace,"" which opens today at the Paramount, Beekman, Murray Hill and other theaters, is never quite so entertaining as its parts, but I've no idea whether this is because of some lack in David Shaber's screenplay or because Mr. Demme's handling of it is more conventional than need be. The material is the sort that might be liberated by the imagination of Alfred Hitchcock. In only two sequences does the film rise to its baroque needs.In one, a ""john"" meets his death at the hands of a lady of the evening, but in midafternoon, and in the other, a climactic chase at Niagara Falls, the pursuer is momentarily stumped at the edge of the falls because all of the sightseers have suddenly donned identical rain slickers.

It can cost more to produce a fashion collection than to mount a musical and, if a collection is a success, it makes a large return on investment. Flops can be professionally fatal. Both depend on creative people and sell that ephemeral quality called talent; the result is that  even for seasoned professionals  a performance can be brilliant, controversial, uneven, merely competent or, alas, inadequate.

us,"Film: 'Teresa the Thief,' A Comedy From Italy:The Cast","Imagine Barbra Streisand starring in a happy-go-lucky comic version of ""Seven Beauties."" and you get the tenor of ""Teresa the Thief,"" a raffish Italian comedy that shows off Monica Vitti to marvelous advantage. Miss Vitti, who bore a very strong resemblance to Miss Streisand at the time (1974) when ""Teresa the Thief"" was shot, also has a Streisand-like ability to make herself adorable at will.In addition, and perhaps of no lesser importance, Miss Vitti can wolf down a meal more avidly than anyone else in movies these days. Because Teresa, the heroine here, is very often down on her luck and starving, this gift of Miss Vitti's comes in handy. She lends an ecstatic energy to the film's every frame, even to the sequences that aspire, not very successfully, to sobriety.""Teresa the Thief"" takes the form of a rambling memoir, a long string of vignettes that lead nowhere in particular but are often individually charming. Raised by the strict father of her large, earthy family, Teresa turns into a burglar during World War II, and is jailed for her crimes. Later, when the Allied forces conquer Italy, she pleads for clemency, explaining that she broke a bust of Mussolini in the apartment she was caught robbing.She becomes a pickpocket later on, operating with a female accomplice during the film's most delightful chapter. Together, they operate by picking up a strange man with whom the accomplice can neck in a movie theater, until she finds his wallet and passes it to Teresa in the next seat. Unfortunately, they always seem to attempt this stunt in theaters showing ""Waterloo Bridge."" And Teresa, who has no real talent for crime, likes the movie so much that she invariably loses track of her job.Miss Vitti, the only real star of the film, helps unify its many episodes by playing them with an imperturbable buoyancy. But even her performance can't quite compensate for the movie's lack of dramatic emphasis, or for its tendency to meander. The loose ends never tie up, and no interlude seems to have any more weight than any other. The passage of time often goes unremarked on, except in the English voice-overs  the rest of the film is subtitled  delivered by Miss Vitti in an accent that makes already-funny lines even funnier.""Teresa the Thief"" is the first film to be directed by Carlo Di Palma, who has long worked as a cinematographer, most notably for Michelangelo Antonioni. It is handsome and well played, but a little bit fluffier than Mr. Di Palma seems to want it to be, and somewhat lacking in momentum.",1979-05-06T05:00:00+0000

The pen had been mainly in the man's hand: It was the male who effectively owned and controlled the discourses within which the woman had to move and have (or fail to have) her being. So when the woman took up the pen, she was, in a certain sense, venturing into a maledominated realm, engaging in an activity traditionally reserved for males (except for letters and other kinds of private documents). Men held the pen, and  with a few exceptionsonly men published. Hence, partly, the degree of anonymity and the extensive use of pseudonyms employed by women writers in the 19th century.

There we were, from September until April, watching the theater lumber its way from one disappointment to another (with a few exceptions), baffled and wondering where its recent promise had gone. We knew we were trapped in a paradox, an irony we might well have done without. On the one hand, during the past four or five years, Broadway and the outlying stages that have become its principal source of nourishment had together built up an audience larger than any in living memory, an audience eager to break house records with the least hint of encouragement. And, on the other hand, no one was able to supply it with the pleasures it was so passionately demanding. Curiously, the forms normally thought to be most popular were in the direst straits. Musicals, for instance, took a terrible drubbing this year: King of Hearts, Carmelina, Ballroom, Zoot Suit, and Grand Tour virtually tripped over one another's heels in their eagerness to depart. But effective comedies were in short supply, too. All those theatergoers, and what were they to go to? (They went to last year's shows, and holdovers from the few years before that, which means that Variety's boxoffice figures for the season will probably remain high; but present shortage means future shrinkage, and confidence was beginning to.",1979-05-06T05:00:00+0000

The theory is backed by the fact that four inlets once divided what is now a 32milelong island. A more romantic explanation is that preRevolutionary residents built fires on the beach to lure passing boats to the shoals where they would flounder and could then be looted.

""The Silent partner"" is about a Toronto bank teller who is given an unexpected chance to rob his own bank, which might seem to place it at a considerable remove from ""Payday,"" a movie that took an acerbic look at the world of a country music star. But both the singer and the bank teller are escape artists, busy extricating themselves from the workaday world. And Mr. Duke, in addition to being a brisk and suspenseful story teller, has a talent for depicting the life they'd like to get away from in exquisitely damning detail.So the backdrop for ""The Silent Partner,"" which opens today at neighbor, hood theaters, is a series of office parties, on-the-job friendships and afterwork assignations. At the center of all this curiously half-hearted activity is one particular teller, played by Elliott Gould and immediately identified as a man whose ambitions are small. He lives alone. He flirts, ineffectually, with a co-worker (Susannah York) who is more than his match. He works out chess problems and collects tropical fish. He robs his bank only because a fluke of an opportunity presents itself. But what an opportunity it is!The teller, who may be drab but is certainly no fool, spots someone getting ready to commit a robbery. So when the thief (Christopher Plummer) comes to his window and demands money, the teller pockets the loot himself and trips off an alarm. Only the thief, who escapes, knows where the money really went. Unfortunately for the teller, the thief is a foul-tempered psychopath who doesn't like wise guys.Beginning with a marvelous confrontation scene in which Mr. Plummer scares the daylights out of Mr. Could by telephoning him from a phone booth just outside his window and delivering some very convincing threats, the film follows the sparring match between these two characters. But Mr. Duke never lets this particular round of cat-and-mousing run away with his story, which is still as much a tale of mundane mores as it is a thriller. The film's romantic interludes are at least as full of gamesmanship as the episodes involving the robbery.Just as he did with ""Payday,"" Mr. Duke has put together a dense, quirky, uncommonly interesting movie, this time with a high quotient of suspense. He develops his characters firmly and fast, and populates the story with a lot of them, weighed down by the monotony of their lives but still, senselessly, always on the go. When Mr. Plummet's fiercely vibrant thief bursts into Mr. Gould's life, he seems almost to be a creature of another species.Mr. Plummer makes a terrific heavy, especially in an early scene in which his destructive potential seems to know no bounds. Unfortunately, the screenplay never makes full use of the maniacal power of his performance, nor does it allow the thief enough ingenuity to make his tricks really surprising. He does behead another character during the course of one quarrel, it's true. But for the most part, his antics are tamer than what is initially promised. And the film has to struggle a bit to make an audience believe that the thief and the teller really are inextricably locked in combat, since there's nothing to keep Mr. Plummer from robbing a different bank, or Mr. Gould, who has hidden the money where no one can find it, from going to the police.One of the most impressive things about ""Payday"" was its central performance, from Rip Torn. Mr. Duke needed a performance of similar intensity from Elliott Gould to hold ""The Silent Partner"" together, and from that point of view Mr. Gould is disappointing.

Each interview was introduced and conducted by Bryan Magee, who studied philosophy at Oxford and is an experienced broadcaster. The originai is talks were uneven in quality, but the best of them were outstandingly interesting and informative, and they make excellent written dialogues in this revised form. Three of them present tersely, and with authority, original ideas. These are the interviews with Noam Chomsky, W.V. Quine and Iris Murdoch. In addition, Sir Isaiah Berlin, Bernard Williams, Ronald Dworkin, Sir Alfred Ayer and John Searle all produce excellent summaries of contemporary work, which cannot easily be found in such an agreeable and readable form elsewhere. The proportion of success is doubly remarkable when one considers the limits naturally set on the dissemination of philosophical ideas by television, as opposed to radio. Unavoidably there are aspects of contemporary philosophy that are neglected. Recent developments in logic and the philosophy of mathematics have had a very great influence on philosophy in recent decades, as they always must have; but they are not subjects that can easily be presented to a large audience on television.",1979-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Lanford Wilson's Talley's Folly is a lovely play, and one of the things it does most tellingly as it begins its intermissionless performance at the Circle Repertory's home in Sheridan Square is to mock the stage  that home of easy illusion  on which it is being performed. Judd Hirsch. the bearded, challenging, wry and wise man of the piece, saunters into view from backstage while the house lights are still full up. Grinning at us conspiratorially, he lounges against the stage apron and begins to expose, one by one, all the pretty scenic appurtenances that are supposed to make us believe in a starcrossed but nonetheless moonstruck romance. The piece is to be a sort of waltz, he explains, a series of halfevasive, halfclinging movements between two people trying to find each other, and. all of the louvers and the latticework and the gewgaws that make silver streaks of the eaves overhead have been planned to give the dance an aura of cheery plausibility. He goes on. That rotating gizmo beneath the pier at upstage center is the device that makes the water sparkle.

us,"Film: 'Cage aux Folles,' Farce in a French Club:The Cast","""La Cage aux Folles,"" the French farce that opens today at the 68th Street Playhouse, is the name of a nightclub in St. Tropez, in the south of France. According to the film, the club is both hugely popular and wildly notorious, though to the rest of us it seems the sort of place that could give St. Tropez a horrid reputation for being square. The Cage aux Folles puts on drag shows that feature thickly set, middle-aged men who, dressed like the chorus of the Princeton Triangle, sing and dance, and then, while taking their bows, flip off their wigs to astound the audience.The movie is based on a play by Jean Poiret that has, I'm told, been very successful in France, but exactly when it was successful is difficult to guess. The nearest Broadway equivalent to the foolish, mechanical sentiment of this farce might be something on the order of ""Never too Late,"" which goes back almost 20 years. ""La Cage aux Folles"" is naughty in the way of comedies that pretend to be sophisticated but actually serve to reinforce the most popular conventions and most witless stereotypes.It's the story of Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) and Zaza (Michel Serrault), who have been lovers for 20 years and who run the Cage, Renato as the manager and Zaza, whose real name is Albin, as the star of the show. Though Renato is supposed to be the masculine member of the couple, his wrist is only slightly less limp than Zaza's. The difference between them is that Zaza wears more makeup, cries more easily and complains about her lover's indifference.The would-be farcical complications revolve around the announcement of Renato's son, Laurent, that he is getting married and, to make things worse, that his fiance is the daughter of a cabinet minister known for his rectitude, a man who is, among other things, secretary-general of the Union of Moral Order. When Laurent's fiance and her parents arrive in St. Tropez to visit, you pretty well know what the second-act curtain will be, what with Laurent's real mother arriving on the scene unexpectedly, thus exposing one of Zaza's most heartfelt if worst performances.There might well be a real movie here, but it is not the one directed by Edouard Molinaro and written for the screen by Francis Veber, Mr. Molinaro, Marcello Danon and Mr. Poiret. It's not only that they go for gags at the expense of character  and humor  but also that they go for such cheap gags, such as Renato's attempting to show Zaza how to walk like John Wayne. Even worse, though, is the awful sentimentality.The leading performances are very much of the style of the film itself  energetic, broad, much too knowing and superficial. Mr. Tognazzi is a fine actor, but here he looks as ridiculous as his role. Mr. Serrault, who won the French equivalent to our Oscar for his performance, is all too convincing as the hammy, temperamental transvestite. He minces more grossly than ever did Billy De Wolfe, and he lunges at pathos like someone playing right guard for the Rams.",1979-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Van Gogh adored his work, and was indeed obsessed with it; it was one of the subjects he quarreled about with Gauguin. Ryder, though he never openly acknowledged it, was likewise deeply indebted to it. And these are not isolated examples of the esteem which Monticelli was held by artists on both sides of the Atlantic.

But the importance of the day to the national psyche  today is the 65th anniversary  and the idealized image it represents are hard to reconcile with its acutely negative counterpart, first venomously articulated by Philip Wylie 36 years ago in Generation of Vipers. Mom, he wrote, was a middleaged puffin with an eye like a hawk that has just seen a rabbit twitch far below. She is about 25 pounds overweight. ... In a thousand of her, there is not sex appeal enough to budge a hermit 10 paces off a rock ledge. Wylie's book went through 20 editions in its first dozen years. Later, Philip Roth named the culprit Mrs. Portnoy, and many psychoanalysts corroborated the indictments against her. Depending on her misdeed, she could cause threemonth colic, infantile rocking behavior or coprophagia in her child. Later, she might let go too perilously early or hold on too suffocatingly long .

Justin Kaplan's graceful essay on the naked self gives us more insight into Walt Whitman in 14 pages than we might expect in a booklength study by a less gifted writer; and Barbara Tuchman's Biography as a Prism of History which, quite properly, concludes the volume, is at once a statement on the manifold uses of biography (in the service of historical study) and a critique of contemporary biographical method.",1979-05-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Netting Bargains: A Fish Story,"ALTHOUGH there is not much to be,said in favor of inflation, it, has brought about at least one positive result: In an effort to stretch shrinking food budgets, Americans are adding variety to their diets by eating many things they formerly ignored. Nowhere is this increased variety more apparent than in local fish markets, now almost as interesting as aquariums, what with the strange and exotic species currently on display. Having discovered the hard way that salmon, striped bass, trout, sole, halibut, shrimp and scallops are not exactly inexpensive alternatives to meat, shoppers are becoming more adventurous and are trying many fish whose names were unknown to them even six months ago. In some cases, these unfamiliar species are bona fide delicacies elsewhere. The huge, wobbly and amorphous monkfish just now being introduced here is the treasured lotte of the French, and the long, pewter gray dogfish or sand shark, with its compact, snowy white meat, is known as palombo to Italians, who serve it crisply fried or simmered in a garlic and basilscented tomato sauce. In many instances, socalled bottom and trash fish gain popularity and their prices rise all too rapidly. Whitings sold for 49 cents a pound four or five years ago ID but now range from $1.10 to $1.35 a pound, and blowfish, discarded by both and ea mercial fishermen 15 years ago, were renamed sea squabs and, when available, bring $3.75 a pound on the wholesale market, according to Mike De Martino of De Martino's Fish Market, 132 Eighth Avenue near 17th Street (2436639). In the view of Professor John Isaacs, a marine scientist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, the growing popularity of these heretofore uneaten fish varieties has two important advantages. Not only can people buy them less expensively than other fish, but by doing so, the environmental balance of the oceans will be much improved.",1979-05-16T05:00:00+0000

The bank robbery turns out to be less a means to an end than a theoretical gesture that, having been made, becomes its own reason for being.Yet ""The Second Awakening of Christa Klages"" is a surprisingly involving sort of movie. Though it wanders, it wanders with a certain purpose, the way some intelligent people talk when they are trying to get a fix on complicated subjects. Miss von Trotta, who has collaborated on the screenplays for ""A Free Woman"" (in which she also acted), ""Coup de Grace"" and ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum,"" all directed by Volker Schlondorff, her husband, is a feminist of striking movie-making talent.""Christa Klages"" looks and sounds very sober, but it is full of odd associations and images that distinguish the work of a true film maker from that of a well-studied hack. It is never predictable. And while the plot is rather absurd, the film is emotionally and stylistically consistent.Miss von Trotta has also cast her film nicely with Tina Engel, who suggests a young Hildegard Knef, as Christa, and Silvia Reize as Christa's longtime friend, Ingrid. In secondary but no less effective roles are Marius Muller-Westernhagen, as an ex-seaman who accompanies Christa on her life of minicrime, and Peter Schneider as a young clergyman, a fellow who preaches the need for action but is unable to act in any unconventional way himself.""The Second Awakening of Christa Klages"" is a didactic film, but it is never smug in the manner of a film that knows all the answers. It's mostly about uncertainty, and about the need to take risks and to make choices. In this sense, it's more profoundly political than even the outraged ""Katharina Blum,"" which was based on the novel by Heinrich Bll and which never allowed the audience to think for itself.""The Second Awakening of Christa Klages"" can be seen at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:45, and next week, Thursday through Sunday, at the same time.",1979-05-17T05:00:00+0000

But Leora Klaymer Stewart, a fiber artist who studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and has been making fiber structures for more than 10 years, is now working on a smaller, more personal scale and is concerned with offloom techniques, rather than weaving. When I first came to New York five years ago, Miss Stewart said, I was making huge, environmental works what I call my exhibition pieces. But I was not really thinking about where they could possibly be used. She calls her newest pieces, each from 12 to 24 inches square, composite structures.

It was a very expensive series, and it was a flop. So the series was canceled. Then Universal took the three-hour debut episode of the show and decided to release it in movie theaters to those same people who hadn't even liked the program for free. A little Sensurround was added. The commercials were removed. Someone thought the whole thing was a good idea.Here are some questions you won't even need your Intergalactic Gyromodular Datamatron to answer: Has Hollywood finally come up with something even less imaginative than the common sequel? If so, then why? Can a lavish but mediocre television program be improved by the absence of commercials that do, after all, wake an audience up? In all fairness, it should be pointed out that part of the principal audience for ""Battlestar Galactica""  small children already hooked on ""Star Wars""  was asleep by the time the original three-hour episode concluded on television, inasmuch as a long Presidential press conference gummed up that evening's schedule. But who's to say that it wasn't the program itself, and not the lateness of the hour, that made them drowsy?Certainly ""Battlestar Galactica"" has that effect in its current form, notwithstanding the ferocious rumbling noises that have been added to its soundtrack. Everyone involved seems to have worked so carefully and expensively at aping ""Star Wars"" that the humor has been lost, and so has the sense of fun. The only real additions to the ""Star Wars"" format, in fact, are a couple of ill-advised romantic subplots and a little boy with a fuzzy robot that has taken the place of his lost dog.""Battlestar Galactica"" was produced by John Dykstra, who was responsible for a lot of the special effects in ""Star Wars,"" and the technical aspects of the program are accordingly impressive. There's even one new gimmick, a woman character with two mouths and four eyes. But the other effects, no matter how well executed, simply don't have the impact they did when they were new. If you've seen one ship chase another around the block in outer space, you've seen 'em all.""Bttlestar Galactica"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,"Screen: 'Death of a Bureaucrat, 'Gutierrez Alea's Cuban Comedy:The Tape Is Red","RED tape can strangle a society more efficiently than even the wiliest revolutionaries or, as the case may be, the wiliest counter-revolutionaries. Forced to deal with the pomp, ceremony, protocol, forms, fine print and contradictory instructions of their bureaucracy, citizens first seethe with anger and then they may simply give up in frustration. There are times when a lost rubber stamp is mightier than the sword.This is the underlying theme of Tomas Gutierrez Alea's quirky, high-spirited Cuban comedy. ""Death of a Bureaucrat,"" which opens today at the Cinema Studio. The film, made in 1966, two years before his extraordinary ""Memories of Underdevelopment,"" is as much a movie maker's movie as it is a social satire. Mr. Gutierrez Alea happily helps himself (and us) to the styles of all sorts of film comedians, including those of Chaplin, the Keystone Kops and Laurel and Hardy, as he tells the tale of the good-natured, none-too-bright young man who attempts to come to the aid of his recently bereaved aunt.The woman's husband, having been an ""exemplary worker,"" was buried with all sorts of honors and tributes. Among his achievements he invented a Rube Goldberg type of machine to mass-produce busts of the hero, Jos Martin, but he was accidently caught in the machine's gears, This ""poor man's Michelangelo"" (as he's called) was also buried with his union card, which the widow needs if she is to obtain the pension that is due her.The nephew's problem is that be cannot obtain an exhumation permit for two years and then, after he has stolen the body from the cemetery, he can't obtain a permit to rebury the corpse until he obtains the exhumation permit. As the poor man goes from office to office, meeting with every conceivable type of indifference, sloppiness and self-importance, his adventures lead to a final, fatal but highly satisfying confrontation.Slapstick comedy is not the form that Mr. Gutierrez Alea is most at home in. Indeed, with the exception of Jacques Tati and Blake Edwards, there are few directors who understand the graceful mechanics by which slapstick comedy operates. Yet Mr. Gutierrez Alea has managed with remarkable skill to concoct a comedy whose lunatic fun absorbs the outrage.At one point there is a superbly wild custard pie-and-flowers battle at the cemetery, which begins when the irate cemetery officials start to dismantle (Laurel and Hardy style, or is it Edgar Kennedy?) the hearse of the undertaker who wants to rebury the corpse without the proper forms. How the custard pies find their way into the fracas I'm not sure, but they are beautifully splattered over landscape and people. Harold Lloyd is recalled when the nephew finds himself locked into a government office after closing time and, to escape, must climb out a window onto a narrow ledge in front of a large clock high above the street.The pace of the comedy is erratic. Like the uncle's bust-manufacturing machine, it moves in fits and starts, but at its best it is most satisfying. Salvador Wood is very funny and straight as the nephew and Silvia Planas is a model of patient grief as the widow who becomes resigned to keeping the corpse at home, preserved as best it can be with ice borrowed from the neighbors.Even when the comedy is strained, ""Death of a Bureaucrat"" should work on the gut responses of anyone who has ever stood in lines at bureaus dealing in driver's licenses, rent control, gas, water, electricity or  perish the thought  complaints. I also find irresistible any movie that contains a banana peel that gets stepped on.",1979-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Hanover Street,' a Love Story:Romantic Mixed Nuts","EVERY now and then a film comes along of such painstaking, overripe foolishness that it breaks through the garbage barrier to become one of those rare movies you rush to see for laughs. What Peter Hyams has achieved with ""Hanover Street,"" his new film about a wartime romance set in the London of 1943, is a movie that is almost as funny as Woody Allen's ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" which, if you remember, was a straight-faced Japanese spy picture that Woody took over and dubbed with a hilariously knuckle-brained English-language soundtrack. The clichs were everywhere, but always just slightly out of place and inappropriate.This pretty much describes the unfortunate method of ""Hanover Street,"" which looks as if Mr. Hyams had studied every popular romantic drama, from ""A Farewell to Arms"" to ""Love Affair"" and ""Love Story,"" and then, when he left the screening room, had been hit on the head with a brick. When he woke up he remembered bits and pieces of things he'd seen but his judgment had fled.""Hanover Street,"" which opens today at the Loew's State 2 and Tower East Theaters, starts being funny with the opening credits, which are set against a vista of fleecy white clouds and a soundtrack full of John Barry's music so heavenly we suspect we might be dead. But no. As the camera pans down we realize that we've been suspended over London's Hanover Street, an elaborate studio set full of carefully simulated Georgian buildings, a lovely Wren-ish church at the far end, and lots of extras looking like a wartime populace.It's here, late one afternoon, that handsome, debonaire David Halloran (Harrison Ford), an American bomber pilot on his day off from bombing Germans, and classy Margaret Sellinger (Lesley-Anne Down), a young woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a Red Cross uniform, meet when they both run for the same bus. Before you know it, they're having tea in a nearby tea-shop and he's saying such things as, ""Who are you and what are you?"" and she's being mysterious.David: ""Tell me your name.""Margaret: ""I can't.""David: ""Please.""Margaret: ""No.""David: ""I'll call you Fred.""Whatever he calls her, it's love, love, love. Does Margaret have a fatal disease? A police record? Amnesia? We soon learn the truth. She's married, and not only married but happily married, to upright, honoborable Paul Sellinger (Christopher Plummer), a British intelligence officer. She's also a mummy to Sarah Sellinger (Patsy Kensit), an eight-year-old of such sweet precocity we want to ship her off to the coal mines for a vacation.""Hanover Street"" is the hysterically unconvincing story of the clandestine affair of David and Margaret who, once a week, make love in quaint little country inns in scenes of lap-dissolve close-ups shot so near to the flesh that we might well be back watching Streisand and Kristofferson in ""A Star is Born."" Only the music is different (it's worse).A program note, contained in the movie's publicity kit, solemnly declares that ""cameras played an important part in the filming of 'Hanover Street.'"" Like many other directors Mr. Hyams believes (mistakenly, I think) that the closer the camera gets to a subject, the more important the subject becomes. Close-ups, though, are to movies what too many adjectives and adverbs are to prose. Instead of clarifying meaning, they soften it with fancy pretentions.Not that there's much meaning to soften in ""Hanover Street."" The middle of the movie sort of vamps for time as if waiting for the next page of the script to arrive. It cross-cuts among montages that show (1) David and Margaret driving through the countryside en route to their rendezvous, (2) David flying through flak over occupied France, and (3) upright, honorable Paul Sellinger confronting a knotty intelligence problem that eventually results in his and David's going off on a mission into occupied France.Two men, each of a different backgrounds and outlook but each in his way true to his code, facing death together and not knowing they love the same woman! I would love to read the minutes of the story conference that accepted that one. They might even be funnier than the movie.It's going to be interesting to see how the public responds to ""Hanover Street."" To me it looks like a movie that underestimates its public and spares no expense doing it. Such nonsense, spread on so thickly, seems essentially cynical. I can't believe that anyone connected with the picture, from Mr. Hyams, who wrote as well as directed it, to the actors, didn't know they were involved in a con job.I've no idea whether the film will do anything for Mr. Ford's screen popularity. He's more of a comic-strip character here than he was in ""Star Wars,"" which was a live-action cartoon. Miss Down is sublimely scenic. Alec McCowen, one of the better actors in the English theater, spends what time he has on the screen fiddling with a pipe.In his last movie, ""Capricorn One,"" which was about a faked space mission, Mr. Hyams was exposing fraud. In ""Hanover Street,"" he's practicing it.""Hanover Street,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), contains the aforementioned love scenes and some rude language.",1979-05-18T05:00:00+0000

""Winter Kills"" isn't exactly a comedy, but it's funny. And it isn't exactly serious, but it takes on the serious business of the Kennedy assassination. That's why other ads for the film have been comparing it to ""Dr. Strange-love"" and ""M*A*S*H."" They don't do the trick, either.This isn't a social satireit's more like a movie with spring fever. It doesn't make a bit of sense, but it's fast and handsome and entertaining, bursting with a crazy vitality all its own. Sitting back and watching it doesn't seem the proper response, somehow. Chasing it with a butterfly net might be closer to the mark.The ideahold onto your hat, please  is that Jeff Bridges is the half-brother of a young President who was assassinated 19 years ago, and that their father, played by John Huston, is the richest, most powerful, and most merrily depraved man in America. Suddenly, new evidence about an extra marksman, a previously unknown assassin, falls into the half-brother's hands. He decides to conduct his own investigation. The first stop is a wig factory.He meets mobsters. He wonders about the Central Intelligence Agency. He follows the trail of a Jack Ruby type (Eli Wallach) with connections in Cuba. He falls in love with a gorgeous young magazine editor (Belinda Bauer), who is of course not a magazine editor but a gorgeous spy, and who is said to have been a former mistress of his late brother's. She would have been about three years old at the time. However, ""Winter Kills"" has so many other screws loose that by the time this curious fact comes to light, it's small potatoes.William Richert, who makes his directorial debut and also adapted the screenplay from Richard Condon's novel, flirts with the notion that the way to hold power in America is to master the art of giving others the runaround. In line with this, Mr. Bridges is indeed run ragged before winding up right back where he started.This point has been both examined and illustrated more effectively in other American movies  ""All the President's Men"" and ""The Parallax View,"" both by Alan Pakula, come to mind. But that hardly matters, because Mr. Richert seems to care very little about narrative strength or clarity. Instead, he writes crisp, brittle dialogue that packs a lot of information into clipped sentences and also packs quite a wallop. His direction, equally economical in its way, is riveting even when it concentrates on the irrelevant. One sequence, for instance, has Mr. Bridges leaping onto a horse and galloping to the top of a mountain just so he can shout to the heavens ""You stink, Daddy,"" or words to that effect. But what a mountain! And what a breathless race! And what a memorable moment, even if the thing it does most successfully is to recall ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (Maurice Jarre wrote the music for both films). That's no minor accomplishment.In addition to being a shining example of the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond, ""Winter Kills"" is a lavish, globe-trotting movie with a large and distinguished cast. (It has to be a large cast, since people Mr. Bridges meets have a way of being bumped off soon thereafter.) Sterling Hayden plays a zillionaire rancher who chases Mr. Bridges off his territory in a tank. Dorothy Malone is Mr. Bridges's nutty mother, who weeps about the ill health of her little dog and then smothers the creature in his sleep. Anthony Perkins is about as eerie as he's ever been; he and Richard Boone are particularly delightful. Toshiro Mifune has about three lines, not enough to establish whether he's supposed to be Mr. Huston's business associate or valet or houseboy.Mr. Bridges and Mr. Huston have roles that are just about unplayable, since you have to believe the screenplay's nonsense in its entirety in order to accept their characters at all. Still, Mr. Huston is commendably jolly, and Mr. Bridges is so amiable he can make an audience follow him anywhere, even to the end of the world's woolliest shaggy-dog story. I'm still not exactly sure who did what to whom, but it all has something to do with Elizabeth Taylor. Who makes an uncredited, non-speaking cameo appearance. And mouths only one word, not a very nice one. And plays the President's procuress. And is by no means the most farfetched creature this movie has to offer. Really.",1979-05-18T05:00:00+0000

That's how the Rangers reached the finals  by outworking the New York Islanders, as Al Arbour, the Islander coach, acknowledged. But in the cup finals against the Canadiens, the Rangers seem to have misplaced their intensity. Not that they're loafing. They're working. But the Canadiens are working harder.

But how quickly they had to move toward that goal was left to the Department of Transportation. Secretary Brock Adams decided to increase mileage requirements rapidly in the early 1980's, and then ease on to 27.5 by 1985: The average now stands at 19 miles a gal lon. But Detroit is asking for a break  appealing directly to the President last week for a slower, steadier climb to 1985. Such a pace, the manufacturers assert, would save billions in development costs and, for ailing Chrysler, might even make the difference between survival and financial collapse.",1979-05-23T05:00:00+0000

Two minutes earlier, Phil Esposito's goal gave the Rangers a 32 lead. If they could hold it, the fourofsevengame series would be tied at 22. But now the mo ment occurred. Digging for the puck, Bob Gainey of the Montreal Canadiens crashed into Dave Maloney, the Ranger defenseman, along the boards in the corner to the left of the Ranger net. Leaving the Ranger captain for dead on the ice, Bob Gainey emerged with the puck, skated out unchecked to within about 20 feet of John Davidson and lifted it past the goaltender for the tying goal. Eventually the Canadiens won in overtime, 43, for a 31 lead in the series, and Monday night they celebrated their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup championship with a 41 victory that their Forum parishoners had demanded. But the Stanley Cup final had turned on Bob Gainey's timecapsule goal that somehow symbolized why the Rangers were wiped out in four straight after having won the opener: Their defensemen were too young and too light.",1979-05-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Alien 'Brings Chills From the Far Galaxy:A Gothic Set in Space,"A GIGANTIC construction moves serenely through space where, though the night never ends, there's always enough light to see strange objects. This one looks like the main set of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance."" It's as if Babylon had been cut loose from earth to sail back through space to its own time. In actual fact, it's the cargo-ship Nostromo on its return to earth at the end of an extended voyage to the far end of the galaxy.When we go inside, the ship appears to have been as suddenly deserted as the Marie Celeste. We wander down empty corridors into abandoned living quarters, into engine rooms and, finally, into the command room where the computers are the only signs of life. The interior of the ship is vast. It contains the kind of waste space one seldom sees anymore except in some rare old Manhattan pile like the Dakota. Something decidedly eerie is going on.Thus  familiarly but with immense promise  begins ""Alien,"" Ridley Scott's new, elaborately produced science-fiction film that opens today at the Criterion and other theaters. However, as this voyage continues, familiarity consumes the promise and leaves as residue the memory of some shrieks from shocks of a most mundane kind.The crew of the Nostromo has not vanished. They are merely sleeping the time away and, shortly after the opening credits, they come forth from their sleep-pods to prepare for their re-entry into the earth's orbit. It's then that they encounter peculiar signals from the wreck of another space ship, one from another galaxy and one which has crashed onto an uncharted planetoid. The Nostromo stops to investigate, locates the craft and, when it takes off again for earth, it carries aboard a specimen of alien life, a small, octopus-like blob that won't stop growing and  possibly worse  is ""unclouded by conscience or delusions of morality.""That's about all one should or can say about the story originally conceived by Dan O'Bannon and turned into a screenplay by him and Ronald Shusett.""Alien"" is an extremely small, rather decent movie of its modest kind, set inside a large, extremely fancy physical production. Don't race to it expecting the wit of ""Star Wars"" or the metaphysical pretentions of ""2001"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" At its best it recalls ""The Thing,"" though the Howard Hawks film was both more imaginatively and more economically dramatized.It's an old-fashioned scare movie about something that is not only implacably evil but prone to jumping out at you when (the movie hopes) you least expect it. There was once a time when this sort of thing was set in an old dark house, on a moor, in a thunderstorm. Being trendy, Mr. Scott and his associates have sent it up in space.As he demonstrated with ""The Duellists,"" his first feature, Mr. Scott is a very stylish director. Though ""Alien"" is not the seminal science-fiction film one wants from him, it's executed with a good deal of no-nonsense verve. The members of the small cast are uniformly good though, with two exception, the roles might have been written by a computor.Sigourney Weaver is impressive and funny as the Nostromo's executive officer, the second in command, a young woman who manages to act tough, efficient and sexy all at the same time. Ian Holm is also excellent as the ship's science officer, a man with a secret that will set him apart from everyone else forever.Other members of the crew are played by Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright, the actress who was so good in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" She plays a somewhat similar role here, one that requires her to weep a lot and leaves her so red-eyed and red-nosed that she may be in danger of becoming the Isable Jewell of the living-color space-age.""Alien's"" sets and special effects are well done, but these things no longer surprise or tantalize us as they once did. In a very short time, science-fiction films have developed their own jargon that's now become a part of the grammar of film. You know the sort of stuff I mean  the shots of blinking instrument panels, of wildly bleeping computers, of cryptic messages clattering in square type-faces across televisio screens. There's also the obligatory shot of that huge space vehicle early on in every film. It appears from over our right shoulder, passes over our head and then proceeds slowly and majestically toward the far distance at screen-left. When I first saw it in ""2001,"" it was awesome. Now it makes me feel like a turtle on a busy though unnaturally quiet highway.",1979-05-25T05:00:00+0000

At the beginning of ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,"" which is about as far ""beyond"" the original as a snail can skip, we see the hull of the capsized ocean liner as a tugboat approaches, hoping to salvage whatever loot was on board. There is also a medical vessel, commanded by Telly Savalas, who is pretending to offer first aid but is in fact an archcrook. Are there any survivors of the wreck? If so, they've either been rescued already or they're sleeping with the fishes. Nobody cares.Almost all of the action in ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,"" which opens today at the Cinerama I and neighborhood theaters, takes place inside the dark, unsightly remains of the damaged vessel. This is almost as disastrous as whatever first hit the ""Poseidon,"" or ignited that skyscraper in Irwin Allen's ""The Towering Inferno,"" or made the bees lose their little winged tempers in Mr. Allen's ""The Swarm.""Mr. Allen, who directed ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" and produced it too, is so obviously ill-equipped to stage action scenes in cramped quarters that his audience winds up wishing as fervently as his characters for a chance to see the light of day.It turns out there are survivors. A blind man (Jack Warden). His kindly wife (Shirley Knight). A nurse (Shirley Jones). A father in a pink ruffled shirt (Peter Boyle) and his daughter in a yellow ruffled dress (Angela Cartwright). A phony Texan (the late Chill Wills). Plus a couple of others, all of whom make silly, romantic plans about what they will do if they ever get out, and all of whom are discovered by the tugboat crew. This consists of Karl Malden, Michael Caine and Sally Field.Mr. Allen's one undeniable talent is for attracting actors you'd love to see doing just about anything else. Mr. Boyle fares better than the others, perhaps because he hollers loudest, but no one really survives the indignities of Nelson Gidding's screenplay. Some day, perhaps Mr. Caine  blandly heroic here, but interesting anyway  and the indomitable Miss Field will have a chance to make a real movie together. But for the meanwhile, it's sink rather than swim.When last seen, the ""Poseidon"" had been blown into small pieces. With any luck, this means Mr. Allen can't possibly make a threequel.""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

This time I needn't have been so fastidious. There's no easy way to forget a comedy as glumly coy and out-of-touch with everything as ""The Toy."" It may not be the worst movie of all time, but when you watch it, it seems that way, which is the same thing.The movie, which opens today at the Paris Theater, stars Pierre Richard (""The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe""), who looks like a sort of straightened-out Harpo Marx, as a magazine reporter who works for a tight-lipped, tyrannical publishing tycoon played by Michel Bouquet. One day the tycoon's small, bratty son, who's been told he can have any toy in a large department store (also owned by his father), sees Mr. Richard and demands to have the fellow wrapped up and sent home as his playmate.The rest of the movie alternates between a series of uninspired slapstick gags, in which ""the toy"" attempts to obtain his freedom, and a series of supposedly serious scenes in which Mr. Richard teaches the child some respect for life, limb and other people's feelings.Mr. Richard mugs unfunnily from beginning to end and Fabrice Greco plays the overbearing child with awful convinction. Mr. Bouquet, one of the most urbane and witty of French character actors (""La Femme Infidele,"" ""Mississippi Mermaid,"" among others), suggests a degree of furious monomania that is supported by nothing else is this flimsiest of pictures.Mr. Veber, credited as one of the authors of the current ""La Cage aux Folles,"" both wrote and directed ""The Toy.""",1979-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Sellers in New 'Zenda':A Comic Version,"PETER SELLERS is the only real reason to see ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" which opens today in a new, comic version at the Ziegfeld Theater. But as reasons go, Peter Sellers is an awfully good one. The film that has been constructed around him has its share of dead air, and every time the emphasis turns to derring-do, the director, Richard Quine, seems well over his head. But when Mr. Sellers appears, playing either one of the two characters he tackles here, the film really does come to life, and not simply for its humor. Here, as in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" Mr. Sellers is dividing his energies between a serious character and a funny one. And the serious performance is, in many ways, the more remarkable of the two.Actually, ""two"" isn't accurate  for a few brief moments at the film's opening, Mr. Sellers plays a third fellow who dies after uncorking a bottle of champagne while riding in a hot air balloon. (The cork punctures the fabric, of course.) Then he becomes both the King of Ruritania, who behaves like a marvelously effete English playboy with yet another of Mr. Sellers's superb speech defects, and a Cockney cab-driver who is absolutely deadpan.For anyone unfamiliar with the first several-screen versions of ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" or even with the book, these two lookalikes are forced by considerations of Ruritanian politics to chance places. The Cockney falls in love with the real King's fiance (Lynne Frederick), who hates the real King but must marry him. (Her country's economy depends on the Ruritanian potato supply.) Complications ensue, and so do some intermittent but genuinely funny gags. There is a hackneyed jealous-husband routine that works better than it ought to, and one swashbuckler's entire speaking part seems to consists of hearty ha-ha-ha's. In one sequence, Mr. Sellers and Catherine Schell wind up trading chicken calls with several sets of villains and one authentic owl.Mr. Sellers is onscreen with himself surprisingly often, and the effect never looks trumped-up. He performs a perfect balancing act, orchestrated so well that the funny character makes the serious one even more effective, and vice versa.""The Prisoner of Zenda"" doesn't have the kind of finesse that Blake Edwards's direction has given the ""Pink Panther"" series. But the slack moments are painless enough, and they come as a fair exchange for the pleasure of Mr. Seller's artfully schhizoid company.""The Prisoner of Zenda"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains minimal violence and a subplot that involves marital infidelity.",1979-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: 'Newsfront, 'Mood of the 50's:Ambitious Australian","""NEWSFRONT,"" which opens at Cinema II today, is a gentle, mannerly Australian film that fully realizes its ambitions, which are intriguing though small. The young director Phillip Noyce has used carefully selected vintage newsreel footage as a way of exploring the personal and professional ethics of a time that is long gone, yet not so far away. One of the minor miracles of ""Newsfront"" is its synthesis of present and past, its way of introducing modern moral dilemmas without rupturing a perfectly realized mood of the early 1950's. Even when it is most thoroughly immersed in period details, ""Newsfront"" is too mindful of the present to feel like nostalgia.Artfully integrating old newsreels into a story about a crew of film makers who supposedly shot, edited and took enormous pride in them, Mr. Noyce has structured ""Newsfront"" like a scrapbook. Key occurrences are represented, both large and small: the events the film crew covered, the changing fortunes of the company that employed them, the different ways one man regards his wife from one year to the next. The transitions are missing, and somehow that makes the material all the more fascinating. In imitation of his characters, Mr. Noyce records things without trying to explain them. The audience is left to contemplate the permanence and elusiveness of change.Although it features a large, fond, boisterous bunch of friends who spend as much time together after hours as on the job, the film focuses sketchily on one man, Len Maguire (Bill Hunter), to whom stability is tremendously important. A fatherly looking figure of indeterminate age, Maguire functions as an anchor to the other, more headstrong members of the group, and yet not even he has much he can truly count on.A devout Catholic and a profoundly decent man, he nevertheless sees his marriage fall upon hard times. He watches the newsreel industry, to which he has devoted his entire professional life, disintegrate with the advent of television. And in one of the film's most touching and beautifully orchestrated sequences, combining new material by Mr. Noyce with the grim newsreel records of a terrible flood, he sees a favored protg die in pursuit of a story. Perhaps inevitably, the news of this young man's death is later emblazoned on posters at the newsreel theater, where a far too stentatious sign invites donations for the widow.The film makers who appear in ""Newsfront"" aren't much above turning anything into a light-hearted story; that, after all, is the curious trick of their trade. Mr. Noyce has wittily selected footage of Chico Marx singing ""Waltzing Matilda"" on a visit to Australia, a politician making a speech as flies converge on his face, a dog who croons hideously when his master plays the piano, and many other testimonials to the silliness that newsreels often celebrated. This works as a fine, stark contrast with the characters behind the camera, who manage to be serious, imaginative, and intelligently interested in what they do.A number of love affairs animate ""Newsfront,"" which would be lively and charming even without them. But to the extent that the film is romantic, its passions go beyond the vicissitudes of individual lovers. Bustling with excellent but not conventionally glamorous players (Wendy Hughes and Angela Punch are radiant exceptions), and polished but in no way slick, ""Newsfront"" embraces the end of an era just as knowingly as it revels in more promising times. There's something attractively rueful about its even-handedness and its scope.",1979-05-30T05:00:00+0000
