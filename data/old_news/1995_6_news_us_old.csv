The grim icing: the Government's leading indicators posted their third straight decline, which is often taken as a sign that recession lurks in six to nine months. But most private forecasters -- and the Clinton Administration -- aren't buying it; they insist the slowdown is likely to stop short of actual contraction. The Labor Department report did show that the unemployment rate inched down to 5.7 percent from 5.8, but that was seen as largely a statistical quirk as millions of students and teachers surged out of classrooms but had not started looking for summer work. One thing seems increasingly likely, though: that the Fed will loosen the screws a bit, perhaps by July 6. [Page 1.]",1995-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Accuser,"ZOLA A Life. By Frederick Brown. Illustrated. 888 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $37.50. WE revere Zola as we revere Voltaire and Solzhenitsyn, as a great artist who paid the penalty in exile for having presumed to raise the moral consciousness of his nation. But he is a more unlikely hero than the other two. Seemingly distracted behind pince-nez in the later photographs, he looks as though he had blundered into the Dreyfus affair unawares. We recognize the Voltaire of ""Candide"" or the Solzhenitsyn of ""Cancer Ward"" in the champions of the martyrs of religious persecution or the victims of the gulag. There is little even in Zola's most pointedly political novel, ""Germinal,"" to suggest that he would one day take on the French military establishment single-handed, defend a Jewish officer falsely accused of espionage and in doing so knowingly court the risk of criminal proceedings for defamation of the army. It occurred to Henry James, who met the young Zola twice, first through his mentor Flaubert and then years later in London when he was the guest of the Lord Mayor, that it was as if ""nothing had happened to him in life but to write 'Les Rougon-Macquart.' "" The later championing of Dreyfus, James felt, was ""the act of a man with arrears of personal history to make up . . . treating itself at last to a luxury of experience.""

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION;Late Bloomer,"Most museumgoers know Odilon Redon (1840-1916) for his vivid, glowing and often otherworldly oil paintings and pastels of flowers. His artistic career was slow in developing because of what he called his ""painful origins"" -- a troubled bourgeois family in which he felt himself to be an outsider. For most of his career, Redon worked almost exclusively in black and white. Among the best known of his images is the surreal ""Eye-Balloon,"" which depicts a floating balloon in the form of a gigantic eye. Because he often used literature as a springboard, illustrating texts by Poe, Baudelaire and Flaubert, among others, Redon was frequently aligned with the Symbolists, a connection he later tried to shrug off with flower paintings and commissioned decorative screens. Redon turned to color in the last two decades of his life, the period in which he realized his greatest professional success and personal happiness. ODILON REDON: Prince of Dreams, 1840-1916 (Abrams, cloth, $60; paper, $35) is an exhaustive look at the life and work of the painter, lavishly illustrated with more than 500 reproductions (200 of which are in color), with biographical and critical essays by a team of scholars under the leadership of Douglas W. Druick, a curator at the Art Institute of Chicago; Fred Leeman, the chief curator of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam; and MaryAnne Stevens, the head of education at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. The only drawback is the unfortunate choice to divide the text into 12 essays, which often makes for a tiresome redundancy. Otherwise, Redon and his admirers are very well served.

us,Family Fare? It Depends on the Beholder,"IN HIS RECENT SPEECH ATTACKING the entertainment industry for contributing to moral decay in America, Senator Robert Dole identified what he regarded as films ""friendly to families"" (his list included ""The Lion King,"" ""True Lies"" and ""Forrest Gump"") and those he considered ""nightmares of depravity"" (""Natural Born Killers"" and ""True Romance""). To see how widely shared his choices were, The New York Times asked eight people concerned with cultural issues what films they would place in these categories and why. Here are their choices. BARBARA GRIZZUTI HARRISON Essayist Friendly to Families ""Boyz N the Hood"" Yes, it's violent; the world is violent. But it says much more about a father's love for his son than most Hollywood mush. ""The Godfather"" Come on, wouldn't you want to be snuggled in the embrace of a powerful family? Nightmares of Depravity ""The Godfather, Part II"" and ""The Godfather, Part III"" Uh, oh, they bump each other off. They're not nice. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" It's a terrible lie. Only profound cynicism could have produced this soupy sentimentalism. It will corrupt your children's morals. EDWARD SOREL Cartoonist Friendly to Families ""The Maltese Falcon"" Sam Spade, a good role model for today's youth, promises Brigid that he'll wait for her while she gains maturity in a maximum-security institution. ""Deep Throat"" An inspiring story of a woman with a physical handicap who nevertheless becomes a useful member of society. ""Triumph of the Will"" When men are not impeded from their God-given right to carry guns, cleanliness and happiness follow. Nightmares of Depravity ""Mary Poppins"" The heroine is a governess who uses trickery to get her job. ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" Just when there is a need for films about safety precautions in the home, Disney gives us this. ANDREW SULLIVAN Editor, The New Republic Friendly to Families ""Crimson Tide"" Superb moralistic drama in which the rule of law is contrasted with the rule of man. Aristotle couldn't have taught this instructive lesson any better. ""Priest"" Sincere Roman Catholic cleric fails to be celibate but abides by confessional confidentiality, and by divine intervention incest is uncovered. Didactic but effective exploration of family values. ""Quiz Show"" Middlebrow morality tale in which telling the truth is the ultimate indicator of character. Nightmares of Depravity ""Home Alone"" Delinquent parents lose a child, who proceeds to wreak revenge by graphically mutilating new companions. The child takes sadistic pleasure in inflicting hideous pain and is deemed a hero. ""J. F. K."" Propagandistic, nihilist, dishonest, paranoid and unpatriotic. Hard to say which characteristic kiddies should be told to avoid most. VICTOR NAVASKY Publisher and editorial director, The Nation Friendly to Families ""The Grapes of Wrath"" A family beset with the woes brought upon by the Depression sets forth against every kind of adversity and gets closer by fighting the system. ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" Jimmy Stewart takes on the system with the help of a woman he is going to marry, as well as his mother and those boys all over America who see him as a model. ""Natural Born Killers"" Oliver Stone takes the television-sitcom view of the family to its logical conclusion and shows that it has no relation to real family values. Nightmares of Depravity ""True Lies"" I haven't seen ""True Lies,"" but neither has Dole. From what I understand, it's full of violence. And especially if you're an Arab, it's very anti-family values, since Arabs get killed by the bushel. ""Hamlet"" The guy kills his uncle and all that, but I think Hamlet can go in either category. He loves his mother a lot, which suggests to me that the anti-family category is an unsatisfactory one. BARBARA EHRENREICH Essayist Friendly to Families ""Dolores Claiborne"" Edifying because it shows a woman cleverly disposing of her abusive husband, and it ends with the woman and her daughter drawing closer together. ""Braveheart"" It portrays my Scottish ancestors more accurately than usual. It shows them with uncombed hair and dirty fingernails, living in windowless huts. A little humility is good in any family lineage. Nightmares of Depravity ""Legends of the Fall"" Sons disobey their father and fight in a senseless war, and one becomes a corrupt politician. Furthermore, it tries to portray families without women. ""Mr. Mom"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" Movies in this tradition portray either a motherless family or an absent, career-driven mom. KATHRYN HARRISON Novelist Friendly to Families ""A Woman Under the Influence"" It portrays real heroism in the daily struggle to maintain a family. The mother is troubled, possibly mentally ill or an alcoholic, and you see that family reflects a delicate balance. ""Ladybird, Ladybird"" Completely unsentimental portrayal of a woman struggling against forces that are huge. The effort to maintain a family is very affecting. ""Tender Mercies"" An honest movie that suggests redemption is possible. You can make bad mistakes and you can't undo them, but it's possible to keep a family together. Nightmares of Depravity ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" Mindless trivialization of social ills like homelessness and anorexia. Even the dog has an eating disorder. ""Dumb and Dumber"" American society is not only suspicious of intellectualism, but now we have movies that glorify imbecility. MICHAEL LERNER Editor of Tikkun magazine Friendly to Families ""Schindler's List"" It encourages a sense of trust in others and the possibility of goodness triumphing over self-interest. ""Panther"" It encourages people to believe that narrow self-interest, in this case a drug-oriented and self-indulgent culture, can be transcended by commitment to a community. ""The Piano"" A vision of the possibility of overcoming chauvinism, transcending a sexist relationship and a woman finding her own power. Nightmares of Depravity ""Rambo"" Perfectly depraved. It takes the individual seeking to break all the rules to establish a higher truth, without regard to the consequences of others and with unrestricted use of violence. ""Pulp Fiction"" A popular movie among people who think of themselves as hip because it's self-reflective about its own violence. It makes it easier to live in the world of Bosnia and right-wing militias. PAUL RUDNICK Playwright Friendly to Families ""Mommie Dearest"" The title alone bespeaks a return to traditional values and happier homes. At last, a film that showcases a celebrity as a concerned parent and a firm disciplinarian. ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"" Senator Dole rightly cited the Republican stalwart Arnold Schwarzenegger as a family asset. In the first ""Terminator"" film, Arnold was an evil robot from the future, but in the sequel he was a good robot from the future. Bob Dole is, of course, a good robot from the past. ""Basic Instinct"" Some viewers may find intimate conversations a bit embarrassing, so sometimes it's advisable just to pile the kids into the Bronco, head for a Sharon Stone movie and point. Nightmares of Depravity ""Beethoven"" As prophesied in Leviticus, Satan always appears in earthly guise as either a big, sloppy, huggable sheepdog, an endangered whale or Shirley MacLaine in character parts. ""The Lion King"" As Senator Dole has indicated, American pop culture can be all too influential. This led to tragedy when after watching a cassette of this Disney hit, my 6-year-old nephew was taken to the zoo, where he crawled into a cage and was mauled when he tried to force a lion cub to hula.",1995-06-11T05:00:00+0000

The oldest old remain a tiny percentage of Americans over all, but their numbers are climbing at a swifter clip than those of any other age group. And while centenarians seem such rare, unearthly creatures that Rose Kennedy's survival to age 104 was considered as remarkable as her political legacy, and the story of the 100-plus Delany Sisters was deemed worthy of a Broadway play, ""Having Our Say,"" in fact this most tenacious group is growing even faster than the oldest old overall. .",1995-06-11T05:00:00+0000

For these measures to beome law, the Legislature would have to approve them before the session ends in January. NO CHARGE -- Senator Joseph L. Bubba, a Republican, is the sponsor of a bill that would guarantee that drivers won't have to pay a quarter to put air in their tires at the service station; presumably the same would apply to children on bikes. NAMING REST STOPS -- A bill would require rest stops on state highways to be named for state troopers killed in the line of duty. Had it been enacted this year, Governor Whitman might have avoided the fuss that erupted after she named a rest stop after Howard Stern. ROADSIDE MEMORIALS -- Some members of the Legislature want to put signs along state highways as memorials to people killed in accidents caused by drunken drivers. The signs would be placed close to the site of the accident and would warn against drinking and driving. SPECIAL PLATES -- Think you've seen every special license plate imaginable? There are 38 bills pending that would allow new plate designations for everything from the Great Falls in Passaic to shade trees and forests. LIGHTS ON -- Under a bill sponsored by Assemblywoman Clare M. Farragher, a Republican, and known as the Dead Battery Bill, drivers would be required to keep their headlights on at all times. The current requirement is for drivers to use their headlights from 30 minutes before sunset until 30 minutes after sunrise. BIKE TO THE TRAIN -- An Assembly bill would require New Jersey Transit to provide space on trains to store the bicycle, except during rush hours. The catch is, they could charge a fee for the storage. HELMETS -- Those whose wheels are limited to skateboards and Rollerblades would not be free from the watchful eye of the Legislature. A bill sponsored by Assemblyman John V. Kelly, a Republican, would require anyone under 18 to wear a helmet, knee pads, elbow pads, and wrist and palm guards. The bill also would require bicyclists under the age of 18 to wear helmets; currently, anyone under 14 must wear a helmet. KAREN DEMASTERS",1995-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,DIARY,"Technology It Felt so Good to Be No. 1 That loud noise you heard last week came from an unlikely source: I.B.M. The computer giant made a very out-of-character hostile bid to acquire the Lotus Development Company for $3.3 billion. Lotus had received previous buyout overtures, but I.B.M. cleared the table with its offer, pretty much announcing that despite its staid image, it too can play hard ball in a competitive world. I.B.M., you may recall, used to be the top seller of personal computers, but no more. Lotus was tops in the spreadsheet market, but no more. But Lotus is No. 1 with Lotus Notes, its networking software, and that's what has brought I.B.M. to the door. First place, I.B.M. figures, is the only place to be. Wall Street Happy Days Are Here Again Hostile takeovers. Kind of gives you the warm and fuzzies about the grand old '80's. It turns out that some investors aren't just settling for that warm glow, but are trying to grab all they can get, or at least get away with. The S.E.C. says it is investigating as many insider trading cases now as it did since the 1980's. As one offical put it, ""It's a growth industry."" It got bigger last week. Lotus stock jumped 89 percent on Monday after I.B.M. announced its bid. The thing is, some of the people who owned the stock, or its options, had just bought on the Friday before. Very insightful. Or very illegal, depending on the quality of your lawyer. Wasn't there something else that made the 1980's so grand? Oh, yes. Many of the insider traders were caught. Brewing More Than a Deal Over Beer The Belgian brewer Interbrew agreed last week to buy the Canadian brewing company, John Labatt, for $2.9 billion. Labatt had been fighting a hostile offer from the Onex Corporation since last month and had talked to several brewing companies about making a friendly offer. Interbrew got the nod. But the deal is for more than just beer. Although Labatt is Canada's second-largest brewer after the Molson Companies, it has interests in the Sports Network and the Discovery Channel and has stakes in the Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Argonauts and the Skydome stadium in Toronto. Canadian law will force Interbrew to sell the cable channels, but no word yet on what happens to the sports assets. The Brussels Blue Jays does have a nice ring. New York Racing Through the Economy We've heard of economic development zones to spur the economy. We've heard of tax breaks to lure big employers. But can driving faster drive the economy? That's what Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said on Tuesday when he voted to raise the speed limit to 65-miles-per-hour on 1,100 miles of the state's highways. He said the new speed limit, which goes into effect Aug. 1, will help improve the economy and tourism by moving people and goods along more quickly. He presumably meant around the state, not out of it. So, step on it. As a way to generate revenue, it sure beats raising taxes. Unless, of course, it has absolutely no effect. The Workplace It Keeps Going, and Going ... Los Angeles County estimates that the O.J. Simpson trial has cost the county $4,986,167 so far, and it's still going like the Energizer Bunny. That's nothing. An outfit in Chicago reported last week that the trial has cost the United States economy $27.6 billion in lost productivity. The Cambridge Human Resource Group figured that we all spend about five minutes of each work day talking about the trial. The outplacement and career management company arrived at its figure by plugging that five minutes into the gross domestic product. The company did not do the corresponding math of how much we cost our employers by talking about our kids, the NBA playoffs, or even about our cranky bosses, who just love to attach dollar signs to all the time we spend goofing off. The Economy Recession? Big Deal O.K., who let that cold breeze in here? Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, put a bit of a chill on the markets when he told bankers in Seattle on Wednesday that the economy may indeed slip into a recession, but if so, it would be brief. The markets took that to mean that the Fed has no intention of lowering interest rates anytime soon, and pushed both stocks and bonds lower. The Dow industrials spent the rest of the week shedding about 60 points and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped from about 6.50 percent to 6.72 percent. Traders continue to be worried that the slowing economy will squeeze corporte earnings, which will just get worse without a rate cut. Anytime Mr. Greenspan wants to close that window, it would be fine with Wall Street. Entertainment A Divorce Before the Marriage Michael Ovitz is not going to run MCA for its new owner, the Seagram Company, in what must be the biggest surprise to come out of Hollywood since ""The Crying Game."" Surprise plot twists are a mainstay of Holloywood, but few people predicted this one. Hollywood insiders had said that the talks to lure Mr. Ovitz, chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, had gone on for weeks, but fell apart over the issue of money and independence. Usually, if you have a lot of one, you have the other, but Seagram balked at giving away too much of both. No word yet of who will eventually run MCA. The chairman of Seagram, Edgar Bronfman Jr., says he's going to spend time to learn MCA's business before making his next move. Why does that sound so groundbreaking? Employment Get a Job, Pretty Please Low unemployment has its good points, but many areas of the South have managed to find the negatives. Unemployment is so low in many urban areas around the Southeast that some restaurants, hotels and grocery stores cannot find enough workers to fill low-wage jobs. It's easy to figure out what happens then. Employers get needy and those low wages suddenly get higher. Some employers have had to raise wages from 20 to 25 percent and still can't find enough workers. In a bizarre twist, the Opryland Hotel in Nashville has brought in about 300 workers from Puerto Rico and bought a former Quality Inn motel for them to live in. Sometimes, supply and demand work together in very strange ways. Air-Sea Rescue No, He Couldn't Call for Pizza When Capt. Scott O'Grady came out of the Bosnian woods Thursday morning, the downed pilot was gripping his pistol. Holding the gun probably made him feel better, but what saved him was a 28-ounce piece of equipment called the PRC-112, his air-survival radio. He used it to send a signal that told everyone he was still around and used it to direct his rescue. It did everything but cook him dinner. So how do you get one? You can't. It is made by Motorola at its Scottsdale, Ariz., operation exclusively for the military. These radios have been around since the early 1980's and pilots carried them during the Gulf War. A bit bigger than a cellular phone, it operates on a lithium battery and fits nicely into the pocket of a flight suit. In an understatement, a spokesman for Motorola said the folks in Scottsdale were very proud of their role. Maybe the captain will give them a call.",1995-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,In Pursuit of Ben Hogan,"Forty years after he dominated the game and more than a quarter-century since he last played competitively, Ben Hogan remains the iconic embodiment of golf as a sport and as a measure of character. His career -- shortened by war and by devastating injuries from which he recovered apparently stronger than ever -- was drawing to a close just as television began to inflate the sport from a relatively quiet pastime into today's gaudy endorsement-laden spectacle. Yet he continues to exert a unique fascination, both for his accomplishments and for the manner in which he undertook them. At his peak, he was unarguably the best in the game. He won nine major championships -- four United States Opens, two P.G.A. Championships, two Masters and a British Open -- over the eight seasons from 1946 to 1953, a remarkable achievement considering his near-fatal auto accident in 1949. In 1959 (when the 19-year-old Jack Nicklaus won the United States Amateur), Hogan, then 46, entered the Open at the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y. During one of the practice rounds, he caught the attention of Jules Alexander, a photographer and weekend golfer, who fell under the Hawk's spell and stalked him during the tournament, shooting more than 100 photographs. His black-and-white pictures, vivid and rich in detail, are the basis for THE HOGAN MYSTIQUE: Classic Photographs of the Great Ben Hogan (The American Golfer/Triumph, $50). Included are a running commentary by Ken Venturi, the golf analyst and a longtime friend of Hogan's, and essays by Dave Anderson, a sports columnist at The New York Times; Ben Crenshaw, a two-time Masters champion and a historian of the game; and Dan Jenkins, the sportswriter. Although not meant as an instructional text, the book reflects Hogan's technique and shot-making skill throughout. One striking example is a pair of photos of his follow-through on two different shots, both taken at the same angle from behind and at first glance almost identical. Mr. Venturi notes that in one, Hogan's extended, slightly higher finish indicates that he is hitting a fade with a fuller shot; in the other, Hogan's right hand has crossed over, the club face is down and the finish is flatter, indicating that he is playing a draw. The essays are a solid counterpoint to the photographs. ""I have this notion,"" Mr. Jenkins writes, ""that if Ben Hogan . . . had ever worn a green shirt and yellow slacks on a golf course, he couldn't have broken 85.""

We sit in them and smoke. The word ""redemption"" comes up a lot. ""Our words are the only thing that can redeem us,"" a lecturer says from the podium one August morning at 9.

Early versions and deleted chapters can, of course, cast revealing light on the mystery of how a classic came into being, especially when they show the author's aims and intentions at the time of composition. In the case of ""Huckleberry Finn,"" however, there is another book, the rarely read travelogue ""A Tramp Abroad,"" that tells us at least as much about Twain and the way he worked, and perhaps even his intentions, as the lost manuscript. Written and published in the years when he was blocked in his work on the novel that became the template for American literature, ""A Tramp Abroad"" is a book that, viewed from a certain angle, stands closer to ""Huckleberry Finn"" than any of his others.

A novelist reflects on the ignorance -- her own and society's -- that is the usual response to homosexuality. The issue was literally brought home to her by her elder son, who at 19 told his parents he was gay. She ""has much to say about tolerance, disappointment and love, themes that concern all parents and their children,"" Meg Wolitzer said here last year. THE WATERWORKS By E. L. Doctorow. Signet, $6.99. Part fable, part mystery, part Oedipal drama, this novel unfolds in 1870's New York, where the moral atmosphere is as dingy as the streets. Here McIlvaine, a newspaperman, relates the odd tale of Martin Pemberton, a young writer who is convinced that he has recently glimpsed his late father -- a profiteer in the best Boss Tweed tradition -- alive in a carriage. Last year our reviewer, Simon Schama, called the book ""startling and spellbinding."" He added, ""The reader is helplessly and gratefully caught in the current"" of Mr. Doctorow's story. Another journalist narrator reveals the depravity of old New York in THE ALIENIST, by Caleb Carr (Bantam, $6.99). In a kind of novelistic twist on Jack the Ripper, a serial killer is murdering and mutilating young boy prostitutes in turn-of-the-century Manhattan. The result is ""a pleasing entertainment,"" Stephen Dobyns wrote in these pages in 1994, one that proves ""Mr. Carr knows his history."" Also reissued is a nonfiction work by Mr. Carr, THE DEVIL SOLDIER: The American Soldier of Fortune Who Became a God in China (Random House, $15). The author maintains that Frederick Townsend Ward, a mercenary for the Manchu dynasty in its 1860's war against rebelling Taiping peasants, was not only a brilliant tactician but a good guy as well. In 1992 Annette Kobak wrote, ""Mr. Carr gives a good picture of the buccaneering milieu . . . and makes a plausible case for the devil soldier being on the side of the angels."" THESE SAME LONG BONES By Gwendolyn M. Parker. Plume, $10.95. Hay-Ti is ""the colored section"" of Durham, N.C., an area that in 1947 is an oasis but not a refuge to people like Sirus McDougald, a black businessman whose price for success appears to be the death of his daughter. This is ""a thoughtful and generous-hearted novel that shows a life . . . aglow with insoluble mystery,"" Josephine Humphreys said in the Book Review last year. Another black neighborhood comes to life in the interconnected stories of RATTLEBONE, by Maxine Clair (Penguin, $9.95), which follow a young woman, Irene, from her 1950's childhood in a Midwestern town through high school. Writing here earlier this year, Veronica Chambers found them ""extraordinary. . . . There is magic dust sprinkled over each and every page."" THE DOWNING STREET YEARS By Margaret Thatcher. Harper Perennial, $16. These are the memoirs of the grocer's daughter who became Prime Minister of Britain and a standard-bearer for a conservatism that brooked no compromise, whether the issue was the Falkland Islands or European supranationalism. The result is ""the gripping tale of a leader who has triumphantly answered the question nagging at every political figure: whether his or her actions are making any real difference,"" Henry A. Kissinger said here in 1993. Madeleine M. Kunin, an American trailblazer from a different political camp, reveals her struggles in LIVING A POLITICAL LIFE: One of America's First Woman Governors Tells Her Story (Vintage, $13). Now the Deputy Secretary of Education, Ms. Kunin describes the circuitous, uphill route she traveled to the Vermont Statehouse. She writes ""vividly, and with a power derived from experience,"" William H. Chafe said in the Book Review in 1994. SMALL WORLD: An Academic Romance By David Lodge. Penguin, $10.95. Certain professorial types are often considered funny by everyone except themselves, and the author sends them up smartly in this novel, which presents the pursuit of an endowed faculty chair as if it were a latter-day quest for the Holy Grail. ""His deliberately outrageous manipulation of character and event is entirely successful,"" Michael Rosenthal said here in 1985. I AM ROE: My Life, Roe v. Wade, and Freedom of Choice By Norma McCorvey with Andy Meisler. Harper Perennial, $11. The woman whose third unplanned pregnancy led to the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion reveals the person behind the pseudonym: abused, impoverished, unglamorous and gay. The story of the crusade she never asked to lead is ""a powerful and important American document,"" Susan Cheever wrote in the Book Review last year. The transcript of Roe v. Wade appears in MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT: Arguments on Abortion, edited by Stephanie Guitton and Peter Irons (New Press, $27.50), a book packaged with two accompanying cassette tapes featuring the actual testimony from this and seven other decisions. The book grew out of the editors' earlier project, ""May It Please the Court: The Most Significant Oral Arguments Made Before the Supreme Court Since 1955,"" which provides ""a strong and direct whiff of history,"" Melvin I. Urofsky said here in 1993. Roe is also highlighted in A HISTORY OF THE SUPREME COURT, by Bernard Schwartz (Oxford University, $15.95), which ""in a well-written account takes us from the beginnings of the American judicial system . . . to the present,"" Mr. Urofsky wrote in the same review. THE LONGINGS OF WOMEN By Marge Piercy. Fawcett Crest, $6.99. What are traditionally seen as feminine objects of desire -- love, a husband, a house -- prove full of misery for three women whose lives become entwined: a writer and academic, an accused murderer and a housekeeper with no home of her own.

Shoppers for shoes, bags and clothes are having similar surprises. People still remember when it was as cheap to eat out as at home, but no longer. However, the best things in Rome really are free, from the view from the Janiculum Hill to the Pantheon (a functioning church) to a drink from a fountain (connoisseurs like the one on Via IV Novembre at the top of Salita del Grillo). And the second best things cost very little. TOUR BY TRAM OR BUS. The 30/ (say ""trenta barrato"") tram line starts its route at the Porta San Paolo, near the Stazione Ostiense (a secondary railroad station with Line B metro stop) and the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius, a late first-century B.C. funerary monument that was incorporated into the walls of Rome in the third century A.D. (to which the Porta San Paolo belonged). A couple of blocks away is the Protestant Cemetery. The 30/ wends its way slowly past the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the Circus Maximus, the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum; the Basilicas of St. John Lateran, Santa Croce, and San Lorenzo; the University of Rome, the trendy San Lorenzo quarter, and the Campo Verano cemetery; then turns toward chic Parioli and the zoo, to end at Piazza Thorvaldsen, a few steps from your choice of the Gallery of Modern Art, the Villa Giulia Museum of Etruscan Art, the Villa Borghese and a number of the foreign academies, which often have free art exhibitions.",1995-06-18T05:00:00+0000

us,DIARY,"THE BUDGET Clinton's Balancing Act To balance or not to balance, that used to be the question, with Bill Clinton clearly favoring a lopsided budget over the pain of a balanced one. But the slings and arrows of outrageous Republicans proved too painful, and last week the President hummed a radically new tune. O.K., balance it, he said, but do it in 10 years, not 7. His formula: save on Medicare, but not as drastically as the Republicans want; cut taxes for the middle class, not the wealthy; cut welfare, but protect children. But the question remains: Will any of the grand formulas being tossed out in the current political frenzy actually stick for 7 or 10 long years? As one lawmaker put it: if you don't like the President's stance on a given issue, just ""wait a few weeks."" AUTOS Fiery Voice at the U.A.W. When Stephen Yokich first picketed G.M., he was in a stroller. He was, after all, just 22 months old; his mother, a G.M. worker, was pushing. That was in the late 30's, a hot time for union battles. Cut to the 90's: automation, Japanese cars, an economy manically reinventing itself, fading memories of union power. United Auto Workers membership has slumped from 1.5 million in 1979 to perhaps 800,000 today. Mr. Yokich, now 59, wants to change that -- and he just might. Last week he was elected U.A.W. president, and hopes are high that he can bring vigor -- and members -- to the struggling union. He's got a fiery resume -- he was, for one, behind last fall's strike in Flint, Mich., which rippled through plants nationwide. But he's also known as a realist, one who can cooperate with management when the handwriting's on the assembly line. SOFT DRINKS A Cola With Snob Appeal It's a time-honored marketing tactic: put some bows and ribbons on it, call it ""premium"" or ""luxury,"" and double the price. Look at ""gold"" cards, which quack pretty much like humbler pieces of plastic. Look at Lexuses, which look a lot like Camrys with gold earrings. And now comes -- take a deep breath -- ""Royal Crown Draft Premium Cola."" It's ""rich and smooth,"" the company says, ""with a long-lasting head."" It comes in beer-style bottles. ""We're inventing a whole new category,"" Royal Crown's president said. And, yes, a whole new price: up to $4.99 a six-pack. Actually, given the huffing and puffing of the great ""cola wars,"" it's a wonder no one has thought up the ""premium"" angle before. DRUGS The Menopause Market Menopause has clearly arrived as a hot topic. Why? Because all those baby boomers are hitting the relevant age, of course; out of sight, out of mind. And, yes, it's a hot business topic too, as drug makers hover hungrily at the gates to this life passage. So when news came last week -- from The New England Journal of Medicine, of course -- that estrogen therapy lifts the breast-cancer risk by at least 30 percent, drug makers watched carefully. Many experts say the cancer risk is more than offset by estrogen's protection against osteoporosis and heart disease -- a view sure to be embraced by American Home Products, which last year sold nearly $1 billion worth of Premarin, the leading estrogen. It gets complicated, though, for Merck is nearing the market -- a market that will bulge in a few years -- with a drug that treats osteoporosis without hormones. For women caught in this vise, this means the added assault of marketers confusing them even more. MEN AT WORK Father? What's a Father? At the risk of sounding like a greeting card: What is a father? (This being His Day, you were naturally wondering this, weren't you?) Don't get soppy or philosophical, though; we're talking statistics, just statistics -- offered by Catalyst, a research group aimed at helping women in business. Does Dad bring home the bacon to two children and stay-at-home, slipper-bearing Mom? A mere 3.1 percent of families fit this cuddly mold in 1993. Fully 10 percent of American husbands are ""designated homemakers"" (no relation, presumably, to designated hitters), up from 2 percent in 1986. And among households with working parents, those headed by single fathers are increasing fastest. Still, Child magazine, which tracked ""father-friendly"" companies in 1992, stopped the next year because so few qualified -- or even cared. O.K., back to the football game (or whatever season it is). CYBERSPACE Between Consenting Computers On the Senate floor last week, Jim Exon of Nebraska waved a blue binder with a red label reading ""Caution."" Mr. Exon was shocked to find this ""disgusting material"" on the Internet, and he and most of the rest of the Senate don't want your children to see it. (Don't ask how many senators sneaked a peek.) So they did what lawmakers tend to do -- voted to impose fines and prison terms on those who distribute ""filthy"" material over computer networks. A worthy sentiment, surely -- and the lopsided 84-16 vote reflects a distinct fear of being seen as ""pro-filth"" -- but the whole free-speech issue lurks awfully close by. Cyberspace has created an odd new mix of public and private, and private communication between adults has always been sacred territory. Even Orrin Hatch, that pillar of conservatism, denounced the measure, saying, ""It's a political exercise, and I'm against it."" THE MILITARY Let Them Eat Missiles Starting in the early 80's -- you remember, when we didn't worry about spending money we didn't have -- this nation spent more than $35 billion on a ""Star Wars"" missile defense, with little to show for it. So you'd think those Republicans hell-bent on balancing the Federal checkbook would apply their austerity here, too -- especially with the cold war over. But no -- even while slashing everywhere else, the House last week added $628 million to the anti-missile allotment. The rationale: the cold war's end means greater risks of missiles from rogue nations, and thus more need for that fabled ""missile shield."" If, that is, it works. POSTAL SERVICE Moving New York's Mail Good news, New Yorkers: those 17 catalogues and 14 credit-card offers that are jammed daily into your mailbox are arriving a bit faster this year. (Oh, yes, the real mail is, too -- when you can find it amid the junk.) The Postal Service said last week that New York no longer languishes at the bottom of the nation's big-city mailbag in on-time delivery -- with 83 percent of mail arriving punctually, up from 62 percent last year. Westchester is another matter, though -- the county's mail service ranks second from the bottom nationally, with only San Juan, P.R., below it. MERGERS I.B.M.-Lotus: Teamwork? So I.B.M. buys Lotus. What does it get for its $3.5 billion? Clearly, what it hopes to create, with Lotus's Notes software, is a team powerful enough to play in Microsoft's league. But that will be a disjointed team indeed if, as promised, Lotus remains a private enclave within Giant Blue. Louis Gerstner, I.B.M. chairman, is all for a big, solid front. But with separate sales forces and software teams, ""there is simply no way,"" one business professor said, that I.B.M. can ""make this deal pay off."" So the surprising independence granted Lotus managers may soon be in name only. . . . Microsoft, meanwhile, got some good news. An antitrust deal it cut with the Justice Department had been tossed out in court, but a Federal appeals court reinstated it -- and took the judge who'd rejected it off the case.",1995-06-18T05:00:00+0000

AFTER ART: Rethinking 150 Years of Photography (University of Washington, paper, $37.50) uses a selection of prints by 191 photographers from the Monsen collection to view the short history of photography from a post-modernist perspective. In separate essays, Andy Grundberg, the director of the Friends of Photography in San Francisco, and Chris Bruce, the senior curator of the Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington, describe the loss of innocence for photographers working in the image-laden environment of the post-modern era and suggest connections between the art of the recent past, which dominates the collection, and trends in photography stretching back to the mid-19th century. The prints are organized, with a bracing disregard for chronology, into topical sections that facilitate the kind of dialogue between periods that Mr. Grundberg and Mr. Bruce are after. An image of a Gettysburg battlefield strewn with corpses, for example, is shown opposite two photographs taken more than 100 years later of Western construction sites -- also bleak images of destruction. The essays, despite outbursts of critical jargon, are thoughtful and informative, but the real pleasure of the book lies in the quality of the photographs and the sly juxtapositions.

The Revenue Streams That Flow From 'The Bridges Of Madison County'","Movie merchandising has existed at least two decades, but the last 10 years have seen an acceleration of this trend, perfected by Walt Disney Company, as movie marketers have become more sophisticated in building revenue sources. The domestic film industry generated more than $5.4 billion in ticket sales last year, while licensing income from merchandising tie-ins to films and animated characters surpassed $17 billion, according to Karen B. Raugust of The Licensing Letter. ""The Bridges of madison County,"" by Robert James Waller, is a hugely successful book, with more than six million copies sold, and has been on the best-seller list for almost three years. Perhaps inevitably, the book and the film version have generated a not-so-small cottage industry of their own.TY AHMAN-TAYLORCOST: $14.95PRINTED: 6 million in the U.S. MARKETED BY: Warner Brooks1 -- THE MOVIE BASED ON THE BOOKThe movie has taken in more than $36.4 million, with an average of 3,420 per screen, which is more than either ""Casper"" or ""Braveheart.""

Taking theaters as a subject -- most famously in ""New York Movie"" (1939), with its enigmatically bored or pensive usherette -- was simply the most obvious way in which films were essential to Hopper. During a long lifetime of moviegoing, what he saw on screen often inspired him indirectly, so that a film like ""Little Caesar"" (1930), with its dramatically lighted scene of thugs in a diner, reverberates years later in Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" (1942). And in turn, the desolate landscape we are now quick to call Hopperesque has had a profound influence on the movies. ""Days of Heaven"" and ""Psycho"" wouldn't be the same without him.",1995-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Exceedingly Odd,"Sarah Bernhardt liked to play dead for photographers, arranging herself in a tasteful rosewood coffin. As an infant, William S. Burroughs saw tiny men romping among his alphabet blocks. The inventor Nikola Tesla feared women who wore pearl earrings and, like Howard Hughes, was so frightened of germs that he avoided shaking hands. The stories of these and 60 other eccentrics are set out by Carl A. Posey, a novelist and an editor at Time-Life Books, in THE BIG BOOK OF WEIRDOS (Paradox Press/ DC Comics, paper, $12.95) and illustrated, in black and white, by 63 graphic artists. The weirdos in question can be as benign as Stephen Tennant, the languid English professional beauty who spent many of his last years in bed, visited by the rich and famous, or as malign as Hitler. Among lesser-known figures, my personal favorite is Cyrus R. Teed, who, around the turn of the century, founded a religious community on the belief that the earth was actually a gold-plated sphere, and that, to quote his motto, ""We live inside."" Mr. Posey's dialogue is often flippant -- ""Terrible? Moi?"" says Ivan -- and frequently funny, in a silly sort of way. The graphics are as various as their subjects, ranging from pastiche (Van Gogh) to near-abstraction (King Farouk). Among the artists, special mention must go to James Romberger, whose scary Hitler, decomposing from frame to frame, is in the highest horror-comics tradition; to Craig Hamilton, for the elegant full-page Art Nouveau designs that curl around Isadora Duncan; and to Frank Quitely, in particular for the panel that shows his Salvador Dali sitting at a cafe table in company with a Cubist Picasso and a Pointillist Seurat. An appendix to the book lists Mr. Posey's biographical sources. If some are less than reliable, so what. How could any right-thinking person not depict J. Edgar Hoover in a little black cocktail dress and fishnet stockings? SARAH FERRELL",1995-06-25T05:00:00+0000

But the reason had little to do with the prospect that its longtime enemy could become a nuclear power. Instead, the government's biggest concern was the sprouting of giant American television transmission dishes in the parking lots of the city's best hotels. Within days, the dire-sounding accounts of diplomatic deadlock started zipping across the Pacific, complete with loose talk about a ""Second Korean War."" Tourists, conventions and business delegations canceled in droves. Naturally, on the streets of Seoul, nothing much had changed. South Koreans have been living under threats of devastation from the north for 40 years, all of them a lot more plausible than an atomic attack. And there are fewer risks getting off the subway at the wrong station in Seoul than there are making the same mistake in Washington. But try to convince Americans whose image of Korea has been created by reruns of M*A*S*H. ""Every time CNN shows a picture of the demilitarized zone, it costs us another planeload of visitors,"" one South Korean cabinet official complained.

us,DIARY,"SECURITIES FRAUD Crash Landing for Brennan ""Come grow with us,"" the ads said, and Robert Brennan's trademark helicopter hammered home the idea that First Jersey Securities, his penny-stock firm, could transform mere mortals into high fliers. For a decade, though, the S.E.C. has tried to prove that Mr. Brennan and his brokers did all the growing, while customers' accounts did a vanishing act. Mr. Brennan held them off, with one delay coming after he named a horse after a judge and the irate judge quit the case for fear of seeming biased. And all the while he built his sports empire, and his reputation as a philanthropist. But the S.E.C. kept at him, and last week Mr. Brennan's charmed life crashed into a wall: a Federal judge ruled that Mr. Brennan and his firm had engaged in ""a massive and continuing fraud"" and imposed damages of at least $71.5 million. PUBLIC SPEAKING What's That, Mr. Greenspan? Clarity is a rare and wondrous thing. It sparkles. It illuminates. It sends all doubt scurrying to life's dusty, cobwebbed corners. So Alan Greenspan, one of the most powerful humans alive, avoids it like the plague. ""I worry incessantly that I might be too clear,"" he said last week. Don't you worry yourself about that, Mr. Greenspan; you didn't even come close. The Federal Reserve chairman -- who could move the financial markets with a mistimed cough -- had just given a Big Speech with an unmistakable message: The Federal Reserve might lower interest rates in early July, or it might not. The economy might slip into a mild recession, or it might not. And to make his calculated obfuscation complete, he stated unequivocally that July's rate-setting meeting would be ""most engaging."" Any questions? THEME PARKS In Orlando, Real Mice When you think of Disney and animals, you think of a grossly overworked mouse, an adorable lion or some ridiculous number of Dalmatians. Disney wants to change that, in its usual oversized way. Last week it announced plans for a Wild Animal Kingdom, at 500 acres its largest park yet, right in the thick of Disney World. It'll be a habitat for more than 1,000 animals, some of them endangered, and untold thousands of humans, all hot and grumpy. Disney overflowed with talk about preserving species and educating the public about wildlife. But if that sounds too educational, don't worry: one section will be devoted to mythical beasts, like unicorns, and another to extinct ones. (Are Disney's magicians off somewhere busily turning ancient amber into velociraptors?) As one observer put it, ""They can say all they want, but this park is to make money."" THE DONALD Did He Lose a Gold Sled? Donald Trump has this thing about gold. It's as if he fancies himself some latter-day Midas, gleefully bestowing his touch on a sadly gray landscape. Look at the Grand Hyatt. Look at Trump Tower. And soon, like it or not, you'll be looking at something called the Trump International Hotel and Tower if you get anywhere near Columbus Circle. In its drab, pre-Trump incarnation, this was the Gulf and Western Building, but last week work began on its Trump rebirth -- same size and shape (no public scrutiny needed), but gold-tinted glass from head to toe. Never fear, though -- this is no quickie gilding: one designer is none other than Philip Johnson. Goldfinger would be impressed. TOBACCO A Recall Hazardous to Logic Philip Morris recalled seven billion cigarettes last month, but now no one seems quite sure why. At first it said there was some irritant in the filters that could cause ""temporary discomfort."" But last week it said the filter problem was small and involved only a bad taste and odor. The irritant may have been in the packaging. But Westvaco, which supplied the packaging, denied that ""minute trace amounts"" of the irritant could be linked to the problem -- and, indeed, the existing packaging is not being destroyed. So let's see: it's not the filters, it's not the packaging, and the cigarettes inside, of course, continue to be harmless. What's the problem? THE ENVIRONMENT No Oil Rig Is an Island The next time you agonize over insulting the environment by discarding plastic bottles, say, or junk mail, just be thankful you don't face this rather more sizable disposal problem. Royal Dutch/Shell has this old oil rig in the North Atlantic that it wants to get rid of, and it planned to sink it. But Greenpeace charged in, calling the rig -- with its 100 tons of sand, oil sludge, and radioactive materials -- an environmental time bomb. The company backed down, but then last week said it had no idea what to do with it. It could cost $70 million to dismantle it on land, vs. $16 million to sink it -- and to top it off, it wasn't clear that land disposal would in fact be safer. An Austrian financier offered to turn it into a floating casino, but that doesn't seem likely. So for now this 450-foot-long orphan wanders at sea. CAR WARS Wrong Side? Detroit Did It The clock is ticking toward Wednesday, when those crippling tariffs on Japanese luxury cars could kick in, and negotiators in Geneva are doing the usual dance -- with no one likely to give in til the last minute. But here's an interesting side issue: Japan has all those Lexuses and Infinitis made with America in mind; they'd be tough to sell in Japan, because the steering wheel's on the wrong side. Japan has long scolded Detroit for trying to sell wrong-side cars in Japan, so it'll be awfully strange to say now that wrong-side Lexuses are just fine. Even a Toyota spokesman said, ""It's a very funny idea."" Of course, they could always call them Fords, sell them at a discount, and then blame Detroit. THE BUDGET A Bumpy Road Ahead? In a family's budget, ""discretionary"" spending is the extra stuff, the frills -- vacations, dinners out, marble Pocahontas lawn ornaments. To Congress, though, the label is applied to things many would consider more basic: roads, schools, the environment. But these become ""discretionary"" because they lack law-given formulas, and are thus ripe for the Republican knife. So when House and Senate leaders agreed last week on $245 billion in tax cuts over seven years -- the final piece of the mad budget-balancing dash -- the plan included $190 billion in cuts from projected discretionary spending. A ""historic step,"" said Newt Gingrich. ""Tax cuts to those who don't need them,"" said Leon Panetta. DETENTION Capitalism as Jailer A lot of people say the Government botches things the private sector could handle easily. But when a privately run immigration jail erupted in violence last week in New Jersey, it raised the opposite question: should human detention be at capitalism's mercy? The head of Esmor, the prison company, put the blame for the revolt on the immigration service, saying it took too long with its paperwork, and said Esmor had fulfilled all its obligations. But a former warden at the center said that he could find no doctor who'd work for the wages offered and that he'd been told that $1.12 a day was too much to pay for an inmate's meals. ""They don't want to run a jail,"" he said. ""They want to run a motel as cheaply as possible.""",1995-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Yesterday in Washington,"BANKING BILL -- The House Banking Committee approved a bill to repeal decades of consumer protection laws, but Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin threatened to recommend a Presidential veto. Majority Republicans contended that the bill would eliminate red tape, allowing banks to pass efficiency savings on to consumers. But Democrats and Mr. Rubin argued that the bill would undermine protections that many depositors have come to take for granted and would allow bank executives to engage in reckless activities that could endanger their solvency. BUDGET -- On basically party-line votes, the House and Senate adopted a seven-year budget that would cut taxes, limit spending for Medicare and other social programs and eliminate the Federal deficit by 2002. The plan is just a framework. The specifics of which taxes will be lowered and how spending will be restrained will not be decided for months, but Republicans rejoiced that they were fulfilling the keystone promise to balance the budget that they made during their election campaign last year. The House vote was after the 239 to 134 vote, and in the Senate the tally was 54 to 46, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed.",1995-06-30T05:00:00+0000
