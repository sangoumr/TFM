us,New & Noteworthy,"HOPSCOTCH, by Julio Cortazar. Translated by Gregory Rabassa. (Pantheon, $8.95.) ''Hopscotch,'' the best-known novel of the Argentine writer Julio Cortazar (1914-84), is the story of a middle-aged Argentine living an expatriate's life in Paris with his mistress. ''The dialogue is brilliant,'' Donald Keene said in The Book Review in 1966, and ''the rapid-fire invention of the language makes every page sparkle, thanks to the translation.'' The work is, in fact, ''a comic novel, sometimes howlingly funny, always acutely ironic.'' Writing in these pages in 1969, C. D. B. Bryan called ''Hopscotch'' ''the most magnificent novel I have ever read. . . . No novel by any living author has more influenced me, more intrigued me, or more enraptured me.'' WISEGUY: Life in a Mafia Family, by Nicholas Pileggi. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Nicholas Pileggi's portrait of Henry Hill - a small-time gangster and ''mechanic'' for a mob family, the kind of tough thief called a ''wiseguy'' in the business - amounts to an oral history of organized crime in New York. ''Mr. Pileggi molds Mr. Hill's life story into an absolutely engrossing book that rings with authenticity,'' Vincent Patrick said here last year. ''Mr. Hill is a find, a bona fide wiseguy who generally 'earned' at street level but who had unusual access to high-level crime bosses.'' The book evoked for him ''the quality of the best documentary films.'' AN ESTATE OF MEMORY, by Ilona Karmel. (Feminist Press, $11.95.) Ilona Karmel's novel about life in a Nazi work camp in Poland in 1943-44 focuses on four imprisoned women, one of them pregnant, who plot to secretly deliver and to save the baby. ''This is a very good book,'' Elizabeth Janeway said here in 1969, one that conveys ''plausible, possible human experience.'' NO LAUGHING MATTER, by Joseph Heller and Speed Vogel. (Avon, $4.95.) This chronicle of Joseph Heller's struggle against and recovery from the paralyzing effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome ''is so much about the approach of the Grim Reaper that it requires the combined strength of two authors to push him back,'' Anthony Burgess said here last year. ''Good humor holds throughout the book, salted by a genial bloody-mindedness which is part of Mr. Heller's charm.'' AVAILABLE LIGHT, by Ellen Currie. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) Kitty O'Carolan, an advertising fashion stylist, is deserted by her lover, a musician and gambler named Jack Rambeau, in this often funny first novel. The book ''should be greeted with celebration,'' T. Gertler said in The Book Review in 1986. ''Ellen Currie nudges reality and uncovers a vein of the fabulous.'' The ''twists and shifts and curlicues of the book spin along in vibrant prose.'' WHY NOTHING WORKS: The Anthropology of Daily Life, by Marvin Harris. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $7.95.) Originally published as ''America Now: The Anthropology of a Changing Culture,'' this book is a ''concise, angry outcry at the current condition of America,'' our reviewer, Robert Lekachman, said in 1982. The author ''rails eloquently'' against faulty appliances, computer goofs, inflation, unemployment and bloated government bureaucracy. The culprit? The postwar shift from blue- to white-collar employment. PRINCE AMONG SLAVES, by Terry Alford. (Oxford University, $8.95.) Terry Alford's biography of Abd al-Rahman Ibrahima, a West African prince sold into slavery in the late 18th century and freed 40 years later, makes ''absorbing reading,'' reviewers said in 1978. ''The story moves along with the excitement, pace, and emotion of a well-written novel.'' JOHN KEATS: The Making of a Poet, by Aileen Ward. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $11.95.) Aileen Ward's critical biography is free of ''that bland propensity for gush and guesswork'' sometimes displayed by earlier biographers of Keats, Carlos Baker said here in 1963. This one, he said, ''is everywhere studded with illuminating small discoveries.'' THE VOICE AT THE BACK DOOR, by Elizabeth Spencer. (Avon, $4.50.) This novel of a postwar Mississippi sheriff is ''powerful, moving and true,'' Borden Deal said in The Book Review in 1956. The story ''mounts with intensity and an ever surer touch to a tremendous climax.'' The same publisher soon will reissue Elizabeth Spencer's FIRE IN THE MORNING ($4.95), the story of bitter enmity between two families in a small Mississippi town. The author, Hubert Creekmore said here in 1948, ''is dealing with material so completely within Southern experience as to be legendary.'' ALONE IN A CROWD: Women in the Trades Tell Their Stories, by Jean Reith Schroedel. (Temple University, $12.95.) A firefighter, a machinist, a sailor, an electrician and a pipe fitter are among the 25 Seattle-area women interviewed for this collection. In 1985 our reviewer, Alice Kessler-Harris, said: ''Lucid and moving, the interviews portray the pitfalls women face and the accommodations they make in order to learn the skills that guarantee reasonable wages - men's wages.'' SEMINARY: A Search, by Paul Hendrickson. (Summit, $6.95.) In 1965, shortly before he was to take his priestly vows, Paul Hendrickson left the Holy Trinity Seminary in Alabama and began a search for spiritual meaning in the secular world. ''His description of seminary life during the period before the Second Vatican Council rings as true as chapel bells on a windless morning,'' Eugene Kennedy said here in 1983. C, by Maurice Baring. (Oxford University, $8.95.) A picture of upper-class English life in the late 19th century, this novel by Maurice Baring (1874-1945) focuses on Caryl Bramsley (nicknamed C), a nobleman's son whose story unfolds through recollections of friends and through papers left after his death. In 1924 our reviewer, Herbert S. Gorman, said the work is ''revelatory of a confident handling of technique, a precise and careful development of personality, and a triumphant circumscribing of theme.''",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,ADDING PEICES TO THE PUZZLE: A NEW CHRONOLOGY OF THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR,"The report made public Thursday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence helps establish the sequence of events surrounding the secret American arms sales to Iran and the diversion of money from those sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. Here is a summary of events showing how the pieces of the puzzle fit together. 1982 - Israel ships non-American arms to Iran, and Israeli middlemen help arrange private deals involving American arms, according to secret studies by American intelligence agencies. These studies apparently are not made available to the National Security Council staff. Late 1984 - The National Security Council begins a reappraisal of United States policy toward Iran. April 1985 - Michael A. Ledeen, a consultant to the National Security Council, tells President Reagan's national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, that he plans to visit Israel. Mr. McFarlane agrees that Mr. Ledeen should ask Israeli officials about ''contacts with Iran.'' May 4-5, 1985 - Mr. Ledeen visits Israel and discusses the situation in Iran with Prime Minister Shimon Peres. May 1985 - The Central Intelligence Agency proposes that America's allies be allowed to sell arms to Iran to enhance Western influence. June 5, 1985 - Secretary of State George P. Shultz complains to Mr. McFarlane that Mr. Ledeen had bypassed the State Department in his contacts with Israel. Mr. McFarlane assures Mr. Shultz that Mr. Ledeen was acting ''on his own hook.'' Mr. McFarlane says of the Iran initiative: ''I am turning it off entirely.'' June 29, 1985 - Mr. Shultz says the proposed new policy toward Iran is ''perverse'' and ''contrary to our own interests.'' Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger writes that the proposed policy is ''almost too absurd to comment on.'' July 1985 - Adnan M. Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian arms dealer, sends Mr. McFarlane a long paper discussing the political situation in Iran. July 3, 1985 - David Kimche, director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, tells Mr. McFarlane that Iranian officials want to open ''political talks'' with the United States. July 14, 1985 - Mr. Shultz tells Mr. McFarlane that the United States should ''seriously consider the idea of private U.S.-Iran relations.'' Mid-July 1985 - President Reagan, in the hospital for major abdominal surgery, authorizes Mr. McFarlane to make contact with Iran. Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, said later that he assumed release of Americans held in Lebanon would be a ''collateral benefit.'' Late July 1985 - Mr. Ledeen meets in Israel with Manucher Ghorbanifar, an expatriate Iranian businessman and arms dealer. According to Mr. Ledeen's later testimony, Mr. Ghorbanifar says Iran might arrange for the release of American hostages if the United States helped Iran to buy weapons. Aug. 8, 1985 - Mr. McFarlane briefs Mr. Reagan on ''the Kimche proposal'' to permit the sale of American antitank missiles to Iran through Israel. Mr. Regan says the President did not authorize such sales; Mr. McFarlane says he did. Aug. 30, 1985 - Israel sends 508 TOW antitank missiles through a third country to Iran. The shipment arrives Sept. 13. Sept. 4, 1985 - Mr. Ledeen meets in Paris with Mr. Kimche, Mr. Ghorbanifar and two Israeli arms dealers to discuss ''technical questions'' related to the sale of American weapons to Iran. They also discuss efforts to obtain the release of American hostages in Lebanon. Sept. 14, 1985 - The Rev. Benjamin F. Weir, a Presbyterian minister, is released after having been held 16 months. October 1985 - Islamic Holy War says it has killed William Buckley, the Beirut station chief of the C.I.A., who was kidnapped March 16, 1984. Nov. 22, 1985 - The C.I.A. arranges for the shipment of 18 Hawk antiaircraft missiles from Israel to Iran. Nov. 25, 1985 - According to his later testimony, John N. McMahon, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, learns of the agency's role in the arms shipments and orders that there be no more such covert activity unless the President explicitly authorizes it. Dec. 7, 1985 - President Reagan discusses his Iran program with Mr. Shultz, Mr. Weinberger, Mr. McFarlane and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, who is to succeed Mr. McFarlane at year's end as national security adviser. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger oppose further arms sales. Dec. 8, 1985 - Mr. McFarlane and an aide, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, meet in London with Mr. Kimche, Mr. Ghorbanifar and Yaacov Nimrodi, an Israeli arms dealer who had served as military attache at the Israeli Embassy in Teheran. Mr. McFarlane tells Mr. Ghorbanifar that the United States does not want to participate in any more arms transfers to Iran. Late December 1985 - Mr. Ghorbanifar meets with C.I.A. officials in Washington. William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, warns President Reagan that Mr. Ghorbanifar's information on Iran ''could be a deception to impress us.'' January 1986 - Mr. Ghorbanifar fails a polygraph examination. The results support the C.I.A.'s contention that he is not to be trusted. Nevertheless, according to the Intelligence Committee report, ''the White House chose to continue to work with him.'' January 1986 - Amiram Nir, an adviser to Prime Minister Peres, urges President Reagan to resume arms shipments to Iran. Mr. Nir and Colonel North discuss the use of money from the Iran arms sales to help the Nicaraguan rebels, according to an account that Colonel North gave to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d in November 1986. Jan. 7, 1986 - President Reagan meets in the Oval Office with Vice President Bush, Mr. Shultz, Mr. Weinberger, Mr. Casey and other officials. Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger argue strongly against selling arms to Iran. But Mr. Reagan, wishing ''to keep the channel open,'' leaves the issue ''unresolved,'' according to the Senate report. Jan. 17, 1986 - President Reagan signs an order authorizing arms shipments to Iran in an effort to improve relations and secure the release of hostages. Responsibility for arranging the shipments is given to Secretary Weinberger's military assistant, Maj. Gen. Colin L. Powell, and Lieut. Gen. Vincent M. Russo, director of the Defense Logistics Agency. Late January 1986 - Colonel North meets in London with Mr. Ghorbanifar, promises to send more weapons to Iran and offers to provide intelligence on the position of Iraqi troops at war with Iran. The C.I.A. objects to sharing sensitive intelligence data, but is overruled by the staff of the National Security Council. Feb. 15-16, 1986 - The United States sends 1,000 TOW missiles to Israel, where they will be transshipped to Iran. Mr. Khashoggi, who helped finance the transaction, receives $12 million from Mr. Ghorbanifar. Late February 1986 - Prime Minister Peres writes President Reagan, urging him to continue efforts to achieve a ''strategic opening'' to Iran. April 3, 1986 - Unidentified American officials meet in Washington with Mr. Ghorbanifar to discuss a proposed visit to Teheran. Several documents suggest that there was discussion of using profits from the arms sales to help Nicaraguan and Afghan insurgents. April 4, 1986 - A memorandum prepared around this time says $12 million from arms transactions with Iran will be used to purchase supplies for the Nicaraguan rebels. It is unclear whether this proposal was ever approved. April 17, 1986 - The body of an American hostage in Lebanon, Peter Kilburn, is found. His kidnappers say he was killed in retaliation for the American bombing of Libya two days earlier. May 15, 1986 - President Reagan approves a mission to Iran by Mr. McFarlane. May 18, 1986 - Mr. Ghorbanifar assures a C.I.A. official that American hostages will be released when Mr. McFarlane's group arrives in Teheran. May 23, 1986 - The C.I.A. ships 508 TOW missiles to Israel. May 25-28, 1986 - Mr. McFarlane, Colonel North and other American officials arrive in Teheran on a plane carrying spare parts for Iran's Hawk antiaircraft missiles. But the hostages are not released. On the trip back to the United States, Colonel North tells Mr. McFarlane that money from the Iran arms sales has been used to support the contras. July 26, 1986 - The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest, is released after having been held hostage in Lebanon for more than 18 months. Colonel North says the release is a result of the McFarlane mission to Iran. Aug. 3, 1986 - Iran receives another American shipment of spare parts for Hawk missiles. Sept. 12, 1986 - Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel offers ''a significant quantity of captured Soviet bloc arms'' for use by the contras. Admiral Poindexter discusses the Israeli offer with Mr. Reagan just before the President meets with Prime Minister Peres on Sept. 15. Oct. 7, 1986 - A C.I.A. officer tells Mr. Casey that profits from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. Oct. 29, 1986 - The C.I.A. arranges for the shipment of 500 TOW missiles from Israel to Iran. This is apparently the last arms deal between the United States and Iran.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Q & A,"'Reasonable' Consent Question: In a recent column you wrote that ''the owner of a rent-stabilized co-op may not unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet, and the unit may be subletted for two years out of any four-year period.'' Can you give me an idea of what has been construed to be an unreasonable withholding of consent? Would it be unreasonable to withhold consent if the renter moves to another primary residence? . . . R. P., Manhattan Answer: Under the rent-stabilization law, consent to a sublet may be withheld if the renter is giving up his primary residence, or if the landlord objects to the proposed subtenant on grounds that are deemed reasonable by housing court, said Gary M. Rosenberg, a partner with the law firm of Rosenberg & Estis. The subtenant's criminal record or inability to pay the rent might be such grounds. The landlord has 10 days after the tenant's request to ask for more information regarding the move or proposed subtenant. If, after being denied permission, the tenant sublets anyway, the landlord may bring eviction proceedings. Troubled Waters Question: For more than two years, rusty water has flowed from the faucets in my apartment. The discoloration gets into the laundry and food, as well as my skin and hair. Is rusty water toxic? Who is responsible for removing this trouble - the landlord or the tenants? And to whom should I complain? The landlord says we are lucky - that it is how we can maintain a ''healthy glow'' between Florida vacations. . . . E. K., Manhattan Answer: Roz Post, director of public information for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, says that galvanized pipes are often found in old buildings, whereas brass pipes, which do not rust, are now the standard. Under the city's maintenance code, it is the landlord's responsibility to replace some or all of the plumbing in the event of discolored water. If you have notified your landlord and he does not take action, you should call the department's complaint hotline at 960-4800.

us,FICTION: IN SHORT,"FAIR AUGUSTO: And Other Stories. By Laura Kalpakian. (Graywolf, Paper, $8.) If variety of setting were the sole criterion of a short story's excellence, Laura Kalpakian's first collection would be superior. With substantial facility she delineates locations ranging from a loch in Scotland to Venice to the Santa Monica pier. These are leisurely, full-bodied, even old-fashioned stories with fairly complete narratives - the antithesis of contemporary minimalism. Yet despite this amplitude, a number of the stories seem bland, familiar, uninspired. The lengthy title story barely avoids soap opera to arrive eventually at a woman's genuine anger over the golden boy of her youth. Ms. Kalpakian's favored protagonists are women without jobs or husbands or the wherewithal to face the trials of daily existence. Though these characters aren't without fictional potential, their plight is portrayed in an all too tidy manner. Voice and point of view are relatively unimportant, with the result that one becomes aware of a consistently colorless, constricting omniscience. What is missing from a majority of the stories are quirks and loose ends that can't be explained even by an all-knowing narrator. Only two stories are told in the first person, and they are among the liveliest. In ''Veteran's Day'' a hairdresser proudly relates the escapes from the police of her brother, a Vietnam veteran whose mission in life is to warn America that its minds are being poisoned by ''Killer Enzymes'' and ''Radio Carbons.'' This and several other stories - including an Armenian couple's first brush with an American Christmas and an atheistic doctor in the midst of a devoutly religious family - exhibit a droll humor and a welcome sense of surprise. As a writer of short fiction, Ms. Kalpakian's best efforts are her freest.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

It was the first major downhill title for Mueller, a 29-year-old veteran of the World Cup circuit. He mastered the difficult jumps on the 3,112-meter course and posted the excellent time of 2 minutes 7.80 seconds. Zurbriggen had to settle for the silver medal in 2:08.13, and Karl Alpiger took the bronze in 2:08.20. Franz Heinzer added to the Swiss domination by finishing fourth in 2:08.34. Michael Brown of Vail, Colo., the top American finisher, was 21st in 2:10.45. Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg finished seventh, despite suffering his third shoulder separation of the season Thursday. (AP) Golf King Ahead: Betsy King shot a 71 and moved into a one-stroke lead after three rounds of the $200,000 Mazda Classic at Boca Raton, Fla. King, winner of seven tournaments over the last three seasons, carded four birdies and three bogeys on the par-72, 6,472-yard course at Stonebridge Golf and Country Club and reached the 54-hole mark at 213. The leader was the only one among the top nine contenders to break par in breezy conditions that contributed to the steep fall of Cathy Moore, the second-day leader, who shot a 77. Heather Farr, starting her second year on the tour, moved into second place at 73-214. (AP) Casper Shares Lead: Billy Casper carded his second straight par 72 to share the halfway lead with Harold Henning of South Africa at 144 in the $300,000 Seniors Golf Classic at the Gary Player Country Club in Sun City, South Africa. Henning shot a 69, the best round of the day. Despite the 104-degree heat, Henning produced five birdies and only two bogeys. Orville Moody, who had been tied at 70 for the first-round lead with Doug Sanders, was a stroke back with 145 after a 75. (AP) Tennis Flach Upset: Dan Saltz upset Ken Flach, a Davis Cup doubles player, in the second qualifying round for the United States Pro Indoor tennis championship, by 5-7, 7-5, 6-3, in Philadelphia. Saltz, of Los Angeles, is 291st in the world computer rankings, 107 places higher than Flach, a St. Louis native. In another upset of the second-round qualifier, Hugo Nunez of Rockaway, N.Y., eliminated Chip Hooper of Bradenton, Fla., 3-6, 6-1, 7-5. Hooper was a semifinalist in the tournament five years ago. (AP) Horse Racing King's Swan Wins Assault: King's Swan, the favorite, scored a front-running 4 3/4-length victory in the $89,100 Assault Handicap at Aqueduct. Ridden by Jose Santos, King's Swan showed a liking to the sloppy track and covered the mile and an eighth in 1:52 4/5 for his second victory in two starts this year. Scrimshaw closed fast on the rail to edge Feeling Gallant by a neck for second. King's Swan, a 7-year-old son of King's Bishop and Royal Cygnet, paid $3.60 for $2 to win. In the co-feature, Videogenic raced to a three-length victory in the $87,650 Rare Treat Handicap for fillies and mares. Squan Song, who won this race last year, was the runner-up, 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Beth's Song. Videogenic completed the mile and an eighth in 1:55 1/5 and paid $15.20 as the third choice in a field of eight. Auto Racing Duel at Daytona: Al Unser Jr. and Danny Sullivan, both in Porsche 962's, were fighting for the lead at the six-hour mark of the Daytona 24-hour endurance race in Daytona Beach, Fla. Unser, teamed with Derek Bell of England and Chip Robinson of New Jersey, held a lead of less than two seconds over the car shared by Sullivan, A. J. Foyt and Al Unser Sr. The younger Unser beat Sullivan out onto the circuit following routine pit stops on lap 166, five and a half hours into the race. Sullivan had inherited the lead from the Porsche 962 of Jochen Mass and Klaus Ludwig of West Germany and Bruce Leven of the United States during the fifth hour. Leven's car led most of the first five hours before a long pit stop due to a collision with a slower car. (AP) Track and Field Best in High Jump: Stefka Kostadinova of Bulgaria set a world indoor best in the women's high jump at Genoa, Italy, clearing 6 feet 8 1/4 inches. She bettered the standard of 6-8, set by Tamara Bykova of the Soviet Union in Budapest in 1983. Kostadinova tried to surpass her outdoor world record of 6-9 3/4, but she missed at 6-10 1/4. (AP) Bobsledding Canadians Crash: An East German team took the lead in the European four-man bobsledding championships at Cervinia, Italy, on a day marred by a spectacular crash by a Canadian sled. East Germany I, piloted by Wolfgang Hoppe, had the best combined time after two runs. The East Germans, who set a course record of 1 minute 2.97 seconds on the first run, compiled a time of 2:04.69. Switzerland I held second place with a combined time of 2:04.83. The USA I sled was seventh in 2:05.68. The Canada III sled was going 67 miles an hour when it flipped on its side and slammed into the lip of the icy track before skidding to a halt. Three of the four team members were injured and were taken to a local hospital by helicopter. The most seriously hurt was Chris Lori, 24, who suffered a broken left collarbone and left hand, shoulder and rib injuries and cuts on the face. (AP) N.B.A. Bullets 106, 76ers 105: Moses Malone scored the last of his 27 points on two free throws with four seconds remaining as the Bullets rallied for 6 points in the final 24 seconds. The 76ers, reduced to the minimum of eight available players by injuries, led by 103-100 after Charles Barkley sank two free throws with 32 seconds remaining. Malone made two foul shots with 24 seconds left and then John Williams of the Bullets intercepted a pass by Mo Cheeks and put Washington ahead by 104-103. After a basket by Barkley put Philadelphia on top by 105-104, Malone was fouled by Roy Hinson after rebounding his missed shot. The 76ers, playing their fifth game in seven days and out of timeouts, had one last chance to win, but Barkley failed to even hit the rim on a 3-point attempt. Barkley finished with 28 points, 17 rebounds and 8 assists. Jeff Malone scored 25 points for the Bullets, who trailed by 91-81 with 8:14 remaining before Williams and Jay Vincent, both reserves, led a comeback. (AP)",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

''Tell me about Baghdad,'' prompts his mother, an alcohol-steeped invalid who, for as long as he can remember, has had to be periodically ''put in storage . . . like a fur.'' David faults his father (a banker given to quoting Blake) for failing to show emotions, but he himself appears the helpless inheritor of a ''mild demeanor and good manners'' - predispositions that enable him, once reassimilated, to drift through the heavily foreshadowed suicide of a family member as if draped in cotton batting. His equanimity also, unfortunately, affords the author an opportunity for gray prose; with David poised on the threshold of his lifelong sweetheart's bedroom, Mr. Milburn actually pauses to describe the decor.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Yet some think he has such power. The 49-year-old executive is one of a handful of financial advisers who devise strategies for managers of pension funds and other huge stock portfolios that will protect them against big losses if stock prices turn down. The approach, known as portfolio insurance, uses stock index futures contracts to offset positions in the stock market to limit their losses to a predetermined proportion of their original investment. (See box.) Many money managers consider this form of hedging less costly and more efficient than simply moving in and out of stocks. ''People always hedged by owning both stocks and bonds,'' said Frederic A. Nelson 3rd, vice president of the Bankers Trust Company.''This is a new form of that.'' It is one of the ironies of this complex computerized age, however, that an approach designed to insure against more losses than they are willing to accept is seen by some as contributing to the very volatility that makes the markets so treacherous for so many investors.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Plagued by the suspicion that we are nothing and haunted by the dread that nothing remains nothing, many regard our epoch as a post age. Postindustrial, postcapitalist, postliberal, posttheological, posthumanist - these posts join in the description of our condition as postmodern. In the postmodern era, God is dead; art is exhausted; philosophy is finished; literature is merely preserved. In Yeats's words, ''Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.'' This anarchy is not merely an intellectual matter. Families are torn by violence, cities plagued by crime and countries paralyzed by terrorism. In the absence of stable foundations, global holocaust seems more than an apocalyptic fantasy.

us,THE LIFE BELOW THE GROUND,"SUBWAY (Aperture, $29.95) by the photographer Bruce Davidson offers a vivid diary of the people who enter this dimmed, often hostile arena. There are pictures of proud young mothers and children, weary businessmen, despairing bag people, menacing young men, and passionate couples embracing. In most cases the sitters are fully aware of being photographed and yet the confines of the train prevents them from donning the mask one ordinarily sees in posed pictures. Through his deft use of light, Mr. Davidson, the author also of ''East 100th Street,'' reveals more color and texture than one expects to find in these seamy, graffiti-riddled environs. He encourages the eye to concentrate on specific details by using a hand-held flash to illuminate the subject. The background falls away into darkness, enhancing the immediacy and intimacy of the photographs. There is a tension in these pictures, as could be predicted of subjects stalked on the subway by a photographer. The least successful are those that border on sensationalism - a crazed bag lady lifting her skirt or an undercover policeman holding a gun to a mugger's head. The strength of the book is in the photographs in which Mr. Davidson conveys his compassion for the individuals who ride New York City's subways.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

As they get older the jokes get dirtier and the ghosts are forgotten. But Jack Matthews gives the impression ''of a man listening to his childhood.'' Like the narrator of his title story, he is a collector of ghost stories, and his characters mutter old riddles as though they're mantras - ''What has four wheels, hemorrhoids, and a dream?'' Mr. Matthews's ''ghostly populations'' sit hunched over the haunted puzzles of their past. Old men take cabs to neighborhoods where they haven't lived for years; younger men scan telephone books for the numbers of former lovers; a couple wanders from resort to resort looking for the screened porch over the lake that is ''set like a fishhook'' in the mind. They travel in what one character jokingly calls ''the bush country of memory,'' and more often than not the country is the American Middle West. Still discernible under the shopping malls and subdivisions is an earlier, pastoral landscape; one can ''stand there in the dirty light of evening and stare out upon the pastel-colored ranch houses, occupying a land that was once covered with oak, beech, and hickory, and populated by foxes and squirrels.'' Some of Mr. Matthews's most effective stories hover in this wistful mood, but he has another way of evoking the lost countryside. He assumes the voices of earlier denizens: turn-of-the-century gunsmiths and Bible college students and foremen of Chinese work gangs. They talk in a tall-tale vernacular, laced with good jokes and bad, but with a postmodern twist. One man is described as ''pale as a corpse, phthisic and thin, but straight as a hoe handle.'' These modern ghost stories (by the novelist and story writer whose last collection was ''Crazy Women'') won't scare your pants off; they will tickle those regions of the mind that still itch for the uncanny.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

With an estimated $5 billion in assets and an annual income of $500 million, the Palestine Liberation Organization's gold, stocks, money-market certificates and Swiss bank accounts are the envy of many major multinational corporations. As James Adams, a correspondent of The Sunday Times of London, shows, this wealthiest of terrorist groups is not state-financed, though Arab countries provided most of the start-up capital. Such self-sufficiency, characteristic of the major terrorist groups today, has been disregarded by target countries, whose counterterrorist programs have focused almost exclusively on preventing attacks or resolving them once they happen, rather than on cutting off terrorists' financial support. Mr. Adams does not suggest how this can be done, but amply demonstrates the resources these organizations have. The I.R.A.'s annual budget of $7 million is financed in part by protection rackets in Northern Ireland, with only $200,000 coming from the Irish Northern Aid (Noraid) group in the United States. Mr. Adams credits the United States with prosecuting Noraid's arms trafficking, but the I.R.A. now relies on Common Market smuggling scams, tax fraud, robberies, gambling, extortion and legitimate front operations - with little British or Irish hindrance. The I.R.A.'s economic clout in Northern Ireland is so great that the author asserts it is impossible to eliminate. The lesson for government policy makers, Mr. Adams concludes, is that today's terrorists have become ''better capitalists,'' who manage their own portfolios.",1987-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Indeed if he had sung the whole role as well as he did the broken-spirited ''Rome Narrative'' in the last act, one would look forward to hearing him again. But the earlier scenes contain different kinds of music - lyrical phrases that he delivered with crude force and approximate accuracy, and vigorously declaimed passages for which he put a harsh, unattractive edge on his sturdy voice. His dramatic involvement was not especially specific, but vigorous, and the voice is a potentially serviceable Wagnerian instrument; one hopes he will strive for a higher standard as he develops in the role.",1987-02-02T05:00:00+0000

Q.Does laughing gas have any adverse effects? A.When administered properly, nitrous oxide or laughing gas has no adverse effects on the central nervous system. However, inhalation of pure nitrous oxide for more than a few minutes can deprive the brain of oxygen and result in brain damage or death. This colorless, sweet-smelling gas is used mainly as an anesthetic in short operations and in dentistry where it is adminstered by the trained physician.

The 35-year-old tournament has been celebrated for its confounding results and the Northeastern victory was unexpected because this team had won only 6 of 25 games this season. Brian Dowd was credited with the winning goal that slipped past Dickie McEvoy in a scramble in front of the Harvard cage. The defeat was only the second for the Crimson, who had been inactive the last 20 days during a break for examinations. Harvard had won its first 15 games before losing to Yale on Jan. 13. Northeastern (7-16-3) and Boston University (12-12-3) will play for the Beanpot championship Monday night at Boston Garden. Boston College (20-6) had beaten Boston University four times this season, scoring 29 goals. But the Boston University goalie, Terry Taillefer, had a shutout until late in the last period and stopped 35 shots.

The 5-year-old son of Majestic Prince-Sensitive Princess earned $19,800 for James Riccio and returned $14.60 for $2 to win. Skiing Zurbriggen Takes Gold: Pirmin Zurbriggen, upset in two previous races, mounted what he said was ''a full-scale attack'' to beat Marc Girardelli for the gold medal yesterday in the first world championship super-giant slalom. ''Now I am a happy man,'' said Zurbriggen, who has won silver medals in the downhill and the combined, but lost his world titles in both events. Zurbriggen was slow out of the gate in the super-giant slalom race, but went through the 43 gates on the 1,553-meter Chetzeron course in 1 minute 19.93 seconds, nearly a second faster than Girardelli. Markus Wasmeier of West Germany, one of the pre-race favorites, nearly lost his balance and had to settle for the bronze with a time of 1:21.08.(AP) N.H.L. Maple Leafs 8, Flyers 4: In Toronto, the line of Peter Ihnacak, Rick Vaive and Steve Thomas combined for four goals and eight assists to help the Maple Leafs end their six-game losing streak. Ihnacak scored twice and had three assists and Thomas had a goal and three assists and Vaive a goal and two assists. The loss was the second in a row for the Flyers, who are starting a four-game trip.

The 35-year-old right-hander, who ended nearly three years of rehabilitation by pitching a three-hit shutout in his first start last April, said his retirement was a mutual decision with the Royals' general manager, John Schuerholz. ''In the best interests of myself, the organization and my family it would be a good time to kind of step down a little and retire from baseball,'' Leonard said. ''I did not want to diminish the things I was able to accomplish in my career.'' Leonard won more games, 130, than any other American League pitcher from 1975-82. He won 20 or more games three times, the only Royals pitcher to do it more than once, and compiled a 144-106 record in 12 seasons. He suffered a crippling knee injury May 28, 1983 while pitching to Cal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles, when he stumbled off the mound and tore the tendon below his left knee. Four knee operations later, Leonard strode to the mound at Royals Stadium before a national television audience on April 16 last season to make his first start since the injury. He threw a three-hitter at the Toronto Blue Jays in a 1-0 Kansas City victory. But the season soured for him as it did for the team as a whole, and he finished 8-13 with a 4.44 earned run average.",1987-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The son-in-law was a top Interior Ministry official until 1984. Page A1 In a deal for Awacs radar planes in 1981, King Fahd and other Saudi Arabian officials agreed to aid anti-Communist guerrilla groups, U.S. officials said. A1 Western journalists in Iran recently observed a regime that has subdued virtually all opposition outside its ranks but that suffers increasingly volatile internal rivalries. A1 Iraq is unlikely to reverse damage -military, political and psychological - that Iran has wrought in its latest offensive despite Baghdad's superior air and firepower, experts say. A6 Attempts to win the release of an American journalist detained in Iran are being undertaken by governments friendly to both the United States and Iran, American officials and diplomatic sources said. A3 Hearings to confirm Robert Gates, the newly nominated Director of Central Intelligence, will not be an occasion for a full-scale public review of the agency's role in the Iran-contra affair, a Senator said. A7 Military analysis: Seizures in Beirut of hostages have prompted a refining of contingency plans for retaliatory air strikes against terrorist camps in the Middle East, Pentagon sources said. A3 Mr. Reagan weighed Pentagon plans for the early deployment of a partial ''Star Wars'' system in a meeting with senior members of his Administration, and reportedly no decision was made. A2 Salvador's soul is in small towns that cover the countryside. The long civil war in which more than 60,000 people have been killed has ground the peasants in these dust-filled hamlets very small. A4 A party shake-up in Vietnam was the result of pressure from grass-roots Communist organizations, according to a Western diplomat based in Hanoi whose impressions were supported by American scholars. A8 NATIONAL A12-21, D24 Wider use of an AIDS test is being considered by Federal health officials, they said. The plan would include testing all applicants for marriage licenses and patients who enter hospitals. A1 The House overrode a veto of a bill aimed at cleaning up the nation's water at a cost of $20 billion. The Senate is expected to take up the measure today, and Democratic leaders predicted a similar override. A1 180 U.S. farms disappear each day, victims of consolidation, changing economics, poor management, bad luck, high interest rates, low crop prices, emotional and financial despair or some of each. A1 U.S. trade figures may be deceiving because it will take more than currency adjustments to close the record $169.8 billion gap between what America bought from abroad in 1986 and what it was able to sell. A1 The House deferred a vote on raises for lawmakers and other Federal officials until after the raises were to take effect, at 12:01 this morning. The vote will thus be either meaningless or the first step in a legal battle to rescind the raises. A13 An amendment on speed limits that would allows states to raise the limit on rural interstate highways to 65 miles an hour was approved by the Senate, 65 to 33. A12 Patrick J. Buchanan will resign from his post as White House communications director effective March 1, he announced. He is the latest hard-line conservative to depart as President Reagan begins his final two years in office. A19 Acid rain poses a serious threat to human health that is too significant to defer protective action, according to representatives of major public health groups who addressed a Congressional panel. A12 Fort Worth is an 'In' place, according to W, the international fashion and society publication that publishes an annual list of such things.

Walliser clinched the gold medal by outracing her teammate, Michela Figini, whom she had beaten in the downhill. Mateja Svet, the rising Yugoslav star who was involved in a car crash three days ago, took the bronze medal in 1:20.23.(AP) N.B.A. Hawks 126, Celtics 123: Dominique Wilkins capped a 54-point performance with a 3-point play with 17 seconds left in overtime, then added a pair of free throws to give Atlanta the victory. Wilkins, who had been bothered by a back injury, didn't get going until after intermission. He scored 13 points in the third quarter, 18 in the fourth and 9 in overtime. It was the third-highest scoring night of his career and his 15th game scoring 40 or more. He scored 16 of Atlanta's last 17 points in regulation, including a basket to tie it at 111 and force the overtime. Then he got the first basket of the overtime. After John Battle's basket, Wilkins stole the ball and scored to give Atlanta a 117-111 lead. Kevin McHale, who wound up with 36 points, got a 3-point play to make it 117-114, but Tree Rollins slammed home a rebound and Glenn Rivers scored to give Atlanta a 121-117 lead. One free throw by McHale and two by Larry Bird made it 121-120. Wilkins got the 3-point play. Bird countered with a 3-point basket to cut the margin to one with 10 seconds to play. Wilkins was fouled on the inbound play and sank two free throws. Bird's 3-point attempt glanced off the back of the rim as time ran out.(AP) 76ers 99, Pacers 94: Roy Hinson and Andrew Toney scored 9 points apiece in the final quarter as Philadelphia rallied to defeat Indiana. It was the Pacers' seventh consecutive loss. Indiana, which led by as many as 9 points in the first half, held an 80-73 advantage with 10:20 left in the game on a rebound basket by Wayman Tisdale. But the 76ers rallied with an 18-10 streak, and Toney gave them their first lead at 91-90 with 4:29 to play. The teams traded points down the stretch until Toney, who had not scored a point until the fourth quarter, broke the 93-93 tie with an 18-foot jumper with 47 seconds left. Tisdale, who had 9 fourth-quarter points for the Pacers, hit one of two free throws to make the score 95-94 with 19 seconds left. But Hinson's two free throws with 10 seconds to play secured the victory.(AP) Nuggets 107, Rockets 105: Lafayette Lever had double figures in points, rebounds and assists for the 10th time this season and Mike Evans scored the go-ahead points with 17 seconds left, giving Denver the victory. The Rockets played most of the game without the starting All-Star forward, Ralph Sampson, who suffered a knee injury in the first quarter. Team doctors said Sampson may have suffered torn cartilage in his left knee. Lever had 26 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists as the Nuggets rallied from a 10-point deficit late in the third quarter. Sampson went to the sidelines for the first time with six minutes to play in the first quarter. He returned briefly in the second quarter but hobbled off again and did not return.(AP) N.H.L. Nordiques 4, Canadiens 1: Michel Goulet extended his scoring streak to four games with a goal and an assist at Quebec. Anton Stastny, Risto Siltanen and Basil McRae also scored for Quebec, which hasn't lost to the Canadiens at the Colisee in two years. The Nordiques bottled up the Canadiens in the first two periods, outshooting Montreal by 20-12 and taking a 4-0 lead. Stastny opened the scoring at 3:25 of the first period with his 17th goal of the season. A Montreal defenseman, Petr Svoboda, blocked the first shot but Stastny made his second effort count and sent a wrist shot over Patrick Roy's shoulder into the net. The Canadiens were penalized for having too many skaters on the ice late in the period, and the Nordiques took advantage of the manpower advantage when Siltanen took a cross-ice pass from David Shaw and whistled a slap shot past Roy's glove with seven seconds left in the opening period. Quebec doubled the score in the second period. Goulet breezed past Chris Chelios and scored his 30th goal of the season with a slick backhanded shot into the lower right corner at 2:11. About three minutes later, Paul Gillis and McRae broke in on Roy and McRae swept Gillis's pass into the net at 5:23. The Canadiens finally beat Mario Gosselin at 3:36 of the third period when Claude Lemieux batted a rebound into the net.(AP) Oilers 4, Blues 2: Mark Napier and Kevin Lowe scored in the first 13 minutes as Edmonton won in St. Louis for the first time in three seasons. Grant Fuhr's strong goaltending helped. Fuhr, making his first start in eight games since he was injured on Jan. 17, withstood a four-shot St. Louis power play midway through the second period. The saves preserved Edmonton's 2-1 lead and the Oilers pulled away in the final period when Jari Kurri and Craig MacTavish scored four minutes apart. The outcome snapped a four-game unbeaten streak for St. Louis, which finished a homestand with a 3-1-1 record. The loss was the Blues' first at home against Edmonton in three seasons.(AP) Indoor Soccer Blast 8, Dynamo Moscow 7: Dynamo Moscow lost for the fourth straight time in its six-city tour of the Major Indoor Soccer League, falling to the Baltimore Blast despite three goals from Vasily Karataev.

Max Apple's latest novel, ''The Propheteers,'' sets out to create a similarly mythic portrait of this nation - and it also mixes real people with wholly invented events in a funny, postmodern brew of slapstick farce - but like the author's earlier works, its animating impulse is not rage but amused reverence, its dominant tone tender nostalgia rather than indignance or disgust.

us,"Safe, Speedy Shucking","ANYONE who has watched a master oyster shucker at an oyster bar must marvel at the speed and skill with which the deed is done. Shucking oysters, however, is more than merely separating the shells: there is a right way and a wrong way. The aim is to open the shell cleanly without severing the fragile meat or spilling the brine. The technique illustrated here can make you an expert with a bit of practice. Before starting, rinse the shells well under cold running water to remove any grit and sand that could get into the meat. STEP 1 Hold the oyster over a cutting surface, the flatter side up and the hinge away from you. With a towel, protect your hand against slips of the oyster knife. Insert the blade into the hinge at the narrow tip. Wiggle the knife as you press it farther into the shell. Be sure to hold the oyster flat to prevent the brine from spilling. STEP 2 When the tip of the blade is securely inside the shell, begin to twist it. The hinge should ''pop'' as it separates. Run the blade around the perimeter, always exerting pressure against the top shell - you do not want to cut through the meat.

If you do this too far in advance of serving, the meat will atrophy and lose flavor. A quick mignonette sauce is good with fresh oysters.

Among the starters, only J. R. Reid is healthy. The injury list: Kenny Smith (surgical knee), Joe Wolf (flu), Jeff Lebo (flu), Dave Popson (bruised leg), Rodney Hyatt (stress fracture in leg), Scott Williams (bruised thigh). . . . Dave Langevin, a free-agent defenseman, has signed a contract with the Los Angeles Kings for the remainder of the season. . . . Kevin LaVallee, left wing of the Pittsburgh Penguins, will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and be sidelined for at least two weeks. . . . Tony Robinson and Kenneth Cooper will spend six additional months in the Knox County Penal Farm because they violated work-release rules, a judge ruled yesterday. Robinson, the former University of Tennessee quarterback, was serving 90 days at the penal farm, on a six-year sentence after he pleaded no contest last November to charges of attempting to sell cocaine to an undercover narcotics officer. Cooper, who had also been convicted on drug charges, was serving 150 days of an eight-year term.",1987-02-05T05:00:00+0000
us,Q&A,"Q.The siding on my house is rough sawn cedar. I have been told not to caulk the joints where the boards overlap as the siding must breathe. Is this true, and will caulking cause sweating and condensation? A.It probably will not cause condensation, but it is unlikely to do much good: this siding is not meant to be very airtight. The cold air is supposed to be kept out by a watertight and relatively airtight sheathing under the sheathing, such as building paper or felt paper. Q.The outside wall in our bedroom gets wet when it is very cold outside. Our house is brick, with no room between the brick and the wall for insulation. We have painted the wall with a paint that is supposed to aid insulation, but the wall still gets wet. A chemical dehumidifier hung in the room has not helped, either. Have you any suggestions? A.The outside wall is too cold, so when warm moist air from inside touches it, condensation forms. The paint will not help, because it is a vapor barrier: it keeps moisture vapor from passing through the wall from inside, but does not prevent condensation inside.",1987-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Sampson Injures Knee,"This season has not gone smoothly for the Houston Rockets, who are 23-22 after reaching the championship round of the National Basketball Association playoffs last spring before losing to the Boston Celtics. Now things are much worse. Ralph Sampson, Houston's 7-foot-4-inch power forward and center, will probably miss the rest of the season after injuring his left knee in a game Tuesday night against the Denver Nuggets. An examination yesterday showed a large tear in the cartilage, and team officials said surgery might be necessary. But Sampson said a doctor had advised him against such a procedure. ''Right now, he's going on the one opinion he's had,'' said Bill Fitch, the Rockets' coach. ''We are holding off until he talks to the other doctor that is going to be involved. If I had to say, it would be my opinion he's going to take the safe approach.'' Richard Vandervoort, the team trainer, said: ''It is in no way a career-threatening situation. At this point, we don't feel there is any ligament damage.'' Even more frustrating is that shoe polish may have been responsible for the injury. The polish was left on the court at the Summit by a drill team practicing before Tuesday night's game. The scuff marks were removed with turpentine, and players said slippery spots remained at the start of the game. Sampson slipped in the first quarter, left the game, then returned for the start of the second but played less than one minute. ''I wanted to test it,'' Sampson said. ''I thought it had just popped out of joint and would be O.K.'' Tom Chambers, a forward for the Seattle SuperSonics, will replace Sampson on the Western Conference roster in the All-Star Game Sunday.",1987-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,POP AND JAZZ GUIDE,"Lee Konitz, New School, 66 West 12th Street (741-5667). For an active musician who has played an unusually significant role in the development of jazz, the alto saxophonist Lee Konitz is heard surprisingly infrequently in New York, despite the fact that he lives in the city. In the post-war 1940's, Mr. Konitz was a key member of two groundbreaking groups - Lennie Tristano's adventurous combos and the nine-member Miles Davis ensemble that is credited with creating ''cool'' jazz. At a time when almost all young alto saxophonists were copying Charlie Parker, Mr. Konitz provided a ''different'' voice on alto just as, a decade earlier, Lester Young was a new tenor-saxophone voice different from the established sound of Coleman Hawkins. Mr. Konitz will make one of his rare appearances, with Harold Danko at the piano, tonight at 6 in the Bernard Mayer Auditorium of the New School as part of the ''Jazz at 6'' series. Tickets are $7.",1987-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,'THE TWO MRS. GRENVILLES' ON NBC,"NBC'S four-hour production of ''The Two Mrs. Grenvilles'' - being broadcast this Sunday and Monday at 9 P.M. - is a good television movie that, with a touch more gumption, could have been terrific. Based on Dominick Dunne's best-selling novel, which in turn was loosely based on the actual William Woodward Jr. society shooting case in 1955, this is the kind of film that once would have starred Bette Davis or Miriam Hopkins. In fact, the opening credits are displayed against the background of artfully arranged satin that was a fixture in ''serious'' movies several decades ago. Naturally, a piano pounds romantically on the soundtrack. Quick, grab the popcorn. Make no mistake, this is dandy television. With Susan Pollock as executive producer and Preston Fischer (''Lace'') as producer, the accomplished director John Erman has persuaded two splendid actresses to play the Mrs. Grenvilles. Ann-Margret is Ann, the showgirl who marries William (Billy) Grenville Jr., very wealthy and very Social Register. And Claudette Colbert is Alice, William's widowed mother, the matriarch who still calls her grown son Junior. Stephen Collins is Billy, and John Rubinstein is his best friend, Bratsie Bleeker. Elizabeth Ashley is Babette Van Degan, Ann's best friend and herself a former showgirl, and Penny Fuller is Cordelia Grenville, the only one of Billy's three sisters to show Ann the slightest civility.",1987-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"NEWS SUMMARY: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1987","INTERNATIONAL 3-5, 28 Senator Nunn warned the President that the Administration would provoke a ''constitutional crisis'' if it adopted a broad intepretation of the ABM treaty of 1972 without extensive consultation with Congress. Page 1 The Kremlin wants to negotiate and to press ahead with arms control talks but is uncertain of President Reagan's political strength, according to former American officials who spoke to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 1 A year after Haiti's dictator fled, demonstrations, strikes and lynchings have become commonplace, unemployment has increased and violent crime has soared. But people are free to speak their minds. 1 Military analysis: An Iraqi success against Iranian forces on the outskirts of Basra appears to have given Iraq the upper hand in the six-week-old battle, according to American military specialists. 3 Gerald F. Seib arrived in Zurich after his release from Iran and said he was ''thrilled and thankful'' to be free. The American journalist was seized in Iran last weekend and later accused of espionage. 3 Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf region and throughout the Middle East appears to be increasing, partly as the result of growing strains between the United States and the Arab world. 3 Terry Waite may be freed next week although he is now in captivity, the Lebanese magazine that first reported American arms sales to Iran said in the latest unconfirmed report on the Anglican emissary's fate. 28 The Philippine cease-fire will end tomorrow, and Communist peace negotiators are going into hiding, including 50 rebels who have received safe-conduct passes for the duration of the two-month truce. 4 A feud over a French art collection has unfolded, as the Mayor of Lille has taken on the Government over where a collection of scale models of frontier cities should be displayed. 4 A secret State Department contract of $276,186 was awarded last year to a public relations company that reportedly worked with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North to rally support for military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. 5 Two Soviet failures in space were reported by American experts who said the rocket and satellite failures occurred a week before the successful launching of astronauts to the Soviet Union's Mir space station. 8 NATIONAL 6-8, 50 Rules for employers of farm workers must be issued by the Labor Department to require that toilets, drinking water and other sanitation facilities be provided, according to a Federal appeals court ruling. 1 No increase in racial violence has occurred in the United States, according to William Bradford Reynolds, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. His speech infuriated civil rights leaders. 1 The unemployment rate stayed pat at 6.6 percent last month, as the new jobs created by the economy were balanced out by more people seeking work, the Labor Department reported. 7 Evacuation plans at nuclear plants were the subject of a proposal submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by its staff. It warned that state and local cooperation is crucial to make the plans work. 50 The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced no reason to bolster controls over American reactors, a special study group of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concluded. 50 Anti-smoking rules went into effect in Federal Government buildings, prompting groans in some corners and cheers in others. The new official Government policy prohibits smoking in all but designated areas. 30 Six children held by two men in what was apparently a satanic cult are the focus of an inquiry, spanning several states, that seeks to identify them. The children were found Thursday in a park in Tallahassee, Fla. 6 A lawsuit says the immigration law puts many illegal aliens in jeopardy because, as one immigration lawyer explained, some employers are ''going overboard and laying off people who have been with them for years.'' 6 Stemming Chicago air traffic errors is the goal of new recommendations issued by the National Transportation Safety Board, which said it was not satisfied with Federal Aviation Administration measures. 7 Man in the News: Dennis R. Patrick, President Reagan's choice to become chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has opinions that are in synch with those of his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler. 50 A move to make the W-4 form easier for people to fill out was promised by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The I.R.S. may issue a new set of instructions and worksheet, he said. 33 A man starved himself to death in Grand Junction, Colo., 16 days after a judge granted him the right to die. The man, Hector Rodas, was a quadriplegic who could not speak or move. 6 Atlanta meets its past 6 WASHINGTON TALK 8 The homeless become an issue REGIONAL 29-32 New York anti-smoking rules were adopted unanimously by the State Public Health Council. The regulations would prohibit smoking in most indoor areas and restrict it on the job and in most restaurants. 1 Opening the 63d Street tunnel and three new subway stations by October 1989 are part of a plan approved by the Transportation Authority, which hopes to greatly improve service on the Queens Boulevard line. 1 An abused girl with an I.Q. of 70 was described by prosecutors as ''innocent, vulnerable and easily victimized.'' The 13-year-old was raped in her adoptive parents' home and sexually abused in two city facilities. 29 A Federal agent was shot in the jaw during a raid in the Bronx that the authorities said grew out of an investigation of a multimillion-dollar cocaine distribution ring. The agent was in satisfactory condition. 29 Wedtech executives kept records, including copies of receipts and bills for vacations, for thousands of dollars in bribes paid to Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, law-enforcement officials said. 29 New York's savings banks are back, thanks to lower interest rates, balance-sheet restructuring, diversification and a removal of usury ceilings.

''Coach Duhon indicated in October that he would not seek a renewal of his contract. My recommendation, and I feel the university's position, will be not to renew any of the present staff's contracts for 1987-88,'' he said. His prepared statement was made public yesterday after the Southland Conference commissioner, Dick Oliver, announced penalties against the McNeese program and all current coaches. Those include two years' probation, loss of all conference basketball revenues for this season and next season, and loss of two of 13 basketball scholarships for the next two years. Brevell said the school channeled money to student athletes through representatives of the university's athletics interests and let a student play basketball while taking less than a full-time course schedule.",1987-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,DEMPSEY JOINS INDIANS,"Rick Dempsey, who established himself behind the plate in 10 years with the Baltimore Orioles, signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians yesterday and will now have to compete for the No. 1 catching job with Chris Bando and Andy Allanson. The 37-year-old Dempsey earned $442,000 last year with Baltimore, but the Orioles refused to pick up his 1987 option for $600,000. His contract with Cleveland calls for a $400,000 salary, $275,000 of which is guaranteed, with an option year at $550,000. Since Dempsey is a Type A free agent, the Indians will have to relinquish their No. 1 pick in the June draft to Baltimore as compensation. The choice will be the 15th pick over all in the draft. Dempsey hit a career-high 13 home runs in 1986, 10 more than hit by Allanson and Bando combined. In 122 games last year, he batted .208 with 29 r.b.i. During his career he has averaged .238. . . . R.

''I carried it around just to show off,'' said the West German star, who completed two rounds over the Waialae Country Club course in 134, 10 under par. Langer said he used a 3-wood off most tees because ''I'm hitting it pretty good and I just wanted to keep it in play.'' The strategy helped produce the best round of the tournament, a bogey-free effort that included one string of four consecutive birdies. He was tied with Couples, who shot a 65 while playing in the same threesome as Langer. (AP) Lopez Rallies to Tie: Nancy Lopez shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday to make up a six-stroke deficit and tie Chris Johnson at five-under 139 for the lead after two rounds in the Sarasota Classic in Florida. The seven-birdie round was the best of the two-week-old Ladies Professional Golf Association season for Lopez, who missed most of the 1986 tour to have a baby. She has 34 victories in 10 seasons as a professional and needs one more victory to qualify for the tour's Hall of Fame. Johnson, the first-round leader Thursday after shooting 67 on the 6,124-yard course at Bent Tree Country Club, retained a share of the lead with a 72 yesterday that featured two birdies and two bogeys. Jane Geddes and Kathy Baker, who shot 66 and 68, respectively, trailed by one shot. (AP) N.H.L. Red Wings 6, North Stars 4: In Detroit, Gerard Gallant scored two power-play goals and Steve Yzerman added a goal and three assists last night for the Red Wings. Detroit trails the North Stars by 1 point in the race for the Norris Division lead, with the teams set for a rematch tonight in Bloomington, Minn. Gallant scored his first goal at 14:16 of the second period, converting Brent Ashton's centering pass for his 26th goal of the season to tie at 2-2. Gallant added his second goal, the game-winner, midway through the final period, backhanding a rebound past Kari Takko, Minnesota's goalie, to stretch the Red Wings' lead to 5-3. (AP) Whalers 5, Capitals 2: Sylvain Turgeon scored two goals in 2 minutes 49 seconds in the third period to spark Hartford. John Anderson also scored twice, including an empty-net goal with 1:02 left, as the Whalers moved past Montreal into first place in the Adams Division. The Capitals, playing at home in Landover, Md., wasted a chance to break a third-place tie with the Rangers in the Patrick Division. Turgeon's first goal came on a slap shot from the left point at 2:34 of the third period, which deflected off Greg Smith, a Washington defenseman, and past Bob Mason. Turgeon scored again at 5:23, putting a rebound past Mason after first deflecting a shot by Stewart Gavin. Mason was then replaced in the net by Pete Peeters after that goal, which gave Hartford a 4-1 lead. (AP) Jets 6, Kings 1: In Winnipeg, Paul MacLean had a goal and two assists for the Jets. MacLean assisted on goals by Doug Smail and Dale Hawerchuk to help the Jets pile up a 4-0 lead after two periods, then scored in the third as Winnipeg completed the rout. The game's strangest goal came at 9:31 of the second period. With the teams playing with four men each, Dave Ellett, a Winnipeg defenseman, circled behind the Los Angeles net and threw a pass into the slot. Steve Duchesne, a Los Angeles defenseman, corralled the puck on his stick, then rifled it into his net past his startled goaltender, Roland Melanson. The Jets got other goals from Ray Neufeld and Jim Nill, who scored on a spectacular third-period breakaway. Duchesne was still shaking his head in the locker room after putting the puck into the wrong net. ''That's the worst one there is,'' he said, slumping in his dressing room stall. ''I tried to put the puck in the corner, but I missed. It's my fault.'' (AP) M.I.S.L. Comets 8, Express 5: Dale Mitchell scored four goals to lead Kansas City to victory over the New York Express last night in Kansas City, Mo. Mitchell, 10th in the league in scoring with 28 goals and nine assists, scored once in every quarter. New York (2-21) got goals from Ricky Davis and Pesa in the second half.

us,HARLEM IN THE JAZZ AGE,"FOR THE BLACK ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, POLITICIANS and entrepreneurs who converged on Harlem in the 1920's and created what came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance, it was a time when everything seemed possible - a time, as a former resident recalled, when ''it was truly bliss to be alive.'' Not only did blacks take pride in their African heritage, pride in black folklore, pride in just being black, but it also seemed natural to believe that art could bridge the formidable gap between the black and white worlds, that excellence and merit could produce social change. That extraordinary decade will be evoked on Thursday, when ''Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America'' opens at the Studio Museum in Harlem. The majority of the show's nearly 200 paintings, sculpture, illustrations, woodcuts and photographs are by five black artists: the painters Palmer Hayden, William H. Johnson and Aaron Douglas (whose woodcut is shown on the facing page), the sculptor Meta Warrick Fuller and the photographer James Van Der Zee. Perhaps more than any other visual artist, it was Van Der Zee (whose photographs appear on these pages), who captured the style and elan of Harlem in the Jazz Age.",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE BRIDGE. By Maggie Hemingway. (Atheneum, $13.95.) The jacket illustration for this imaginative first novel is a detail from a painting by the British impressionist Philip Steer. A slender woman, closely watched by a man, stands on a bridge and gazes at the sunset beyond a little harbor. During the 1880's Steer summered, mostly alone, in a tiny village on the Suffolk coast called Walberswick. After 1891 he never returned, and, according to Maggie Hemingway, the quality of his work diminished. He died at 82, a bachelor, leaving instructions that all his papers be destroyed. Ms. Hemingway wonders why he left a place that inspired him to sensual, vital, fresh work. Her novel posits a frustrated Victorian romance for the solitary artist, an untenable passion that made the village ultimately unbearable. She imagines a lonely young matron, Isobel Heatherington, summering at Quay House, near the bridge, on the way to the beach. Isobel is accompanied by her pretty daughters, Maria, Sophie and the mischievous Emma. ''They hovered there in the doorway in a cloud of white muslin, clutching straw boaters with long ribbons and looking . . . like a vision of perfect innocence and sisterliness.'' This is a blurred timescape of the British past that is sometimes Victorian, sometimes actually Edwardian - H. E. Bates territory, in the spirit of L. P. Hartley's ''Go-Between.'' It was most successfully occupied, recently, by Isabel Colgate in ''The Shooting Party.'' Everything is prefigured and genteel. If you like your tea and fiction delicately seasoned and served exquisitely, this short novel may be a perfect midwinter cup.",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

They have been attracting attention because they confront audiophiles with contrasting design precepts. Nakamichi relies on the appeal of a new circuit to maximize the performance obtainable with its modest wattage, plus a set of simple but sufficient operating controls. Yamaha offers ample power from a conventional circuit along with a plethora of clever and useful controls.

While confessing that they did not know how long it would last, both sides agreed that $18-a-barrel oil was good for consumers and producers. So much for the talk. What about the economic realities? First, look at what caused the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to unravel last year. As with all cartels, excess capacity became OPEC's Achilles' heel. To impose artifically high prices, OPEC had to reduce output, leaving it with some excess capacity in the early 1970's. The market force of artificially high prices pushed down world demand by 15 percent from from 1979 through 1985. Also, the supply of oil from the non-OPEC interlopers rose by almost 50 percent from 1973 through 1985. Thus, OPEC had to again dramatically reduce its output - to nearly 50 percent below its peak in 1977, leaving it with even more excess capacity.",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

In earlier days, before radio, records and television, it was also an integral part of the education of every music-lover. All symphonic and chamber music was published in four-hand versions so that amateur and professional alike could become familiar with the content of the scores, Most four-hand music, aimed at the amateur as it was, did not need a virtuoso technique. The necessary requirements were, and are, musical curiosity, a love for making music and a compatible partner. How many of us, as children or young students, went through the literature - not only original four-hand music, but also arrangements of Mozart and Haydn symphonies and string quartets, Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler! How many amiable arguments there were! Keep out of my way, you clown! Look, I have the solo, not you, so keep that bass down! Ouch! You stabbed my pinkie! Rhythm! Rhythm! Can't you count? Playing two-piano music also is fun, but how many living rooms contain two pianos? Anyway, three recent CD disks combine four-hand and two-piano music. The disk with the two biggest pianistic names also contains two of the most famous pieces of their kind in the literature - Schubert's four-hand F minor Fantasy and Mozart's Sonata in D for two pianos (Columbia compact disk MK 39516; also LP and cassette). The pianists are Radu Lupu and Murray Perahia.",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

Srully Blotnick, a business consultant and author, writes with his numbers instead of his heart. Mr. Blotnick, whose previous books are ''The Corporate Steeplechase'' and ''Otherwise Engaged: The Private Lives of Successful Career Women,'' here analyzes successful men. He finds that in a study he conducted, ambitious men fall into four groups: the working-class man seeking autonomy, the hard-driving entrepreneur seeking respect, the accommodating service worker who wants life to be as social as possible and the creative loner interested in making something original. He idealizes these into types and shows which men are likely to succeed and how, and what their failings are likely to be. Some of his findings are interesting: few men who see business and finance as a dog-eat-dog world went on to become wealthy; the ratio of immigrants among the successful in this study was high. Mr. Blotnick found that those men who were willing to change could eliminate their weaknesses. Despite much interesting information, the author's bloodless approach mitigates his impact. He writes of men as if they existed in a vacuum, affected little by friends or family, less by women. And while carefully defining success in a material sense, it still seems surprising that the ambitious men Mr. Blotnick writes about frequently sound so much like losers.",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

The discussion centers on AIDS, but worries about other sexually transmitted diseases, teen-age pregnancies and matters of religion and morality arise, too. Inevitably, television is drawn into the discussion. It is seen, as always, as both a cause and a cure for the problem.

Montgomery, who twice had points taken away for butting, was disqualified by Referee James Molinell at 2:29 of the fifth round after he again lunged into Curry with his head. A furious Curry followed Montgomery as Molinell led him away and hit him from behind with a right to the head. The punch started a near-brawl as cornermen from both camps raced into the ring and tried to fight one another before security guards and fight officials managed to gain control. It led the Nevada State Athletic Commission to announce that the purses of both fighters would be withheld pending a viewing of the tape of the bout. Curry, from Fort Worth, is 26-1 with 20 knockouts. Montgomery, from Detroit, lost his first bout in 18 career starts. (AP) Skiing Hess Captures Slalom: Switzerland's Erika Hess made the fastest second run to win the women's slalom at the Alpine Ski World championships and add a sixth -and probably last - gold medal to her record-breaking career. Hess, who says she will retire at the end of this season, sped through the 55 gates in the second-run time of 46.51 seconds to overtake Austria's Roswitha Steiner, at Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Hess finished with a total time of 1:33.30, to Steiner's 1:33.55. Mateja Svet of Yugoslavia took her second bronze and third medal of the championships. The best American finisher was Eva Twardokens of Olympic Valley, Calif., who was ninth at 1:35.59. (AP) Golf Lopez Ahead by 5 Shots: Nancy Lopez opened a five-shot lead after three rounds of the $200,000 Sarasota Classic , firing a four-under-par 68 to fuel her bid to qualify for the Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall of Fame on the same Florida course where she won her first tournament nine years ago. Lopez, who started the day tied for the lead with Chris Johnson, pulled away from the field with four birdies on the front nine of the par-72, 6,124-yard Bent Tree Country course. Lopez won her first tour victory in the 1978 Bent Tree Ladies Classic. Lopez, winner of 34 L.P.G.A. events, added birdies on No. 13 and No. 17 and finished the day with a 54-hole total of 9-under-par 207. Her nearest rivals, at 212, were Cathy Morse and Kathy Baker, who shot 71 and 72, respectively. Lopez needs one victory to qualify for the Hall of Fame. (AP) Stadler Ties Course Record: Craig Stadler matched the course record with a 10-under-par 62 to take a one-stroke lead over Paul Azinger after three rounds of the $600,000 Hawaiian Open at Honolulu. Stadler, who has not won in two and a half seasons, made 10 birdies in the ideal playing conditions - including a string of five in a row - and completed 54 holes in 200, 16 shots under par. Stadler's third-round effort tied the course record held by Hale Irwin and Nick Faldo of Britain, both in 1981. Azinger, who scored his first PGA Tour victory in Phoenix last month, moved into second with a 65 that put him at 201. (AP) Track and Field Atkins a Double Winner: Dianne Atkins, Joe McDonald and Paul Vandergrift turned in impressive performances in the Army interscholastic meet in the West Point Field House. Atkins, a 17-year-old senior at Malverne (L.I.) High School who is considered the leading girls' sprinter in New York State, was a double winner. She took the 55-meter dash in 7.16 seconds and the 200-meter dash in 25.54 seconds. McDonald, competing for Kingston (N.Y.) High School, just missed being a triple winner. The senior had victories in the long jump at 22 feet 9 1/4 inches and the triple jump at 45-10, but he finished second in the high jump at 6-4. Vandergrift, one of the top middle-distance runners in the East from Archbishop Kennedy High School in Conshohocken, Pa., was the winner of the 1,000-meter run in 2 minutes 30.20 seconds. In other events, Tilden of Brooklyn equaled the New York State record in the girls' 1,600-meter relay in 3:54; Ann Letko of North Hunterdon, N.J., registered one of the fastest 3,000-meter times in the country this season in winning the girls' event in 9:58.2; and Steve Edden of DeWitt Clinton in the Bronx took the 800-meter run in 1:56.73. New York Team Excels: New York athletes won 20 of 26 events last night to defeat a Boston team for the third straight year in the Reebok Challenge Cup indoor meet in Yale's Coxe Cage. The New York squad tallied 170 points to Boston's 78. Michele Bush led the New York team with victories in the women's 1,500 meters (4 mintues 22.35 seconds) and 3,000 meters (9:40.91). Nnennah Lynch, a sophomore at Hunter College High School, posted a national class indoor best for 1,500 meters when she ran 4:27.74 behind Bush. The former sophomore mark was 4:30.1 set by Christine Curtin of Bellmore, L.I., in 1982. Horse Racing Quick Closing Rallies: Quick Closing, who raced as part of an entry with Fine Dining, rallied strongly through the stretch to score 1 3/4-length victory in the $72,000 Level Best Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Aqueduct. Quick Closing, who carried 112 pounds, was ridden by E. T. Baird, who rode four winners on the day. Super Cook, who led into the stretch, held on to be second, a half-length ahead of Center Box. Bold Mate, the even-money favorite on the strength of her victory in the Busanda Stakes Jan. 11, tired badly to finish eighth in the field of nine. Quick Closing returned $27 for $2 to win as the fifth choice. N.H.L. Bruins 8, Maple Leafs 5: Cam Neely had his first three-goal game in the league and Michael Thelven, a defenseman, scored twice, as the Bruins took their ninth victory in the last 11 games. Thelven, who underwent shoulder surgery last fall and had only 1 goal in 13 previous games this season, scored in the first and second periods. (AP) Nordiques 5, Sabres 2: Michel Goulet and Peter Stastny had two goals each for Quebec. Anton Stastny had a goal and two assists for Quebec. He has 5 goals and 6 assists in his last six games. (AP) Penguins 4, Blackhawks 1: Craig Simpson scored two goals to help end a three-game losing streak. Gilles Meloche lost his shutout at 11:02 of the third period when Doug Wilson tapped in a rebound of Denis Savard's shot. A Pittsburgh defenseman, Rod Buskas, was given a match penalty in the second period for intent to injure. Buskas attacked Bob Murray after Murray was given a major penalty for high sticking Simpson. The match penalty carries an automatic suspension pending league review. (AP) Whalers 3, Canadiens 1: Sylvain Turgeon and Dean Evason scored second-period goals and Mike Liut made 23 saves to keep the Whalers atop the Adams Division. The victory, the eighth in the last 11 games, gave the Whalers into a 3-point lead over the Canadiens and Bruins. (AP)",1987-02-08T05:00:00+0000

The horrors that haunt his characters today - the 20th century's police inquisitions, pogroms and wars - are the same specters that hung over ''After the Fall'' and ''Incident at Vichy,'' plays he wrote for the first Lincoln Center theater company, more than two decades ago. What has changed with time is the writer's perspective. In ''I Can't Remember Anything'' and its companion piece, ''Clara,'' characters of Mr. Miller's American generation look back at history's cataclysms and their own liberal crusades to ask what, if any, good came of it all. The answers they find are at best ambiguous - a moral gray area where once the author of ''The Crucible'' and ''All My Sons'' would have found clear-cut blacks and whites.",1987-02-09T05:00:00+0000

The 27-year-old Woerndl gave West Germany its first gold medal ever in the event and led a medal sweep over the favorites in the final event of the two-week championships. Guenther Mader of Austria, who was picked over Bernhard Gstrein, his teammate, just 24 hours before the race, took the silver to add to his bronze in the combined. Another West German, Armin Bittner, who led Woerndl by one-hundredth of a second after the first run, settled for the bronze. Felix McGrath of Norwich, Vt., the only American among the finishers, was 10th in 1 minute 56.29 seconds.

Elliott crossed the finish line about one car-length ahead of Geoff Bodine, who was just inches ahead of Waltrip.

Shultz, who said he was reflecting President Reagan's thinking. Page A1 Andrei D. Sakharov sees change in the Soviet handling of human rights but does not know how far it's going to go. He said in an interview, ''Something real is happening.'' A1 White House officials knew in 1986 that the United States was dealing with radical, not moderate, elements in Iran to gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon, aides to Vice President Bush said. A1 Leading senators are divided over the propriety and wisdom of the Reagan Administration's policy of soliciting money from foreign governments to help the Nicaraguan rebels and other guerrilla groups. A8 A threat to kill hostages in Beirut came from a clandestine group that kidnapped three American professors and an Indian scholar last month. The group seeks the release of 400 Arabs held in Israeli jails. A8 A hostage's family is 'holding on,' according to the American wife of Alec Collett, a 65-year-old British journalist working for the United Nations who disappeared almost two years ago in Lebanon. A8 In Manila, finding the 'hidden wealth' of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos is the task assigned to a presidential commission that, in less than a year, has become in effect the nation's largest conglomerate. A1 Mrs. Marcos left 1,060 pairs of shoes and slippers behind, according to a new inventory, including one battery-run pair that glows in the dark. It had been reported that she owned 3,000 pairs. A12 A party power-struggle in Britain is under way, as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her opponents position themselves for a general election that could reshape party politics. The election date has not been set. A3 Botswana has lived under a shadow of what some call ''demonstration sanctions'' by its neighbor, South Africa, for almost two months. A South African tribal ''homeland'' has in effect demanded recognition by requiring Botswana citizens to obtain visas. A4 Hu Yaobang is in a Peking hospital for an undisclosed illness, according to a Chinese source, three weeks after he resigned in disgrace as the chief of China's Communist Party. He was said to be ''distraught.'' A3 NATIONAL A13-16, B12 The cost of medical care rose 7.7 percent last year, or seven times as fast as overall inflation, according to new Government data that indicate medical inflation remains a serious problem. A1 The U.S. insurance crisis is ending as abruptly as it began. Last year, liability insurance was hard to get because companies, citing coverage cancellations and sharp premium increases, refused to renew policies. A1 Teen-agers who mediate conflicts are the mainstay of Project Smart, which has outposts in six New York City high schools and is part of a national movement to tap the positive force of peer pressure. A1 The Pentagon will review contracts on military data processing given to foreign countries in the hope of preventing leaks of information to foreign governments, a Defense Department official says. A13 More local taxing powers for cities are being pressed by state officials around the country because cuts in Federal aid have so weakened many city and county governments. A14 A Miami suburb is getting a facelift by promoting the old instead of the new. An ordinance adopted last year created special districts within Coral Gables, Fla., to encourage development in its Mediterranean style. A14 A new bridge across the Tampa Bay in southwest Florida, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, connects St. Petersburg with Bradenton and Sarasota, making largely rural portions of the state easily accessible. A15 Philadelphia's court system is mired in a crisis, plagued by corruption charges and a growing backlog of cases.

us,Q&A,"Q. How do bullet-proof vests work? A. Most lightweight bullet-resistant garments are made of Kevlar, a material developed by the Du Pont Company. Kevlar, once described as ''the step beyond nylon,'' is formed of fibers of aromatic polyamide, ultra-strong chains of carbon atoms. The material resists penetration by low-velocity projectiles like shrapnel and pistol bullets. A bullet fired at a Kevlar garment first encounters a few yarns of the fabric, and the yarns spread the impact energy of the bullet to other yarns until the entire garment is engaged in resisting the bullet. Eventually, the bullet deforms or flattens. Bullet-resistant garments contain 10 to 30 layers of Kevlar depending on the degree of protection required. As the number of layers increases so does the degree of protection. Kevlar vests used by police officers typically weigh about three pounds. Garments made of a combination of ceramic and hardened steel backed by Kevlar can resist high-velocity rifle bullets. The steel blunts the bullet and the Kevlar catches it. These are used by soldiers and SWAT teams. Q. What are the causes of albinism? A. There are several kinds of albinism, or the lack of normal pigmentation. Its most extreme form, universal albinism, is a hereditary disease caused by the lack of melanin, the dark brown pigment normally present in the skin, hair and eyes. The inability of melanocytes, or pigment cells, to produce melanin is believed to result from a lack of tyrosinase, an enzyme necessary for its production. When a person lacks the gene responsible for the normal production of tyrosinase and inherits a gene for no pigmentation from both parents, albinism occurs. There are two other kinds of human albinism: ocular albinism, affecting only the eyes, and localized albinism, in which small areas of the body lack pigment. Complete albinism occurs in about one in 20,000 people and affects all races.",1987-02-10T05:00:00+0000

The Kings also dismissed another assistant coach, Frank Hamblen. They replaced him with Don Buse, a former N.B.A. player. It was the second time the Kings had dismissed Johnson as head coach. He coached the club, then in Kansas City, from 1973 through 1978, and returned to the head coaching post in 1984 after working as an assistant in Chicago and Utah. The Kings managing general partner, Gregg Lukenbill, said Johnson and Hamblen were let go because ''we need a new direction'' and that the team was not playing up to its potential under Johnson. The team currently has a 14-32 record. Neither Johnson nor Hamblen was available for comment. Lukenbill said that the Kings' especially poor showing last Wednesday against the Los Angeles Lakers ''brought things to a head,'' but that a coaching change would have been made anyway. The Kings set several dubious N.B.A. records in the first quarter of that 128-92 loss to the Lakers. The Kings missed all 18 shots from the field in that period, trailed by 29-0 at one point, and ended the 12-minute quarter trailing, 40-4.",1987-02-10T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 News analysis: The U.S. and Europe have had a cluster of disputes that are spreading malaise within the Atlantic alliance and raising questions about the Reagan Administration's command over foreign policy. A1 Afghan guerrillas shot down a plane in the eastern part of the country and said 43 military men on board were killed. But Afghanistan's Soviet-backed Government said victims were mostly women, children and elderly men. A1 Kidnappers extended a deadline ''until further notice'' for Israel to release 400 Arab prisoners. Three American professors and an Indian scholar are held hostage. A15 India contacts Iran on hostage A15 No changes for the better in Beirut could be seen by a Lebanese man who returned after six weeks abroad. Used cars imported from European countries speed through the streets, dodging garbage strewn everywhere. A14 A definition of an Iranian moderate was attempted by the White House, where the spokesman said that term was used to describe ''people who would have some reason to be friendly to the United States.'' A3 Systematic killings by the contras were described in a report by Americas Watch, a human rights organization, which also reported widespread rights violations by the Nicaraguan Government. A10 A West German coalition collapsed when a cabinet member from the environmentalist party in Hesse, the first to hold office in West Germany, was dismissed by that state's Premier. The coalition had lasted 14 months. A8 Japan's interest in heart transplants is reviving amid widening debate over when and how a doctor may declare a patient dead. Japan's first and last heart transplant was two decades ago. A4 National A16-21, B20 Support for catastrophic illness insurance is expected from President Reagan, for a program much like one proposed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Administration officials said. A1 Selling water rights is more common in the arid West as the demand for water in urban areas outpaces supplies in mountain rivers and reservoirs, and the increase has prompted debate. A1 Streamlining export controls that the nation maintains chiefly to keep high technology out of Soviet hands is the goal of sweeping proposals that were announced by the Commerce Department. A1 The dollar was battered in waves of heavy selling after Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said no meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers was planned to stabilize the currency. D1 A Vatican commission of 3 bishops has been appointed to evaluate the governing arrangement in Seattle, where Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen was superseded by an auxiliary bishop in a disciplinary move. A16 A ban on Federal aid for abortions or to groups that counsel clients about such services is the crux of a new legislative proposal that the President endorsed late last month, sources said. A20 No evidence of a cult kidnapping has been found in an investigation of six children found last week in Tallahassee, Fla., the authorities said, adding that the group that was raising them does not seem to be involved in child abuse. A21 Orange County, Calif., is Republican through and through, a place where loyalists still root for Mr. Reagan and never think he is wrong. ''This is Reagan Country,'' one resident said. A16 The importance of child care to employers who want to keep experienced workers on the job is likely to grow, a new study indicates. A18 A discovery of a Freud manuscript, ''A Phylogenetic Fantasy,'' which had long been thought lost, promises to touch off a new round of debate about the influences that spawned psychoanalytic thought. C1 Washington Talk A22 Toward an ideological scorecard Acting lessons for political world Regional B1-4, B15, B17, B19 Queens youths face murder charges, after 12 of them were indicted by a grand jury in the racial attack last December that resulted in the death of a black man in Howard Beach, officials said. A1 Lilco lacks the legal authority to carry out an emergency evacuation plan at its Shoreham nuclear plant, a state appeals court ruled, saying such action would be a ''usurpation of the state's police power.'' A1 A judge wrote to a juror saying that the judge's apparent criticism of the juror was not appropriate. The juror had cast the lone vote for the acquittal of a reputed member of the Gambino crime family. B3 The Blizzard of '87 was not, as a compact coastal storm brushed by the New York City region, but buffeted much of southern New Jersey and parts of the New England coast with high winds and heavy snows. B1 Baby M's biological mother testified, tracing good times and bad in 13 years of marriage and describing moments of happiness and anguish with Baby M. ''The only skill that I know I do well is being a mother,'' she said. B1 Riverside's Dance Festival will close in June, after 12 years at the Theater of the Riverside Church, because of a $900,000 deficit at the church. The festival's director was dismissed in January.

us,Trimming a Fillet of Beef,"A WHOLE fillet of beef can be an elegant and relatively simple entree if you are cooking for 10 to 12 guests. It can be roasted whole and carved just before serving with the sauce of your choice, or sliced into individual fillets for pan-frying or broiling. The fillet of beef, also called the tenderloin, often comes untrimmed from the butcher. Use the following technique to remove the fat and membrane. If you want to roast it whole, it should be tied with twine as illustrated so that the meat keeps its shape and cooks evenly. STEP 1: To remove the thick layer of fat that covers the top of the fillet, use a sharp boning knife to separate the fat from the meat at one end, as illustrated. Grab the fat with your other hand and peel it back while working the knife underneath until all is removed. STEP 2: Carefully remove any of the translucent membrane on the surface of the meat by running the knife under it -do not slice away any meat in the process. Work with the knife and your fingers to clean the fillet. STEP 3: One end of the fillet will be smaller and narrower than the other. This is called the tail. Flip the thin tail under the fillet and then tie it securely with kitchen twine. This is done for esthetic as well as practical reasons; the tail will cook more evenly this way. Make several loops with the twine along the rest of the fillet. It is now ready to be brushed with vegetable oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. Roast a four-pound trimmed fillet for about 20 minutes in a 450-degree oven, then flip it over and roast at 400 degrees for another 10 minutes.",1987-02-11T05:00:00+0000

It also blamed the Norwegian referee, Hans-Ivar Ronning, for losing control of the game from the first period and recommended that the coaches for the two teams - Canada's Bert Templeton and Pat Burns and Vladimir Vasiliev and Valentin Gureev of the Soviet Union - be barred from all international competition until Dec. 31, 1989. The recommendations will be considered at the next federation general congress, during the world championships in Vienna in April.

Page A1 Soviet dissidents have paid respects, since their unexpected release from labor camps, to the nerve centers of their movement - Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena G. Bonner, and Larisa Bogoraz, the widow of Anatoly T. Marchenko. A12 Washington applauded Moscow for its decision to free 140 political prisoners, calling it ''an important step'' and urging further releases as a way toward improving Soviet-American relations. A12 Robert McFarlane's sense of failure at living up to his own standards, rather than his fear of pending investigations, prompted his apparent suicide attempt, say people sympathetic to the former national security adviser who are familiar with his mental outlook. A1 When Mr. McFarlane overdosed on drugs, he was attempting suicide, the police say, but they said they had ended their investigation because there were no grounds for criminal charges. A16 Valium seldom causes death but is commonly used in suicide attempts, experts said. One doctor said it was ''the best thing for a would-be suicide to take,'' because it can leave a person with another chance at life. A17 Washington's policy on South Africa has failed, according to a panel appointed by the Reagan Administration to evaluate America's ''constructive engagement'' policy toward South Africa. A1 Using Mexico as a U.S. entry point is becoming more common for citizens of countries as far away as India, China, Yugoslavia and Lebanon, according to American and Mexican Government officials. A3 Anxiety over AIDS in Japan has spread, sending Japanese to clinics for blood tests and prodding the Government to start special programs to keep the disease in check. A11 National A19-24, B10-14 Experts doubt that a 'Star Wars' defense system of even a rudimentary nature could be put in place in the next decade, as the Reagan Administration is considering. A1 'Star Wars' session inconclusive A13 Eastern Airlines will pay $9.5 million as a fine, the largest civil penalty the Federal Aviation Administration has ever imposed against an airline, for more than 78,000 maintenance and safety violations. A19 Vietnam veterans' death rate within the first five years of their return from combat to civilian life was 45 percent higher than that of veterans of the same era who did not serve in Vietnam, a new study said. A20 A forger fooled the Mormon Church and scores of document collectors around the country with forged historical papers. He has pleaded guilty of killing two people to keep his forgeries a secret. A20 Stanford began a fund-raising drive to raise $1.1 billion in five years, the largest amount ever sought by an American university from private sources. The school's president called the move ''audacious.'' B11 Television condom advertisements were advocated by the Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, who said condoms were the best protection from the AIDS virus for those who ''will not practice abstinence or monogamy.'' A1 The Democratic Party chose Atlanta as the site for its 1988 national convention, calling it ''the hub, heart and capital of the South'' and underscoring that region's political importance in the Presidential election. B14 A plea to close eight nuclear reactors of the Three Mile Island design until they can be made more stable came from the Union of Concerned Scientists, which also requested public hearings on the plants. A24 One of Mr. Reagan's old confidants is being brought into the White House to serve as a senior staff member, a source close to the President said. The confidant, Stuart K. Spencer, is a master political operator. B14 The dollar has declined enough against the Japanese yen, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d suggested. His remarks were seen as designed to put pressure on West Germany to reach a currency accord similar to one with Japan. D5 Starting over after losing a spouse early in life can carry added nuances of tragedy, from guilt to debt to alienation, says to a book by the director of Sinai Hospital's Widowed Persons Service in Baltimore. C1 Washington Talk B10 The politics of smoking Sarah Brady's fight on guns Regional B1-9 Murder charges for 3 Queens youths were part of an indictment unsealed in the Howard Beach assault case, which also charged nine other teen-agers with crimes ranging from manslaughter to inciting to riot. A1 The break in the Howard Beach case occured on the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., when one of the youths suspected in the attack came forward, according to the special prosecutor who investigated the attack. A1 A Brooklyn shelter for the homeless is about to be constructed, Andrew Cuomo announced. It is a model for other family shelters he hopes to build throughout New York City and the state. A1 Builders of a $636 billion hotel and apartment complex on a 13-acre platform above the Hudson River have been selected. The team is headed by Julien J. Studley, the real-estate broker and developer. B1 A new design for the Guggenheim Museum's expansion was presented that is one floor lower than a previous plan that had incurred the resentment of community groups and preservationists.

(Buddy) LeRoux confirmed that the part owner of the Boston Red Sox and the Suffolk Downs thoroughbred race track was considering the purchase of the Patriots along with Sullivan Stadium and the adjacent harness racing track in Foxboro, Mass. ''There have been ongoing discussions for about two months,'' said George Sullivan, vice president for Belle Isle Limited Partnership, which was formed by LeRoux for the purchase of Suffolk Downs and 200 acres of land last year. ''Buddy will have nothing to say until something is finalized.'' Bob O'Malley, general manager of Suffolk Downs, also confirmed that LeRoux and the Patriots' general manager, Patrick Sullivan, (no relation to George) had been talking for a few weeks about possible purchase of ''the entire package.'' The package would include the National Football League team, 60,000-seat Sullivan Stadium, and the lease on the harness track. Speculation has put the price at $90 million and $100 million. The Boston Herald quoted unidentified sources as saying LeRoux wanted to buy the Patriots and convert Suffolk Downs into an 80,000-seat domed stadium. If he buys the Patriots, LeRoux would have to relinquish his interest in the Red Sox because N.F.L. rules prohibit an owner from also owning a baseball club.",1987-02-13T05:00:00+0000

''Things just don't seem to be going my way recently,'' said McEnroe, who was seeded fifth. Kriek, seeded 11th, ended the match with three aces in a row. He had 12 for the match, and McEnroe had six. In a preceding match, Jimmy Connors came back from a four-game slump in the second set to take a 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 victory over Eliot Teltscher. Connors, seeded second, had easy going in the opening set and stood at 2-1 in the second before Teltscher made his run to go up by 5-2. Stefan Edberg of Sweden, seeded first, had easier going against Ramesh Krishnan of India, taking a 6-3, 6-2 victory. In afternoon play, Mikael Pernfors took a two-set victory over Amos Mansdorf of Israel. (AP) N.B.A. Pistons 113, Cavaliers 109: In Richfield, Ohio, last night, Adrian Dantley scored 25 points, including two free throws that snapped a 109-109 tie with 34 seconds left, as Detroit moved into a tie for first place with Atlanta in the Central Division. Detroit led by 13 points early in the fourth period but the Cavaliers tied it at 107-107 when Brad Daugherty hit a short hook with 1 minute 20 seconds to play. Bill Laimbeer of Detroit and Ron Harper of Cleveland exchanged jump shots before Dantley hit the foul shots that put Detroit ahead for good. (AP) Bucks 106, SuperSonics 104: In Milwaukee, Jack Sikma tipped in a missed shot at the buzzer to give Milwaukee the victory. Ricky Pierce scored 30 points for the Bucks, who withstood a late Seattle rally led by Tom Chambers, who had 14 points in the fourth quarter. Chambers hit a 3-point goal with 40 seconds left to cut Milwaukee's lead to 104-102, then tied the game with two free throws with seven seconds left. John Lucas of Milwaukee rushed the ball to the other end and his shot was deflected by Alton Lister, but Sikma tipped it in. (AP) Bullets 121, Nuggets 115: Moses Malone scored 38 points, 26 in the second half, and the Bullets blew a 14-point lead early in the fourth quarter before rallying for the victory in Denver. It was the first time all season the Bullets won after playing the night before. They had lost 12 previous games under similar circumstances. Washington led, 89-75, heading into the final quarter but a 12-0 Denver run, capped by Danny Schayes' 3-point play, helped even the game at 95-95 with 7:25 left. Darwin Cook's lay-up 58 seconds later gave the Bullets a 99-97 lead, and they never trailed again. (AP) GOLF Burns Leads by One: George Burns birdied nine holes en route to a nine-under-par 63 that gave him a one-shot lead after the first round of the $500,000 Andy Williams Open golf tournament in La Jolla, Calif. J. C. Snead, who scored consecutive victories in this tournament in 1975-76, made an eagle 3 on the final hole for a 64 that tied him with Lon Hinkle for second. Hinkle also scored an eagle, holing out a wedge shot for a 2 on the fourth hole. Burns's effort set a record on the North course at Torrey Pines, at 6,659 yards the shorter and easier of the two courses used for the first two rounds of this tournament. (AP) Rodriguez Leads Seniors: Chi Chi Rodriguez shot a two-under-par 70 to take the first-round lead in the $260,000 PGA Seniors Championship at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Rodriguez, a three-time winner in 1986, his first full season on the Senior PGA Tour, was one stroke ahead of Joe Jimenez and Jack Fleck, former PGA Seniors champions.

The loss ended Yale's five-game winning streak and dropped the Elis out of a first-place tie in the Ivy League with Cornell. Yale is 13-8 over all and 6-3 in the league. Columbia (8-12 and 3-6) had lost three in a row. Columbia moved to a 38-17 lead before Chris Dudley pulled Yale within 40-28 at halftime.

(AP) N.B.A. Clippers 110, Spurs 96: In San Antonio, Mike Woodson scored a season-high 37 points to lead Los Angeles.

(AP) Celtics 131, Blazers 116: Kevin McHale scored 37 points and Danny Ainge added 26 as Boston won at Portland, Ore. The Celtics, who won their third road game in four nights, took control of the contest by scoring 8 straight points to build a 91-79 lead with 3:10 left in the third quarter. Boston pulled away after that and stretched the advantage to 21 in the final minutes. (AP) Suns 105, Jazz 98: Larry Nance scored 26 points and blocked six shots as Phoenix won at home. The Suns saw their 49-43 halftime lead erased as Utah used a 10-0 run to gain a 53-53 tie with 8:36 left in the third quarter. The lead then see-sawed until Ed Pinckney's free throws with 54 seconds remaining and Nance's stuff with 28 seconds to go put the Suns up by 80-77 entering the final period. After the Jazz pulled within 97-96 with 1:57 left in the game, Walter Davis sank two foul shots and Nance hit a jumper.

When a car that is used to running on premium gets regular gas, which has a lower octane rating than premium, it loses power and the engine knocks, often within a few minutes of filling up. If you get 8 gallons instead of the 10 you paid for, your car demands a refill sooner. And if you get leaded when your car uses only unleaded, it throws off the engine's timing, damages the spark plugs and clogs the catalytic converter, an air-pollution-control device, stopping the car cold.

us,LITERATURE LOST IN THE THICKETS,"UNTIL Henry David Thoreau in the middle of the 19th century, America had no great literature of place and scarcely even the beginnings of such a tradition. Here is an extraordinary cultural phenomenon once we begin to think about it, since it tells us that Americans after 200 years had not yet learned to make significant artistic use of the magnificent lands they called their own. Instead, their energies were expended in obliterating as much as possible of that original landscape and transforming the eastern portion of the country into a recognizable facsimile of the Old World. By the time of the Romantic movement here those who, like Thoreau, wished to celebrate American places were inheritors of a littered, occasionally even blasted landscape bearing scant resemblance to that encountered by the first whites. Before American places had ever been celebrated many of them had been so altered that no one could remember what they had once been like, nor could anyone recall what had happened in them. Americans believed they lived in a historical landscape and behaved accordingly, and so instead of poems and paintings memorializing their lands they would have for their monuments toll roads, treeless villages with the names of antiquity slapped across them, and stump fields. This is not to say that before Thoreau there were not a great many literary descriptions of American places, but these descriptions belong to the vast literature of exploration and settlement, and in it there is a persistent negativity: the emotional compass bearings of its authors remained on those places of the Old World from which they or their immediate forebears had come. In the Spanish accounts of shipwreck and disaster, the perils of the French Jesuit priests (the ''black robes''), the terrific hardships of settlers, the whole huge genre of the captivity narrative, and indeed most of the literature of the early republic, the modern reader, searching for some authentic sense of place, some Continued on page 34 assent to the land, becomes a kind of wilderness wanderer himself, lost in a thicket of resistance. He feels that for these literary pioneers the real world was always elsewhere, not wherever in America they were suffered to be. IF, however, we were to draw a more generous and accurate definition of American literature so as to include the oral literatures of Native Americans, then we would also have a strong, early tradition of the literature of place. For in these tribal literatures there are hundreds of narratives and songs that are truly born of particular places. Emergence myths, in which either a people or its cultural hero comes right up out of a particular soil, are common in the tribal lore of every region of America except the Northwest. So too, myths wherein the land speaks to the people and informs them of their place in the grand scheme of creation. In a Seneca myth, for instance, the people are instructed in the history of the world and of their place in it by a boulder that speaks to them in a forest clearing. Here, quite literally, the people identify themselves by a place, the totality of which they must subsequently come to understand.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

And, unexpectedly, it is showing up in some traditionally staid locales. While Karl Lagerfeld has been prodding the dowager image of the Parisian house of Chanel for some seasons, he has gone all-out this time, suggesting that familiarly shaped scarves, bags, hats, blouses and even jackets be made of fabrics that look as though they have been printed alongside the comics. In New York, a similar breakout is visible in a corner of the second floor of Tiffany & Co. There, in the newly enlarged leather department, are some of the most original handbags anywhere. Designed and produced in Paris, and made of the finest materials, they are examples of chic, if bold, fashion. Some of the new kicky designs will probably look passe posthaste, but many will not.

But the company has also managed to accumulate a deficit of about $450,000, so a deficit-reducing benefit performance of Mr. Wilson's latest play, ''Burn This,'' will be held at 7 P.M. at the Theater 890, Broadway near 19th Street. A backstage buffet will follow. Tickets, $500 or $1,000, from 212-691-3210.

The works may benefit from some clarification, however, and the artist will oblige with a movie and commentary at 7 P.M. in the Great Hall of Cooper Union. A Champagne supper will follow at the Grace Church School, 86 Fourth Avenue (10th Street).

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BRUISED FRUIT. By Amy Ephron. (Doubleday, $13.95.) Perhaps to differentiate herself from the bittersweet comic writing practiced by her sisters Nora and Delia, Amy Ephron has gone in another direction - toward bittersweet tragic writing. Her second novel, ''Bruised Fruit,'' is composed of the sort of affectless prose associated with stories about disengaged women by writers like Jean Rhys. Ms. Ephron has gotten world-weariness down on the page extremely well. So well, yet without making it her own - without making the impulse behind the narration convincing - that it is difficult to shake off the feeling that ''Bruised Fruit'' is intended as a sly sendup. But unfortunately, it probably isn't. Ms. Ephron's zonkette, Kate Bailey, is more or less trying to pull her life together after her lover's murder, in which she is a prime suspect. She does a number of things to pass the heavy time - lolls about the pool; moves in with a man named Stephen Carver, whose business is shadowy; goes after a part in a movie. Kate and chums drink Mersault, Calvados, Evian water, and pick at color-coordinated meals. Nouvelle cuisine - a little placed neatly on an oversized plate amid gray and pink restaurant walls - is an apposite emblem for a tale told by means of sentences like this: Stephen ''didn't leave a note, just a single stem of bougainvillea, pale purple bougainvillea with tissue-paper petals that resembled origami, on her pillow.'' Maybe Stephen is a Japanese flower arranger. Eventually the murder gets solved, but somehow the finally-flushed-out murderer seems much less a villain to Ms. Ephron than that vulgar color, red. The anemia in ''Bruised Fruit'' is so contagious that when you finish it, all you want to do is lie down and inhale.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"HIDDEN SYMPTOMS. By Deirdre Madden. (Atlantic Monthly, $14.95.) Although Deirdre Madden's first novel is set in Belfast in 1969, it is more about familial love than Ireland's political struggles. In her view, however, the two are united: the loyalties between parents and children can easily be perverted into the sectarian hatreds that divide the country. Ms. Madden, an award-winning young Irish author, explores this theme through three characters: Theresa, an embittered university student whose twin brother was brutally murdered by Protestant terrorists; Robert, a disaffected journalist in his late 20's who has turned to atheism; and Kathy, Theresa's best friend and Robert's lover. All three are suffering from something hidden, just as Ireland, writes the author, used to contain its madness in small eruptions. For Theresa, the harsh secret is her brother's violent death. Robert, who considers himself removed from politics, conceals his need for his family's love with contempt. Kathy, at first the most easygoing of the three, discovers a darker side to her own nature when she uncovers a secret about her father. These characters evoke the reader's empathy even when their passions seem murky. Ms. Madden, for example, reveals too little of the nature of Theresa's desperate, almost incestuous love for her dead twin. And while the symmetry of their situations sometimes seems contrived, Ms. Madden writes movingly and often lyrically of the differences that lead these three to wound one another. It is their final inability to make peace that gives her brief novel its sorrowful impact.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

Our superintendent and doormen are on full alert when he is home. His parents travel for months at a time and seemingly do not want to get involved in his problems. The co-op board is very concerned, yet feels powerless to act because of legal repercussions. How can we proceed before this boy commits a crime in our building? . . . M. S., Manhattan Answer: Despite the difficulty of the situation, you are wise to proceed cautiously. Unless the youngster has done something that violates the law or the rules of the co-op, the board would have no grounds to seek an eviction. It cannot put out a family simply because it fears the son may cause trouble.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"TREASON IN TUDOR ENGLAND: Politics and Paranoia. By Lacey Baldwin Smith. (Princeton University, $25.) Lacey Baldwin Smith goes further than the title of his book and argues that ''Tudor England imagined political life to be so exposed to naked villainy and so devoid of friendship and loyalty that only a James Bond could have hoped to have survived.'' Focusing on three notorious but bungling conspirators - court groupie Gregory (Sweet-Lips) Botolf, would-be king-napper Thomas Seymour, and the flamboyantly mad Dr. William Parry, who sought to time his planned murder of Queen Elizabeth with an invasion by Scotland - Mr. Smith maintains that Tudor society was obsessed with fingering pathetically unstable figures who were of no real threat to the crown. Even Tudor schools, he maintains, conditioned children to a paranoid style of thought, leading to what he identifies as the primary flaw of the Tudor age - failure to conceive of a loyal opposition. But paranoia is a psychological term, and Mr. Smith's attempts to explain historical events in its context become dubious. Was Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, a paranoid personality, as Mr. Smith suggests? Not if one considers that he may have suffered from syphilis and that he had a powerful enemy at court in Robert Cecil. But if Mr. Smith, a professor of English history at Northwestern University, sometimes fails to persuade, he never ceases to be witty and spirited. It would be a pity if his provocative theory were to obscure what is in fact a wide-ranging, splendidly detailed history.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

How can we make arrangements for such a tour? -A. J. G., Ormond, Fla. Answer: Yes, but there is a drop-off charge. Travelers planning to set out on a long tour aboard a recreational vehicle for the first time should study some of the advisory material that is available. One source of information is the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (Post Office Box 2999, Reston, Va. 22090), which issues what it calls the R.V. Life Style Publications Catalogue. The catalogue, obtained by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope, lists about 30 publications, some of them free, that can be ordered from the association. But it charges $2 postage for some of the books on its list, and these can be purchased at many bookstores. Among these are four campground guides, including ''Trailer Life's R.V.

Anyone who has known Peace Corps volunteers in the field cannot help but be impressed by their dedication and diligence. But readers curious about the first generation of Americans to take on third world deprivation hand-to-hand won't find much of an account in ''Come as You Are.'' This detailed volume concentrates instead on the cocktails, lunches, Hyannis Port weekends, memo writing and furious office politics that attended the birth of the agency in the Camelot era. As Padraic Kennedy, an early senior staffer, puts it: ''It was exciting, it was fun, and boy, did the press love it.'' ''Come as You Are'' might have worked as a sort of belated expose, unmasking the Peace Corps' true origin as a public relations gimmick and the plaything of ''America's first royal family'' and their courtiers. But this revelation emerges only inadvertently. Sargent Shriver, the first Peace Corps director, notes without apparent concern that, according to the author, the agency ''was like a rocket. It was sitting on the launching pad and no one knew where it was going to go or what it was going to do.'' Willliam Haddad, another top official, writes in a letter that what the Peace Corps needed was ''go-getters, guys who can charge around the world, make deals.'' What they often got were guys like Donovan McClure, the Peace Corps representative in Sierra Leone, who candidly admits: ''I had never heard of Sierra Leone before, and plenty of others at the Peace Corps hadn't either. I mean, most of us had never heard of most of the places where the Peace Corps was going.'' Could such factors help explain why the agency has been so much more successful as an outward bound program for liberal arts majors than as an instrument for economic development and the communication of democratic values? Ms. Redmon, a former Peace Corps senior writer, never even raises the question.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

Roy went into the final today leading his nearest challenger, Britain's No. 2 sled driven by Mark Tout, by nearly a full second. Driving the newly designed USA No. 1 sled with Jim Herberich of Winchester, Mass., on the brake, Roy raced down the 1,600-meter run in 1 minute eight-tenths of a second and 1:00.97.

The bout ended two seconds from the end of the round with de Wit slumped on the canvas and bleeding profusely from the nose. The loss was his first in 17 fights as a professional. Cooper's record is 16-1. (AP) Horse Racing Lover's Cross Handicap Winner: Lover's Cross never trailed yesterday in winning the $86,850 Stymie Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Aqueduct. The 4-year-old son of Explodent and Girl in Love, ridden by Ruben Hernandez and carrying 116 pounds, turned back a strong challenge by favored King's Swan nearing the stretch and then drew away to a 2 3/4-length victory. Proud Debonair edged King's Swan for second by a head. The triumph was the first in three starts this year for Lover's Cross, who was last in a field of 14 in the Bougainvillea Handicap on grass at Hialeah in his previous start. He went a mile and an eighth on a fast track in 1:50 to earn $65,610, including a $13,500 Breeders' Cup Award, for Kinghaven Farms. He returned $17.20 for $2 to win as the third choice in the field of six. Track and Field St. Anthony's Wins Trophy: A fourth-place finish in the final event, the one-mile relay, gave Iona Prep a tie for first place with St. Anthony's in the 60th annual Catholic High Schools Boys Indoor Championships in Manhattan. Each team had 30 points. However, the tie was broken for the team trophy when St. Anthony's, of Smithtown, L.I., showed four second-places to one for Iona. St. Anthony's had tallied 23 of its points in the earlier field events while Iona had 21 in the field. Paul Whittaker of Xaverian was named the meet's most valuable performer. He won the 1,000-meter run in 2 minutes 33.7 seconds and anchored Xaverian to its upset victory over Loughlin in the 2-mile relay. N.H.L. Canucks 3, Penguins 3: Barry Pederson scored with 4:39 left in the third period to give Vancouver the tie last night at Pittsburgh. Pederson fired a rebound into a wide-open net with the Penguins' goalie, Pat Riggin, trapped out of position.

us,OBLIGING THE NOBLESSE,"The female figure in the Italian Renaissance was not only idealized as a Neoplatonic manifestation of ''heaven on earth,'' but seen as the embodiment of intellectual refinement. And with this elevation of the flesh came a new cultural phenomenon - that of the ''honest courtesan.'' These highbrow mistresses, companions to princes, painters, ambassadors and merchants, writes Lynne Lawner in LIVES OF THE COURTESANS: Portraits of the Renaissance (Rizzoli, $35), were at once financially autonomous and perpetually enslaved. Bejeweled and draped in the latest fashions, they wrote verse, recited the classics and, unlike their poor cousins in the brothels, entertained clients in their private palaces. Ms. Lawner, a poet and art historian, argues that the courtesans' most intriguing aspect was their ability to project images of themselves that were at once elusive and eminently tangible. Drawing on the diaries, plays, letters and paintings of the period - including journal entries written by the courtesans themselves - Ms. Lawner probes the causes of this intentional ambiguity. She investigates everything from beauty routines to sartorial habits, to the sexual symbolism of certain gestures and objects in such paintings as Palma Vecchio's ''Bella,'' Raphael's ''Fornarina'' and Titian's ''Venus of Urbino.'' The result is an exceedingly handsome, well-designed art book dedicated to images of Renaissance female beauty. But most arresting are its revelations about the qualities of character that have shaped Western ideas about femininity and romantic love.",1987-02-15T05:00:00+0000

But achieving them has taken more than 14 years - until last week, when a Federal appeals court put an end to what it characterized as ''this disgraceful chapter of legal neglect.''

Provisions Article II For the purpose of this Treaty an ABM system is a system to counter strategic ballistic missiles or their elements in flight trajectory, currently consisting of: (a) ABM interceptor missiles, which are interceptor missiles constructed and deployed for an ABM role, or of a type tested in an ABM mode: (b) ABM launchers, which are launchers constructed and deployed for launching ABM interceptor missiles; and (c) ABM radars, which are radars constructed and deloyed for an ABM role, or of a type tested in an ABM mode. Article III Each Party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems or their components except . . . (a) within one ABM system deployment area . . . centered on the party's national capital . . . and (b) within one ABM system deployment area . . . containing ICBM silo launchers. [ The 1974 Protocol amends Article III as follows: Each party shall be limited at any one time to a single area out of the two provided in Article III of the treaty for deployment of ABM systems or their components. ] Article V 1.

us,Q&A,"Q. Why is the distance between stars measured in light years? And how long, in miles, is a light year? A. The stars are spaced so far apart that any measurement of the distance between them in familiar units would be unwieldy, according to Dr. Joe Patterson, professor of astronomy at Columbia University. So scientists created a more manageable astronomical unit called the light year, which is the distance it takes light to travel in one year, at a speed of about 186,200 miles a second. One light year is about 6,000,000,000,000 miles. The closest star to earth, Alpha Centauri, is 4.2 light years. This is the average distance between most stars. Q. What causes wrinkles in the skin? A. Wrinkles are caused mainly by ultraviolet radiation from the sun, according to Dr. Allen Lawrence, a Chicago dermatologist. Over time, the ultraviolet rays break down the middle layer of skin, the dermis, causing it to loosen and allowing wrinkles to form. With extreme age, the dermis loosens on its own accord, Dr. Lawrence said. To decrease the extent of wrinkling in the skin, one should limit exposure to direct sunlight, such as by using sunscreens, he added. Wrinkles are more likely to occur among people of lighter skin or who have thin layers of skin.",1987-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Gorbachev said in an address. Page A1 A Soviet dissident is still confined in Chistopol prison in the Tatar Republic, his family said, despite the assurance of a senior Soviet official on American television Sunday that he had been released. A10 How to interpret the ABM treaty is the central arms-control issue, affecting negotiations in Geneva, relations between the United States and its allies and relations between the Administration and Congress. A1 Hours after a cease-fire expired, 17 Phillipine civilians and one soldier died in a brief fire fight in Namulandayan last Tuesday. The incident threatens to aggravate strains between the Government and its military. A1 A Nicaraguan rebel leader resigned from a governing position in a power struggle that threatens the future of Washington-backed anti-Sandinista forces. He said it was an effort to unify the rebel movement. A1 Truckers can get rich in Canada, plying some of the most remote and potentially dangerous roads in North America, ones that are slowly pushing development into the continent's last frontier. A1 In Jerusalem, prosecutors began presenting the details of their case against a Ukrainian-born retired auto worker from Cleveland who is accused of war crimes at the Treblinka death camp. A3 Penang Island off Malaysia's coast has become and remained the country's most dynamic and spirited corner. The small island seems to attract and nurture artists, intellectuals, reformers and dissidents. A4 National A13-21, D19 New U.S. oil shortages may be ahead, despite higher prices and a more stable market, that could be as disruptive as those of the 1970's, Government policy makers and other analysts warn. A1 Tax season will be much the same this year. Most of the new tax law's provisions became effective only at the beginning of 1987, so individuals will not encounter sweeping changes until next year's filing ritual. A1 The A.B.A. will not to seek a law barring all advertising of tobacco products, The American Bar Association's policy-making arm decided, rejecting a proposal that it join efforts in Congress to do so. A14 W. Wilson Goode will run again, he said, seeking a second term as Philadelphia's first black mayor. ''I do not claim that we have done everything right,'' he said, ''but we have always tried to do the right thing.'' A14 A movement toward safer sex is gathering momentum among heterosexuals, as AIDS and the fear of it infect the nation, which may promise to change male-female relationships and bedroom behavior. A21 An inquiry into the arrest of 8 aliens in Los Angeles has been requested by a top Immigration and Naturalization Service official. The immigrants are said to be linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. A19 A bill to raise the minimum wage is expected to be approved in Congress this year, said the Senate and House Majority Leaders, who added that they would support efforts now underway to raise the miminum wage of $3.35 an hour. A15 A dispute over Medicaid fees paid in Rhode Island has resulted in some obstetricians turning away pregnant women on welfare who come to them for prenatal care. The doctors say the fees do not cover their costs. A14 The Navy has suspended a program to equip warships with drone aircraft after losing four of the five pilotless reconnaissance planes sent out recently with the battleship Iowa, military sources report. D19 Alaskans are resisting any cuts in their state's impressive list of gifts to them, despite a stunning decline in state revenues caused by falling oil prices. The Governor has said the state is in financial chaos. A13 Governor Cuomo condemned policies espoused by the Reagan Administration on many issues, from arms control to the environment. The Governor, speaking in New Orleans, was on the second in a seris of trips outside New York States, as he decides whether to run for President.

However, the bill will be vetoed by President Reagan if it eventually passes both houses of Congress. Page A1 Radical changes in the contras are sought by Arturo Cruz, the Nicaraguan rebel leader who is seeking to control the anti-Sandinista movement. He seeks an expanded civilian directorate with complete control of funds. A6 Lebanese militiamen fought battles in Beirut unrivaled in their fury, using heavy artillery and tank assaults to seize key positions. Officials said 50 people had been killed and 120 wounded. A1 Robert M. Gates seemed headed for Senate confirmation as Director of Central Intelligence after hearings that reflected Congressional anger over the Reagan Administration's Iran dealings. A1 News analysis: Data on N.S.C. misdeeds uncovered by a Presidential panel are likely to include disclosures that could lead to criminal prosecutions, according to officials who have seen the panel's report. A1 400,000 Mozambicans may starve to death, according to Mozambican and Western aid officials. They said up to one-third of the population was suffering sever food shortages resulting from guerrilla warfare. A18 Cambodians still face abuses in refugee camps in Thailand, according to the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. The group said the refugees were often victimized by heavily armed Cambodian bandits. A3 American Rembrandt scholars think that five paintings in American museums are by the Master. Dutch experts have downgraded the works and have removed them from the canon of works entirely by him.

Regan's future as White House chief of staff was the subject of new speculation. President Reagan, in an informal exchange with reporters, said that Mr. Regan's future was ''up to him.'' A1 Opponents of Central America policy have been burglarized 50 times. The victims fear they are under attack by the Reagan Administration or by conservative groups possibly working with Government officials. A1 The Reagan Administration will issue guidelines today for widespread testing of Federal employees to determine if they have used illicit drugs, Administration officials said yesterday. A1 The ozone shield must be protected by a global agreement, members of Congress said. They backed a bill to gradually eliminate Americans' use of chemicals that destroy the earth's atmospheric ozone. B6 The secrets sold to Israel by Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst, dealt as serious a blow to national security as any other espionage case in American history, prosecutors said. A21 A pilot program using polygraphs to screen applicants for Pentagon security clearance has been conducted in a way that makes it impossible to judge the validity of the tests, a report ordered by Congress said. A27 The U.S. death penalty was assailed by Amnesty International in its first major criticism of America. The organization called the penalty the ''ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.'' A17 John Landis acknowledged breaking a California law by hiring two child actors without permits. The director testified against charges in the deaths of three actors while filming ''Twilight Zone: The Movie.'' A20 Powerful Mexican diet pills have dangerous side effects, American officials say. They are trying to halt the flow of a drug called Redotex, which includes a stimulant, a laxative and a tranquilizer. A24 Many taxpayers rushed to make extra-large charitable contributions and otherwise seek deductions as 1986 ended. Some of these actions will benefit them greatly, but others face stricter rules.

A1 Four cultural centers overstated attendance figures they submitted to the New York City agency that gave them grants of $40 million a year in 1984 and 1985, a state audit said. They are the Bronx Zoo, the Botanical Garden, the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum.

But the president of the Tulsa-based fitness center that used the pictures said that the promotion was planned without Bosworth's knowledge or permission. ''We didn't realize what a commotion or stir-up could be caused,'' said Jim Benien, president of the All American Fitness and Racquetball Center. ''We never even talked to Bosworth.'' Gary Reall, director of advertising for the center, told The Tulsa Tribune that the photos were used with Bosworth's knowledge, but later said he had spoken only with a friend of Bosworth and had not received permission for use of his photo.

Boston, which avoided its first three-game losing streak since 1983, silenced the sellout crowd of 17,007 fans in Reunion Arena early. The Celtics surged to a 67-46 halftime lead after outscoring the Mavericks by 37-17 in the second period, and they built a 31-point lead midway through the third quarter. Dallas cut the lead to 14 points with a 13-0 run in the final quarter but the rally ended when McHale re-entered the game and scored two baskets.(AP) 76ers 114, Warriors 103: Andrew Toney, Maurice Cheeks and Charles Barkley combined for 75 points as the 76ers held off a late Golden State rally in Philadelphia. Toney scored 27 points, Cheeks had 25 and Barkley 23 as the 76ers handed the Warriors their 11th loss in 14 games. Barkley also grabbed 18 rebounds and Cheeks had 14 assists. The Warriors were assessed six technical fouls, including four for illegal defenses, one againsst George Karl and another on Floyd. Philadelphia dressed only nine players, with Julius Erving, Cliff Robinson and David Wingate sidelined with various ailments.(AP) Cavaliers 129, Kings 119: Brad Daugherty scored a season-high 33 points, 10 of them in the final five and a half minutes, to help the Cavaliers snap the Kings' three-game winning streak. Daugherty and two fellow rookies, Ron Harper and John Williams, scored 6 points apiece during a 22-6 run that rallied the Cavaliers from a 104-97 deficit to a 119-110 lead with just over two minutes to play in Richfield, Ohio.(AP) Pacers 105, SuperSonics 88: John Long scored 29 points and four other Pacers scored in double figures as Indiana gained its fifth victory in its last seven games. The Pacers, playing at home, led from start to finish as they jumped to a 8-0 lead. Chuck Person had 10 of his 15 points in the first period.(AP) N.H.L. Oilers 9, Maple Leafs 2: Wayne Gretzky scored once in the first period and set up four second-period goals to pace Edmonton. The 5 points gave Gretzky 9 in two games against Toronto this season and 75 career points against the Leafs. Gretzky's goal was the 534th of his career, moving him ahead of Frank Mahovlich, a former Maple Leaf, and into sole possession of eighth place on the career scoring list.(AP) Sabres 4, Bruins 3: Dave Andreychuk, John Tucker and Mike Foligno scored Buffalo's first three goals during a 3:07 span early in the third period in Buffalo. Phil Housley scored the eventual winning goal for the Sabres. Greg Johnston, Steve Kasper and Ken Linseman tallied for the Bruins. It was Boston's fourth straight loss; the Sabres have won six of their last seven.(AP) Skiing Lewis and Fletcher Win: Doug Lewis and Pam Fletcher, two United States Ski Team veterans who have endured nonproductive seasons on the World Cup circuit, captured the men's and women's downhills yesterday on the opening day of the United States Alpine championships in Crested Butte, Colo. Lewis, 23 years old, of Salisbury, Vt., was timed in 1 minute 23.80 seconds on a relatively short men's course. Andreas Rickenbach, 20, of Pleasanton, Calif., was second in 1:24.07, followed by Alan Lauba of Bellevue, Wash., in 1:24.82. Lewis, acknowledged as America's best downhiller here in the absence of the injured Bill Johnson, had paced the final men's training run on Tuesday by nearly two seconds, although officials later said he had missed a gate. Fletcher, 24, of Acton, Mass., finished more than a full second ahead of the defending national downhill champion, Hilary Lindh. Fletcher was clocked in 1:22.32. Lindh, 17, of Juneau, Alaska, had a time of 1:23.41, followed by Carter Payne, 18, of Aspen, Colo., in 1:23.60.(AP) Soviet Women Take Title: Paced by an unknown, late addition to its team, the Soviet Union took the women's 20-kilometer relay title and captured its first gold medal at the Nordic world championships in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Racing third, Nina Gavriluk stole the spotlight from her better known teammates by posting the fastest individual stage and leading a Soviet rally. The Soviet time was 58 minutes 8.8 seconds. Norway took the silver in 58:46.1 and Sweden gained the bronze medal.(AP) Horse Racing Belocolus First by a Nose: Belocolus took the lead from pace-setting Alioth in midstretch yesterday and then barely lasted to withstand the late rush of Road to Ponder to score a nose victory in the $45,000 allowance feature for 4-year-olds and up at Aqueduct.

Last evening, for instance, he staged a kind of concerto triathlon with the New York Philharmonic, playing works for cello and orchestra by Krzysztof Pendereck, Haydn and Tchaikovsky. And, one may add, playing them all with the enormous tone, ravishing phrasing and almost reckless ardor that are as much his trademarks as the oddly bent cello pin that sets his instrument at just the proper angle for his needs.",1987-02-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"WOMEN WRITING ABOUT MEN. By Jane Miller. (Pantheon, Paper, $8.95.) Women have long written about men as fathers, brothers, lovers, sons, heroes and, as Adrienne Rich said, ''the phantom of the man-who-would-understand'' - the double. But because female writers have needed, according to Jane Miller, ''to be extremely circumspect'' in these portrayals, many critics have assumed that women write only of themselves. Ms. Miller, who teaches at the University of London Institute of Education, demolishes this condescending misreading in ''Women Writing About Men.'' Feminist discussion of novels by women has usually focused on female characters; in considering male characters created by women, Ms. Miller attempts more than a gallery stroll past the Mr. Rochesters and Daniel Derondas of literature. Studying Jane Austen's fictional fathers, the author analyzes how women have rationalized their own subordination. Reviewing the male characters of Maxine Hong Kingston and Toni Morrison, she questions the view of ''patriarchy'' as an abstract term separate from those that designate other forms of oppression. Central to Ms. Miller's book is her recognition of women's ''learned androgyny,'' a way of thinking that allows them as readers to enter into stories such as ''Moby-Dick'' that exclude them. The author offers a powerful insight into why feminist criticism strikes some women as narrow, since it requires them to see male characters as ''other.'' She urges women readers to ''unlearn androgyny,'' not only to appreciate portraits of men by women but also to sensitize them to exclusionary situations in life.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,ARTISTS IN THE HOUSE,"The Esthetic Movement in America in the decade from the 1870's to the 1880's has been neglected until recently by scholars of the decorative arts. Among the major American art figures working then were the painter James McNeill Whistler, the glassmaker Louis Comfort Tiffany and the architect H. H. Richardson, who designed Trinity Church in Boston. Now, thanks to the catalog for a recent major exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, such independent artists are treated for the first time as an integral part of a design movement that encouraged hand-crafted objects in the belief that beautiful domestic interiors would affect their inhabitants in a positive way. IN PURSUIT OF BEAUTY: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Rizzoli, $60), explores a period inspired by a British movement that had reacted against the Industrial Revolution's machine-made products. The 11 essays by scholars range from general social history to such specific crafts as stained glass and metalwork. We learn that some of the country's greatest museums - the Metropolitan itself, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, for example - were founded during these years in which art schools and publications burgeoned, women in the arts rose to prominence and, in American cities, a new profession emerged, that of the interior decorator. A ''Dictionary of Architects, Artisans, Artists, and Manufacturers'' compiled by Catherine Hoover Voorsanger, a research associate at the Metropolitan, gives a brief, invaluable account of the major personalities of the decade - when art was meant to be useful, not just beautiful.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

It is a lovely film, rich in detail and emotional reverberations. Mr. Baldwin's partly autobiographical story is told through the eyes of a boy living in Harlem in the 1930's. John Grimes (James Bond 3d), approaching his 14th birthday, lives in a world circumscribed by school, where his white teachers recognize his writing talent; by church, where the black experience explodes in hypnotic sermons and songs; and by home, where his father Gabriel (Paul Winfield) uses the Bible to warn of the sins of the world and of white folk in particular. Stan Lathan directs a superb cast that also includes Olivia Cole, Rosalind Cash, Ruby Dee, Alfre Woodard, C. C. H. Pounder, Linda Hopkins and Douglas Turner Ward. The final church scene alone is reason enough not to miss this film. Religious experiences are not readily accessible to peering cameras, but Mr. Lathan and his photographer, Hiro Narita, have caught the drive and energy of the gospel music in images that are mesmerizing.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"FLIPPING FOR IT. By Daniel Asa Rose. (St. Martin's, $14.95.) This first novel feels like a detective story, though it's about the pains of divorce. The dialogue is matter-of-fact; the action, over a four-week period, moves episodically; the secondary characters are colorful and talk cynically, with dark humor. The main character even gets to spend a lot of time in a nightclub drinking and staring at women. Not unlike some detective novels, this one begins with an unexpected revelation. Thomas, a young zoologist, is told by his wife, Jane, that he must move into the guest room - immediately - and that she has already seen a lawyer. Her reasons are vague: ''It's just that some women don't want men to tie them down to any commitments any longer.'' Her motives don't become much clearer with time, though Thomas tries desperately to uncover them. When the inevitability of the breakup finally dawns on Thomas, the custody of his two children becomes a main issue. He hires a famous, cold-blooded divorce lawyer. Frustrated, lonely, weakened, he does absolutely everything he is told not to do in order to insure a favorable outcome in the case. Despite a penchant for histrionics, Daniel Asa Rose, a winner of the O. Henry Prize for short fiction, wants to say some rather simple things about hurt and loss. For the most part, he succeeds. In the end, the quesions Thomas asks about the divorce -Why? Whose fault is it? - are blurred and practically meaningless. We are left with the drama of two people sundering their lives. This old subject is told with freshness, humor and, when the author puts affected writing aside, great openness of heart.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

C., Manhattan Answer: If the owner of your apartment failed to make maintenance payments, the co-op board would take legal action against the owner, not against you. Your status as a rent-stabilized tenant would remain intact even in the co-op board found it necessary to take over the apartment and sell it to another investor. Transferring Space Question: We own two apartments in a nonevict co-op building - the one we live in and the adjacent unit, which is occupied by the original rent-stabilized tenant. Can we renovate the two units to take some space from the rental unit and add it to ours? If we lower the tenant's rent by an amount commensurate with the reduction in space, is her consent necessary? If not, whose approval would be necessary for such a renovation other than the co-op board's? . . . K. N., Manhattan Answer: If your tenant objects, you cannot do such a renovation, said Thomas R.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"OUR FRIEND MANSO. By Benito Perez Galdos. Translated by Robert Russell. (Columbia University, $25.) Perez Galdos is one of the treasures of 19th-century Spanish fiction. ''Our Friend Manso'' (1882), here translated into English for the first time, reflects his prodigious, inexhaustible curiosity about the human condition and the limits of the novelist's art. Maximo Manso is a middle-aged professor of philosophy in Madrid, a competent, unambitious man who observes the human drama that surrounds him but in some fundamental way is unable to participate. This imperfect self-realization is but one symptom of his fictional status; indeed, the novel opens with Maximo's declaration that he does not exist. His subsequent parthenogenesis through a friend's inkwell, together with his mistily indecisive adventures in life and eventual absorption into Limbo (equipped, oddly, with a telephone), amount to a wry commentary on the difficulties of artistic creation. Paradoxically, these intimations of unreality only serve to make the protagonist more believable. He is particularly well-developed in that most essential of human traits, the urge to gossip; when he hears that his landlady has sold the family butcher shop in an attempt to improve her social position, Maximo cynically remarks that when it comes to washing off bloodstains even Lady Macbeth would have an easier time of it. The translator of this entertaining volume, a well-known Perez Galdos scholar, shows considerable skill in rendering the Spaniard's deliciously splenetic turns of phrase. Some nuances are inevitably lost, however: in the Spanish, for example, Manso (''placid'') is at once the character's name and his most perfect epithet.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"GOING LIVE. By Muriel Dobbin. (Dutton, $17.95.) To judge by Muriel Dobbin's entertaining new novel, the television news industry is the glamorous career of choice for ambitious women today. At 37, the veteran television correspondent Martha Vogel is young enough to dream of being her network's national news anchor, but mature enough to realize that her superiors favor female broadcasters with younger, less wrinkled faces. Most prominent among her competitors is Caroline Mitchell, an aspiring newscaster whose on-camera manner and appearance remind viewers of the young Jacqueline Kennedy. Behind the scenes, however, Caroline is coldly calculating. She sees nothing wrong with discarding her fiance, the son of a local newscaster, once he has provided an entree to his father's connections. Nor does she think twice about exploiting a casual acquaintance with Martha to gain the attention of James Mellenkoff, an icy network executive who happens to be Martha's lover. Even Jill Starling, Caroline's childhood friend and fellow broadcast journalist, is stung by the serpentlike Caroline. In so poisonous a profession, can fair-minded Martha and good-humored Jill survive their wounds and live to see another broadcast day? As Caroline and Martha vie for the role of network anchor, the plot becomes alternately predictable and farfetched, but the characters play their roles with an enjoyable mixture of seriousness and self-mockery. ''Going Live'' succeeds as a diverting modern-day variation on an old-fashioned morality tale. Blind ambition may take you far, the author tells us, but - as improbable as it may sound - plain solid work will take you farther.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

In those olden, golden days, the Paris couture was the be-all and end-all of creativity. What was introduced or endorsed was immediately copied, adapted and accepted worldwide. Today, fashion ideas originate in many places and many countries. Nevertheless, in the past few years the couture has steadily re-emerged as a powerful arbiter of style, no longer content to merely purr along with luxurious clothes for women of financial substance. And with a series of showings the likes of those viewed last month for spring, it has become quite clear that no one with a shred of interest in fashion can afford to miss what transpires at this highest level of fashion.

When he returned to the Laker dressing room in McNichols Arena he was served with court papers notifying him that Alex English of the Nuggets had filed suit against him in a court in Denver seeking repayment of $150,000 in debts. English said that he and Brad Davis of the Dallas Mavericks had each lent Abdul-Jabbar $75,000 in 1985 and that the Laker star had not repaid the loans. ''It's a personal thing and I want to leave it at that,'' said English, whose suit indicated that Davis had assigned his part of the debt to English for collection. Abdul-Jabbar, who passed another National Basketball Association milestone by scoring his 36,000th point Friday night in Chicago (he is the first to reach that level), also declined to elaborate on the loans.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"MANDELA'S CHILDREN. By Ora Mendels. (Little, Brown, $16.95.) Part thriller, part psychological portrait, part history, ''Mandela's Children'' (the title refers to political offspring) tells the story of Ruth Harris, a white woman brought up in Johannesburg. An ardent student activist there in the 60's, she is now a United States citizen, divorced, with a grown son. She has dropped politics and her former comrades. She has told no one in her new life about her arrest 20 years ago, her months in solitary or the damning, haunting confession that was her last act in South Africa. But now, contacted by an old friend, she is lured back into the struggle. She agrees to return to Johannesburg for a brief, safe mission - a chance to redress some of the wrong she still holds herself accountable for. The mission becomes a complex, dangerous intrigue. As a thriller the novel is exciting. Though the style is plain, the dialogue sometimes awkward, the devices often clumsy, the story hurtles forward like an express train out of Times Square. As a portrait it is somewhat less successful. Numerous flashbacks interrupt the narrative, each time bringing it to a lurching halt and only slowly regaining our interest. This added background gives Ruth dimension as a character, but her extremely harsh judgment of herself undermines our sympathy. Still, politically, the book does what journalism rarely can: it helps us feel as well as know. Ruth works feverishly on a huge nonviolent antipass campaign, which results in 69 Africans being shot dead by police in an incident now known to the world as the Sharpeville massacre. The reader shares Ruth's sense of betrayal and rage. Years later, when a man is killed with a tire ''necklace'' set afire, our horror is not only general - that people should be driven to such an act - but particular, because we know they have the wrong man. The scene is a small, grim tour de force in a passionate novel.",1987-02-22T05:00:00+0000

Referee Sam Williams of Detroit halted the bout - scheduled for 15 rounds - after 55 seconds of the second round when the challenger, from Mount Laurel, N.J., was caught on the ropes. Honeyghan had already floored the 26-year-old Bumphus in the first round and also knocked him down - illegally, according to the referee - at the start of the second. Honeyghan was off his stool early, rushed across the ring, and as the bell rang, knocked down Bumphus as the challenger rose from his stool. Manager Lou Duva, who was not completely out of the ring at the time, bounded into the center of the ring to protest. The referee started the round over and penalized Honeyghan a point. It was not enough time for Bumphus, however, as Honeyghan caught him on the ropes with a ferocious barrage of blows, prompting Williams to halt the fight. (AP) N.H.L.

Gates, agreed to send the White House a 1985 memo that favored arms dealings with Iran though he knew it was at odds with conclusions reached by Central Intelligence Agency analysts, sources said. Page A1 A plea for leniency for a Honduran convicted of plotting to assassinate the President of Honduras in 1984 was made by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North last year, National Security Council documents show. A9 Classified papers were destroyed by Lieut. Col. North's secretary as Mr. North watched, a source said, adding that it happened on the evening before Justice Department investigators came to review the files. A8 Six major countries will cooperate closely to stabilize the dollar, leaders from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada said. A further decline, they said, would hurt the world economy. A1 Arrest of key terrorist suspects was announced by France's Interior Ministry. The seizing of four members of Direct Action, the country's main underground group, represents a major blow against European terrorism. A1 A trial of another accused terrorist will begin in Paris after two and a half years of seeming hesitation by the Government. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah's imprisonment apparently prompted a series of bomb attacks last year. A6 News analysis: Syrian troops were being welcomed as ''peacekeepers'' by some Beirut residents. But whether they could make the streets of the Lebanese capital safe seemed doubtful. A10 Syrian troops poured into Beirut and began taking control of the capital's predominantly Moslem western sector in an effort to restore order among warring militiamen. A11 Celebrations in Manila began for last year's peaceful ouster of Ferdinand E. Marcos. The two men who led the revolt met stiffly at a military cemetery, their relations strained and their reputations tarnished. A2 NATIONAL A12-15 As courts weigh abortion laws requiring teen-agers to notify their parents or have their consent, a judge has ruled that, in practice, Minnesota's law does not meet its goal of giving support and guidance to pregnant girls. A1 A bartering scheme for the elderly in Washington, the Service Credit Volunteer System, is a novel idea devised to help participants ''purchase'' needed assistance by exchanging services, not money. A1 This is a pivotal week for Mr. Reagan because of the upcoming release of a Presidential review commission report on the Iran-contra affair which could determine whether Mr. Reagan rebounds and some top advisers remain. A1 A move to the right of the President is being sought by some conservative activists, who are pressing Republican Presidential hopefuls to embrace a tough foreign policy position in 1988. A13 A proposed AIDS test's role in controlling the disease's spread will be debated tomorrow and Wednesday in Atlanta. Some say it would be a waste of effort to administer the test as broadly as Federal officials propose. A15 Support for a new welfare plan came from the Reagan Administration, which said it may modify its policies to accommodate elements of the plan, authored by the nation's governors, including putting welfare recipients to work. A15 Primary elections in Chicago are on Tuesday, and amid the last-minute campaigning are signs of the reorganization of political life that Mayor Harold Washington has set in motion. A13 Silicon Valley is said to be stingy, a region known for its technical innovations and entrepreneurship, not for its charity. San Jose, Calif., is trying to redevelop, but despite a recent charity gala, the first in the area, efforts are going slowly. A12 Homeowners' tax benefits are lower on the 1986 returns than they used to be. New guidelines on deductions related to refinancing mortgages and to energy-saving home renovations will mean less in write-offs.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1987","MARKETS Stock prices ended lower in a wild, unpredictable session as the market reacted to Brazil's decision to suspend payments on its foreign commercial debt. Traders said a sharp drop in stock index futures caused heavy program selling of stocks in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average nearly recovered fully from a drop of almost 45 points, but a sharp reversal in the final hour left the blue-chip index 18.70 points lower, at 2,216.54. [ Page D1. ] Bank stocks tumbled amid growing investor concern about the earnings impact of the Brazilian move. [ D8. ] The dollar was firmer in light trading. Traders said they were unwilling so far to test the strength of a weekend accord by the United States and five of its allies. The nations pledged to ''cooperate closely'' to stabilize the dollar. In New York, gold dropped $3.25, to $402.50. [ D24. ] In the credit markets, interest rates fell on Treasury issues as a late rally pushed up prices. Dealers and traders remained uncertain on the outlook for the dollar. [ D21. ] Prices of crude oil slumped to their lowest levels since the OPEC production-restraint accord took effect Jan. 1. In New York futures trading, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude fell 56 cents, to $17.08 a barrel. [ D24. ] Kidder, Peabody was fined $300,000 by the New York Stock Exchange, which charged that the firm violated exchange rules and Federal regulations. According to the exchange, the violations included improperly computing net capital and filing inaccurate reports to the Government. [ D5. ] THE ECONOMY The U. S. and the Soviet Union resumed grain talks amid reports that Moscow had recently bought up to a million tons of American corn. Moscow's re-entry into the market would reaffirm a long-term bilateral grain agreement. Senior American officials were saying just a month ago that the pact had been virtually repudiated by the Russians. [ D6. ] The Supreme Court agreed to clarify the circumstances in which companies must publicly disclose merger talks. It will also hear a case about nuclear plants that exceed cost projections. [ D5. ] COMPANIES Rainier said it received two takeover proposals from large out-of-state banking companies. Rainier, the largest bank in the state of Washington, did not identify the suitors. But banking sources said the suitors were probably Security Pacific and First Bank System. Both bids involve exchanges of stock. [ D1. ] Sumner M. Redstone stepped up the bidding battle for Viacom. A company controlled by Mr. Redstone offered about $2.5 billion for just over 80 percent of Viacom, with the promise of a greater cash payout. The bid for the media concern exceeds a previous Redstone bid and a management buyout offer. [ D1. ] The parent of American Airlines ruled out a bid for Pan Am. AMR said, however, that it would be interested in acquiring assets of Pan Am if they were put on the market. [ D6. ] Elders IXL plans to acquire Carling O'Keefe, the Canadian brewer, for almost $300 million. [ D5. ] Conoco plans a $400 million project involving an offshore production platform in extremely deep waters. [ D5. ] INTERNATIONAL Argentina is seeking new money and concessions sufficient to insure 4 percent economic growth, officials said. The nation is preparing to open debt talks with private banks in New York. Argentina is doing considerably better than Brazil, which has suspended interest payments on debt to foreign commercial banks, but it faces such problems as inflation. [ D8. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS The outlook for nonrefundable, discounted air fares remains in doubt. Passenger volume has risen strongly, but Christopher D. Bowers, a marketing executive at United, is uneasy about the loss of revenues. Talking Business. [ D2. ] Single-country funds are still in vogue after gaining immense popularity last year.

us,Q&A,"Q. What causes infestations of lice? A. Basically, people get lice from other people, according to Dr. Stanley Green, an entomologist at Pennsylvania State University. Lice spread between people who share personal items and articles of clothing. Lice can infest anyone, regardless of their personal hygiene. They do not feed on dirt but rather on blood. Three types of lice feed on people: head lice, body lice, and crab or pubic lice. Head lice are spread from hats, hairbrushes, combs and wigs. Body lice are transmitted from clothing, particularly undergarments. Crab lice are spread through sexual contact but can also be contracted from toilet seats and bedding. Lice are a particular menace to people because the bites cause extreme discomfort and in some cases sleeplessness. A number of chemicals have proved effective in controlling lice. Among them, Dr. Green recommends Kwell cream, lotion or shampoo, pyrenate liquid or gel, Rid liquid, and Cuprex. Dr. Green said that washing clothing in hot water would kill body lice but that frequent showers alone would not kill head lice. Q. How does a levitated train remain off the ground? A. Experimental trains are levitated when powerful magnets on the railbed repel magnets of the same pole mounted on the trains, thereby keeping the trains from touching the railbed. Another set of magnets arranged along the railbed attracts magnets of the opposite pole on the train, pulling it forward. All of the magnets are made of superconductive materials that have no resistance to electricity, allowing them to create much higher magnetic fields. The Japanese Railway has produced an experimental train that travels at 250 miles an hour.",1987-02-24T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 Limited immunity will be granted this week to some witnesses to compel their testimony on the Iran-contra affair, the chief counsel of the special Senate investigative committee said. A6 Alterations in N.S.C. documents were ordered by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North who told his secretary to use a word processor to prevent the originals from being found by investigators, sources said. A6 Syrian troops went into action within 24 hours of their arrival in Beirut, trading gunfire with militiamen and setting up checkpoints in an attempt to stop the fighting here. A1 Iosif Z. Begun returned home to a jubilant Moscow welcome, pledging to devote himself to the cause of human rights in general and Jewish rights in particular. The Jewish rights advocate was freed from prison Friday. A1 U.S.-Soviet grain talks resumed amid reports in the market that Moscow recently purchased up to one million tons of American corn, reports that could not yet be confirmed. D6 Top U.S. scholars appealed to China to stop its crackdown on liberal intellectuals. In a letter to the Chinese Ambassador in Washington, 160 scholars said they were ''deeply concerned.'' A7 Bangkok is being challenged by the army chief who replaced Prem Tinsulanonda when he became Prime Minister. The army chief has made several recent speeches that have been sharply critical of Thailand's civilian politicians. A9 NATIONAL A12-23 The 1988 deficit target cannot be met without using gimmicks, the House and Senate Budget Committee chairmen said, indicating that they are ready to abandon the budget-balancing law's goal of $108 billion. A1 A new welfare plan was endorsed in large part by President Reagan. He supported the governors' idea to require welfare recipients to work, if able, in return for child care, medical insurance and other benefits. A20 Richard A. Gephardt is a candidate for President, he said as he called for an end to an era of ''selfishness'' and for stern measures on trade. The Missouri representative is the first major Democrat to announce his candidacy. A12 Some aliens have left the U.S. since the nation's new immigration law was signed by President Reagan on Nov. 6, and the law's sanctions for employers has forced tens of thousands of others to confront the possibility of doing so. A12 Mayoral candidates in Chicago will be chosen by voters today. The candidates then will slug it out in another six-week campaign leading up to the general election April 7. A12 Displays of sexually explicit books and other materials will be considered by the Supreme Court, which will decide whether states may ban such displays from places where children might be able to examine them. A23 Marijuana smoking declined in 1986 among high school seniors in the United States, but there was an increase in students tried cocaine in various forms, including crack, a national study reported. A21 A film director was questioned by prosecutors in an involuntary manslaughter trial involving ''Twilight Zone: The Movie'' about a meeting that he says took place before the helicopter crash in which three actors were killed. A18 Dance now has a corps of managers, the product of the boom of the 1970's and a highly competitive business. Many people says it is becoming more difficult and even foolish for artists to try to manage their own companies. C13 A new computer age is farther away than many would wish. The gap between the availability of state-of-the-art personal computer hardware and the development of the software that makes it tick is rapidly widening. D1 WASHINGTON TALK A22 Contra drug inquiry stirs interest E.P.A. chief shifts gears REGIONAL B1-4, B20 Confusion about AIDS is growing and disrupting New York City's work force. Employers and employees are reacting to AIDS victims in ways ranging from support and financial assistance to ostracism and outright dismissal. A1 Poor subway car performance has been noted on the R-68's, the newest cars in the city's fleet, and the Transit Authority is considering switching to a rival manufacturer for the final 200-car order. A1 The rites of passage of police officers in New York City are long and hard. Motivations and ability are constantly tested, and lives can be disrupted. As a result, one recruit said, he postponed his engagement. B1 30 protesters of an eviction were arrested for attempting to prevent a woman from being removed from a Columbia University apartment building. Columbia says it is trying to meet a growing need for housing.

The Hawks led throughout the second half and took control in the fourth period with a 17-7 run that stretched their lead to 100-87 with just under four minutes left. Wilkins scored 7 in the spurt and Mike McGee added 6. After David Wingate hit a 3-point basket with 10 minutes 30 seconds left in the game, the 76ers went 6:13 without a field goal before Charles Barkley scored on a rebound. The Sixers did have nine free throws during that period and went 38 of 46 from the free-throw line in the game. Andrew Toney led Philadelphia with 23 points, Barkley had 20 and Maurice Cheeks 17. McGee added 19 points and Glenn Rivers had 16 for the Hawks. (AP) Cavaliers 109, Bullets 105: In Richfield, Ohio, Tyrone Corbin scored 8 points during a 19-2 Cleveland run in the second quarter, and the Cavaliers survived a fourth-quarter Washington rally. The Bullets got 19 third-quarter points from Terry Catledge to pull to 10 points down, at 84-74, entering the fourth quarter. Washington used a full-court trap defense to whittle the deficit to 1 point -102-101 - with 1:43 to play, but the Bullets never caught up. Phil Hubbard led Cleveland with 21 points. Catledge finished with 27 to pace the Bullets. (AP) Rockets 124, Nuggets 108: Akeem Olajuwon scored 16 of his 31 points in the breakaway third quarter to lead Houston. Olajuwon led a 12-0 surge over a 2:55 span of the third quarter that broadened the Rockets' 6-point halftime lead to 82-67 with 5:04 remaining in the quarter. Jim Petersen scored a career-high 22 points and helped the Rockets pull away in the final minutes. Houston's Cedrick Maxwell scored his 10,000th career point with 2:36 to go in the first quarter. (AP) N.H.L. North Stars 4, Canadiens 3: In Montreal last night, Keith Acton capped a three-goal second period for Minnesota with the winning goal. After the North Stars' Brian MacLellan and the Canadiens' Claude Lemieux scored first-period goals, the North Stars jumped on Montreal's mistakes in the second. Brian Bellows was left unchecked and scored his 17th to start the rally. Brian Lawton snapped a loose puck into the net midway through the period, and Acton scored after an errant Montreal pass. Larry Robinson scored for the Canadiens early in the third and Lemieux added his second late in the period, but steady goaltending by Kari Takko, a rookie who faced 16 shots in the final period, kept the Canadiens from tying the game. (AP) TENNIS Keil Upsets Bassett: Kathrine Keil, ranked 122d in the world, scored the first upset of the International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Fla., yesterday when she beat Carling Bassett of Canada, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.

The following technique molds the beef into a classic chateaubriand shape. STEP 1: Have a butcher cut a chateaubriand section from the tenderloin, or, if you buy the whole strip, remove the center third. The thinner end of the fillet is usually sliced into single-portion steaks, called tournedos; the thicker end can be sliced into individual steaks called filet mignon. STEP 2: Lay the chateaubriand on the center of a towel, with one of the flat sides down so that it stands like a cylinder. STEP 3: Fold the towel as illustrated. Using a meat pounder or heavy skillet, pound it to compress the cylinder into a thick pucklike shape. Saute the chateaubriand in oil for about 15 minutes for medium rare.

Page A1 Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North filed suit against the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, challenging the constitutionality of the law under which the prosecutor was appointed. A1 Syrian troops killed 22 Shiites in hand-to-hand combat and 3 Druse militiamen in West Beirut, police and hospital authorities said. But the Shiite group said that only 18 of its fighters had been killed. A1 Two captured French terrorists, objects of one of France's most intense police manhunts, managed to live quietly and undetected for three years among unsuspicious villagers in the Loire valley. A1 Interference in French journalism is at issue because a rightist business group has won a TV franchise that the Government took back from its original owners, saying they were Socialist sympathizers. A7 A top NATO official will retire, the Defense Department said. Gen. Ber- nard W. Rogers, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, will be replaced in June by Gen. John R. Galvin, now commander of forces in Latin America. A3 U.S. policy has been undermined in Central America, said George P. Shultz, by a member of Congress who is trying to run his ''own foreign policy.'' Mr. Shultz was referring to Senator Christopher J. Dodd. A3 Repression in post-Solidarity Poland has become less obvious, as Government authorities try simultaneously to limit potentially incendiary debate and to avoid any possible cause celebre. A12 China's senior leader may be weaker as a result of the recent political turmoil in Beijing, said some China-watchers in Hong Kong, who said Den Xiaoping may no longer exercise real power. A12 NATIONAL A13-18, B6, B9 A meeting on curbing AIDS' spread began in Atlanta that was intended to explore expanded uses of the blood test for AIDS. But a consensus appeared to be emerging against widespread mandatory testing. A1 A stellar explosion closer to Earth than any observed since 1640 is being studied, astronomers reported. This supernova may significantly increase understanding of how they come about. A1 Harold Washington won renomination as the Democratic candidate for Mayor in Chicago. Mr. Washington, the city's first black Mayor, defeated former Mayor Jane M. Byrne. A1 Governors approved a welfare plan that would turn its largest program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, into one that would require work or job training from recipients in exchange for aid. A17 A plan to ease evacuation standards at nuclear power plants was sharply attacked by Governor Cuomo and other elected officials at a Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearing in Washington. A14 Mr. Cuomo proposed Richard Nixon as the nation's next chief arms control negotiator, saying that he thought Mr. Nixon could command respect. He also had some chilly observations about Gary Hart. A17 Toxic dumping locales in 12 states were identified by a Houston-based gas pipeline company that has acknowledged burying PCB's in possible violation of Federal law. Seventeen sites are in Pennsylvania. A14 Fighting crime in Los Angeles is the aim of a proposal that will go on the ballot June 2 in the city's South Central area on paying higher property taxes to hire more police in the district. A14 A mistaken search was reasonable and thus did not violate the Constitution, the Supreme Court ruled, because police officers armed with a warrant who searched the wrong man's apartment in a multi-unit dwelling were understandably confused. B6 'Video visits' to the elderly are being used by nursing homes to supplement personal visits. The concept was recently recognized by the American Association of Homes for the Aging as a significant innovation. C1 Better designs for ski gear, from boots and bindings to poles and gloves, are resulting from computer simulations that give a better understanding of what happens when a ski pounds against the snow. D8 One of the biggest banking mergers in history was announced as the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles won the bidding to acquire the Rainier Bancorporation of Seattle. D1 Deaver warned to plead guilty or face indictment A1 WASHINGTON TALK A16 Sizing Up Dole Cuts at Pentagon Capital Reading REGIONAL B1-4 The restoration at Ellis Island is about halfway through and it is beginning to make the old United States Immigration Station gleam again. The inside of Registry Hall resembles a barrel-vaulted ice castle. B1 The Parking Violations Bureau, which lay at the heart of New York City's biggest corruption inquiry in a generation, has emerged from its darkest days with new programs and improving morale. B1 Surrogate-birth arrangements are increasing nationwide. They have been improvised between friends and relatives, or by homosexual couples and single people, with no supervision by doctors or lawyers. B2 An agreement to pay Jay L. Turoff was described by a witness, who said the former head of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission got a percentage of the witness's shares in an electronic taxi meter company in exchange for Mr. Turoff's mandating the use of the meters. B3 Plans for next year's opera seasons underscore the different problems and ambitions of the Metropolitan and New York City Operas. Both are trying to balance finite resources against artistic responsibility. C19 NEEDIEST CASES D23",1987-02-25T05:00:00+0000

But his success in front of the camera hasn't tempered his desire to return to the sidelines. ''At the end of the playoffs, I'll have the opportunity to have some options, and that will be pleasant,'' Brown said during a luncheon with other CBS broadcasters in Manhattan. He would not say if any team had approached him yet. In the meantime, broadcasting has kept Brown close to the sport. ''When you're coaching, you are working towards an emotional and physical exhaustion for 2 hours and 5 to 8 minutes,'' he said. ''When you're broadcasting the game, you have to be conscious about being articulate, concise and informative. You want to teach, but you also want to have humor.''",1987-02-26T05:00:00+0000

No author had ever been guaranteed such a sum. And, based on a reading of the first 200 pages of the book, several other publishers were convinced it was not of the caliber of his previous best sellers, including ''Tai-Pan,'' ''Shogun'' and ''Noble House.'' Was the Hearst Corporation, the parent company of William Morrow & Company, which bought the hard-cover rights, and Avon Books, which bought the paperback rights, going too far out on a limb to promise that much? The $5 million is a guarantee that Mr. Clavell will pocket that amount even if his royalty on each hard-cover and paperback book sale does not amount to that much.

us,Hoyt Barred for Season,"LaMarr Hoyt, the 32-year-old former Cy Young Award winner, was barred from baseball for the 1987 season by Commissioner Peter Ueberroth yesterday for Hoyt's involvement in three illegal drug incidents over the last year. ''While our first priority is to provide help to those who need it, we will impose discipline where appropriate,'' the commissioner said. Hoyt, a 24-game winner with the Chicago White Sox in 1983, was traded to the San Diego Padres after the 1984 season. Last February, authorities who stopped him at the Mexican border said he was carrying three grams of marijuana and a quantity of unauthorized Valium and Quaalude pills. He paid an administrative fine. Later that month, the San Diego police said they found him in possession of marijuana and a switch-blade knife. He pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance. After getting treatment at a drug rehabilitation center, primarily for alcohol, he rejoined the Padres and compiled an 8-11 record with a 5.15 earned run average in 35 games. But he was arrested again last October, this time for marijuana and unauthorized possession of pills. He pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to 45 days. When the Padres released him Jan. 7, the team said it would not honor the remaining three years of his contract, and the Players Association filed a grievance in Hoyt's behalf. Last year, the commissioner penalized 11 players for their involvement with drugs but permitted them to play if they met certain conditions. All complied by donating a percentage of their salaries to drug-prevention programs, performing community service and submitting to drug tests. No such option was mentioned in Hoyt's case, however. Don Fehr, executive director of the players association, said it would be up to Hoyt and the pitcher's representatives if they want to appeal the commissioner's action. ''The saddest part is that everybody is lining up to throw darts at the guy,'' Fehr said. ''I used to think the worst thing that could happen to you in America was to get fired from your job. Now they've fired this guy and said he can't even work any place else.''",1987-02-26T05:00:00+0000

STEP 2: Lake Resources transfers $2.037 to the C.I.A. Swiss account. Because of a communications failure between North and Secord, the deposit is made to a closed account. STEP 3: Because the funds are not immediately available for the Defense Department, North asks Israel to deliver 500 TOW's from its own inventory. STEP 4: 500 Israeli TOW's delivered to Iran on Oct. 30 and 31. STEP 5: 500 TOW's released to C.I.A. and transported to Kelly Air Force Base 3. STEP 6: TOW's shipped to Ramstein, West Germany, Nov. 6. STEP 7: C.I.A. proprietary airline delivers TOW's to Israel Nov. 7 as replacements. Note: The difference between the amount provided by Iran and that paid to C.I.A. (Defense Department was still unpaid for this last shipment as of January 20, 1987) leaves almost $5 million unaccounted for.

According to I.B.F. rules, Spinks was supposed to have made a mandatory title defense against the No. 1 contender by Jan. 19, nine months after taking the crown. Robert W. Lee, the I.B.F. president, said Spinks was given a 30-day extension to fight the top-ranked I.B.F. contender, Tony Tucker. After Don King won the purse bids for that fight at $711,000, Butch Lee, Spinks's promoter, sent a message to the I.B.F. saying that Spinks would neither negotiate nor participate in a mandatory bout with Tucker. Lee said that after the federation received the message ''we had little choice but to vacate Spinks's title.'' He added that the vacant title would be filled in an ''immediate elimination series'' between Tucker and the No. 2 contender, James (Buster) Douglas, and the winner would defend within six months against Carl (the Truth) Williams.",1987-02-27T05:00:00+0000

The saxophonist Henry Threadgill and the bassist Fred Hopkins were two-thirds of Air, the new-jazz trio that played fast and loose with Mr. Threadgill's compositions in ways that were droll and bluesy and smart, often all at once. Andrew Cyrille has lent his crisp, explosive drumming to some of the best jazz of the past two decades - not least of it his long association with Cecil Taylor. Together, they should make a trio that can assemble and take apart structures, kick them around the block and then put them back together again upside-down or sideways. Sets tomorrow at 8 and 10 P.M.; tickets are $10. $ ? * * *Roger Miller, Volcano Suns, Divine Horsemen, Phantom Tollbooth, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street (982-4052). With bands from Boston, Los Angeles and Plainview, L.I., CBGB has assembled yet another testimonial to the quality and ferocity of independent-label American rock. The Volcano Suns and Roger Miller both sprang from the Boston band Mission of Burma; Mr. Miller left to play keyboard-centered compositions with the structural complexity of classical music, while the Volcano Suns continue Mission of Burma's guitar-charged attack - leavened, now, with a little humor. Divine Horsemen are on the dark side of Los Angeles's rediscovery of country-rock; on their album ''Devil's River'' (SST), the singers Chris Desjardins (who calls himself Chris D.) and Julie Christensen share tales about violence, tortured love and morality in songs that twang and stomp. And on their debut EP, ''Phantom Tollbooth'' (Homestead), the Long Island-based band plays dissonant, squalling songs with titles like ''More Paranoia,'' songs that grind and thrash, then turn on a dime. Phantom Tollbooth opens tomorrow at 10:30 P.M., followed by Divine Horsemen (11:30 P.M.), Volcano Suns (12:30 A.M.) and Mr. Miller (1:30 A.M.); admission is $8. $ ? * * *Pat Martino, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, at 17th Street (533-7902). The guitarist Pat Martino dropped out of jazz in 1980, the victim of a brain aneurysm that led to surgery and a complete memory loss. But he taught himself to play again, and his style is intact - steeped in be-bop, but with utterly individual harmonic turns and a rhythmic flexibility that makes his phrases seem to twist themselves inside out. He'll be playing in a bare-bones trio, Steve LaSpina on bass and Joey Baron on drums, and the shows will be recorded for a live album. Sets tonight are at 9 and 11, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 and 10 P.M.; there is a $12.50 cover and a $7.50 minimum. $ ? * * * Pop Album of the Week: Nana Vasconcelos: Bush Dance (Antilles): The Brazilian percussionist-singer Nana Vasconcelos made his last solo album, ''Zumbi,'' by layering on all the sounds he could produce with his hands and his voice. For ''Bush Dance,'' he has harnessed a DMX drum machine and added occasional keyboards or guitars, mostly from Peter Scherer of the Ambitious Lovers. The result is more high-tech but no less exuberant, making Brazil-New York connections with Brazilian, especially Bahian, rhythms right up front. At times, as in ''Futebol'' and ''Paleto,'' the music suggests a leaner version of pan-American fusions by Weather Report and the Brazilian songwriter Milton Nascimento; elsewhere, as in ''Mamae Cade Baleia,'' Mr. Vasconcelos heads for territory all his own - Bahian-country-minimalist-funk, or something like that. Like all great percussionists, Mr. Vasconcelos knows just where an interjection or syncopation will lift the music; even when he's using a computerized beat, he tops it with live, unpredictable kicks.",1987-02-27T05:00:00+0000

Dick Van Arsdale, a former Knick and All-Star guard for the Suns who does color for the team's radio and television broadcasts, was named interim coach for the remainder of the season. With a 22-34 record and in fifth place in the Pacific Division, the Suns appeared headed toward their third straight losing season, and missing the playoffs for the second year in row. ''The team needs a change in direction and a change in attitude,'' Colangelo said. ''With five rookies on our roster, we are one of the youngest teams in the league and we are in a rebuilding mode. But the Suns are in a negative cycle and we had to do something to break out of it.'' The 49-year-old MacLeod said: ''It's a blow, but you take it. It's not the end of the world. I hope to coach again somewhere, some place.'' In coaching longevity, MacLeod, hired as the fifth coach in Suns' history March 30, 1973, trailed only the 16 seasons of the Boston Celtics' Red Auerbach and the 14 of the Golden State Warriors' Al Attles. His 579 career victories placed him eighth in history.

Rozelle's rules require any club desiring a move to another stadium or city to get approval of three-quarters of the league's other clubs. Bidwell, who contends that Busch Stadium is so small that the team cannot generate enough income, has threatened to move the club. Plans for a new domed stadium in St. Louis have hit a snag, and Bidwell is said to think that his case for relocation is so strong and well understood that there is no need for the suit.",1987-02-28T05:00:00+0000

The company said the latest fourth quarter results reflect about $13 million pre-tax of non-recurring expenses for the following: the reversal of a portion of a previously recorded insurance claim associated with the lawsuit filed against the company by competing bottlers in the Charlotte market, other costs and expenses associated with that lawsuit; a special provision for bad debt; severance expenses for the company's fourth quarter manpower reductions; an additional sales tax assessment; writeoffs of inventory, and additional expenses for the company's employee benefit programs, including a provision for settlement of certain claims related to executive incentive programs in effect during prior years. The after-effect of these non-recurring expenses was $7.4 million. In addition, the company experienced an after-tax increase of about $1 million in container expenses due to curtailed patronage dividend from one of its container suppliers. The company said the fourth quarter also was adversely affected by the reversal of previously accrued investment tax credits of about $1 million as a result of changes in federal tax laws. In addition, the effective tax benefit was lower than usual in the fourth quarter due to the netting of capital gains against ordinary losses and the inability to carry back operating losses for State and Canadian income tax purposes, making the ocmpany's after-tax loss about $3.7 million higher than it would have been at normal rates.

Baker Jr., in a dramatic move to revive his troubled Presidency. Page 1 Man in the News: Howard H. Baker had always said that it's hard to say ''no'' to the President. So his friends were not surprised when he quickly accepted the post of White House chief of staff. 7 Mr. Baker's presidential ambitions had him on the verge of deciding to run for President when President Reagan offered him his new post. ''I didn't see how I could turn it down,'' Mr. Baker said. 1 The Tower panel was dismayed and surprised by President Reagan's lack of knowledge about the Iran-contra affair during their two long conversations last month, the 3 commission members said in an interview. 1 News analysis: Mr. Reagan's choice of Mr. Baker as his new chief of staff was taken by political Washington today as the first distinct sign in months that the President is rousing himself from political torpor. 1 George Bush accepted the conclusion of the Tower Commission that Washington's negotiations with Iran disintegrated into a trade of arms for hostages and said the policy had ''failed the American people.'' 6 Tangled web of legal issues 9 Guatemalan role cited in reportbe, 10 Nicaragua derides Tower report 10 INTERNATIONAL 2-10 The Paris trial of a terrorism suspect heard a prosecutor's plea for a ''moderate'' sentence. He said France could be held hostage if it made Georges Ibrahim Abdallah into a ''martyr.'' 1 The Vatican expressed astonishment at efforts by the Italian authorities to arrest the American head of the Vatican bank and two of his closest associates. A sharply worded statement fully supported Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus. 2 Protecting the ozone layer was the subject of criticism leveled against Europe by the United States, which said foot-dragging had prevented action against destructive chemicals at an international conference on the issue. 2 News analysis: Russian opposition to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new policies is evident among high party officials and farmers alike, and the leader has felt increasingly compelled in recent weeks to address their concerns. 4 George Shultz arrived in Hong Kong. He begins a five-day visit Sunday to 5 Chinese cities, including Dalian, the center of an economic development zone, in an effort to reinforce an improving relationship with China. 3 Prosecutions urged in Manila 3 NATIONAL 11-13, 32 Drug profits in Florida are so great that prominent figures from professional automobile and boat racing appear to have been drawn into competition with agents. 11 News Analysis: The welfare system and how to overhaul it have suddenly become the center of a national consensus among liberals and conservatives, governors and members of Congress and the Reagan Administration. 11 A $14.8 billion trade deficit was reported by the Commerce Department for the month of January, with imports flowing at nearly twice the level of exports. The showing was much worse than in December. 39 Consumer prices were up 0.7 percent in January, the biggest advance in four and a half years, the Government reported. But many analysts said that the rise did not necessarily mean a new inflation surge. 39 The release of 185 Texas prisoners will be the immediate result of Gov. Bill Clements' declaration of a state of emergency in the prison system. The move cleared the way for the release of perhaps hundreds of others 11 Secret U.S. nuclear experiments were conducted, with President Eisenhower's approval, while the United States and the Soviet Union had a moratorium on testing, according to a newly published report. 13 A convicted spy portrayed himself as a loyal American who helped Israel and cited ''extremely detailed'' requests for American intelligence data as evidence of Israel's highly coordinated espionage effort. 12 Politics is big business in Louisiana, and with the biggest business, oil, in the dumps, the upcoming election year can be counted on to stoke the economy through the nonpartisan primary on Oct. 24 and the run-off Nov. 21. 13 A Federal research funding pattern was noted by the auditing arm of Congress, which found that 16 of the 20 universities that received the most Federal research money in 1967 were at the top of the list for 1984. 12 A land swapping proposal in Alaska aims to shift title to subsurface oil rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from the Federal Government to Alaska Natives and perhaps to the state. 12 WASHINGTON TALK 12 Consequences of Fawn Hall REGIONAL 33-37 New regulations on tow trucks were proposed by the Mayor, who noted that tow trucks speeding to crash sites contributed to 7 deaths, about 800 personal injuries and 1,200 collisions between 1983 and 1986. 1 An offer of free AIDS testing will be required in hundreds of clinics in New York State that specialize in prenatal care, family planning and the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse, a health official said. 33 Stabilized rent rules will change in New York City under a Board of Estimate decision. But city officials, building owners and tenants are not certain how the process of setting rent guidelines will proceed. 37 Refugees seeking to enter Canada are gathering on the New York-Canada border.
