His pictures were inspired by the turn-of-the-century German Jugendstil (youth style, or Art Nouveau), graphic artist provocateurs who regularly outraged both bourgeois and aristocratic Junker classes by poking holes in their masks and debunking their pretensions in the notorious weekly satirical journal Simplicissimus (also known as Der Simpl in the 1940s). He also owed a debt to his favorite visual trickster, Ronald Searle, whom Wolfe praised as a giant of the graphic netherworld on the front page of a 1981 Times Book Review. Wolfe surprisingly identified as much as a cartoonist as he did a writer, and many of his drawings were captioned. In 1979, the same year that The Right Stuff was published, he wrote the introduction to an exhibition catalog I edited on Simplicissimus. Caricaturists, as any caricaturist can tell you, he wrote, live, work and die in a shantytown scarcely visible from that monumental Braslia known as the world of art. He was referring to his own inclination for the comic art form, which he started practicing in 1956 at The Springfield Union (the predecessor of The Republican) in Massachusetts. He continued: The few miserable souls in the fine art classes who are interested in caricature pass around pictures by the artists they admire, quietly, by hand, as if in some Novosibirsk samizdat network. He likened his first introduction to the work of the master graphistes from Der Simpl, at the Union in 1959, to having discovered another planet where, as in science fiction novels, the creatures were more enlightened than those on earth. In 1980, Wolfe emerged from his self-imposed netherworld with In Our Time, his book of mocking sketches and stinging essays about the 1970s absurd fashions, trendy morals and silly conceits. The drawings from that book reprinted here pay overt homage to the style of the period, but even more to the audacity of its artists to subversively  often savagely  lampoon their targets while still leaving them laughing and wanting more.",2018-07-06T09:00:12+0000

In early October, the dining facilities at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a neo-Classical landmark built in 1928, will be the first component of the Frank Gehry-led redesign of the museums interior to open to the public. Mr. Gehry was selected for the renovation in 2006, but the wheels for the master plan didnt start turning until 2010. (The whole project will be completed by 2020.) A 76-seat restaurant called Stir, to be run by Starr Catering, which came up with the restaurants name, will be warmly wood-paneled in Douglas fir, with a ceiling that undulates, Gehry-style. Central to the ceiling is a gridlike sculpture of curved crisscrossed slats and beams.  Mr. Gehrys contribution to the restaurant includes the tables and chairs, but not the tableware. The chef Mark Tropea, a former chef for residents of 15 Central Park West, an apartment tower in New York, will preside over the open kitchen. He plans to offer seasonal fare with strong local connections, like Kennett Square mushrooms, Barnegat scallops and a burger topped with Lancaster Cheddar. A new, enlarged cafeteria, also run by Starr Catering, is part of the plan. The dining options do not have an outside entrance, so museum admission is required for entry. We envision it as part of a total museum experience, Gail Harrity, the museums chief operating officer, wrote in an email.  Stir will open only during museum hours, so just lunch and brunch will be served; the cafeteria will be open from morning until late afternoon.",2018-07-10T21:00:42+0000

us,"Inside J.R.R. Tolkiens Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work","From Qenya to Gnomish to Sindarin, the high elven-speech J. R. R. Tolkien uses amply throughout the Lord of the Rings trilogy was the product of almost 40 years of what the English author once referred to as his secret vice: glossopoeia, or language creation. As Carl F. Hostetter writes in an essay in Catherine McIlwaines Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, his was a labor performed and preserved on thousands of manuscript pages containing Tolkiens minutely detailed description and unceasing elaboration (and revision) of not just one but rather of a family of invented languages, which can be collectively called the Elvish tongues. Although not alone in this practice, Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species. Tolkien drew this partial table of sound-correspondences among five Elvish languages  Qenya, Telerin, Noldorin, Ilkorin and Danian  around 1940. The meticulous organization scheme together with the curved lines connecting lexical groupings reveal both the systematic phonetic and the historical relationships between these individual tongues, while the numerous self-correction marks reflect a literary mind almost obsessed with perfecting each and every one of them, in both comprehensive tabulation and in minute detail.",2018-07-13T09:00:01+0000

Of course, the divide isnt as absolute as that; books can chronicle real-time experiences and films often include talking heads holding forth about the past. Still, the difference is striking. Books require that people recount their emotions; documentaries require that people bare the same emotions in front of a film crew.

Manhatta has its own street entrance and a plush lobby leading to dedicated elevators. Up you go to the 60th floor, the entirety of which is given over to the restaurant and the Bay Room, a spacious private event space (Mr. Meyers first) that abuts it. Its worth going at least for a drink at the commanding 40-foot black walnut bar, which, like the restaurant, has sweeping views of the city and New Jersey. (Theres no back bar lined with bottles, lest they interfere. And the dcor is suitably understated, with dark wood furnishings and bronze accents that would suit a tavern.) If you tire of the panorama, theres a gleaming open kitchen, with Jason Pfeifer, the executive chef, and his team at work. Though Mr. Pfeifer was last seen in the kitchen Maialino, here he looks more to France than to Italy. The well-tailored informality and emphasis on seasonality have much in common with Mr. Meyers flagship Union Square Cafe. At Manhatta, theres less emphasis on California and the Mediterranean, Mr. Pfeifer said. The evening menu offers peekytoe crab salad with leeks and artichokes, a French onion burger, duck tortellini in consomm and classic veal blanquette. Lunch is coming soon. Chocolate mousse, a vanilla souffl and blackberries with walnut gelato and sabayon cater to the sweet tooth. ",2018-07-17T17:05:48+0000

The causes are numerous and tangled. But consuming too much sugar is widely accepted as an important factor. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued a recommendation: Everyone, regardless of age, should restrict his or her sugar intake to less than 10 percent of all calories consumed daily. For young children, that would mean no more than about 45 grams of sugar a day. Of course, few young children are responsible for their own diets or can be expected to capably monitor their sugar consumption. That oversight usually falls to a parent. And a recent study published in the International Journal of Obesity suggests that most of us, alas, are not adept at estimating how much sugar is in some common foodstuffs.",2018-07-19T14:38:35+0000

Unconcerned about trends, the designers focus their attention on fit. Our garments dont fit small like many swimwear brands. We are trying to make swimwear that is inclusive, says Lansom. Mathilde and I are different shapes, and we will never stop until each piece fits us both.

But in the early 17th century, when Peter Paul Rubens shipped thousands of paintings out of the largest workshop in Europe, Antwerps house style was a much bolder affair. Head to the main cathedral here, for which Rubens painted his grandiose Descent From the Cross, and look at the eight figures bringing down Christs body in a torrent of sweeping fabrics and slashing light.

The 450-degree smoke point is higher than butters.

We live on an island, and most times, a nice pair of swim trunks is our daily attire, he says. As a testament to the designers laid-back Hawaiian sensibility, the brand offers board shorts  a classic surfers style of swimsuit  only in understated colorways and in trimmer, more tailored fits. One of our biggest inspirations is surf history here in Hawaii, Serrao says. Were recreating those original board shorts that were made of durable materials and made to last. Whats more, having the drawstring hidden within the waistband lends the trunks a clean silhouette. For Serrao, the option to have a more subdued trunk without any outlandish print or color is a matter of cultural immersion. It becomes the situation of the local versus the tourist, he says. To be local is to blend in and not stand out too much: Especially in Hawaii, you never want to appear like youre trying too hard. $118, salvagepublic.com",2018-07-26T18:50:08+0000

us,Ample Hills Opens Its Red Hook Factory,"Delays in opening a restaurant are common in New York. And the roadblocks are compounded when a place to eat also involves a fully equipped ice cream factory and bakery, as in the case of Ample Hills Creamery Factory and Museum. The location was one of the complications that pushed the opening back the best part of a year. Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, the owners, who founded the company in Prospect Heights seven years ago, were dealing with raw space. We had to build the infrastructure from scratch, Mr. Smith said. They also had to switch architects midstream. The new 15,000-square-foot facility, with a scoop shop and counters in front and behind it, a playroom and an interactive museum of ice cream, is built into Beard Street Warehouses. Part of a series of brick storerooms from the mid-19th century, the warehouses were once used to hold goods like cotton and coffee. The space has allowed Ample Hills to improve production with the capacity to churn out 500,000 gallons a year (right now theyre at 50,000). In place of batch freezers, there is now a continuous system. Mix-ins like cookie pieces made in the bakery are added automatically and pints are filled by machine, not by hand. Mr. Smith said that, if anything, this industrialization should enhance the ice creams texture. And though the company is now able to deliver pints to many more retail shops, Mr. Smith said they would keep opening scoop shops, adding, We dont just want to be pints in grocery stores. Los Angeles will have an Ample Hills in the fall, followed by another one on Prospect Park West, to bring the total to 13.",2018-07-31T17:59:43+0000
