McMahon suffered the injury Sunday in the second half of the Bears' 30-7 loss to New England. He could be out from four to six weeks, his doctor said yesterday. McMahon did not suffer any torn cartilage and will not need surgery as previously feared, said the team trainer, Fred Caito. Ditka said McMahon knew he was hurt after the play. ''He was aware the knee was twisted, but he walked off the field because he didn't want to show he was hurt,'' the coach said. Ditka said Mike Tomczak would start against Tampa Bay next Sunday.

Cane, ranked 101st in the world, handed Edberg only his second opening-match loss in a tournament this year. He lost to Mark Woodforde of Australia at the Canadian Open in August. ''I had nothing to lose and I played very relaxed,'' Cane said. ''I knew I had a chance to beat him if he didn't serve well.'' Edberg was broken three times in the final set. Edberg said he has simply played too much in the last five weeks.

Walt Poddubny had a goal for the Nordiques.

Detroit took a 3-1 lead on third-period goals by Gerard Gallant and Jeff Sharples, but the Capitals started their rally midway through the period when Lou Franceschetti circled the Detroit net and banked a shot into the net off Glen Hanlon, the Detroit goaltender. Franceschetti, who has been with the Capitals longer than any other player, was recalled from Baltimore of the American Hockey League on Monday. Detroit took a 1-0 lead on Sharples's first-period, power-play goal. Dale Hunter answered with a power-play score for the Capitals midway through the second period to make it, 1-1. Washington has played four straight overtime games.(AP) Canadiens 5, Whalers 3: Shayne Corson, Claude Lemieux and Mike Keane, a rookie, scored during a 2:45 span late in the first period to spark the Canadiens at Hartford last night.

For a year in which he batted .271, hit 11 home runs, drove in 44 runs, stole 46 bases and hit 40 doubles, Sabo received 79 points and 11 first-place votes from a panel of 24 baseball writers, two from each National League city. Mark Grace, the Chicago Cubs first baseman, was second with 61 points and Tim Belcher, the right-handed pitcher of the Los Angeles Dodgers, was third with 35. Sabo's 46 stolen bases tied for fourth in the league and were the most for a Reds rookie since Bob Descher's 54 in 1909. Sabo also matched a major league mark for third baseman with 11 assists in a game. Cincinnati was going to use him as a backup infielder, but when Buddy Bell, the veteran third baseman, was hurt at the end of spring training, Sabo took over. He was the only rookie to play in the All-Star Game.(AP)",1988-11-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Life in the 30's,"ONE of the saddest, most troubling continuing family dramas being played out in this city may well be the one involving the contractor and the commissioner, the judge and her daughter. The star of this drama was to have been the former commissioner, Bess Myerson, a onetime Miss America and New York City icon, the original girl-from-the-Bronx-who-made-good. The contractor is Ms. Myerson's paramour. The judge issued a ruling in his divorce case. The three of them are charged with conspiracy. The focus of the purported conspiracy is the judge's daughter, who the prosecution contends was given a job by Ms. Myerson in exchange for the judge's reduction of alimony payments. The daughter is a 39-year-old woman, outspoken about her liposuction and her manic-depression, named Sukhreet Gabel. Big-eyed and talkative, posing for pictures on the courthouse steps, she has wrested the starring role from her former boss. She has also become something of a public laughingstock, which is horribly sad, since she seems to be a woman with a good many problems, and unfortunate, since it diverts attention from the real issues of the case.",1988-11-03T05:00:00+0000

He won by a 2-to-1 ratio six years ago and polls point to a similar margin of victory next week. However, Mr. McMillan, underfinanced and undersupported by his own party, has taken the position that no incumbent should get ''a free ride'' and that an election is an opportunity to encourage discussion of issues. With both Senator Moynihan and Mr. McMillan not straying too far from the ideological center, there have been few major differences on issues. But, they disagree on abortion, aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and the budget deficit. The two candidates were interviewed by Frank Lynn of The New York Times. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: Drugs - As co-chairman of Democratic Working Group on Drug Abuse, helped draft recent legislation that reversed past allocation of more than 70 percent of Federal funds for cutting drug supply.

Now, with France floundering as it tries to qualify for the 1990 World Cup, Michel Platini has been named head coach of the French national team.

us,Q&A,"Q. When I moved into my 60-year-old apartment a couple of years ago, paint was peeling from the ceiling and the walls had bubbles on them. These would crack if you tapped them. I had all the walls and ceilings scraped, sanded, patched and painted, but last summer the bubbles were back and a few weeks ago a piece of plaster fell from the ceiling. What causes this problem, and what can be done about it? A. From your description it seems as though, at least on the ceiling, the problem may be with the plaster rather than the paint. If so, you will have to scrape out all the defective and loose sections and then do a more extensive patching job on the plaster. Or you may be better off putting up ceiling tiles or panels. As for the walls, it is not clear whether the paint or the plaster is bubbling. If the plaster is actually bubbling, then the defective material must either be scraped out and replaced or patched, or covered with paneling. If the paint is bubbling, it should all be removed, and the walls should be primed with an alkyd primer sealer before repainting. An even better solution would be to line the walls with canvas after scraping off as much of the paint as possible. You can then paint over the canvas just as you would over plaster. Q. Five years ago we had our kitchen rebuilt and installed a new ceiling with recessed lighting fixtures, which use reflector lamps. I cannot tell the exact wattage of the bulbs originally installed, but I have been replacing them with 75-watt bulbs. Lately the paint around one of the fixtures has started to bubble and crack. We thought it might be from a leak, but the nearest pipe is in a wall more than three feet away, and the plumber thinks the bubbling may be caused by the fixture. What is your opinion?< A. It sounds as if the fixture is becoming overheated and causing the paint to bubble. You may be using bulbs that are too high in wattage, or the fixture may not have enough space around it inside the ceiling to allow heat to escape harmlessly. All such fixtures are marked as to the maximum size bulbs that should be used (many are limited to 50 watts), so look for a label on the inside. If the ceiling is not accessible from above, then the fixture should be taken down. The space above and around it should be inspected from below to make certain that it is not covered by insulation or that air circulation around it is not otherwise impeded. Q. The metal cabinets in our kitchen have been faced with pressboard covered with something that looks like a contact paper with a simulated dark wood finish. This paper facing has peeled off in several places. Is it possible to paint over it with a lighter color? A. Yes. First wipe the surface with a solvent like paint thinner to make certain you remove all wax, polish, grease and soil. (This thinner is flammable, so take all precautions and make sure there is no pilot light on.) Prime with a coat of Enamelac, BIN or similar shellac-based sealer. Then paint with two coats of semigloss enamel, sanding lightly between coats. Q. My house has steel siding on the outside. Can this siding be painted, and if so what kind of paint should be used? A. The first step is to clean the siding thoroughly by scrubbing it with a brush and detergent. Then, if you are sure the siding is steel and not aluminum (you can test with a magnet), it should be primed with a metal primer, after which you can apply two coats of any good-grade alkyd base house paint. If the siding is aluminum, no primer is needed, and a latex house paint that is formulated for this purpose should be used.",1988-11-03T05:00:00+0000

In the holiday season, it's an easy way to send gifts. If you are shopping by catalogue, it's wise to use a credit card. It gives you a separate record of your purchase and, if a dispute arises, the credit-card company won't require you to pay until the matter is settled. Many companies have toll-free numbers for ordering or answering questions; some will send a free catalogue if you ask. The A.T.& T. toll-free information service or a toll-free directory can provide company numbers. Here is some advice for catalogue shoppers: $ PROCESS TIPS Ordering Procedures will be listed on order forms. Keep your own record of when you ordered and how you paid. Shipping Most orders should arrive within 30 days. Rush shipments can often be made in one or two days, for an extra fee. Delays The Federal Trade Commission requires the company to inform you of delays. You can cancel or wait. Your payment should not be processed until shipment. Returns In case of damage, the company is required to pay return costs; if you send the item back because you don't like it, you may have to pay for shipping. Help If you paid by credit card, the card company will help you if the catalogue company ignores your complaints. The Direct Marketing Association will also help if you send a record of the transaction and explanation of the problem.

Here is a brief selection: One tour company that specializes in gardens and has itineraries set up for three trips in 1989 is Serendipity Tours, 3 Channing Circle, Cambridge, Mass. 02138 (617-354-1879). The Garden Country is the title of one tour, scheduled for England from May 8 to 23. The first week will be spent visiting sites in the Cotswolds; in the second, participants have the choice of touring either Sussex and Kent or Wiltshire and Dorset. Two landscape designers will lead the tour, priced at $3,500 a person, including trans-Atlantic air fare, accommodations and all meals. A two-week tour of castles and gardens in Scotland is set for Sept. 12 at a cost of $4,200, including air fare. It will be led by a historian and a landscape architect. The Arboretum of the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia is sponsoring a Serendipity tour to forests and gardens in northern California from May 23 to June 5, and it will be led by the arboretum's director, Timothy Storbeck. The price of $2,450 does not include air fare. The Canterbury Cathedral Trust in America, which is based in Washington (202-328-8788), is co-sponsoring a tour of Canterbury and English gardens with English Homes and Country Tours, a British company. The 13-day program starts June 7 and includes visits to Sissinghurst, Warwick Castle, the Cotswolds and Bath. The price of $2,610 includes accommodations, all meals and drinks at private homes but not air fare. Ten percent of the tour cost is a contribution to the trust and is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.

In the first act, the principal characters were named Vladimir and Levy; in the second act Levy mysteriously became Estragon. The play was written with astonishing speed.

Most sexual diseases are most easily transmitted in the first weeks or months after an individual contracts them; in the case of syphillis, for example, by the time someone becomes sick, typically five years or longer after infection, the syphillis spirochete is virtually nontransmissible. By contrast, the AIDS virus is hard to transmit in the first few years and becomes quite easily transmitted as people start to develop symptoms, some three, four or five years later. Even at that late point, by moving quickly to notify and counsel, it is still possible to save 50 to 60 percent of steady partners from infection; with testing and earlier notification, certainly the chance exists to save 80 percent or more of partners.

us,NONFICTION,"CLARA BOW: Runnin' Wild. By David Stenn. (Doubleday, $18.95) This rags-to-riches biography of Clara Bow is titillating and enthralling yet sad. Born in 1905 into a desperately poor Brooklyn family, in which she was sexually abused and her mother was beaten repeatedly by her father, Bow was both beautiful and smart. She supported herself from the time she was 16 and by age 20 she was America's biggest movie box-office draw. An already stellar career was boosted by Elinor Glyn, Hollywood's reigning queen of chic, who dubbed her the ''It'' girl. ''It'' was a coy euphemism for sex appeal, which Bow possessed in abundance, along with great natural talent as an actress, a feisty temperament, fiery red hair and a penchant for candor. ''Clara Bow,'' written by David Stenn, a scriptwriter for television, chronicles the silent-screen films that made her a legend and her equally legendary sexual adventures. It also portrays her decline. She was exploited by her studio, Paramount, throughout her career, although she was their biggest moneymaker; uncertain about the quality of her voice, she was terrified at the advent of talkies. A series of scandals labeled her a home-wrecking tramp and made her a has-been at 25. Bow retired, married and had two sons. The mental illness that was prevalent in her family began to emerge and she spent the last 20 of her 65 years as a recluse; she was diagnosed as schizophrenic. Her husband, the actor Rex Bell, who became a well-known Nevada politician, had her legally barred from seeing her sons and the couple were estranged. This is a touching portrait of a sad and turbulent life.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000
us,FICTION,"LOVE IN THE DAYS OF RAGE. By Lawrence Ferlinghetti. (Dutton, $15.95.) Close upon the 20th anniversary of the student uprisings in Paris comes the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's novel about a May-September romance set against those few months of profound upheaval. Annie, an American painter living in Paris, has an affair with Julian, an older banker who, though firmly ensconced in the capitalistic hierarchy, is really an anarchist - or so he says. When Annie is skeptical, Julian woos her with stories of his revolutionary youth. As the drama of the revolt grows tense and ultimately reaches its decisive moment, Julian, at Annie's urging, must prove his allegiance to the cause with a single, incontrovertible act. Though Mr. Ferlinghetti makes an attempt at creating a memorable and passionate romance, it falls short. Annie, if anything, is continually questioning why she should remain with Julian. As for Julian, he enjoys Annie's company and her bed well enough, but with his polished, worldly demeanor he is no Abelard to her Heloise. The real hero of ''Love in the Days of Rage'' is the student uprising itself. Mr. Ferlinghetti writes very convincingly about the turbulence and energy, the sheer letting loose that was May 1968 in Paris. You can feel yourself being jostled and pushed along by all the chaos and anger. In short, you find yourself in the midst of great change. Mr. Ferlinghetti obviously has deep affection for Paris and its unique intellectual spirit. Even with its flaws, this short novel is haunting.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"GERALD L. K. SMITH: Minister of Hate. By Glenn Jeansonne. (Yale University, $25.) Gerald L. K. Smith was a bizarre fundamentalist whose vitriolic racism was matched only by his passion for collecting Bibles. In chronicling Smith's life, Glenn Jeansonne, who teaches history at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, opens a window on the lunatic fringe. Born in Wisconsin in 1898 and raised in a populist environment, Smith became minister of a church in Shreveport, La., where he ran afoul of conservatives after prevailing on Senator Huey P. Long to intervene on behalf of some church members who were threatened by foreclosure on their mortgages. Smith then became director of Long's Share Our Wealth Society, which to many smacked of socialism. After Long's assassination, writes Mr. Jeansonne, Smith ''would cry about the blood of Huey and then dip his hands in red dye and hold them aloft.'' Mr. Jeansonne impressively records the intricacies of Smith's financial organizations, his hatred of Franklin D. Roosevelt, his cultivation of isolationist congressmen (who later spurned him) and his quixotic campaigns for the Senate and the Presidency. But the book lacks psychological insight into Smith's character; the shift from seeming liberal to professional racist is not explained by the mortgages incident, in which one of the principals among the mortgage holders was Jewish. (Long was tyrannical, but not a racist.) A charismatic orator, Smith saw Jews and Communists as universal evil agents, with blacks as malleable fellow travelers. He once wrote: ''I expect to live and die a misunderstood man by millions of my compatriots.'' And he did, thank God.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,LOTHAR BAUMGARTEN'S DISCREET PROVOCATIONS,"Among current presences on the international art scene none is more benign than a German artist called Lothar Baumgarten, who has just made the news on two quite separate counts. At the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, there was inaugurated a ceiling piece of majestic proportions and almost incorporeal substance that measures roughly 110 feet by 40 feet. What we see there, floating high in the air and immediately above a reduced replica of the Parthenon frieze, is a hand-cut and hand-painted version of the Cherokee alphabet that was elaborated between 1809 and 1821 by an Indian named Sequoyah. Noble forms in themselves, the characters in question made it possible for a Cherokee newspaper to be published and read as of February 1828. (One of its first subscribers was Alexander von Humboldt, the great linguist, in Berlin.) This critic has not yet seen the Pittsburgh piece, but detailed photographs make it clear that it is a major addition to the long series of discreet provocations that Lothar Baumgarten has been setting up the world over, from Caracas in Venezuela to Venice in Italy. Each letter in the Pittsburgh ceiling is positioned at an angle of 45 degrees to its neighbors, so that no matter where we stand we see characters that, from our point of view, are the right way up.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Dionne Jr. of The New York Times is based on interviews with politicians and political consultants and on polls taken for newspapers, television and the campaigns. A number of recent polls suggest there is movement to Michael S. Dukakis in the final days of the campaign. This could overturn several narrow leads now held by Vice President Bush. The list also covers races for the United States Senate and for Governor in states where they are occurring. Most incumbent House members are expected to win re-election; the list includes only some of the most competitive House contests. ALABAMA: 9 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush the overwhelming favorite. ALASKA: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush far ahead. ARIZONA: 7 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush has big lead. Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat, favored, but his once large lead has shrunk. ARKANSAS: 6 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush has been leading, but Dukakis has outside chance. CALIFORNIA: 47 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush and Dukakis have been close for weeks. Bush appeared to have a narrow lead, but the polls have been contradictory. Dukakis has built the most extensive ground organization in the state's history and is counting on it. Republicans say absentee ballots will save the state for Bush. Senator Pete Wilson, Republican, leads Lieut. Gov. Leo McCarthy, Democrat, though McCarthy has narrowed the very expensive race. Close House race near President Reagan's home in Santa Barbara pits Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, Republican, against State Senator Gary K. Hart, Democrat. COLORADO: 8 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads, though Dukakis campaign still has hope. CONNECTICUT: 8 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush and Dukakis fighting to the end. Republican polls show late trend to Bush. Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Republican, faces fierce challenge from Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman. Weicker, the most vocal liberal in the Republican Party, clings to the narrowest of leads. DELAWARE: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads. Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican, favored, but Lieut. Gov. S. B. Woo is given some chance. Gov. Michael N. Castle, Republican, an overwhelming favorite for re-election. DISTRCT OF COLUMBIA: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis's surest bet in the country. FLORIDA: 21 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush locked up the state early. In fight for an open Senate seat, Rep. Buddy MacKay, Democrat, holds surprising, shaky edge over Rep. Connie Mack, a conservative Republican, despite Bush's lead. Three House seats opened up when incumbents sought the Senate seat. Porter Goss, Republican, favored to hold Mack's seat. Florida House Speaker Jon Mills, Democrat, a narrower favorite for MacKay's seat. Very close fight for the seat of Rep. Daniel A. Mica, who lost to McKay in primary. GEORGIA: 12 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads, though this is one of Dukakis's better Southern states. Feature contest is the race between Rep. Pat Swindall, a Republican under indictment, and the favored Ben Jones, a Democrat who played Cooter on the Dukes of Hazzard. HAWAII: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis led in late polling. Senator Spark M. Matsunaga, Democrat, a sure re-election winner. IDAHO: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush by a mile. ILLINOIS: 24 ELECTORAL VOTES A very close contest with Dukakis gaining ground. Rep. Jack Davis, Republican, faces strong challenge for re-election from State Senator George Sangmeister. INDIANA: 12 ELECTORAL VOTES The Bush-Quayle ticket far ahead. Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican, will be an easy winner. In the Governor's race, Secretary of State Evan Bayh, Democrat, leads Lieut. Gov. John Mutz, Republican. Bayh is the son of former Senator Birch Bayh, who was defeated by Dan Quayle in 1980. Three House incumbents, Reps. John Hiler, Republican, and Jim Jontz and Philip R. Sharp, Democrats, are in close races. IOWA: 8 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis leads in the state whose caucuses began the process. KANSAS: 7 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads comfortably. KENTUCKY: 9 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads, but Democrats say has tightened. LOUISIANA: 10 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads, but some polls last week showed Dukakis getting close. Rep. Clyde C. Holloway, Republican, is slight favorite in rematch against Faye Williams, Democrat. MAINE: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush has slight edge in state that is his summer home. Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat, hopes to break records with re-election margin. MARYLAND: 10 ELECTORAL VOTES Should be a strong Dukakis state, but polls have shown it close. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat, a heavy favorite despite spirited campaign by Alan Keyes, a former aide to Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and one of two black Republican Senate candidates this year. Peter Franchot, Democrat, has mounted a stronger-than-expected challenge to Rep. Constance A. Morella, Republican. MASSACHUSETTS: 13 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis favored in home state, but Bush has come embarassingly close. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat, has no such problem. MICHIGAN: 20 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush has led for a month, at times by a lot. But the race has tightened. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat, expected to win big. MINNESOTA: 10 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis has narrow edge. Fierce Senate battle between the incumbent Dave Durenberger and Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, son of the former Vice President. Durenberger leads but Humphrey was closing the gap this week. Rep. Arlan Stangeland, Republican, in a close race. MISSISSIPPI: 7 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush strongly favored. Rep. Trent Lott, Republican, leads Rep. Wayne Dowdy, Democrat, for the seat of retiring Senator John C. Stennis. Dowdy hopes to score upset with a heavy black vote. A tough fight for Dowdy's House seat, while Republicans should hold Lott's seat. MISSOURI: 11 ELECTORAL VOTES Another state where Dukakis has closed the gap to make it a tight race. Senator John C. Danforth, Republican, is heavily favored over State Senator Jay Nixon. Gov. John Ashcroft, Republican, leads solidly over Betty Cooper Hearnes, Democratic challenger. MONTANA: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads in a state where Dukakis once hoped for a breakthrough. Senator John Melcher, Democrat, favored, though Republicans say their candidate, Conrad Burns, is in a position to upset him. In a spirited fight to succeed the retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden, a Democrat, former Gov. Tom Judge, a Democrat, and the veteran State Senator Stan Stephens are virtually even. NEBRASKA: 5 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush safe in this traditionally Republican state. Democrats should pick up a Senate seat as former Gov. Bob Kerrey leads Senator David Karnes, Republican. Democrats may take the House seat of Rep. Hal Daub, a Republican who lost to Karnes in the Senate primary. NEVADA: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Should be one of Bush's best states. The surprise is how well Senator Chic Hecht, Republican, has done against the popular Gov. Richard H. Bryan, Democrat. Hecht, once far behind, is now close to even. NEW HAMPSHIRE: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush far out in front. Rep. Judd Gregg, Republican, leads Paul McEachern, Democrat, in the battle for the Governorship. In the fight for Gregg's House seat, which the Democrats have not won since 1912, Mayor Jim Donchess of Nashua, Democrat, runs close to former Justice Chuck Douglas of State Supreme Court. NEW JERSEY: 16 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush built very large lead in a state where his ''Boston Harbor'' television ad hurt Dukakis badly. But in recent days, Dukakis has come quite close. Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat, has led his Republican challenger, Pete Dawkins, throughout. Democrats fear that Bush's strength could pull in Joseph Azzolina, Republican, over State Senator Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat, in the battle for the seat of the late Rep. James J. Howard, Democrat. NEW MEXICO: 5 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush ahead in yet another state Dukakis once thought he could win because of its large Hispanic vote. Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat, once thought to be threatened, is now heavily favored. One tough House race is for the seat of retiring Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr., Republican. NEW YORK: 36 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis leads, though race could be close. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan will win overwhelmingly. Several close House races: Nita Lowey, Democrat, leads Rep. Joseph J. DioGuardi, Republican, in Westchester County. Rosemary Pooler, Democrat, narrowly lost to Rep. George C. Wortley, a Republican who retired. She has a tougher race against Syracuse City Council President James Walsh, Republican, who leads narrowly. Asesemblyman Bill Paxton, Republican, is leading David Swarts, Democrat, in the battle for Rep. Jack F. Kemp's seat. NORTH CAROLINA: 13 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads, having beaten back a once formidable Dukakis effort. Gov. Jim Martin, Republican, has an edge over Lieut. Gov. Bob Jordan, Democrat. The state has several closely contested House races. In what seems to be the closest, ic Rep. Stephen L. Neal, Democrat, is tested by Lyons Gray, a Republican businessman. NORTH DAKOTA: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads in a state where Dukakis once had a chance. Senator Quentin N. Burdick is 80 years old and has been ill. He has been leading Earl Strinden, Republican, but no one is certain what impact the Senator's health will have. Gov. George Sinner, Democrat, once worried about his prospects, but he leads Leon Mallberg, an antitax crusader. OHIO: 23 ELECTORAL VOTES Crucial to the Dukakis strategy, Ohio appeared close last weekend. But Bush seemed to open up a substantial lead this week. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, is well ahead of Mayor George Voinovich, Cleveland's popular Republican Mayor. State Senator Paul Gillmor is favored to hold retiring Rep. Delbert L. Latta's seat for the Republicans. OKLAHOMA: 8 ELECTORAL VOTES Solidly for Bush. OREGON: 7 ELECTORAL VOTES Has been very close, though Dukakis may be winning an edge in a state where he is well-organized. PENNSYLVANIA: 25 ELECTORAL VOTES The Bush campaign has spoken of a surpise victory here, but the closing trend may win for Dukakis. Senator John Heinz will be an easy winner. RHODE ISLAND: 4 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis leads. Republican Senator John H. Chafee leads his energetic Democratic foe, Lieut. Gov. Richard Licht. The race for Governor between the Republican incumbent, Edward DiPrete, and Bruce Sundlun, a Democratic businessman, is bitter and close. Rep. Fernand J. St Germain faces tough challenge from Ronald Machtley, Republican. SOUTH CAROLINA: 8 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush way out in front. Rep. Liz J. Patterson, a freshman Democrat, in jeopardy from Knox White, a 34-year old Republican. SOUTH DAKOTA: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads. TENNESSEE: 11 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush ahead in a state where a Democrat should do better. Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat, is far ahead. John J. Duncan Jr., Republican, is favored to hold his father's House seat, but it could be close. TEXAS: 29 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate in large part because he hoped to win Texas. But Bush, who represented Texas in the House, has led since August. Still, polls have shown wildly varying Republican margins, and some showed the contest tightening. Bentsen himself will win re-election easily over Rep. Beau Boulter. Two close House races: one for Boulter's seat, the other a rematch between Rep. Mac Sweeney, Republican, and Greg Laughlin, Democrat. UTAH: 5 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush leads by a vast margin. This could hurt Ted Wilson, the former Mayor of Salt Lake City, a Democrat who seeks to oust Gov. Norman H. Bangerter. Wilson's once large lead has shrunk as Bangerter tried to tie Wilson to Dukakis. An antitax third-party candidate, Merrill Cook, complicates the contest. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican, far out in front. Rep. James V. Hansen, Republican, faces former Rep. Gunn McKay, Democrat, for the third time since 1980. VERMONT: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES The Presidential race is very close with some polls giving Dukakis a slight lead. Rep. Jim Jeffords, a liberal Republican, is favored over Bill Gray, Democrat, for the seat of retiring Senator Robert T. Stafford, Republican. Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Democrat, is heavily favored to win a third term. In a three-way fight to succeed Jeffords. Former Lieut. Gov. Peter Smith, Republican, benefits from a split in the non-Republican vote between Paul Poirer, a Democrat and the Vermont House majority leader, and Bernard Sanders, the socialist Mayor of Burlington. VIRGINIA: 12 ELECTORAL VOTES Solidly Bush. Former Gov. Charles Robb, Democrat, strongly favored over Maurice Dawkins, Republican, for the Senate. WASHINGTON: 10 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis and Bush are neck-and-neck. So are Rep. Mike Lowry, Democrat, and former Senator Slade Gorton, Republican, in the battle for the seat being vacated by retiringSenator Daniel J. Evans, Republican. Gov. Booth Gardner, Democrat, is a heavy favorite for re-election. There is a hard-fought rematch between Rep. John R. Miller, Republican, and Reese Lindquist, Democrat. Miller leads. WEST VIRGINIA: 6 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis leads. Senator Robert C. Byrd will be an easy re-election winner. In the Governor's race, Gaston Caperton, a wealthy Democratic businessman, held a large lead over Gov. Arch Moore. But some polls have shown Moore closing the gap. WISCONSIN: 11 ELECTORAL VOTES Dukakis has a slight lead. In the race for retiring Senator William Proxmire's seat, Susan Engeleiter, a 36-year-old Republican State Senator, has been closing the gap against Herb Kohl, a Democratic businessman who is spending heavily on his own race. Kohl still a slight favorite. WYOMING: 3 ELECTORAL VOTES Bush easily.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE LAST OF HOW IT WAS, by T. R. Pearson. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Spun from twisted tales about life in rural North Carolina, this novel completes T. R. Pearson's trilogy about a mythical town called Neely. Last year, Patricia Henley said here that ''the language, earthy and elaborate, creates a world the reader will long to return to with the same abandonment of the real world one might have experienced as a child - the complete entering into the writer's dream.'' WALTZING WITH A DICTATOR: The Marcoses and the Making of American Policy, by Raymond Bonner. (Vintage, $11.95.) When Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, Raymond Bonner writes, he cleared the move in advance with President Nixon, to whose political campaigns he may have contributed as much as a million dollars. By documenting the symbiotic relationship between the Philippine dictator and American military and business interests, Mr. Bonner has made ''a signal achievement,'' Richard H. Ullman said here last year. His ''meticulous investigation makes it plain that the Marcoses' depredations were well known to United States diplomats in Manila and to their superiors in Washington.'' THE COLOR OF BLOOD, by Brian Moore. (William Abrahams/Dutton, $7.95.) As head of the moral opposition to a repressive regime, an Eastern European cardinal becomes caught in a dangerous political balancing act. ''Almost in thriller form, [ the novel ] is also a wise and illuminating meditation on the labyrinthine forces at work in a Roman Catholic Communist country like Poland,'' Clancy Sigal said here last year. BOTTOMS UP! A Pathologist's Essays on Medicine and the Humanities, by William B. Ober. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) By day a pathologist and assistant medical examiner, at night William B. Ober writes historical essays on such kinky arcana as flagellation and the sadomasochistic influences in the madrigals of the 16th-century composer Carlo Gesualdo. ''The author is that rarest of birds - a master of lore in both the sciences and the arts,'' Richard Selzer said here last year. ''If the gift of prophecy has not deserted me, Dr. Ober will be quoted by others a hundred years from now.'' Also available from the publisher is Dr. Ober's BOSWELL'S CLAP AND OTHER ESSAYS ($8.95). Named for the gonorrhea that bedeviled Dr. Johnson's biographer, the book includes disquisitions on how medical and psychosexual afflictions shaped the art of Swinburne, D. H. Lawrence and other literati. WAITING FOR CHILDHOOD, by Sumner Locke Elliott. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) Following the separate fates of seven members of an Australian family around the time of World War I, Sumner Locke Elliott conducts a fictional tour of a continent about to enter the modern world. ''The various narratives are so sensitively and refreshingly told, so neatly developed and carefully interwoven, that it is difficult not to be captivated by the sheer literary virtuosity of it all,'' A. R. Gurney said in The Book Review last year. SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR: A Life . . . a Love Story, by Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier. Translated by Lisa Nesselson. (St. Martin's, $12.95.) ''My life would be a beautiful story come true,'' wrote Simone de Beauvoir, the feminist writer and lover of Jean-Paul Sartre, ''a story I would make up as I went along.'' Last year our reviewer, Benjamin Ivry, called this biography ''a lucid, appealingly human account. . . . Indeed, there is a joie de vivre about this book . . . that explains why it might have been a lot of fun to be an existentialist.'' FLIPPING FOR IT, by Daniel Asa Rose. (St. Martin's, $7.95.) A young zoologist cannot understand for the life of him why his wife is leaving him for another man. Despite some histrionic prose, this first novel by a winner of the O. Henry Prize for short fiction ''is told with freshness, humor and . . . great openness of heart,'' Richard Goodman said here last year. DARK VICTORY: Ronald Reagan, MCA, and the Mob, by Dan E. Moldea. (Penguin, $7.95.) When he was president of the Screen Actors Guild in the 1950's, Ronald Reagan helped negotiate a deal that enabled his agent, MCA, to develop an entertainment monopoly, the author writes, that had connections with organized crime. The book contains ''interesting reading'' about Mr. Reagan's Hollywood past, Jeff Gerth said here in 1986, ''but falls short in showing that old ties make for current scandal.'' CAPTAIN BLACKMAN, by John A. Williams. (Thunder's Mouth, $10.95.) Running roughshod through American military history, a black soldier fights in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the War of 1812, the Battle of San Juan Hill and, finally, in Vietnam. ''The novel seems to say that the only reason black and white soldiers have not killed each other more often is that there has always been someone else to kill first,'' George Davis said here in 1972. '' 'Captain Blackman' is a boldly experimental way to get this all down.'' The same publisher has reissued Mr. Williams's novel SISSIE ($9.95), the story of a young black playwright, his sister and their mother. In 1963, Ernest Buckler said that the book put its author in the same league as James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison. THURSDAY'S UNIVERSE, by Marcia Bartusiak. (Tempus, $8.95.) Developments in astronomy are coming so fast, our reviewer, Laurence A. Marschall, said in 1986, that Marcia Bartusiak's ''authoritative'' book about cosmology should be read with dispatch. ''For a few years at least [ it ] can render the arcana of astrophysical research understandable to the public.'' To insure even greater longevity, the author has added an epilogue about the birth of last year's supernova.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE WHORE OF TJAMPUAN. By Harry Kondoleon. (PAJ Publications, $15.95.) Sardonic humor and verbal inventiveness enliven this strange, ultimately sad tale of a young man wandering through ''the terrible emptiness of a life exiled from love.'' The playwright Harry Kondoleon begins this first novel on the island of Bali, but it might just as well be New York, Rome, Singapore, Bangkok or any of the other places where the aimless, unhappy protagonist, Frank Klingensmith, has taken drugs, fought off craziness and had sex with a variety of peculiar people. In essence, ''The Whore of Tjampuan'' is simply another 1980's youth adrift saga. It's redeemed, however, by Mr. Kondoleon's flair for characterization and imaginative way with words. Though the cast is large for such a slender novel, each individual is strikingly defined with wit and measured sympathy. Among the more memorable are the misleadingly named title character, a respectable housewife who serves Texas-style chili in her Balinese restaurant, and Frank's parents, who watch television all day in their squalid apartment, commenting loudly on the personalities' physical attributes. While he is less vivid than these subsidiary figures, Frank holds a rather scattered narrative together by telling their stories in his own distinctive voice, which combines a sharp eye for absurdity with an ironic appreciation for the reasoning, however skewed, behind the bizarre things people do to cope with a chaotic universe. ''The Whore of Tjampuan'' has more style than substance, but its offbeat imagery and snappy prose give it considerable charm.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Reworking the Classics: Homage or Ego Trip?,"The most controversial issue in the theater today continues to be the reinterpretation or ''deconstruction'' of celebrated classical plays. There is no theatrical activity that more inflames purist sensibilities in criticism and the academy - nothing that stimulates as many caustic generalizations about the debasements of modern culture. Perhaps because ''deconstruction'' as an assonant noun if not as a method, is so perilously close to ''destruction'' and ''desecration,'' the standard purist posture is like that of Switzers before the gates of the Vatican, defending sacred texts against the barbarians. The paradox is that both sides are really devoted to the same esthetic purpose, which is the deeper penetration of significant dramatic literature. The difference is in the attitude. Is classical reinterpretation a reinforcing or a defiling act - a benign or a malignant development in the history of modern theater?",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"SPOCK'S WORLD. By Diane Duane. (Pocket Books, $16.95.) For those of us truly committed to the voyages of the Starship Enterprise and its quirky, familiar crew, there are very few unknown details, few legends left unexplored. But Diane Duane, the author of three earlier ''Star Trek'' books, has written the one irresistible story for any true Trekker: the ''history'' of the planet Vulcan, home of the Enterprise's stoic first officer, Mr. Spock. ''Spock's World,'' the latest of the ''Star Trek'' novels and the first to be published in hard cover, links the development of the fictional planet's tradition of logic and suppression of emotion with a fairly suspenseful story line that involves the possible withdrawal of Vulcan from the United Federation of Planets. The call to withdraw - a carefully engineered plot from a surprising, but ultimately logical source - is a disaster in the making. It would end the careers of both Spock and his father, Sarek, the Vulcan representative to the federation, and result in the exile of his parents from Vulcan, since every good fan knows that Spock's mother, Amanda, is human. Ms. Duane's meld of ''history'' and ''Star Trek'' lore creates a narrative that readers unfamiliar with the legendary television show may find difficult to follow. But if, like most Trekkers, you've watched the ''Journey to Babel'' and ''Amok Time'' episodes a dozen times, here is your chance to discover how Sarek and Amanda really met, whether it's true that Vulcans have no feelings and what happened to T'Pau, Vulcan's cranky and reclusive leader. Ultimately, ''Spock's World'' is an insular one; only a few million ''Star Trek'' fans will know or care what's going on.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Shortly after graduating from Harvard in 1981, Brian Hall set off on a bicycling tour of Europe with no goal other than the determination to shed the kind of provincialism that is born of, and nurtured by, 17 years of uninterrupted schooling. After several months of cycling in Western Europe, Mr. Hall, suddenly bored, decided to spend the fall exploring three ''more secretive, more elusive'' countries: Rumania, Bulgaria and Hungary. ''Stealing From a Deep Place,'' Mr. Hall's fluidly written chronicle of that journey, alternates between novelistic accounts of the adventures and misadventures of a solitary American traveling through the remote countryside and incisive observations on the history and politics of the region. Mr. Hall seems particularly interested in the daily lives of individuals he meets along the way. In Budapest, he finds that his friends' scathing remarks about Russia mask a deep concern for Hungary's national integrity under Soviet influence. Mr. Hall's patience wears thin in Rumania, where he encounters lazy customs officials, untended roads and a lack of food, which he indignantly attributes to a government more concerned with industrialization than feeding its own population. He sketches many memorable characters from Bulgaria, including Stilyan, the shady finagler, decked out in polyester and pointy-toed boots, who insists on ''helping'' Mr. Hall when his bike breaks down; and Yordan, the monk who becomes an unlikely drinking partner one cold November evening. People, much more than sites, stimulate Mr. Hall's keenest observations. The result is a book that transcends any notion of a typical tour guide.",1988-11-06T05:00:00+0000

Behind you, however, is not the Upper East Side, but Prospect Heights, because this is Brooklyn, not Manhattan, and the Park is Prospect, not Central.

The report indicated that the rate of production expanded at the highest level in three months. New orders also continued to grow at a slightly faster pace than in September but below levels for August and July, the report said. [ Page D1. ] The credit markets are becoming more pessimistic and interest rates are likely to rise, analysts said. The catalyst for the abrupt shift in sentiment was the across-the-board strength in October's employment figures, which sent a clear signal that the economy was not slowing but inflationary pressures were rising. [ D1. ] COMPANIES The $20 billion takeover battle for RJR Nabisco grew muddier over the weekend as the company's top executives considered whether to file a lawsuit to block a bid from an investment group led by Forstmann Little and Goldman, Sachs. [ D1. ] Natural gas producers think they are close to resolving the last of their disputes with the gas pipeline companies. The disputes have scared away many potential customers, who feared that the settlements might lead to much higher natural gas prices. [ D1. ] Texas Air reported a net loss of $114.1 million during its third quarter, which is ordinarily a strong period. [ D5. ] Banking regulators agreed to back down temporarily from their plans to order Mcorp, the troubled Texas bank holding company, to transfer capital into its ailing subsidiaries. [ D14. ] INTERNATIONAL REPORT West Germany is about to push through a law to reduce national health insurance payments for many drugs, a move strongly opposed by pharmaceutical companies. [ D8. ] Jordan began an austerity program and banned the imports of such goods as cars and video-cassette players. [ A3. ] American officials have criticized West German plans to offer subsidies to Airbus Industrie. [ D2. ] Japan and Britain say foreign investors will be scared away from Europe unless France and Italy ease tough regulations that treat English-made Nissans as Japanese cars, subjecting them to strict import quotas. [ D4. ] Brazil has brought the interest payments on its bank debt up to date for the first time since early last year. [ D9. ] THE MEDIA BUSINESS Wheatland Publishing is trying to buck the trend against independent book publishers and appears to be laying the foundation for long-term growth. [ D12. ] The game of musical chairs at the Omnicom Group is not as surprising as it seems because Bruce Crawford and Allen G. Rosenshine are returning to the careers they love. Advertising. [ D11. ] Investor's Daily is struggling for recognition among readers and advertisers, and it now faces a challenge from The Wall Street Journal's revamped ''Money and Investing'' section. [ D12. ] PBS has altered the rules for corporate sponsors on public television programs as critics complain about the increasing commercialization of the network.

The parties' leaders had demanded a change in the law as a precondition for joining the Prime Minister's party in a new government. Page 1 A West German politician resigned after giving a speech about Hitler that set off a political furor. Philipp Jenninger, Speaker of the West German Parliament, was not accused of being pro-Nazi, but was criticized for the timing and style of his remarks. 5 China's most prominent dissident says he has been invited to visit Taiwan. He would become the first prominent citizen from the mainland to visit Taiwan in almost 40 years. 6 Moscow and the Afghan guerrillas appear ready to hold their first direct talks on freeing the 313 Soviet soldiers reportedly held by the insurgents. 6 Kremlin leaders toured the Baltic, where three republics have shown resistance to the Communist Party's plan to redesign the Soviet Government. The officials apparently were assessing the extent of opposition. 6 Andrei Sakharov met Nazi-hunter, Simon Wiesenthal for the first time in New York City; it was a moment both seemed to savor - perhaps because until now, there was no place the two campaigners could meet. 6 Authorities broke up a meeting held by a group of dissenters in Prague. The police crackdown was the latest in a wave of increasingly aggressive actions to stifle dissent in Czechoslovakia. 6 A U.S. Navy destroyer in Japan, firing shells far from its practice area, narrowly missed hitting a Japanese patrol boat. The episode was the most recent in a series of tense incidents involving American military forces in Japan. 3 A relative of Haiti's leader lay dead in his car, the latest victim in a new wave of crime and terrorism in Haiti. The man, a brother-in-law of Haiti's President, had been shot several times. 28 In the Canadian general election, John Wilcox, the man touting himself as Johnny Canuck has set himself up as a sidewalk historian, traveling on money raised from a variety of anti-free-trade paraphernalia. 3 National 7-9, 32 A discount fare will be curtailed by major airlines as part of a broad restructuring of the discount fare programs that have saved consumer and business travelers hundreds of millions of dollars. 1 The dollar continued to plunge, nearing its 40-year low against the Japanese yen. Traders said they were becoming more convinced that the Bush Administration would favor a weaker dollar. 1 The Government will begin to notify more than 80,000 farmers whose loans are delinquent that they may be subject to foreclosure. Officials said the timing of the announcement was not determined by politics. 1 On Veterans Day, President Reagan visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where he appealed for a healing of the divisions that overshadowed American involvement in the Vietnam War. 7 In a new study of Vietnam veterans, almost two-thirds of those who experienced heavy combat reported delayed psychological and other health effects. The finding contradicted previous Government reports. 7 Calm returned to California after two days of turmoil following passage of a ballot measure that ordered cuts in insurance premiums. The State Supreme Court temporarily halted implementation of the new law. 7 The oldest known insect fossil was discovered in Canada. It provides strong evidence that the transition of animal life from sea to land occurred earlier than thought, scientists say. 32 Researcher sentenced for supplying false data to Government 7 Bizarre criminal case yields unusual Midwest auction 7 Politics 8-9 The Presidential race was winnable, Dukakis campaign aides say. They contend it would never have been easy, but that a better set of tactical decisions could have turned the tide. 1 George Bush's first vacation was witnessed by one intrepid reporter, who revealed that the President-elect had spent the morning by the pool, returning congratulatory calls and enjoying the Florida sunshine. 9 Michael Dukakis was a critical factor in George Bush's victory, aides to the President-elect say. Of all the Democratic challengers, they argue that Mr. Dukakis was the most vulnerable to their strategy. 8 Bush personnel team aims for stiff scrutiny 9 Regional 29-32 A $2 billion New York budget gap, nearly twice the amount estimated three months ago, has led the state's budget director to freeze hiring at all state agencies and to suspend approval of new contracts. 1 The first Bronx principal arrested on drug charges Wednesday had already been suspended from his job three times, was under investigation by the Board of Education and had enrolled in a program for drug abusers. 1 The integrity of New York City police is being threatened by rampant drug trafficking and efforts to control it, police commanders and criminal-justice experts have warned. 29 New betting games were on display at the Second Annual World Gaming Congress and Expo '88, a three-day trade show at the Showboat casino. The Whirlwind of Cash was a highlight. 29 A Queens animal rights advocate was arrested as she planted a bomb in Norwalk, Conn., outside a surgical instruments company that has been criticized for medical procedures using dogs. 29 Hospital workers met at a church to plan a challenge to what they said was widespread discrimination against minorities, particularly in hiring and promotion to senior positions in the hospital system. 29 Queens merchants failed in their bid to prevent the Metropolitan Transit Authority from rerouting bus lines that now cross Jamaica Avenue in order to serve the Archer Avenue subway extension. 31 Passer-by kills woman on Columbus Avenue 31",1988-11-12T05:00:00+0000

World War I was its own particularly disillusioning hell, but in Robert Goddard's superbly plotted romantic thriller, the real evil lurks in a graceful English country estate. There a wounded young lieutenant, recovering at the home of John Hallows, his dead captain and friend, is drawn into the Hallows family's tangle of secrets. The household includes a cast of standard but well-drawn characters: the captain's withdrawn, grieving father, turning his back on difficult truths to preserve the family's good name; the dead man's voluptuous, scheming stepmother; his beautiful, oddly calm widow, with whom the lieutenant falls in love; the captain's grandfather, garrulous but observant; and a wealthy, arrogant American who plots to marry the widow against her will. The principal story is told in retrospect from the point of view of the widow's daughter, who has been raised in an atmosphere of secrecy and hatred. The novel's movement through time, using additional narrators, adds layers of depth to its mysteries, which fit together as intricately as the pieces in a Chinese puzzle. ''In Pale Battalions'' contains a murder, hidden liaisons, flights and searches, as well as musings on the waste of war and the limits of duty and decency. Together they form an elegant melodrama in which the sentiments sound right, even when they border on cliche, and the author's manipulation of suspense and surprise rarely fails to dazzle.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Democracy, equal rights and, especially, justice are concepts often invoked but seldom examined; so it is singularly useful to read Elizabeth H. Wolgast's clear-sighted and thought-provoking essays. Ms. Wolgast, a professor of philosophy at California State University in Hayward and the author of ''Equality and the Rights of Women,'' argues in ''The Grammar of Justice'' that our underlying principles square rather badly with common sense and everyday practice. For example, in a society predicated on the existence of certain basic rights, held equally by everyone, Ms. Wolgast asks, how are we to understand the debate over abortion? The fetus is not exactly a person with the same rights you or I have; yet it is certainly not a mere piece of property attached to the woman who carries it. Ms. Wolgast also considers the theoretical problems of individual rights and responsibilities, representative governments as moral agents and the philosophical problems posed by punishment. It is time, she argues, for thoughtful application of a reality principle, so that our concepts of justice can acknowledge that women are different from men and children from parents, and that human beings live in communities in which people take responsibility for one another. No reader need agree with all her conclusions to find this a thought-provoking exploration of the philosophical ground on which American prejudices, instincts and rhetoric stand.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Whitney Balliett's fine eye for detail and love for music are apparent in these portraits of popular singers as different as Margaret Whiting and Ray Charles. The pieces, all but one of which first appeared in The New Yorker, are cast in a mold that will be familiar to Mr. Balliett's fans. Each subject is introduced by several paragraphs of the author's unflaggingly patrician prose, studded with a few of his patented metaphors that range from quick and precise (Nellie Lutcher, at the piano, holds herself ''straight as a ladderback'') to ambitious (blues shouter Big Joe Turner moves through a nightclub like ''a house being moved down a road'') to bizarre (Julius La Rosa's dog lies on the floor, looking ''like a Welsh mountain range''), and one or two bold but dubious generalizations (Tony Bennett is the ''most widely admired American popular singer''; Joe Turner is ''probably the greatest of blues singers''). After the introduction, the author usually cedes the floor to his subject, who holds forth in his or her own words for the rest of the profile. This approach, which Mr. Balliett takes as predictably as a horse that follows the same route home no matter who's riding, makes for good oral history but slightly dim reading. But none of these portraits is without value and the best of them are fine indeed. For anyone interested in American popular song, ''American Singers'' will be worthwhile.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

us,How 'The Devil' Hauled Shaw Up From Hell,"In 1896, when he was 40, Bernard Shaw's sense of failure had brought him to the verge of physical collapse. For the past year he had been making a living in London as a drama critic at $10 a week, but the sheer drudgery was causing headaches and neuralgia. He was the author of five unsuccessful novels and of seven plays, only three of which had achieved noncommercial productions before small audiences. The best of these, ''Candida,'' had been taken on by the actor-director Richard Mansfield, but abandoned as impossible in rehearsal. Shaw was becoming discouraged and physically run down; he wrote to the actress Ellen Terry, ''Oh, Ellen, I am the world's packhorse; and it beats my lean ribs unmercifully.'' But in the autumn of 1896, his talent for self-advertisement brought him an interesting commission, which led to his first success: ''The Devil's Disciple.'' (A revival of the play, starring Philip Bosco, Victor Garber, Roxanne Hart, Rosemary Murphy and Remak Ramsay, opens tonight at the uptown Circle in the Square.) William Terriss, the actor-manager of the Adelphi Theater, was the greatest living exponent of melodrama - those absurd plays in which the hero is exposed to a preposterous series of dangers, which he overcomes with manly fortitude and heroic self-sacrifice. More often than not his name was Tom or Dick, and he wore an open-necked shirt that exposed a muscular chest.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

The Hapsburgs traced their family roots to the 10th century and as an Austrian dynasty to King Rudolf of Hapsburg in the 13th century and only passed into history themselves with the abolition of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I. The refurbished Treasure Chamber of the Hapsburg Emperors in Vienna, which was closed from late 1983 to early 1987 for restoration, occupies two sides of the Schweizerhof courtyard in the capital's old Imperial Palace, known as the Hofburg. This rambling edifice comprises a series of interconnected courtyards dating from the Middle Ages and leading to an immense domed palace that epitomizes the gaudy splendor of the empire's final days. The Treasure Chamber consists of some 20 rooms and has been modernized, with new lighting installed and the ornate, rococo showcases regilded and cleaned. A new visitors entrance has been built, with cloakrooms and a big souvenir shop selling postcards and guides. (Despite improvements, though, the chamber is usually crowded. The free English guide available at the entrance of little help: it is almost incomprehensible.) The chamber, first organized on its present scale by the Empress Maria Theresa in 1747, is stuffed with the priceless booty of six centuries of royal rule over vast tracts of Europe, successful wars and carefully arranged dynastic marriages. Here you can see what were revered in the Middle Ages as St. Peter's tooth and a nail from the Holy Cross, as well as a bowl once thought to be the Holy Grail and crowns, jewels, scepters and other treasures beyond the wildest dreams of avarice. The chamber contains splendid robes and regalia, ornate reliquaries of exquisite workmanship, sacred vessels of gold and silver, rare jewels and bizarre and costly curiosities that together paint the story of the family's brilliant past.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Ted Kendall, the narrator of this poignant, beautifully written first novel, loses himself in alcohol and hopelessly romantic dreams. He finds himself in golf, which becomes his life but not quite his salvation. ''At first,'' he tells us, ''golf was only a green shade protecting me from the gathering white heat of my mother's death.'' From that beginning, with a style that is at once lyric and spare, William Hallberg uses alternating chapters to take us back and forth in time. In the past, Ted hones his considerable talent and earns a golf scholarship to Ohio State. There he befriends Dave Traynham, the long driver and giant ego of the university golf team, and falls in love with Traynham's girlfriend, Janice. Along the way, he nurtures his dream of becoming a touring professional. Switching back to the present, Ted is in a Southern prison for a terrible deed that is somehow linked to Traynham and Janice. While in prison, he recruits other convicts to help him turn a patch of swamp into a two-hole golf course. It's the best way he knows to serve his time, and he vows to play those two holes before his release. By story's end, Ted will be free (or at least out of prison), but he knows that life offers too few second chances. ''The Rub of the Green'' is a story to be enjoyed by nongolfers and savored by those who love the game. Ted Kendall keeps on playing, through fairway and rough, always trying to follow through.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Would I have problems in shipping my bicycle to France? - M. C., Norwalk, Conn. Answer: Breaking Away Bicycle Tours has been running Tour de France trips for three years and has made plans for two programs starting and ending in Paris next July. (The race begins in the city of Luxembourg on July 1, goes to Belgium, then heads counterclockwise around France before finishing in Paris on July 23.) Breaking Away says bicyclists may ride as much or as little as they want with its escorted tours, which use support vans that carry luggage as well as bicycles, which go on the roof. Most participants take their own bicycles, but rentals in France can be arranged. The company's groups stay in a region along the route of the race for two or three days before moving on, ahead of the racers, to another. An escort and mechanics go along with each party, and an opportunity to meet some of the racers is scheduled. The first program, of eight days, is to begin July 5 when participants are met on arrival in Paris.

us,College Top 20,"College basketball's top teams as selected by William C. Rhoden of The New York Times. 1 Duke While Michigan has the better talent, Duke, anchored by the all-America Danny Ferry, has the staying power to end up on top when it counts. The key will be finding a defensive specialist to replace Billy King. 2 Georgetown Alonzo Mourning, the Hoyas' 6-10 prize recruit, makes Georgetown an instant contender for the Big East championship, and more. The backcourt is set with a rotation of Charles Smith, Jaren Jackson, Mark Tillmon and Dwayne Bryant. 3 Oklahoma If the Sooners had a flaw last season - and at 35-4 they didn't have many - it may have been an under-utilized bench. With Mookie Blaylock returning at guard and Stacey King at center, the Sooners can make a run at a second Final Four appearance. 4 Michigan It has become an annual ritual to discuss Michigan's talent in November and its disappointing elimination in March. With Rumeal Robinson and Sean Higgins in the backcourt, Terry Mills, Glenn Rice and Loy Vaught on the front line, the Wolverines are simply too talented - again - not to rank highly in the early going. 5 Syracuse The Orangemen's biggest problem will be chemistry, not talent. Billy Owens, the super freshman, joins a solid crew led by Sherman Douglas, the all-conference point guard, and Derrick Coleman, the 6-9 forward. 6 U.N.L.V. The Rebels are deep but inexperienced. Stacey Augmon, the sophomore forward, is the rock of this team and there are a host of talented newcomers. 7 Louisville After two seasons of meandering, it's about time for the Cardinals to focus on a national title. Four starters return from a 24-11 team that finished first in the Metro Conference. Pervis Ellison, the 6-9 forward, is the heart of the team. 8 Arizona The Wildcats won't get out of the blocks as quickly as they did last season, but they might actually be as tough a team in March. Sean Elliot is the Pacific-10's most complete player. 9 West Virginia Coach Gale Catlett had his string of seven straight 20-victory seasons snapped last year, but the Mountaineers should rebound with a vengeance with four starters returning. 10 Florida State Coach Pat Kennedy has four starters back and will push Louisville for the Metro championship. 11 Villanova The Wildcats turned what was supposed to have been a rebuilding season into a miraculous journey that ended just one game short of the Final Four. Rollie Massimino has four starters returning from that squad, including the conference's best backcourt: Doug West and Kenny Wilson. 12 Missouri Derrick Chievous is gone but the Tigers return all other starters -plus considerable firepower -from last season's 19-11 team. 13 Arkansas After three seasons of a rugged uphill climb, Nolan Richardson might be close to the moutaintop by the end of the season. 14 Oklahoma State Leonard Hamilton, the third-year coach, has quietly built a dynamo. This could be the season it kicks in. Watch his sophomore forward, Richard Dumas. 15 North Carolina Depending on how quickly and how well J. R. Reid's foot heals, North Carolina could be the force in the A.C.C. If Reid's foot does not heal quickly, the Tar Heels could find themselves muddled in the middle. 16 Georgia Tech If Bobby Cremins can find a point guard to complement Brian Oliver in the backcourt and get the ball to the forwards, Dennis Scott and Tom Hammonds, Georgia Tech might have something going. 17 Iowa The Hawkeyes have a strong returning nucleus in B. J. Armstrong, a guard, Ed Horton and Roy Marble, a forward. 18 Georgia The Bulldogs could be one of the surprises of the season, depending on the adjustment of the freshman guard, Litteral Green. 19 Connecticut Jim Calhoun has five starters back from a team that finished 20-14 and won the National Invitation Tournament. The best of the five is the center, Cliff Robinson. 20 Illinois The Illini, like Michigan, are perennially laden with talent. This season's team, despite not having a player over 6-8, is no exception. Look for a ferocious inside attack. Marcus Liberty, the 6-8 swingman returning from Proposition 48 banishment, could give this team an incredible lift.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

For the journalist Sidney Blumenthal, the political landscape of the 1970's and 1980's is a desolate place, populated by muddled thinkers and incompetent campaigners. Hardly anyone escapes his indictment. President Reagan's supporters will admire Mr. Blumenthal's deft skewering of Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, John Glenn and other Democratic luminaries, who are presented in ''Our Long National Daydream'' as mired in the past, unsure of themselves and unable to craft policies that will fire the public's imagination. But Mr. Blumenthal wields his stiletto on Republicans as well, and here his material is so rich - and he builds his case so effectively - that he almost seems to be shooting fish in a barrel. George Will, James Watt and William Rehnquist, not to mention Mr. Reagan himself, provide targets that are almost too easy. Most of the essays originally appeared in The Washington Post or The New Republic between 1984 and 1988; occasionally, knowing how events turned out makes a piece seem old. And the faint air of the poli sci textbook hangs over the exposition at times. But his observations are always insightful, and usually irreverent; in his eyes, for example, a White House encounter between Mr. Reagan and the voice of Donald Duck is ''a meeting of equals.'' Where, these essays force one to wonder, is the public outrage this dismal catalogue of misfeasance, malfeasance and nonfeasance ought to provoke? These essays indict not only the politicians they describe but also the voters who allow them to flourish.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

''The reader is carried along by the power of Mr. Lewin's reporting.'' THE BOYS OF WINTER, by Wilfrid Sheed. (McGraw-Hill, $5.95.) Jonathan Oglethorpe, a cynical editor in search of a best seller, is less interested in Billy van Dyne, an obscure but promising writer, than he is in Billy's attractive wife. Wilfrid Sheed ''may be America's closest cousin to Evelyn Waugh, although he suffers fools just a tad more gladly,'' Herbert Gold said here in 1987. His novel about a writers' colony in the Hamptons ''does the satirist's good work of demolition, but it also, alas, tells much of the truth about literary politicking. . . . There is a nostalgia for times when the Word really did seem haunted and holy.'' BEN-GURION: The Burning Ground, 1886-1948, by Shabtai Teveth. (Houghton Mifflin, $12.95.) When this biography of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, was published last year, our reviewer, Martin Gilbert, called it a work of ''pioneering research and historical detective work of the highest order. Even someone familiar with the general outline of Ben-Gurion's career will find many previously unknown facts and remarkable insights, illustrating his utter single-mindedness in pursuing the goal of statehood, even when that goal seemed most hopeless.'' IN THE SKIN OF A LION, by Michael Ondaatje. (King Penguin, $7.95.) During the 1920's, Patrick Lewis leaves his rural Canadian home to live among the immigrant laborers of Toronto. Last year, Carolyn Kizer said in The Book Review that in his surreal, unruly novel Michael Ondaatje writes beautifully about work. ''This is, of course, a rarity in fiction at any time, and one can only be grateful for a man who is not focused on the classroom, the bedroom and the bar.'' THE VIRTUOSI: Classical Music's Legendary Performers From Paganini to Pavarotti, by Harold C. Schonberg. (Vintage, $12.95.) In his portraits of the giants of classical music, Harold C. Schonberg, formerly the senior music critic of The Times, shows that in every age talent is often accompanied by excess. In 1985, our reviewer, Anthony Burgess, called the book (originally titled ''The Glorious Ones'') an ''entertaining survey of vocal and instrumental greatness.'' THE OLD LEFT, by Daniel Menaker. (Penguin, $5.95.) As the child of a materialistic age, David, a young college professor, finds it hard enough to be a good liberal, much less a committed radical like his aging Uncle Sol. ''Because of the elegance of [ Daniel ] Menaker's simple prose, David's sensibility engages our affection,'' our reviewer, Daniel Stern, said of these stories in 1987. ''But it is crotchety, constantly kvetching Uncle Sol who engages our respect.'' THE PARADISE OF BOMBS, by Scott Russell Sanders. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $6.95.) The author considers his essays about the melancholic experience of having just one life to live in the only world there is ''experiments in making sense of things.'' ''His essays take the bifocal stance of lyric poem and chilling story,'' Kim R. Stafford said here last year. THE TOMMYKNOCKERS, by Stephen King. (Signet/New American Library, $5.95.) Evil comes to a small town in the form of Tommyknockers, nasty little creatures that live in a spaceship buried for eons in a writer's backyard. '' [ Stephen ] King's presumption that we are afraid of everything makes him a great and terrible storyteller,'' Nina Auerbach said here in 1987. MUCH DEPENDS ON DINNER: The Extraordinary History and Mythology, Allure and Obsessions, Perils and Taboos of an Ordinary Meal, by Margaret Visser. (Collier/Macmillan, $10.95.) By tracing the history of each item in a run-of-the-mill dinner, a self-styled ''anthropologist of everyday life'' shows that what we most take for granted fundamentally shapes our lives. The book is ''consistently thoughtful and entertaining,'' John Gross said in The Times earlier this year. THE SPLENDID OUTCAST: Beryl Markham's African Stories, compiled by Mary S. Lovell. (Laurel/Dell, $7.50.) In addition to ''West With the Night,'' the aviator Beryl Markham wrote short stories based on her adventures in Africa. ''She emerges from them as a woman of finely tuned observation, as well as courage, cunning and vulnerability,'' Diane Ackerman said in The Book Review last year. HARD HEADS, SOFT HEARTS: Tough-Minded Economics for a Just Society, by Alan S. Blinder. (Addison-Wesley, $10.95.) An unrepentant Keynesian says that the right mix of Government intervention and free-market principles can provide for the social welfare and even achieve full employment. ''This is a book to treasure, not least because of the author's demonstration that economists can write graceful English prose and temper their didactic impulses with modesty and humor,'' Robert Lekachman said here in 1987. HARD TO BE GOOD, by Bill Barich. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) In Bill Barich's stories about people learning to accept the limits of life, the characters give up too easily, Russell Banks said here last year. But he complimented the author on ''his graceful prose, his penchant for understatement and his affection for the homely, telling details of ordinary lives.''",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

The gift, most of which will go to build a new academic center to be named for Mrs. Cosby, was announced last week at a dinner in honor of Spelman's president, Johnnetta B. Cole. Mr. Cosby said he and his wife ''have been blessed because I found a vein of gold in the side of a mountain.''

us,CAMERA! ACTION!,"With elements of costume epic, backstage story, frontier adventure, domestic romance and even a Dickensian scenario (an orphan that Cecil B. adopted was actually his brother's son), the story of the DeMille family seems like another C. B. extravaganza. With audacious brevity, the biographer Anne Edwards documents three generations of this remarkable clan in the lavishly illustrated THE DeMILLES: AN AMERICAN FAMILY (Abrams, $39.95). Her elegant narrative proves far more substantial than appearance suggests. Ms. Edwards incorporates information from interviews, family letters, reviews and other sources to tell the story. Prompted by his wife, Beatrice, Henry DeMille became a Broadway playwright and collaborator of David Belasco. Upon Henry's death in 1893, the enterprising Beatrice became a dramatist's agent, encouraging her two sons, William and Cecil, to pursue the family calling. Cecil would enter the fledgling movie industry, directing ''The Squaw Man,'' received with much praise in 1914. William followed Cecil to California, bringing his daughter, Agnes, who would later return to Broadway and become one of the century's most revered choreographers. Ms. Edwards dwells on Cecil and Agnes, but not entirely at the expense of their supporting casts. While relying on anecdotes and specific details to evoke the larger picture, she ventures her own insights: ''Cecil seemed unconcerned that in the opinion of his critics his works were not considered artistically significant. His only fear was that an audience might be bored.'' With Agnes completing a circle, the DeMille chronicles serve as a potent reminder that the foundation of film is in theater.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Visitors, particularly those with young children, may find an hour of such lighthearted entertainment an ideal counterbalance to time logged in museums, monuments, restaurants and shops. Plots are usually uncomplicated and the action easy to follow. A fairy tale might be simply staged with only a few hand puppets, such as a plush brown wolf or satin-garbed princess on a stage less than an arm's breadth. Or there are ambitious adaptations of Shakespeare or Dante on a full-size stage with spotlights, black lights, grandiose soundtracks in stereo and a cast of hundreds of puppets, some in synchronized chorus-blocks of two dozen that one puppeteer can manipulate at once. There is a theater that specializes in traditional Sicilian puppetry with armor-heavy knights dueling on stage, clanking swords and shields manipulated from above by string and rods.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

This spare and elegant novel, Ann Hood's second, is about the disintegration of a New England family after a freak accident: Alexander, everyone's favorite, is electrocuted during a thunderstorm as he talks on the telephone with his child. For months afterward, 6-year-old Sam refuses to speak, fearing, not unreasonably, that if he does he too will vanish. Other family members react differently to the tragedy, but all are devastated. Alexander's mother, Cal, impulsively leaves home for a new bohemian life in San Francisco; her husband, Jams, becomes a kleptomaniac, making stealing into a symbolic vengeance for the loss of his offspring. Curiously, the central figure in this drama is the least realized: Alexander's sister, Mackenzie, a photographer whose emotional life has been immobilized by her brother's fate. Mackenzie continually remembers the old family home in Rhode Island, imagining her childhood with Alexander as a perfect idyll - yet wondering now and then, as does the reader, whether she isn't inventing most of it. Ms. Hood's descriptions of Mackenzie are rather generic and improbable (''everything she touches . . . turns not to gold, but to platinum''); her lover, Jason, orders roses to match the color of her hair. Yet ''Waiting to Vanish'' is tougher and truer than it first appears. There are many ways of overcoming the past, not all of them noble; the solution for Ms. Hood's characters - as perhaps for most people, in and out of fiction - is not to face it at all, but rather to discover protected venues where the harsher truths may once again be silent.",1988-11-13T05:00:00+0000

This increase is much higher than the 9 percent increase for tenants on two-year leases in rent-stabilized apartments. Why is there such disparity between the two rent-regulation programs? . . . W. G., Manhattan Answer: According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the disparity exists because of the difference in the way the increase for each system is calculated. The maximum base rent, as well as the maximum collectible rent, for tenants in rent-controlled apartments is based on a mathmatical formula established by law in the 60's. The increases for rent-stabilized units are set by the Rent Guidelines Board. When determining allowable increases each year the board takes into consideration such factors as inflation and increases or decreases in building operating costs.

us,Rise and Fall of Peronists,"June 1943 - A coup ousts President Ramos Castillo. Juan Domingo Peron, a colonel a political philosophy, becomes Minister of Labor the next year. February 1946 - In elections called by the military regime, Peron wins the presidency on a platform supporting greater economic and social benefits for workers. The Government begins a program of nationalization, and the armed forces play an increasingly oppressive role in the country's political life. Constitutional rights are restricted. April 1954 - Taking an anti-American stand, Peron is elected to a third term. He arrests five leaders of the opposition Radical Civic Union, including its vice presidential candidate. September 1955 - Amid growing popular discontent over inflation, oppression and corruption, Peron is ousted in a coup. He flees into exile in Spain. November 1972 - Peron is allowed to return to Argentina. July 1973 - President Hector J. Campora, a Peron backer elected because Peron is barred from running for office, resigns to make way for Peron, who takes office in October on a ticket that includes his wife, Isabel. She becomes the first woman to serve as a vice president in Latin America. July 1974 - Juan Peron dies. Mrs. Peron assumes the presidency but loses control of the Peron factions. Political violence increases and the economy falters. March 1976 - A coup led by Lieut. Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla topples Mrs. Peron. She is put under house arrest. The Government begins the ''dirty war'' against the left. Almost 12,000 people are eventually killed. March 1981 - Gen. Roberto Eduardo Viola becomes President, followed by Lieut. Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri. He frees Mrs. Peron, who goes into exile in Spain. May 1982 - Argentine forces invade the Falklands. Britain retakes the islands after six weeks of fighting; 255 Britons and 712 Argentines die and 14,000 Argentines are captured. Three days later, General Galtieri resigns.

Good as Mr. Bosco has been in a wide variety of roles during his long career, Shaw seems to bring out the Ralph Richardson in him.

The currency was lifted by comments from Japanese finance officials, the American Treasury Secretary, the West Germans and President-elect Bush. Dealers said the Fed also moved to support the dollar in New York after the Bank of Japan bought dollars in Asia. [ Page A1. ] Text of Vice President Bush's remarks. [ D25. ] Short-term interest rates rose sharply on signs that the Fed was prepared to tighten its grip on monetary policy. The rise in secondary T-bill rates raised rates on new three-month and six-month bills to their highest levels in more than three years. [ D16. ] Stock prices eased. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.95 points lower, at 2,065.08. [ D8. ] THE ECONOMY Fare changes will raise travel costs by about 35 percent for as many as a fifth of the nation's air passengers, analysts estimated. The new fares, which had been due to take effect today, were delayed for a week by United Airlines. Other airlines may postpone their increases as well. [ D1. ] Some airlines have begun to cut back sharply on the seats they sell through consolidators. These wholesale sellers offered large discounts to travelers. [ A1. ] A weaker real estate market in the Northeast is causing banks and savings institutions to take losses on a rising number of loans to builders and developers. [ D1. ] U.S. oil producers will remain in a slump until OPEC regains control of the market and raises prices, experts said at the American Petroleum Institute convention. [ D1. ] Unusually strong demand for unleaded gasoline bolstered energy futures. [ D18. ] The Supreme Court will again take up the issue of requiring clients to go into arbitration in disputes with brokers. A 1987 ruling left unresolved the enforceability of arbitration agreements under an important provision of securities law. [ D1. ] An administrative law judge ruled that George C. Kern Jr., a prominent Wall Street lawyer, violated Federal disclosure rules during the 1986 takeover battle between Allied Stores and Campeau. The judge declined to impose any sanctions. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Control Data expects a fourth-quarter loss that could wipe out its earnings for the year. The company attributed the lower forecast to delays in shipping new mainframes and continued softness in other operations. [ D1. ] Three top editors of The Christian Science Monitor resigned. The resignations were prompted by the announcement of extensive changes in the operation of the highly regarded newspaper, which is published by the First Church of Christ, Scientist. [ D1. ] Interco refused to negotiate with the Rales brothers, who threatened to withdraw their $2.6 billion takeover bid. [ D4. ] Tandy will supply personal computers to Matsushita for sale under the Panasonic brand name.

I hate to do this, but there's been a tremendous demand to answer a couple of questions, thus violating what I had planned to do to give you a little reprieve for four days, but nevertheless, let me just say at the outset that we've had a wonderful, relaxed time here. We'll leave tomorrow morning -that's all right, you're not missing a thing -head back to Washington fairly early tomorrow, and then I expect I'll be seeing, with the President, Chancellor Kohl and visiting with him, I think, on, just myself, maybe one or two advisers. So we'll be back to work. This has been very restful. It's exactly what Barbara and I needed. We're grateful to our host here, Will Farish. And I'll be glad to take a few questions. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS The Dollar Is Falling Q. The dollar is falling on world markets. I'd like to know if you favor a stable dollar or if the dollar should be allowed to drop any further? If youy favor a stable dollar, would you propose any specific steps to make that happen. A. The policy, is, in effect, is the Administration's policy. It's built around policy coordination and exchange market stability. These are words of art. That's the policy of the existing Administration. It will be the policy of the George Bush Administration. And the dollar apparently is stronger this morning, and apparently the Tokyo market is up, so these gyrations happen, but that is the policy. Q. Are you in favor of a stable dollar, or should it be allowed to drop further? A. I've said what our exchange market stability is the key, but nobody is going to peg the dollar to any existing currency. Yes? Treasury Secretary Q. Are you going to name Nicholas Brady as your Treasury Secretary, as the papers are saying. A. When I name my Treasury Secretary, I'll be sure you all are among the first to know, because you've been good about traveling with me and everything else. But there will be no Cabinet announcements from these sands here, and I will - it is very early -I've done a little research, and most Cabinet announcements come a little later into the transition. We may have some this week, but I just can't help you on who the - can't tell you - I haven't confirmed that any particular one will come this week, but there might be announcements relating to the future of the Bush Administration. But I don't feel under any great pressure, having had one day in the office since the election, and I just don't feel inclined to meet somebody else's timetable. I will do it when I am ready. I will spell out who the key people will be in this Administration. Q. Don't you think it'll send a stabilizing message to the market if you name your economic team this week? A. I think the appointment of James Baker was - did send a good message - an excellent person of experience. And I think it was, that one sent a very good message, and I hope every other appointment I make will send similarly reassuring messages. Action on Deficit Q. The financial community is also waiting for you to show signs of your taking some sort of aggressive action on the deficit, or are prepared to. Is there any action on that? A. I don't become President until Jan. 20, but I am convinced that the deficit remains a major problem, and I will address myself to that early on in my Presidency, and will be talking, perhaps before then, to key Congressional leaders and others about it. It is a matter of grave urgency. I know it. I think the country knows it, and I want to be in the forefront of trying to do something about it after I become President. I said down there in Houston, and I just repeat, I do not want to start acting like I'm President of the United States. Yes? What Baker Will Do Q. On Mr. Baker, can you outline some of his duties? There's been some talk about him being a deputy President. Can you clarify that for us? A. You haven't heard. Take your guidance from me on those matters. You haven't heard that here. He'll have his hands full as Secretary of State. I think everybody knows that he is a close confidant of mine, and I value his judgment on a wide array of matters. But this - I did see some reference to that and I simply would look here for guidance on who's going to be calling the shots other than the new President. Q. What about a troika, three people for your chief of staff as has been reported, is that under consideration? A. Stay tuned, stay tune. I'll have announcements on that fairly soon. Q. Are you disturbed by all the jockeying for power, after only a week? A. Hey listen, I'm so relaxed I don't even read about all that stuff anymore. And I don't get as uptight as I used to about it. Doesn't mean anything. I'm going to make the decision. They know I'm going to make the decisions. Everybody knows that. And so it doesn't matter. The speculation doesn't bother me. Steps by P.L.O. Q. P.L.O. leaders, sir, have recently approved Resolution 242 to recognize Israel's right to exist. What does that mean for the Middle East Peace process? A. If the P.L.O. leaders have definitively stated their support for 242, that is very, very good. I want to hold back in my acquiescence to the question, because I'm just not sure that is exactly what has happened. But it would be a very important step if they have done that, and if there is a - certainly if there is unanimity, and you don't have divisive factions that resist that. It would be very good. Yeah? Farm Foreclosures Q. As you know, 80,000 farms are going to be foreclosed very shortly and it's been alleged that the timing of it is politically motivated, so as not to negatively affect your election. A. I don't believe there is any political motivation related to the agriculture policies at all. Q. What about these foreclosures? Do you see any way they could be forestalled or do you think they should go ahead? A. I simply would - I will get briefed on that when I get back. Meeting World Leaders Q. When you return to Washington you're going to be meeting with Chancellor Kohl and later in the week with Margaret Thatcher. What kinds of issues do you expect to be taking up with them, domestic issues or foreign policy conerns like the Middle East? A. I think it'll be a combination of domestic issues and foreign policy issues. It just so happens that you have two esteemed world leaders coming to town, and I am Vice President of the United States, and every time they come to town I have met with both of them. We have had private meetings with both of them, as Vice President, over the years. I can't tell you how many, but a lot of them. And so this is simply a continuation of that policy. Obviously there's some interest on their part and mine as well in talking about where we go after I become President, but it is - it should be viewed as a continuation of existing policy. Savings and Loan Plan Q. The Savings and Loans crisis was something that didn't come up too much during the campaign. Do you have a specific plan in hand at this point? A. No, but I will by the time I get to be President of the United States. I will probably have some ideas as to how to proceed. I will be talking to the Secretary of the Treasury soon - a little more detail about that. You're second - coming, coming? Go ahead. Talks With Soviets Q. You've held open the possibility of conferring with congressional leaders on the deficit problem before you're sworn in as President. Another pressing area is the whole area of Soviet-American relations. Would you also be open to the suggestion that maybe your Secretary of State should have some preliminary discussions with the Soviets even before Jan. 20. A. I'd be careful about that. I do not want to pre-empt the official foreign policy machinery of this Administration. And so I would be wary of, you know, special missions involving the future Secretary of State. I just don't want to get crosswise. One of the things about this transition - both Martin Van Buren and I found this - is that it's smoother than in other transitions because you're a part of an Administration; you're part of an Administration where you don't have the radical policy shift. Yes? Contra Position Clear Q. How long do you suspect you'll have before contra aid becomes a non-issue because of the disappearance of the contras. A. Well, my position, I hope, is very clear on that one. I just think it is essential to support those that are fighting for freedom, the quest being freedom and democracy in Nicaragua. And so I don't know, Ralph, in terms of a timetable. But again, those who are looking for radical policy shifts won't find them. Now, if you're looking for new initiatives or something of that nature, maybe we'll have something to say on that. But in terms of reiterating my support for the freedom fighters, I'm glad to keep on doing that. Yes Jane? Makeup of Cabinet Q. You promised during your campaign that you would appoint a Hispanic to the Cabinet. Do you intend to keep that promise? A. The promise will be kept, and beyond that, I won't have any comments right now on the makeup of the Cabinet. Boston Harbor Cleanup Q. When you become President, Mr. Vice President, do you expect to release some E.P.A. funds to clean up Boston Harbor? A. I will take that under advisement. Political Director's Job Q. Will the White House political director's job be more important in your white house than it has been in last few years? A. We're debating now how to structure the - we're just starting to talk about how to structure any political office in the White House, if there is to be one, how it will be structured. So it's too early for me to answer that. Yes? Vice President's Duties Q. What specific functions do you now have in mind for your Vice President? A. No specifics yet. I had a very good meeting with Senator Quayle. We discussed my perception of the job, starting with how it worked under the Carter-Mondale Administration, and how it's worked in the Reagan-Bush Administration, and how I expect it to work in the Bush-Quayle Administration. But we didn't get into - if your question is specific assignments - I did not go into that at all, and again, it's too early to resolve that. Q. During the campaign you talked as though he would take over the space council and and also be the drug czar. Is that your thinking? A. Space council, yes, and again, we didn't go into detail. That's a given. The drug czar has been complicated a little by the new legislation. And I, it may be I will be able to do that which I think should be done, but I have to get - we're getting a good legal opinion on the legislation. I must comply with the law, but I think a President can have people report to him any way he wants. But I want to know more about it before I go further with that one. Yeah? Talks With Ortega Q. Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega has called for talks between you and him when you're president of the United States. Are you willing to talk with the Nicaraguan president? A. My view is that the Sandinistas should keep their commitment to the Organization of American States. The argument is not between Daniel Ortega and the United States of America. The argument is between Daniel Ortega and the other democracies in this hemisphere that are seeking to enhance their democracies, not just in their countries, but for the peoples of Central America. So I'm not interested, I mean I would not jump at an opportunity to have a bilateral chat, meeting, with Daniel Ortega. What is needed is to work out the commitment that the Nicaraguans have made to the Organization of American States, and I would encourage that in every way possible. But there's no point having a bilateral meeting and giving them a certain standing that I think is uncalled for until they go forward and do that which they pledged to do, and which everybody wants - democracy and freedom. And I'm talking about certifiably free elections. I'm talking about a free press. I'm talking about freedom of the church and a lot of freedoms that they have crunched down on in Nicaragua today. Advice From Nixon Q. What advice did Richard Nixon give you when he called? Did he offer anything specific? A. No, he didn't. It was just a courtesy. He called me and I just returned his call. It was a very very short chat. Q. Have you gotten advice from anyone, your mother, anyone, this week about how to do the new job? A. Advice? You try. Ban Ocean Dumping Q. Mr. Vice President, as I was walking up the beach to get here today, I saw a hypodermic needle on the beach. What can you do about it? A. No more ocean dumping. These beaches, I must say, are refreshingly clean, but we've got to end ocean dumping, and that is - you know, you've got not just hypodermic needles, but other things as well floating up onto these beaches, and we've got to renew our conscience as a country to preserve the natural resources of this country. And the beach is just part of it. Roe v. Wade Q. Would you look forward to seeing Roe v. Wade overturned? A. Yes. Campaign for Son Q. Would you campaign for your son for governor of Texas? A. I never intervene in primaries, and I expect if any of the Bush boys ran, they would have primaries, but I have no reason to believe that he's going to do that which you ask about. But I can take this opportunity to say how grateful I am to our five kids, who started out with varying degrees of enthusiasm for the campaign, and all ended up doing a superb job for their dad. And we have great pride in them, and I feel a - you know, that our family is stronger than ever before, but I - Jane, I have no way of knowing what George's future political plans are. New Job Sinks In Q. When you talked to us the morning after the election, you seemed happy but a little shell-shocked. I wonder if you've jad a chance to reflect on what the next four years are going to bring? A. It has sunk in a little more clearly. I'd hate to think of myself as shell-shocked, but nevertheless, that's one way of describing how one feels after the end of a campaign, and finding himself elected to be the next President of the United States. The great thing about this, the few days we've had here - and you probably wonder why I stand out here fishing all the time - the great thing is you get to clear your mind. You get to think a little bit about the future. You see these tremendous problems, but you just get refurbished in your desire to do the best job you can, and you recognize that the problems are tremendous. But I'm blessed with a lot of good people out there willing to help, and so I think my mental attitude is in much better shape. I know my body is. I'm sure everybody can attest to that - to these long lenses - these long penetrating lenses which cause us to wear T-shirts when we go swimming and all this kind of thing, because we don't want to be analyzed by the doctors from The New York Times. So, it's - no, it's been just great. And I'm being serious, it is wonderful to take four days - whatever it is - five nights here, and just totally relax with friends, close, dear friends, who give us plenty of elbow room. I've been able to run every day. I love the fishing. It doesn't matter what you catch. It's the fact you're out there, and fishermen know that. And so I'm still of the Isaac Walton school, that the days I spend fishing should not be deducted from the time I - deducted from the time I spend on earth. We've got time for a couple more. This beautiful lady in the - yes? Fish Are Winning Q. Fish four, Bush zero - is that the score here? A. Wait a minute. I've just said it doesn't matter if you catch anything. You get another question. You get a more serious question. Soviet Relations Q. The Soviets are saying that they look forward to your Presidency because of the continuation of policy but also because they anticipate you'll be more flexible on S.D.I. A. Well, I have indicated nothing to give them hope, if they need hope, on that question, because I - my position on S.D.I. is stated, and it is not changing, not changeable, so - I haven't seen that in any of the utterances out of the Soviet Union on the subject, but I think that there will be a certain stability, and I understand the equation. I think the challenge for the rest of this decade and into the next is how you manage this. There's enormous opportunities for a more tranquil world - if you look at Eastern Europe you see problems, but you also see opportunities. And, so, I think I'm knowledgeable, in that what the Soviet equation means. I'm very interested in it. I will be sure that anybody who works the problem in the Bush Administration knows of my commitment to keeping this country strong and to enhancing the peace, and I think they go hand in hand, and the Soviets obviously are important. I know the change. I understand what's happening there, I think, as well as anybody could, because I've taken a keen interest in it. So I'm - I look forward to working with the Soviet leaders to enhance the peace. Concern of Conservatives Q. Have you been made aware of the concern of certain conservative leaders with Housing, H.H.S. and the Attorney General spot? They're worried that you'll fill them with people that in their view will let them down after, in their view, they gave you so much help in the election. A. (Laughs.) You want to rephrase your question? There's great interest from all quarters on what each Secretary - who he or she will be. And I understand that, and I will make selections that will be well accepted, in my view, and I can't go any further beyond that. I keep hearing people on all sides have concerns about who's going to run this department or that. That's understandable. That's part of our - hey, wait a minute, two more. Where's your stripes? I didn't recognize you. Women in Cabinet Q. This is virtually an all-female press corps, sir. Will there be a woman in your Cabinet or more than one, sir? A. I have no numbers, no numbers selected, but - send him over here. This guy's gonna conclude the press conference. Come on over here. But there are no quotas, no numbers, but I would anticipate that there will be female representation in my - but it's not a -I don't like to put it like that. That sounds kind of quota-ific. There will be men and women of excellence. Now what you're supposed to say is thank you very much. Wait a minute. No Talk With Quayle Q. Have you talked to Senator Quayle since you've been here? A. I've talked to very few people. I talked to Jimmy Baker last night and Fuller and that's been all, I think. The phone rings and we don't answer it. I'm going to go do a little work now for two hours and get back out here fishing.",1988-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Congress eliminated the death benefit but restored the minimum benefit for all people eligible before January 1982. April 1981 The Administration successfully petitions Congress to eliminate the Social Security program providing monthly payments to full-time students who are children of disabled, retired or deceased workers covered by Social Security. May 1981 The President proposes major benefit reductions for future Social Security recipients who retire before the age of 65, meets strong bipartisan opposition in Congress and drops plan. September 1981 Mr. Reagan seeks a one-time, three-month deferral of cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients, later drops proposal. May 1982 Social Security officials disclose that disability insurance benefits for more than 100,000 families have ended under an accelerated review of cases begun by the Administration. April 1983 The President signs into law the bipartisan plan passed by Congress to insure the solvency of the Social Security System, including a six-month delay in the 1983 cost-of-living increase. April 1984 The Administration suspends efforts to reduce the number of people receiving Social Security benefits and orders that benefits be continued or restored for 40,000 people who challenged their removal from the rolls. September 1984 A Social Security Administration study concludes that efforts to reduce the number of people on disability rolls has led to a ''huge volume of adverse court decisions.'' April 1985 The Reagan Administration decides to reduce the staff of the Social Security Administration by 21 percent. December 1985 The Reagan Administration announces that it will again review all 2.6 million people on disability rolls to determine if they should continue receiving benefits. March 1986 The Administration plans to establish a new court to hear cases of people denied retirement or disability benefits. May 1986 The Social Security Administration again begins removing ineligible people from disability rolls. June 1986 The Supreme Court upholds a finding that Social Security officials had a 'fixed clandestine policy' to deny disability benefits to people with mental illness. It rules that mentally disabled people have the right to sue for Social Security disability benefits.

Identical twin cousins, one studious and reasonable and with a kind of muted rich-girl English accent; the other popular and a little scatterbrained, with hair perfectly flipped. Both played, of course, by Patty Duke, who by her own admission was depressed, exploited and secretly boozing while simultaneously portraying America's average fantasy teen-ager and America's average parental fantasy of what a teen-ager should be. The first time I hit the streets of Brooklyn Heights, before I knew much about New York, all I could think was, ''This was where Patty lived.''

The statement did go further than previous Soviet endorsements. 4 Lithuania declined to declare its laws supreme over Soviet law, heeding the plea of its Communist Party leader to be patient but disappointing its neighbor, Estonia. 6 Canada's ruling party hopes to win a narrow majority in the approaching elections. But the Liberal Party continues to use doubts about a trade agreement with the United States as a political weapon. 3 The Soviets warned Afghan rebels that it would react severely against ''further military escalation,'' and that it had already taken ''measures to stop subversive and terroristic acts.'' 6 Mikhail Gorbachev arrived in India for a three-day official visit to reaffirm close relations between the two countries at a time when some Indians are questioning Moscow's intentions in the third world. 6 The former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan was reported to be ready to apologize for abuses during his administration and return money he is said to have stolen from the Government. 28",1988-11-19T05:00:00+0000

These include models with fans that circulate warm air, and heaters small enough to put on your desk at home or in the office. Most heaters use at least 1,500 watts of electricity and have adjustable thermostats. It is wise to look for a certification mark from an independent testing facility like Underwriters Laboratories Inc., although not all states require testing for safety. Heaters should not be left unattended or where children can reach them, and they should be unplugged when not in use. Your dealer can tell you which model is best for the space you want to heat. Here is a list of basic heating units. Prices range from $50 to $ 200. TYPE ATTRIBUTES Convect ion Models with fans heat rooms more quickly but can be quite hot at close range.

That is why ''Butterfly'' has been sung believably by such large-voiced sopranos as Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi and Leontyne Price even though the eye may have resisted total belief in the character portrayed.

To mark the occasion, The Book Review this week devotes its In Short reviews to publications from small presses. The Crime column, Page 40, also highlights small presses. THE GOOD TIMES ARE KILLING ME. By Lynda Barry. (Real Comet Press, Paper, $16.95.) In this deft and deceptively simple first novel, the cartoonist Lynda Barry gives us the world of Edna Arkins, who is coming of age in Seattle. It's a tough neighborhood, this world. Inside the house where she has lived all her life, Edna's family is beginning to unravel. Outside, the unwritten rules of childhood are changing, along with the people on her block. ''In the beginning of this street it was a mainly white street,'' Edna recalls. (The Arkins, too, are white.) ''That was a long time ago, but I can remember the houses went White, White, White, Japanese, White, White.'' Now the houses go ''Chinese, Negro, Negro, White, Japanese, Filipino.'' And now friendships - even the dreamy intimacies of summertime - can suddenly shatter under the steady pressure of racism. There is pleasure as well as pain in this tricky universe, and Edna marks both with music: songs she hears over the radio, in a black church service and on the portable record player she keeps as a shrine in the basement. Music releases her memories, and this astonishes her. ''How can a song do that?'' she asks. ''Be like a net that catches a whole entire day, even a day whose guts you hate?'' As a kind of subtext for this thought, Ms. Barry puts a ''Music Notebook'' at the novel's end, with paintings and biographies of some legendary performers. But the real music in this book comes from the cadence and rhythm of Edna's speech. Ms. Barry has an impeccable ear, and this funny, intricate and finally heartbreaking story exquisitely captures an American childhood.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

WHY CAN'T SHARON KOWALSKI COME HOME? By Karen Thompson and Julie Andrzejewski. (Spinsters/Aunt Lute, Cloth $20.95; Paper $10.95.) After the car driven by the woman she loved was struck by a drunken driver in Minnesota in November 1983, Karen Thompson faced far more than the grim prospect of nursing her brain-damaged companion back to health. For the first time, she had to confront her homosexuality and the reactions it would generate from her lover's family, her own parents, her church and the courts. The story of Ms. Thompson's relationship with Sharon Kowalski, both before and after the accident, is powerful and poignant, particularly as it describes how Ms. Kowalski's parents used the legal system to keep her away from the woman she had lived with for four years. Her story identifies many villains: not just Ms. Kowal-ski's family, but assorted judges, doctors, nurses, newspapermen, clergymen, even Ms. Thompson's own lawyers, whom she now thinks were too timid, and Ms. Kowalski's court-appointed counsel. Particularly as the indictments mount - the book often reads like a legal brief and a repetitious one at that - one wishes at least some of these people could be heard. Still, Ms. Thompson's account (written with Julie Andrzejewski, a professor of human relations at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota) is convincing, in part because her personality is so pleasing. As she describes her experiences, and her evolution from reclusive physical education teacher to feminist activist, she comes across as modest, thoughtful, sincere and vulnerable. Her narrative is largely free of shrill, self-righteous sloganeering. Only toward the end, after she has lost the legal battle to become Ms. Kowalski's guardian, when she mouths ritualistic incantations against ''racism, sexism, ageism, classism, handicapism and homophobia,'' does the reader suspect the voices are those of Ms. Thompson's advisers as much as her own.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

KLYTAIMNESTRA WHO STAYED AT HOME. By Nancy Bogen. (Lintel, $17.95.) If ''Klytaimnestra Who Stayed at Home'' is a bellwether, we may have to anticipate sympathetic fictional treatments, from self-styled feminist viewpoints, of Lady Macbeth, the Wicked Witch of the West and Snow White's evil stepmother. The problem with Nancy Bogen's first novel, originally published in 1980 in paperback and now reissued in a hard-cover edition, is not that it reworks the mythology of Clytemnestra, wife and ultimately murderer of Agamemnon, who led the expedition to recapture her wayward sister, Helen, from Troy. Homer and the tragedians, above all Aeschylus, demonstrate the variety, flexibility and profundity with which the Greek literary tradition approached this complex female figure: bereaved mother of Iphigenia; adulterer with Aegisthus; victim of her own avenging son and daughter, Orestes and Electra. Rather, Ms. Bogen's treatment is dismaying because its revisionist perspective drains the titanic Clytemnestra of passion and resolve. Multiple interior monologues, shifting from the aristocratic principals to servants and spear-carriers, have a leveling, not an individualizing, effect: everyone is weary, vacillating and preoccupied with sex. This mundane view occasionally has touching results, as when the conquering hero, Agamemnon, beaching his ship at last, absently registers the tattered, unwashed condition he shares with his fellow victors over Troy. But despite the novel's anachronistic surges of conspiracy theory, the edges of its plot are blurred and the characters finally sink under the weight of their mutual weakness. This thoroughly modern style of ''humanizing'' the story creates an incredible shrinking myth in which, ironically, the women are most diminished. Cassandra in particular - the captive Trojan princess whose prophecies are both infallible and unheeded - is an opportunity missed here: what a burden of consciousness might have been explored. For power, dignity and emotional urgency in characters of both sexes, readers had best sidestep Ms. Bogen's version for the Greek vision.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

While Roy Cohn was dying of AIDS, he collaborated with a friend, the journalist Sidney Zion, on the story of his life. At about the same time, Nicholas von Hoffman was writing CITIZEN COHN (Bantam, $5.50), an unauthorized biography of Cohn, who is probably best known for his stints as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy during the 1950's and as a prosecutor of the Rosenbergs. ''These two books should be read in tandem,'' Tom Wolfe said in The Book Review last year. ''Both hum along at a merry clip, thanks in part, perhaps, to the two authors' headlong dead-heat race to publication.'' FIRST LOVE AND OTHER SORROWS, by Harold Brodkey. (Vintage, $7.95.) In a story called ''The Quarrel,'' two young esthetes from Harvard become a mutual admiration society, convincing themselves that no one else sees life with the same refinement. On a trip to the south of France, however, they discover that they are really quite ordinary after all. ''The surface simplicity of Mr. Brodkey's stories is disarming,'' one reviewer said in 1958. ''It is, of course, the result of real ability and hard work. Mr. Brodkey writes well, in a clear, uncomplicated, unaffected prose. He sees well, too; more important, he thinks about what he sees.'' CHILE: Death in the South, by Jacobo Timerman. Translated by Robert Cox. (Vintage, $6.95.) To overcome the oppression of the Pinochet years, Jacobo Timerman writes, Chileans must steer a course between the left and right extremes. ''His analysis is a good deal more subtle than the usual binary, superpower thinking,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ''And his experiences on the South American continent have clearly earned him the right to feel the way he does.'' The same publisher has also reissued PRISONER WITHOUT A NAME, CELL WITHOUT A NUMBER ($6.95). Translated by Toby Talbot, the book tells of Mr. Timerman's experience as a prisoner of the Argentinian junta in the late 1970's. Mr. Timerman ''writes with passion, but a passion controlled almost to the point of detachment,'' Anthony Lewis said here in 1981. ''The effect is devastating.'' CUTS, by Malcolm Bradbury. (King Penguin, $5.95.) Henry Babbacombe, an ascetic British author of post-modern novels, is hired by Eldorado Television to write a blockbuster miniseries. ''There is so much fun, fury and intelligence in this little novel, one can forgive its insistent cartoonishness or those rare moments when the wit is less rapier than spoon,'' Lorrie Moore said here last year. INVISIBLE FRONTIERS: The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene, by Stephen S. Hall. (Tempus, $8.95.) Driven by the quest for knowledge and dreams of enormous profits, three teams of scientists competed during the late 1970's to synthesize the gene that makes insulin. Last year, our reviewer, Daniel J. Kevles, said Stephen S. Hall ''succeeds marvelously in making the science accessible to the general reader, mixing straightforward description with inventive metaphors, similes and analogies.'' FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE, by Fannie Flagg. (McGraw-Hill, $5.95.) Mrs. Threadgoode spends her twilight days in a nursing home, reminiscing about the eccentric characters who gathered during the Depression at the Whistle Stop Cafe in Alabama. This is ''a real novel and a good one,'' Jack Butler said here last year. THE RISE OF THE COUNTER-ESTABLISHMENT: From Conservative Ideology to Political Power, by Sidney Blumenthal. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $9.95.) Tracing the intellectual origins of Reaganism, Sidney Blumenthal shows how a band of conservatives - who, paradoxically, wanted radical change - set up their ''counter-establishment'' in Washington. He ''traces in a masterly way how the tiny bands of guerrilla conservatives rode down from the hills and captured the fat cities and the Presidential palaces of American life,'' Godfrey Hodgson said here in 1986. ''This is a thoughtful and fair-minded book.'' TIDINGS, by William Wharton. (McGraw-Hill, $5.95.) Beset by a variety of problems, both ethereal and mundane, a philosopher and his family spend Christmas at their old mill in France. ''It is some measure of how engaging and sympathetic Mr. Wharton makes these characters in the midst of their obsessive, solipsistic musings that the reader really worries that they are going to miss out on Christmas morning,'' Susan Kenney said here last year. ''We have a heartwarming tale of family love and reconciliation in the season to be jolly.'' IT'S RAINING IN MANGO: Pictures From a Family Album, by Thea Astley. (King Penguin, $6.95.) While telling the story of four generations of an Australian family, Thea Astley describes a continent whose magic is being overwhelmed by drugs, prostitution, development and suicide. Last year, The Times's Michiko Kakutani praised the author for her ''concise, elliptical style, her wit and her narrative ingenuity.'' THE SOCRATIC METHOD, by Michael Levin. (Ivy, $3.95.) Rebecca Shepard's chances of becoming the first tenured female professor at fictional McKinley Law School are not helped by the fact that she has written an article condemning the brutalities of the American system of legal education. Last year, our reviewer, Scott Turow, called this novel ''an energetic, intelligently motivated and often extremely funny book.''",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Tchaikovsky's Death - The Riddle Endures,"Lives of great men do not only remind us that we can make our lives sublime. Read with a suitably cold eye, they also remind us that personal history and myth want to tangle and merge. In the hands of many biographers, truth and fact become illusions or malleable intellectual concepts, as in the work of the more dogmatic literary Deconstructionists. Myth, they argue with Joseph Campbell, can be a higher form of truth. Some historians are more rigorous in method than others, of course, but even the most scholarly attempt to recapture a celebrated life must often rely on second-hand anecdotes, doctored or suppressed documents and faulty memories. So, biography must always be regarded skeptically: at best as an unfinished portrait, at worst as a fable with footnotes. The bit of history/myth I wish to deal with today is the unresolved and by now probably unresolvable mystery of Tchaikovsky's death, the subject of rumor and speculation for nearly a century. We still do not know beyond question whether he died in 1893 of cholera, as virtually all biographers accepted until recent years, or if he may have committed suicide for dark reasons growing out of his homosexual entanglements and fear of creating a scandal that could destroy his family.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

This isn't a revolt on the part of bridesmaids fed to the teeth with wearing pastels and later trying to convert fluffy orchid or pale yellow tulle into passable dinner dresses. Rather, it is almost always the bride's idea, for any one of a number of reasons. Sometimes, it's because she's basically a nonconformist, a bit of a rebel.

THE UNDERGROUND ARMY: Fighters of the Bialystok Ghetto. By Chaika Grossman. Edited by Sol Lewis. Translated by Shmuel Beeri. (Holocaust Library, 216 West 18th Street, New York, N.Y. 10011, Cloth, $18.95; Paper, $10.95.) Chaika Grossman was a principal organizer of the revolt against the Nazis in the ghetto in Bialystok, Poland, during the war and one of the few who survived it. She later immigrated to Israel where she was active in politics and in 1986 was elected deputy speaker of the Knesset. Now her story, which first appeared in Hebrew in 1949, has been published in a readable English translation. As a ''privileged'' Jew - that is, one with blue eyes and blond hair - Ms. Grossman passed herself off easily as an Aryan and acted as a go-between for the various ghettos in Poland and Lithuania, smuggling weapons for her comrades. ''The Underground Army'' is written in a straightforward and dispassionate style. Even the head of the Bialystok Judenrat, the Jewish organization that collaborated with the Germans, appears as a sort of decent man who tried his best at a time when traditional moral codes had broken down. At times some readers might become disoriented by the rapid pace of Ms. Grossman's narrative, but that flaw is outweighed by the author's vivid attention to day-to-day life, with episodes full of peril and suspense.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000
us,'Coriolanus': A 20th-Century Power Play,"Shakespeare's ''Coriolanus,'' the tale of Rome's great warrior, has received only flickering attention over the last two centuries, when it was staged as often in adaptations as in its original shape. But Shakespeare's own play has been steadily performed and scrutinized since the 1930's, in part because it is a work that speaks directly, and ominously, to the politics of our times. Though the late scholar James E. Phillips wrote that T. S. Eliot's ''Coriolan'' fragments promoted this intenser interest, the rise of Fascism is the more probable cause. (Or is that saying the same thing? Eliot's poems end with a quote from the proto-Fascist Charles Maurras.) Though the play, drawn from Plutarch's ''Lives,'' takes place early in the Roman Republic, the new production (in Joseph Papp's series of the complete plays) is set in the late 1920's, when Fascism, royalism, corporatism and other forms of stricter authority were being advanced and resisted.

By Roger Sheffer. (Night Tree Press, R.D. 2, Box 140-G, Gorge Road Route 46, Boonville, N.Y. 13309, Paper, $14.95.) The thread that connects the tales in Roger Sheffer's fine collection of short stories is that each occurs in the fictional Adirondack township of Lost River. This section of upstate New York easily qualifies as a depressed area, a desolate place ribbed by snowmobile tracks and rarely traveled mountain trails. With little indigenous industry to sustain them, most year-round citizens exist on welfare. Those who don't live hand to mouth, earn a meager living tending bar, waiting on tables in sparsely filled diners, pumping gas or servicing the ramshackle cabins and somewhat more presentable summer camps that dot the area. Unlike other parts of the Adirondacks, Mr. Sheffer's Lost River lacks even the saving grace of being scenic: it is a spiritual and geographical dead end from which few escape. Yet its people, however desperate, have inner lives, and Mr. Sheffer writes about them very touchingly. In one of the best stories, ''Deer Flies,'' we meet Harold Shink, an outcast in a town of outcasts, who makes his living by repairing the homes of summer visitors. Shink is an inarticulate man who, as described by the owner of the local general store, ''is a fat and disgusting thing for me to look at every day.'' But he has a sensitive side, which is depicted when he shows a summer resident a hidden waterfall that only occurs after a heavy rain, a phenomenon he's named for his sister. Throughout these stories, lives intersect briefly then drift off in other directions. Some sections of ''Lost River'' are stronger and more successful than others; together, however, they create a cohesive picture of what life in this desolate section of the Adirondacks is like.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

By Curtis White. (Sun and Moon, Cloth, $15.95; Paper, $10.95.) In his second collection of stories, Curtis White holds all-American cultural stereotypes up to a fun-house mirror. Reflected is a splintered, disjointed version of traditional Middle Western Americana, one that is full of antic imagination and wild humor. Mr. White's stories are littered with familiar characters who have taken on a fourth dimension: the young man rising in his job at Sears, the tough nightclub singer with a heart of gold, the earnest immigrant. In one of the best stories, ''The Order of Virility,'' a barker at a carnival sideshow, who travels with and loves the show's hermaphrodite, makes a point of seducing the local wives while his companion lures, then shocks, their husbands. Sex is frequently on the characters' minds, but it is sneaky and uncomfortable sex. What keeps each story in ''Metaphysics in the Midwest'' intact is neither conventional plot nor logic nor turn of mind, but a boldness that moves the reader from scene to scene without relaxing its grip. The problem is that this kind of modernist, Dadaesque comedy, which depends on excess, requires the finest discrimination: how much excess is, well, excessive? In making the choices in this collection, Mr. White, a professor of literature at Illinois State University, fails more often than he succeeds. Too many of the stories adopt the pumped-up cadences that come from trying too hard. Still, there is a real voice here, an original and aggressive one that is worth following.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Gilder won his first title in almost six years - since the 1983 Phoenix Open - with a 266 total, 22 under par on the Kapalua Bay course. While it came in an approved but unofficial event on the PGA Tour, the $150,000 first prize represented the biggest check of Gilder's 13-year career, more than doubled his earnings for the year and was more than he had won in any season since 1982. John Mahaffey, who also had a 66, was second at 268.(AP) One-Shot Lead for Couples: Fred Couples of the United States shot a four-under-par 68 but saw his 5-shot lead cut to 1 yesterday after the third round of the $1.2 million Dunlop Phoenix Golf Tournament in Miyazaki, Japan. Couples, who had an opening-round 62, was closely pursued by his American playing partners Ken Green and Jeff Sluman. Green, who shot 64, carded nine birdies to move into second place at 14-under 202. Sluman, who had a 65, held third at 203. (AP) Elder Leads After Two Rounds: Lee Elder, who suffered a heart attack after last year's tournament, birdied two of the last three holes yesterday and shot a one-under-par 70 for a one-stroke lead over Harold Henning after two rounds of the $300,000 Senior PGA Tour event at Key Biscayne Golf Course in Florida. Elder, 52 years old, was at five-under 137 heading into the final round today. Henning shot a 70 and was at 138.(AP) Bowling Karlsson Beats Holman: Mats Karlsson of Sweden took advantage of two open frames by Marshall Holman of Medford, Ore., and beat him by 231-199 to capture the Professional Bowlers Association Brunswick Memorial World Open yesterday in Glendale Heights, Ill. Karlsson earned $33,000 along with his third P.B.A. title. In the final round, Ron Palombi Jr. of Erie, Pa., defeated Mark Williams of Beaumont, Tex., 245-226. Holman then eliminated Palombi by 247-187 and defeated Parker Bohn 3d of Freehold, N.J., 244-219. (AP) Soccer Penalty Shot Costly to Norwich City: A disputed penalty spoiled pace-setting Norwich City's perfect road record and allowed its pursuers to gain ground in the English League First Division standing as Norwich tied 1-1 at Everton yesterday. Norwich appeared headed for its sixth road victory when Malcolm Allen scored the game's first goal. But the referee awarded Everton a penalty shot with 15 minutes to play and the England international midfielder, Trevor Steven, produced the tying goal. The result allowed runner-up Arsenal, which whipped Middlesbrough by 3-0 at home, to cut Norwich's lead to 2 points. Third-place Millwall also improved with a 4-0 trouncing of last-place Newcastle United, while defending champion Liverpool moved up to fourth by winning by 1-0 at the Queens Park Rangers.(AP) U.S. Gains in Under-16 Play: The United States and Trinidad have assured their places in the semifinals of a regional under-16 championship.

Nidal Baba scored goals in the 12th, 31st and 34th minutes for the United States. David McGuire added a goal in the 63d minute, and Anthony Wood in the 70th minute.

Kentucky Spur won by a head in 1:53 2/5, lowering the world record for a 2-year-old pacer on a five-eighths of a mile track. Central Park West had set the record at 1:53 3/5 earlier in the evening in winning the Breeders Crown 2-Year-Old Filly Pace and clinching the 2-year-old filly title after a 7 3/4-length victory.(AP) Auto Racing Petty Leads Qualifiers: Richard Petty, the seven-time series champion and winner of 200 Nascar stock car races, led second-day qualifying yesterday for the Atlanta Journal 500 today.

That lap would have been good enough for third place on the 42-car grid if Petty had turned it on Friday, when Rusty Wallace, also driving a Pontiac, set a track qualifying record of 179.499 m.p.h.

I WAS A WHITE SLAVE IN HARLEM. By Margo Howard-Howard with Abbe Michaels. (Four Walls Eight Windows, Paper, $12.95.) After reading ''I Was a White Slave in Harlem,'' it is impossible to imagine a conversation that Margo Howard-Howard would not dominate. His life was a breathless walk on the wild side. Stories were for embellishing, rules for breaking and people either fools or toys - or, less often, mythical figures of the sort that Howard-Howard, the grand drag queen, manifestly considered himself to be. For decades, until his death in September, he breezed through a slick New York scene of transvestites and tricksters. Figures of New York legend appear in the book (written with Abbe Michaels, a New York freelance writer) like flickering images on a shifting screen. Now here, suddenly gone, are the likes of James Dean, Truman Capote, Andy Warhol - most of them conveniently dead. What is true, not quite so true or downright false eventually becomes less urgent than what will happen next. Howard-Howard lengthily proclaims his lineage - from British royalty; that the connection was fabricated matters little. Underlying the layers of glitz is a gritty story of an often troubled person. His mother thought her only son belonged in the circus; a customer willing to pay $100 for a kiss nearly bit off Howard-Howard's tongue. The title refers to the years he claimed that he was a willing prisoner of Leroy (Nicky) Barnes, Harlem's heroin king. Finally, there is escape, Methadone treatment and a final ego trip: Howard-Howard began a New York society to honor Mary, Queen of Scots, filling it with society matrons, some of whom whispered that her voice seemed a bit husky. Last year, on the 400th anniversary of Mary's beheading, Margo visited England and met Queen Elizabeth II. The book's last line: ''She's a rather nice lady, said one queen of the other.''",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

By Geoffrey Fox. (Hudson View Press, 2643 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10025, Paper, $6.95.) This frequently powerful collection of short stories enters Latin America as if through the rickety back door of a burlesque house: ''Goo' mornin', all you wonnerful people,'' begins the title story as a tour guide leads his Anglo flock through the imaginary splendors of a city called Santo Abismo. The low-rent stand-up routine serves to lure unsuspecting readers to some pretty dank depths, and although the stories of violence draw from a familiar well (a peasant is mutilated, a village decimated, a rebellion plotted), when he turns to accidental clashes between conflicting cultures, Geoffrey Fox steps out on his own. Most fictional treatments of such encounters feature at least one ugly American, but ''Welcome to My Contri'' does not resort to easy cliche. The Northerners who appear here do not tramp carelessly on third world freedoms; instead, they inadvertently knock them over. A bit like characters from Graham Greene, they don't quite understand the rules by which others play the game, with the result that the game itself is deeply suspect. In this short and impressive work, Mr. Fox, who has taught Latin American politics and society at New York University, has created a memorable set of players who, while not natural antagonists (they often share the same dreams and goals), are still somehow bent on confrontation. Watching their sometimes vicious, often darkly humorous interactions leaves us thoroughly wrung out - and aware that we are in the presence of a formidable new writer.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

He thinks that Medicare covers our medical bills. Think again. First, it pays only 80 percent of approved expenses; we pay the rest. Also, we pay a hefty premium, which is deducted from our Social Security every month, and that premium is going to be increased to pay for the so-called catastrophic program.

By Bo Ball. (Independence Publishers, P.O. Box 29905, Atlanta, Ga. 30359; $12.95.) One wishes to hear ''Appalachian Patterns'' read aloud. In language both musical and quirky, Bo Ball gives life to the inhabitants of his native Appalachia. Set during the 1930's and 40's, these 11 stories show the dwellers of a rural community called Copperhead as they spend their years in simple yet timeless pursuits: caring for babies, laboring to make ends meet, going crazy from love, dreaming of and often fearing a world beyond their own. Despite some characters who come close to being folksy caricatures, there is real emotional resonance in most of these colorful tales. A literature and writing professor at Agnes Scott College in Georgia, Mr. Ball seems essentially a poet, packing his sentences with inventive images and sometimes producing beautiful effects. But when it comes to rendering dialogue he often gets lost in a brier patch of fractured spelling. (What good does it do a story if the reader has to spend a long minute figuring out that ''Slike sprang'' means ''It's like spring''?) When Mr. Ball's risks as a writer pay off, however, they pay off well. In ''Idie Red, Idie Blue,'' for example, twin sisters named Gaye and Faye come of age rambling the country roads, much sought after by men and soon seeking out their attentions. This story, which richly displays the author's unusual voice, magically combines elements that are lyrical, erotic and plain down-home.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

Working with his architect, John Wipple Barton, he received permission to add a floor and a penthouse to the six-story building. The interior is being gutted and rebuilt, and the first-floor, cast-iron facade and decorative tin capitals are being refurbished. The work is costing $5.6 million, and though the 24 condominium lofts will sell for $250,000 to $1.2 million, Mr. Buden said he will not make much of a profit because he bought the building for $3 million, triple what its price would be in a landmark district.",1988-11-20T05:00:00+0000

(One well-known piece, Falla's ''Homenajes,'' was included.) The ''Valencian Watercolors'' of Eduardo Lopez-Chavarri, first heard in 1910, speaks a pleasant, Romantic-nationalistic language that needs more bite, or perhaps the superimposition of a real vocal part over the songlike textures. Roberto Gerhard's concerto for piano and string orchestra (1951) has some arresting gestures and an effective slow movement, brooding and gloomy. Tomas Marco's ''Quasi un Requiem'' (1972), once past what sounded like a routine sampler of aleatory effects, achieves a certain solemnity.",1988-11-22T05:00:00+0000

But by the time college radio stations and an alternative circuit of clubs and independent labels had arisen that could support them, most of the first-generation alternative bands were gone. Some had spectacular flameouts, others simply dissolved as their rebellion was transformed into a fashion statement. But two punk-rooted bands that have carried on uncompromising, self-directed careers since 1977 will be back in New York clubs this weekend - the Feelies at the Ritz tonight and the Mekons at CBGB tonight and tomorrow.",1988-11-25T05:00:00+0000

This season, she is singing the role at the Metropolitan Opera, to considerable acclaim. (There is a performance tonight at 8 o'clock. Tickets: standing room $7 to $10, at the Met box office. Information: 362-6000). ''For me, Butterfly is a role that embodies pain and joy,'' Ms. Watanabe said in an interview. ''It is a complete character, as are so many of Puccini's roles. I have sung several of them: Mimi, Manon Lescaut, Suor Angelica. They are my favorites, because they are integral characters, and very theatrical.

The only racer to beat the twins from Yakima, Wash., was Niklas Lindquist of Sweden, a rookie on the pro circuit tour this year. The top three qualifiers were awarded gold bars. A field of 32 men and 16 women were selected in the qualifying runs to compete in slalom and giant slalom runs scheduled for today, tomorrow and Sunday. Steve Mahre said he and his brother could have skiied better, but were satisfied at being able to qualify in their first attempt. ''To tell you the truth, I didn't feel that fast,'' he said. It was the first time the Mahre brothers had raced since the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia.(AP)",1988-11-25T05:00:00+0000

For instance, the average yield on a six-month certificate of deposit last November was 132 basis points below the yield offered for a five year C.D.; since then, that yield spread has been nearly reduced by half. Analysts at Donoghue's Money Fund Report say the seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund is at a three year high, with room for further increases.

Here is an excerpt from my journal for that trip, for Monday, Nov. 4, 1985: ''Finally, at the end of the long long day, we arrived in Melbourne. Our driver to the hotel told us that Tuesday is Melbourne Cup Day. The Melbourne Cup is a horse race as big as the Kentucky Derby at home. In our room, in an entire magazine on the Cup, I found this: 'The first Tuesday in November. To any person with an ounce of Australian blood in his veins, it means one thing only - the Melbourne Cup. A horse race that brings a nation to a complete standstill for about four minutes.' Well, to us the standstill looks a lot longer than four minutes. Apparently, the town has gone bananas over the race. And Princess Di and Prince Charles are here - to the great delight of the city. Our hotel is elegantly observing the occasion. First we noticed a fancy card, welcoming us for the Cup and wishing us well in our wagers. Then we found a notice of a Champagne Picnic available at $20, Australian. And while we were getting ready for dinner, a bell hop brought a beautiful chocolate cake, about five inches in diameter. The decoration on top was a horse's head encircled by a horseshoe. Then, when we returned from dinner, we found a small bottle of Champagne with a printed note which stated that it was compliments of the hotel on Cup Day. Oh, I forgot to say that all the stores in Melbourne will be closed tomorrow. How bananas can you get!'' CARL F. ZERKE Pensacola, Fla.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Mr. Bass Man,"In 1935, the Cab Calloway Orchestra, barnstorming its way back to the Cotton Club after making a film in Hollywood, arrived in Chicago in need of a bassist. Mr. Calloway hired Milt Hinton, an unheralded 25-year-old Chicagoan, intending to replace him in New York. Sixteen years later, Mr. Hinton was still there, having established himself as one of the leading bassists in jazz. Mr. Hinton has since enjoyed a richly varied career, recording with artists ranging from Billie Holiday and Benny Goodman to Aretha Franklin and Paul McCartney. In BASS LINE: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton (Temple University, $39.95), written with David G. Berger, who teaches sociology at Temple University, Mr. Hinton tells his own story with eloquent simplicity. He describes his childhood in Vicksburg, Miss., where he witnessed a lynching as a child, and his life on Chicago's South Side, where he once had a summer job in a dry-cleaning shop that was a front for a numbers game controlled by Al Capone. But the text is only the beginning of the story here. For the last 50 years, Mr. Hinton's hobby has been photography, and approximately 200 of his photographs of his musical peers are included here. With evocative shots like those of a scholarly looking Foots Thomas preparing an arrangement for Mr. Calloway, an impossibly young and intense-looking Dizzy Gillespie dozing in a Pullman car and a drawn and tired Billie Holiday skeptically listening to playbacks during one of her last recording sessions, Mr. Hinton shows us private moods seldom captured on album covers or in conventional photos of musicians in action.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Gleaming black lizards darted between clefts in the rocks. To the northwest, beyond the peaceful, dreaming waters of Tule Lake, the white cone of Mount Shasta shone in the clear light; in the middle distance, leaping fingers of flame edged by black smoke rose from the fields of horseradish farmers burning stubble left over from pasture of the year before. The terrain in the foreground - once-molten lava, cooled and petrified, seemed almost too pat, symbolically, as the repository for ghosts and memories of a war fought, on the Indian side, with the white heat of desperation. The scene seemed shot through with a gentle melancholy: in this, one of the saddest and bloodiest clashes of the Indian wars, the Modocs' identity as a tribe was lost for all time.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

The 64-year-old director describes any number of fascinating exhibits in the planning stage - on the horse in North America, on the tribal use of body paint, on powwows, on controversial Indian issues, such as poverty, criminal recidivism, infant mortality, and alcoholism. For a brief moment, it sounds like a real museum. The facts are sobering. Few Americans had even heard of the Museum of the American Indian until a bitter fight surfaced recently over moving the collection, one of the finest of its kind in the world, out of the Upper Manhattan building it has occupied since 1916. Only the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, and the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, rival the museum's holdings of Indian artifacts. They, of course, draw millions of visitors every year, enjoy strong support from government and private sources, regularly mount important exhibitions, and maintain extensive programs of scholarly research and publication. The Indian museum is another story - a long, drawn-out story, perhaps the longest-running tragedy in the history of American museums.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Reading George Burns's loving tribute to his late wife, the comedienne Gracie Allen, is the next best thing to watching reruns of the couple's long-running 1950's television series. Burns and Allen were married, both on stage and off, for 40 years. They began as a vaudeville act in the 1920's, graduated to radio in the 1930's, then gave television one of its first and most memorable situation comedies from 1952 to 1958. The key to the act's success was not Mr. Burns, who always played the straight man, nor the material, which could sometimes be corny even by vaudeville standards. What kept the show going was Allen, who used her exquisite comic timing to transform a stock ''dizzy dame'' character into what Mr. Burns calls ''the national symbol of misunderstanding.'' Gracie's role as the dumb wife is dated, but her ''illogical logic'' can still draw laughs: she once determined to meet Babe Ruth and his twin brother, for instance, after reading that the Babe's double had won a game. She also once threatened to run for governor of the State of Coma, saying she had been there for years, and sometime later announced her candidacy for President on the Surprise Party. After she retired in 1958, Allen's heart ailments gradually worsened. She died in 1964 at the age of 58. Mr. Burns tells her story as if he were doing a stand-up comedy routine; he even lets the reader know when he is puffing on his cigar as a signal to laugh. This entertaining monologue is the kind of memorial that would please any comic for one simple reason: it leaves the audience with a smile.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

us,SETTING IT UP,"Table settings are simply environments in miniature. Pulled together with the same precision as furnishing an entire house, they require a careful balance of just the right elements. And like all areas of home design, they are a reflection of the eye and taste of the creator. On the following pages, an antiques dealer, a decorator and an architect have readied their dining tables for the holidays. Suitably, each approached the task with his or her own panache. The antiques dealer used rare 18th-century objects as ornaments both on the table and around the room. The decorator mixed her own collection of antique tabletop accessories with a traditional array of garlands and topiary made from the greenery in her own backyard. And the architect chose a selection of china and glasses of his own design that are not so very different from the buildings and philosophies that have long been his signature. In each case, the result is not only personal but a feast for the eye.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"A POLITICAL EDUCATION: A Washington Memoir, by Harry McPherson. (Houghton Mifflin, $11.95.) In 1956 Harry McPherson, a liberal young lawyer from Texas, packed his Buick and drove to Washington for a sobering stint as an aide to Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson. When this insider's guide to politics was published in 1972, The Times's Anatole Broyard said it was ''fascinating to read'' and called the author ''refreshingly candid in both his praises and his criticisms.'' THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, by Tom Wolfe. (Bantam, $5.95.) For Sherman McCoy, an investment banker with a palatial apartment on Park Avenue, it was frightening enough when he accidentally took the wrong exit off the expressway, descending into the netherworld of the South Bronx. Little did he know that from that moment on his carefully ordered life was fated to be torn asunder. For years, Tom Wolfe, the doyen of New Journalism, had threatened to strike a blow against post-modern fiction with a Fieldingesque novel of social realism. The result is ''a big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go,'' Frank Conroy said here last year. ''Fast as it is - like falling downstairs, sometimes - the pace is superb, and the action, twists of plot, comic setups and jumps from track to track always occur at just the right times.'' DOLLARS AND DREAMS: The Changing American Income Distribution, by Frank Levy. (Norton, $7.95.) As the gap between rich and poor keeps growing and the middle class shrinks, fewer and fewer people are able to buy their way into the American dream, the economist Frank Levy argues. Earlier this year, Robert Lekachman said in The Book Review that this book is ''admirably lucid and mercifully concise.'' INTO LOVE AND OUT AGAIN, by Elinor Lipman. (Washington Square/Pocket, $6.95.) When Tim and Hannah fall in love at the Registry of Motor Vehicles they embark on a romance that lasts throughout seven of these 16 short stories. Writing here in 1987, Sara Vogan praised this book for moments that are ''very funny, even poignant.'' SHEER FICTION, by Paul West. (McPherson & Company, $10.) The author of ''Rat Man of Paris'' condemns America's flat, minimalist ''tofu fiction'' about ''little people with mortgages'' as ''a way for the ungifted to have a literary career.'' Last year our reviewer, David Sacks, said the ''verbal fireworks'' in these essays are ''sheer joy.'' A FAN'S NOTES, by Frederick Exley. (Vintage, $7.95.) To coincide with the publication of ''Last Notes From Home,'' the conclusion of Frederick Exley's fictional memoirs, Vintage has printed a new edition of his first novel, which many critics consider the best of the trilogy. This story about a heavy-drinking, half-mad writer who yearns to be as great as his idol, the football star Frank Gifford, was praised for the ''exuberance'' of its style by John P. Sisk in The Book Review in 1968. The same publisher has also reissued the middle volume, PAGES FROM A COLD ISLAND ($6.95), in which the narrator (obsessed this time with the literary lion Edmund Wilson) is confronted with the problem of sudden fame. THE GOLDEN ORIOLE, by Raleigh Trevelyan. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $12.95.) Born to a family of Britons who served under the British Raj, Raleigh Trevelyan returned to India to trace his ancestors' past. This ''may well be one of the last in the long line of Anglo-Indian memoirs, and by a happy chance it is certainly one of the best,'' Jan Morris said in The Book Review last year. L'ABBE C, by Georges Bataille. Translated by Philip A. Facey. (Marion Boyars/Kampmann, $9.95.) In the days of the French Resistance, twin brothers - one a priest, one a sexual libertine - become engaged in an obsessive triangle with a prostitute. In Georges Bataille's novel, first published in France in 1950, ''the style is crisp, and this translation is quite remarkable,'' Marianne Veron said here in 1984. THE RACE TO FASHODA: European Colonialism and African Resistance in the Scramble for Africa, by David Levering Lewis. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $11.95.) In the late 19th century, Britain, France, Italy and Belgium competed for dominance in the Nile Valley, a final stage in the colonization of Africa. This history of that period is ''elegantly written and thoroughly researched,'' William Boyd said here earlier this year. THEIR PRIDE AND JOY, by Paul Buttenwieser. (Laurel/Dell, $8.95.) Born to a philanthropic family of overachievers, the Gutheim siblings have lofty goals: one brother anticipates a Supreme Court clerkship, the other a performance at Carnegie Hall. Then sister Joan comes home from Bennington with what is now known as anorexia nervosa. Last year our reviewer, Joel Conarroe, said this novel set in New York in 1960 ''makes some telling points about the timeless dynamics of family relationships.'' AN URCHIN IN THE STORM: Essays About Books and Ideas, by Stephen Jay Gould. (Norton, $7.95.) In a collection of book reviews, the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould explains how one can reject strict Cartesian reductionism while remaining firmly on the side of the rationalists. For people ''serious about writing or thinking,'' this is ''nearly a perfect study in method,'' Caroline Rand Herron said here last year.",1988-11-27T05:00:00+0000

The increase, first announced by Chase Manhattan, is the fourth rise in the prime - all by a half-point - this year and it puts the base lending rate at its highest level since May 1985.
