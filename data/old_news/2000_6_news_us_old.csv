Dave Avery was born on his family's farm in Aurora, NY on December 17, 1916. He graduated from Cayuga Lake Academy and Syracuse University. Early on he chose to work in advertising and spent most of his career with the National Geographic Magazine in New York, retiring in 1983 to Riverside and Essex, CT. He was a member of the University Glee Club of New York, an Elder and Deacon of the Rye Presbyterian Church in Rye, NY, a founding member of the Rye Walking, Chowder and Poker Society and a long-time member of the Manursing Island Club in Rye. Although at home in corporate offices along Madison Avenue, he was molded by his early years in Aurora, NY. His easy, open manner, his generosity, sense of humor and pride made him a successful salesman, a loving husband, dedicated father and joyful relative. The farm never left him, as his success in nurturing tomatoes, radishes and scallions out of the most unpromising ground in suburban New York attests. He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Irene Avery of Essex, CT, his children by a previous marriage, William of New Canaan, CT, David Jr. of Stamford, CT, Thomas of Oakland, CA, Chris of Royaton, CT and Carol of New York City, his step-daughters Elizabeth Bagley of New Canaan and Sue Howland of Chicago, his sister Jean Wagner of Hampton Falls, NH, his brother Baldwin of Pocono Lake Preserve, PA., and seven grandchildren.

At one end, more than 100 candles suspended on thin steel wires hung as if floating in air over a shallow trough of water. When guests put on special glasses, left, and looked at a point of light, they saw paired hearts.

He received a BS in Physics from Harvard University in 1947 and a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Cornell University in 1951, where he studied nuclear physics under Hans Bethe. George moved to New Mexico in 1951, where he was a driving force in the Theoretical Physics Division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory until his death. In the early part of his career there, he worked on reactor physics and safety. By the 60's, his interests shifted towards biology and immunology. He served as a group leader for the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics from 1974-1990 and Theoretical Physics Division leader from 1980-1989. He was a founder of the Center for Human Genome Studies in 1988. George authored three books and hundreds of scientific articles and was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). George was also an avid mountaineer and outdoorsman. His first exposure to technical climbing came during a summer camp to the Tetons while he was in high school. It quickly developed into a passion and he went on four expeditiions to the Peruvian Andes in the 50's. He and is team made the first ascent of Yerpaja in 1950 and of Salcantay in 1952, two of Peru's highest and most difficult peaks. In 1953, George attempted K2 (then unclimbed) with a well-knit team. They endured a horrific storm for a week at 25,000', and a terrible accident on the way down. The entire team could easily have been lost, but miraculously all but one team member staggered into base camp. This was a pivotal event in the lives of the seven surviving team members, who became as close as brothers. George was carried out from the base camp and eventually lost two toes to frostbite. Despite this, his enthusiasm for climbing was undiminished. He went on several more Himalayan expeditions, culminating in the first ascent of Masherbrum (the 25th highest peak in the world) in 1960. George then married Virginia (Ginny) Lotz in 1956. In Ginny, he found an enthusiastic life partner and together they enjoyed many outdoor adventures. They had two children: Carolyn and George, Jr. Family backpacking and climbing trips were the norm. In their later years, George and Ginny enjoyed a dozen treks in the Himalayas, and another dozen to mountain ranges in the rest of the world. Even at age 73, he remained in remarkable physical shape, hiking 14 miles the weekend before his death. A brilliant but unassuming man, he was a great inspiration to his family, his many friends, colleagues, and young aspiring mountaineers. George is survived by his wife, Ginny of Los Alamos, New Mexico; his daughter, Carolyn BellPrince and grandchildren Kaitlin, Austin and Derek Prince all of Los Alamos; his son, George Irving Bell, Jr. and wife, Esther Brady, and grandchildren, Allison and Henry Bell all of Boulder, CO. He is also survived by his elder sister. Dr. Barbara Bell, of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. A memorial service is planned and will be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers the family suggests donations to the American Himalayan Foundation, 909 Montgomery St., Suite 400, San Francisco, CA 94133 or the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 201 Eubank Northeast, Suite B2, Albuquerque, NM 87123.

Both the portrayals of the black characters and the views Roth puts into their mouths have generated some uneasiness among a number of reviewers and critics.

These days, many of our most popular travel books -- Frances Mayess paeans to Tuscany come to mind -- are not really travel books but lavish fantasias of home renovation, which only serve to confirm the fact that anyone with two weeks vacation and a credit card can join an eco-tour of the Costa Rican rain forest but a good team of construction workers, whether at home or abroad, is almost impossible to find.",2000-06-04T05:00:00+0000

What the former Wall Street financier meant was that he wanted to spend for better health care and schools, instead of cutting taxes. But Mr. Corzine had also just invested a stratospheric $35 million to win a primary, more than any other Senate candidate in American history. The price tag for this victory now stands as a distressing symbol of a political system so driven by money that a candidate must be either extremely wealthy or extremely beholden to contributors in order to win.

Born in Budapest, Hungary in 1916, Tony's versatile piano artistry brought joy to many people throughout the world. A child prodigy, he toured Europe as a classical concert pianist. Subsequently, having falling in love with jazz, he toured with the W. Martiny and T. Brunner orchestras and performed as a solo pianist in many of the most popular night clubs in Hungary and Switzerald. He was recently honored by being included in a musical CD ROM Tribute, compiled by the Hungarian Foundation for Jazz Education and Research, for his contributions to jazz history. From 1952 to 1960, Tony lived in Havana, Cuba. There, he appeared as a guest on numerous television and radio shows, and was the featured artist of his own popular dining club, the Mes Amis (My Friends). After immigrating to the United States in 1960, Tony's popularity rose through his solo engagements at the Windsor Hotel, Montreal, The Pierre, Summit, Carlisle, Sherry Netherlands, and Park Lane Hotel (New York City), and other night clubs such as Gogi's and the House of Hungary. Starting in 1973, he maintained a sixteen year engagement at the Blue Room in the Warwick Hotel, Houston, Texas.

(Lunch is at a Korean place in Manhattan). Mr. Dude comes off as a jovial Jersey Guy as excited about home fries as haute cuisine.

Moulton of Exeter, NH and Quonochontaug, RI died on Friday, June 2 after a long illness. He was 86. Prof. Moulton was an internationally known linguistics scholar, specializing in Germanic languages. Born in Providence, RI, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton in 1935. After teaching at Yale, where he received his Ph.D in 1941, he went to Cornell from 1947 to 1960, and returned to Princeton to teach until he retired in 1979. Middlebury College and the University of Munich awarded him honorary degrees.Prof. Moulton was awarded a Fulbright and two Guggenheim Fellowships. Author of several books and multiple articles, active in the Linguistics Society of America and the Center for Applied Linguistics, he was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. During WWII as a captain in the army he wrote the army language series SPOKEN GERMAN with his wife Jenni, to teach German to American servicemen. As an American, his structural understanding of Germanic languages, from Old and Middle High German to modern day Swiss German, made him unique. His linguistic gift was to make complicated work simple and bring a light touch to serious studies. Prof. Moulton is survived by his wife of 62 years, Jenni Moulton, their daughters Elizabeth Farnham of Exeter, NH, Susan Moultan of Winchester, MA, four grandchildren and his brother David.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Thoughts of Another Life,"The characters in Joan Silber's first collection of short stories, IN MY OTHER LIFE (Sarabande, cloth, $21.95; paper, $13.95), are almost all New Yorkers, but not the self-absorbed, ambitious, cell-phone-toting kind. These are plain-spoken middle-aged people, just trying to get by, who imagine themselves better off in another life. In this life, they are drug counselors, bartenders, video store managers and real estate agents; never married, working on second marriages, trying to raise children. They don't consider themselves failures, but realize they might be seen that way. In ''Bobby Jackson,'' the 40-ish narrator looks back on his youth as a bartender, when he experimented with heroin and felt ''drowned in love'' with a waitress named Nancy. That he survived those reckless years is not alarming, just true. ''I was not afraid to die,'' he says plainly. ''I had the dreamy curiosity about death that small children have.'' Now, in the calm of middle age, he is someone ''who takes great private pleasure in things around me. On some days my own apartment seems like a vale of peace and light.'' There's a lot to be said for holding on to what you've got, Silber tells us. In ''Lake Natasink,'' an unconventional relationship is portrayed with quiet honesty and humor. Patty and her lover Charlotte are moving upstate with their newly adopted baby, and tension arises over the transition. Tired of arguing, ''They sit down quietly. They watch the news.'' Silber, the author of two previous novels, treats dysfunction a bit more gently than Lorrie Moore, with whom she shares a marvelous, perspicacious wit. Her characters struggle to keep going, however slowly, without losing their dignity. If they lack fulfillment, memories of old longings seem to suffice. These elegant and wise stories pay tribute to ordinary urban heroes -- people who have lived long enough to know that when misfortune shows up, there's no need to make a fuss.

All Napster is, after all, is a huge database of MP3 files, a musical commune dreamed up by a college-freshman geek. And sharing a database isn't theft. If you agree to join the Napster ''community,'' you agree to share every MP3 you have with any other Napsterite who is online at the same time you are.

Looking down at my hand-held mallbot, I notice that McDonald's is offering 16 ounces of Diet Coke at 89 cents, but my bot, whom I call Marty, would fry his silicon if I paid retail. He's a little Palm Pilot-looking gizmo and he can keep track of the price fluctuations of every item in the mall through his little infrared window, and he can haggle them down if I let him. He signals that Diet Rite has tumbled to about two pennies an ounce over at Subway. That means that the teenagers who work as food-court arbitrageurs will be selling Diet Rite to the people in the McDonald's line. I figure Mickey D.'s is going to have to discount deep at the register, so I put in an offer for 63 cents a cup and let the market come to me. I could hold out until after the lunch rush, when prices usually drop 15 percent, but I'm thirsty now. Besides, I want to be back at Macy's in half an hour. It has been oversupplied with my favorite brand of cologne all day, and with the Christmas shopping season over in just a few hours, there are signs of panic sweeping across the store's entire male-fragrance sector.",2000-06-11T05:00:00+0000

I, however, have a foolproof method for calibrating the extent to which a dead cat will bounce. And if my shares have a way, from time to time, of getting sold at prices lower than where I bought them, that doesn't mean I made a bad trade. I just made a losing trade. It happens. All the time.

The art critic RoseLee Goldberg has written a thoughtful, if at times too adulatory, overview of Anderson's multimedia career. This handsomely produced LAURIE ANDERSON (Abrams, $39.95) covers her early sculptures and sketches, art-rock records like her pop hit ''O Superman,'' quirky inventions and grandly scaled electronic operas like ''Home of the Brave'' and her latest, ''Songs and Stories From Moby-Dick.'' Anderson trained as a classical violinist with the Chicago Youth Symphony, studied art at Columbia University and actually did walk away from an airplane crash, as recounted in her song ''The Language of the Future.'' Her experimental work has been influenced by the Fluxus performance artists, as well as by John Cage, Philip Glass and William S. Burroughs, but Goldberg presumptuously links her to Whitman, Melville and the prophet Isaiah. Although Goldberg assumes the reader is familiar with performance art, her descriptions of Anderson's pieces are vivid and illuminating, and she shows the seamless continuity of Anderson's daily life, dreams and work.

A fisherman's son from Northern Japan, he earned a law degree from Chuo University in Tokyo and was awarded a law scholarship from the University of Kansas in Lawrence in 1959. At a time when young Japanese rarely left their homeland, he explored every part of the country he loved and eventually became an American citizen. During the turbulent 60's he took part in almost every major event, became a wellknown figure in the East Village, working with LaMama and other groups. He then went on to make award-winning documentaries for Japanese and American public television. His passionate interest in astronomy was reflected in an impressive International NHK-TV Galactic Odyssey series. In 1996 he received a Media Achievement Award from the International Society for the Study of Dissociation for his sensitive TV portrayal of multiple personality disorder. His beaming smile and integrity won the hearts of all who loved and worked with him-whose personal and professional lives he so deeply touched.

''Sail away, sail away,'' Sarah Cracknell of Saint Etienne coos in ''How We Used to Live,'' the nine-minute mini-suite that sums up ''Sound of Water'' as it drifts between distant, unhappy memories and persistent hope. For a decade, Saint Etienne has been leavening pop songs with dance-club rhythms, coolly observing how far astray passion and ambition can lead. The band's fifth unified album, ''Sound of Water,'' floats above the fray; its songs yearn for escape and sanctuary. Saint Etienne collaborated with the minimalist German electronic group To Rococo Rot and with Sean O'Hagan, the Beach Boys idolator from the High Llamas. The few uptempo songs are skeletal and abstracted, transparently displaying their underlying patterns of clicks and blips and nonsense pop syllables, while the ballads sway between two chords like Brian Wilson in a hammock. Saint Etienne remains fascinated with pop construction, but has moved past cleverness and easy ironies. Its songs are no longer puzzles; they're atmospheric, self-contained worlds.

Possessing 50 pills or more would be a second-degree crime with a 5-to 10-year sentence. Possessing fewer than 50 pills would remain a third-degree offense.

During his career, he conducted more than 80 major orchestras and festivals in the U.S., Canada, and twelve European countries and premiered a host of major works by acclaimed American and European composers. Former assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Maestro Dufallo worked closely with Leonard Bernstein from 1965 to 1975. During this time, he made his opera debut with the New York City Opera and succeeded Darius Milhaud as artistic director of the Conference on Contemporary Music at the Aspen Festival in Colorado. American symphony orchestras that performed under his baton include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, and Buffalo Philharmonic, with which he enjoyed a three-year association as assistant conductor. Maestro Dufallo conducted more than 25 world premieres, including Stockhausen's ''Carre'' in London, The Hague and Paris; Jacob Druckman's ''Lamia'' with the Berlin Philharmonic, and Sir Peter Maxwell Davis' opera ''The Lighthouse'' at the Edinburgh Festival. Other European performances include Robert Beaser's ''Piano Concerto'' with the Philharmonique de Monte Carlo with his wife, Steinway Artist Pamela Mia Paul, the Rome premiere of Elliott Carter's ''A Mirror on Which to Dwell,'' the world premiere of ''Trance Formations'' by Robert Zuidam at Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, and the Polish premiere of Bruce MacCombie's ''Chelsea Tango.'' Named permanent guest conductor of the Gelders Orchestra in Holland, Maestro Dufallo made his European debut in 1970 in Paris with the Orchestra Telephonique Francais. Other major European orchestras that have performed undehis baton include the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic, London Symphony and Royal Philharmonic. Equally at home with Mozart and Mahler, Dufallo's programming frequently included works by Bernstein, Aaron Copland, George Gershwin, Charles Ives, and Igor Stravinsky. In February 2000, Maestro Dufallo conducted the Dutch Radio Symphony as part of a 26-hr. series, ''Of Beauty and Consolation,'' which was taped by VPRO Dutch television and broadcast in Europe in April. The two-and-one-half-hour performance (with no intermission) included original text (by the conductor), which he spoke between each piece. Other recent appearances include tours with the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, a tour of Holland and Belgium with the Dutch Radio Philharmonic, the world premiere of ''The Food of Love'' by Peter Schat with the Noord Nederlands Orkest, and debuts with the Orkest van het Oosten (1997-98), and Israel Sinfonietta and Limburg Symphony Orchestra (1998-99). His internationally acclaimed publication, ''Trackings: Composers Speak with Richard Dufallo'' (Oxford University Press), includes conversations with twenty-six of the world's leading composers. Maestro Dufallo has been recorded on Sony, Composer's Voice, CRI American Masters, Fontec Records, Channel Crossings, and Globe. A native of Whiting, Indiana, Maestro Dufallo was born Jan. 30, 1933. He is survived by his wife, pianist Pamela Mia Paul, sons Basil Dufallo, a classics scholar, of Seattle, and Cornelius Dufallo, a violinist in the Flux Quartet, of New York; daughter Rene Kirby of Los Angeles, and a sister, Kathryn Traczyk of East Chicago, Indiana. No service is planned. Memorials may be made to the Richard Dufallo Scholarship Fund, University of North Texas, P.O. Box 311367, Denton, Texas 76203.

Now comes a restaurant that suggests that far from dreaming of domination, all the dust-coated horsemen really wanted to do was teach the West to do barbecue right. At Gobi Grill, Mongolian barbecue is the main attraction. At the end of a busy day in the desert, say legends posted here, Genghis's men used their razor-sharp weapons to carve up local game and vegetables, which they grilled on their shields. The tradition lives on in the form of the tava, a flat, round skillet perfect for grilling meals. Diners here assemble their own, plucking thinly shaved meats like lamb, chicken, beef and seafood from a cart, tossing in a variety of fresh vegetables, and ladling on one of four sauces and assorted condiments. Garlic water, anyone? Next, you slip your bowl into the kitchen through a slot beneath a glass window, a chef heaps your selections onto a smoking skillet and cooks it with the aid of elongated chopsticks as you watch. Who knew such a simple ritual could be so fascinating? And, for that matter, who knew you could grill Asian noodles? Later, diners cradling their steaming bowls hurry back to their seats to feast under a tentlike structure called a ger.

Last week, as Mr. Gore embarked on a new series of ''prosperity and progress'' speeches, Mr. Bush immediately derided his efforts as ''Al Gore's 'I Invented Prosperity' Tour.'' Underneath the surface of such exchanges, however, the political terrain may be undergoing some redefinition. For the first time in decades, a presidential race is occurring at a time of economic abundance and budget surpluses. These unusual circumstances are testing the creativity of both major candidates.",2000-06-18T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Revising Lives,"In computer software terminology, the ''version 2.0'' of a program is generally the first major revision to the original product, where old mistakes are fixed and new features are added. As one might guess from the title, Caroline Preston's warm and engaging second novel, LUCY CROCKER 2.0 (Scribner, $23), is about a woman's decision to revise her own life. Part midlife catharsis, part wilderness adventure story, the book also brings a human touch to the world of computers. Lucy is a painter and former librarian living in Massachusetts, and she is married to Ed, a software company president; they have teenage twin sons who started their own computer consulting business while in fourth grade. Asked to produce paintings and puzzles for a sequel to a computer fantasy game she had designed, Lucy procrastinates until Ed, goaded by Ingrid, his company's publicity director, fires her from the project. After she discovers that Ed and Ingrid are engaging in after-work activities of their own (often involving huckleberry massage oil), and catches her sons surfing for porn on the Internet, Lucy is prompted to action. She signs up her protesting twins for a rigorous canoe trip, and then she takes off on a sojourn of her own to her family's old cabin in the Wisconsin woods. Although the book's plot can be predictable in places, Preston gives us strong, complex characters who each end up striving to correct the bugs and glitches plaguing their lives. J. D.

Rathere, the 14-year-old daughter of a space-roving journalist, has trouble getting her father's attention. Her constant companion is an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) with so much computing capacity that it can pilot a starship, baby-sit for Rathere and ponder the mysteries of the universe at the same time. The danger, for Rathere's financially strapped father, is that the A.I. will raise its ''Turing Quotient'' to 1.0, which would make it, in the eyes of the law, an independent person rather than a useful piece of property. Realizing that his daughter's relationship with the A.I. is driving the machine toward sentience, the father separates them. Rathere fights back in the only way she can. To nudge the A.I. over the threshold to personhood, she makes love to it -- in a scene of eerie beauty that begins with the words, ''It's me, darling.''",2000-06-18T05:00:00+0000

These are excellent films by first-rank directors, but what made them so soul-satisfying was a quality of intimacy, palpable and immediate. That quality takes the experience of watching to another level.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; America's Satanic Mills,"Social documentary photography was still new when Lewis W. Hine began photographing child laborers at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 1906 and 1918, working as an investigative photographer for a humanitarian organization, the National Child Labor Committee, he documented children toiling in mines, mills, fish canneries, factories and on the streets. Buoyed by his belief in the power of pictures to change public opinion, Hine was indefatigable. He could also be shrewd, claiming to be a Bible salesman to gain entry into factories where he was otherwise unwanted, or memorizing the height of his coat buttons to compute the heights of the children he photographed. His social realism was in tune with the muckraking tenor of his times, Vicki Goldberg writes in her insightful introduction to LEWIS W. HINE: Children at Work (Prestel, $39.95), a selection of more than 90 of Hine's finest photographs. If their frankly prosaic character renders pronouncements about the excellence of individual pictures difficult to make, she observes, there is less question about the force and power of the totality of his work. Aesthetics were not what Hine's work was about; it was social change that he sought. Truths were revealed in the details: the scabbed bare feet of a small girl in a cotton mill, the hugeness of a bundle of newspaper compared with the diminutive arm of the 8-year-old newsboy who clutches it. If some of the shock of these images escape us now, it is only because the camera has made us witnesses to far worse atrocities in the intervening years. But nothing takes away from the pioneering quality of Hine's achievement. Andrea Barnet",2000-06-18T05:00:00+0000

Coach, the New York City leather company, introduced the Manhattan Small Ottoman, above, in January last year and in May of last year, Interieurs, a Manhattan shop, brought out its bamboo armoire, right. Although Celia Tejada, vice president of product design at Pottery Barn, knew of Coach's and Interieurs' designs, she said, ''We were absolutely not influenced by Coach, and we were not inspired by Interieurs.'' The pieces merely extended the company's line of furniture, she said. Heidi Harvey, an intellectual property lawyer at Fish & Richardson, a Boston law firm, said, ''You can make designs that are similar, but you can't go so far as to confuse the public between the original high-end design, and the second, mass market design.'' How do they differ? A Pottery Barn Cube 19 1/2 by 19 1/2 by 17 1/2 inches in brown cow leather costs $399. Coach's Ottoman (18 by 18 by 15) starts at $990 and comes in seven leather treatments. Pottery Barn's mass-produced bamboo armoire (43 inches wide, 70 inches tall) is $1,450, Interieurs' handmade bamboo, maple and steel armoire (48 inches wide, 67 inches tall) is $10,970.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FOWLE, PHYLLIS L.","FOWLE-Phyllis L. Propp, 92, a retired lawyer and lieutenant-colonel in the Army Reserve, died June 22. In 1944 she was the first woman officer in the Army Judge Advocate's Generals Corps. The JAG cited her for this in April 1999 at a banquet at its school in Charlottesville, VA at which she was guest of honor. Later that year, the American Bar Association's Commission on Women in the Profession awarded her its Trailblazer certificate. She was born in Laurel, IA on the farm of her father, Henry J. Propp and his second wife Martha Knoble Propp. She grew up in nearby Marshalltown where she graduated from its high school. She graduated in 1930 from the University of Iowa and received her J.D. from its law college in 1933. After practicing in Mason City, she entered the Federal civil service in the regional office of the Farm Credit Admistration in Omaha, and later at the Federal Land Bank. Active in democratic politics, Miss Propp also served on the board of the Omaha Urban League. When Congress established what became the Women's Army Corps in May 1942, she was an original volunteer. She was commissioned after completing its OTC course at Fort Des Moines to which she returned early in 1944 as a captain and Post Judge Advocate and was formally detailed in the JAG in May 1944. In January 1945 she was assigned to the JAG office at General Dwight D. Eisenhower's European Command in Paris. Shortly after the German surrender, she was promoted to major and moved with the headquarters to Frankfurt, Germany and later to Heidelberg. In 1947 she left active duty as a lieutenant-colonel but continued the same work heading the civil affairs section as a civilian. She resigned from this post in the summer of 1951. In November she was married to Farnsworth Fowle, then a New York Times correspondent in Germany. After a year in London, they returned to the United States and settled in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Continuing in the Army Reserve, Mrs. Fowle was admitted on motion to the New York Bar and established a solo law practice in midtown Manhattan. She served on the Bronx and city boards of the YWCA. She was a past president of the former Riverdale Committee on Intergroup Relations, the local chapter of the United Nations Association and the Villa Charlotte Bronte cooperative. Survivors include her husband; her nieces Charlotte Gaden of Waterloo, IA, Grace Bluck of Preston, MN, Esther Schmidt of Newton, IA, Phyllis Gaddis of Portland, OR and Marjorie Tuomi of Clatskanie, OR and two nephews Myron Lorenzen of Waterloo, and David Bollhoefer of Newton.

There he stood pensively in front of a strange 1899 painting depicting a monk assisting crippled, naked boys on crutches at the ocean. The picture, originally titled ''Children of Pleasure'' and then renamed ''Sad Inheritance,'' was unusual for several reasons. Its subject was not a sacred one but rather a moralizing tale of children afflicted with syphilis, a portrayal of Christian charity, an example of both church propaganda and the way religious themes were secularized in the late 19th century.

Yet he wrote in 1890, ''What impassions me most -- much, much more than all the rest of my metier -- is the portrait, the modern portrait.'' The lavishly illustrated VAN GOGH FACE TO FACE: The Portraits (Thames and Hudson, $50) traces the development of the artist's self-expression in his portraits. Unlike his contemporaries John Singer Sargent and Gustav Klimt, van Gogh was concerned with conveying larger human truths through portraiture. His intense religious feelings, as well as his straitened personal circumstances, drew him first to the poor and downtrodden as subjects of his paintings, but those anonymous figures also served as shorthand for a range of sociological types. Intimate though a portrait might be, in the end it was a portrayal of a class rather than an individual. Even his self-portraits are so many character sketches: van Gogh as worker, bourgeois or bohemian. The self-portraits in particular reveal his roots in the work of the Dutch Old Masters, but as the essays in this volume explain, van Gogh could not have gained his command of color without exposure to the French Impressionists. It was the synthesis of those influences that leads Joseph J. Rishel, a curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, to assert, ''The modern portrait begins with van Gogh.'' He himself summed up the effect of his work best when he wrote in June 1890, a month before his suicide, ''I would like to make portraits that a century later might appear to people of the time like apparitions.''

Opponents called the complex too large, too expensive and too invasive on the rural character of the town. Town officials said the vote had the biggest turnout for a referendum in recent history.

Where the Little Prince religiously tends his planet, his creator was a champion procrastinator. (If the wreckage found off the coast of Marseille this spring, weeks before Saint-Exupery's centennial, proves to be that of his lost World War II airplane, it will be one of the first occasions on which he has turned up on time.)

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; West Is More East,"Meera Syal's smart, sprightly second novel, LIFE ISN'T ALL HA HA HEE HEE (New Press, $22.95), begins with an Indian wedding procession down a snowy London street. Dowdy Chila is marrying the dashing and worldly bachelor Deepak, who has chosen her precisely because she is so dowdy -- and plump, compliant and traditional. He has decided he is through with ''snappy witty women with low-fat bodies and high-maintenance demands.'' Chila's oldest friends, Tania and Sunita, are understandably a little worried for her. The book is about how these three childhood companions struggle to move between the cloistered, samosa-nibbling world of their parents and freewheeling contemporary London. Chila, at first, appears to have it easiest. Prone to deferential giggling, she seems content to stay at home and organize her spices. Sunita is in a tougher spot: a onetime campus feminist, she can't understand how she became an overweight and depressed mother of two, stuck in a sexless, surprisingly traditional Indian marriage. Beautiful, provocative Tania lives with an English boyfriend and works as a documentary filmmaker. But she is perpetually restless and at war with her past. The story revolves around a film Tania makes about love and marriage among Indians in England, using her friends as subjects. The film reveals the fissures in their lives -- and her own. Syal is a television actress who has written extensively for the screen, and while her new novel veers occasionally into melodrama, it is gossipy, funny and thoroughly entertaining.

Even though we were from Verona and the Pilgrim was in rival Cedar Grove territory, we made a beeline for the place most weekends. We'd sit for hours in the worn-out booths, depositing quarter after quarter in the table-side jukeboxes and singing along with Bon Jovi. Since there was a $2 minimum per person, we would always order something -- maybe French fries with mozzarella and gravy, a Pilgrim staple -- and then scrape together whatever money was left for a tip. We graduated from high school in 1995. Since then, although it still welcomes students in search of a late-night snack, the Pilgrim has graduated from diner to restaurant. When the Diakos family took over several years ago, they had the place gutted, and when it reopened after a year of renovations, almost nothing was the same. The tableside jukeboxes are gone and the menu is far different. Instead of the usual greasy-spoon fare, it now includes such cuisine as wraps named after rap artists (get it?). For $7.95, you can order a Tupac, for example, a Southwestern-style wrap filled with grilled chicken, refried beans, jalapeno peppers, guacamole, cheddar cheese, salsa and Spanish rice. Or, if you're a vegetarian, you might consider the Queen Latifah ($6.95), which includes zucchini, carrots, avocados, red and green peppers, onions and tomatoes; it is complemented by rice and beans. There is filet mignon ($17.95) too, and twin lobster tails ($24.95). Which is not to say that diner staples like hamburgers ($4.95 for a deluxe with lettuce, tomato and French fries) are not available. There's still a $2 miminum, and hungry students can still order fries with cheese and gravy ($4.50). And those students can still play Bon Jovi tunes, but only on one large jukebox, so everyone can hear, and it they want to, sing along. SARAH TREFFINGER",2000-06-25T05:00:00+0000

Stage roles included ''Strange Interlude,'' with Glenda Jackson, ''Look Homeward, Angel'' with Anthony Perkins, and ''A Matter of Gravity'' with Katharine Hepburn. Early radio days brought her fame in soaps from which she transfered to television soaps and became famous playing ''Myra'' in ''All My Children'' for over five years.

In 1966 the store moved to 23rd and Collins, with Buddy Hackett and Alan King cutting the opening ribbon.

They are served in a cup, and you spoon them up like breakfast cereal. The sensation is a little odd, since they lack the softly melting surface of a scoop of ice cream. I can't imagine a rippled flavor like vanilla-fudge or caramel swirl being satisfying in this form, but for crunchy Oreo cookie it's just fine.

Internationally recognized as a pioneer of organ transplants and transplantation immunology, Dr. Reemtsma's contributions have had a profound influence in medical education, research and clinical care. He established one of the leading heart transplant programs in the world and co-founded one of the first programs to bioengineer artificial organs. Dr. Reemtsma was the first to show that non-human organs could successfully be transplanted into humans and was devoted to finding a cure for diabetes through the transplantation of islet cells. Dr. Reemtsma received his surgical training at Columbia University and later returned as Chairman of the Department of Surgery in 1971. He was a trusted advisor to generations of medical students and faculty. A long time friend and colleague whose many contributions enriched the field of medicine, he will be greatly missed and his memory cherished.

Now, neighborhood residents are making themselves at home by sipping coffee and bringing their toddlers to play. The landscape architect Thomas Balsley, whose specialty is remedying unsuccessful urban plazas, and the developer Rose Associates, reprogrammed the plaza into a park, adding a small lawn (above), a sheltered play area and a coffee kiosk with smart aluminum tables and chairs. A Greenmarket draws shoppers to the park twice a week. ''It's a fresh perspective on what public open space could be,'' said Mr. Balsley, after whom the revamped space is named. The backdrop of Balsley Park is green corrugated metal walls (left). ''This is an escape from the grid of the city,'' Mr. Balsley said.

Ted leaves a grieving family: Carole, his wife of 45 years, his son William and daughter Emily, his sister Joanne Kaufman, and her family, his son-in-law Arthur McGrath, and daughter-in-law Caroline Kenner, and his grandchildren, Sam, Sophie and Dylan.

Among his many activities, Ted provided funding for researchers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health to examine ways to discourage adolescent smoking, and for the study of pharmaceutical public relations at the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy. He is the author or co-author of five books, including ''A User's Guide to Bypass Surgery'' (1996), ''How to Be Heard: Making the Media Work for You'' (1974) which was reissued as ''Publicity'' (1985), ''The Father's Book'' (1970) and ''Nine Months to Go'' (1956).
