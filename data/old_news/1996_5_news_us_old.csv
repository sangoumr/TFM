us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Master of Space,"Frank Stella first caught the attention of the New York art world in 1958, at the age of 22, when his austere ""black paintings"" marked him as an uncompromising, inventive artist. At 34, Mr. Stella had his first retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. Both talented and well connected, Mr. Stella got himself included in the canon of American abstraction with precocious speed. Although his later works -- huge, multipart metallic constructions replete with gaudily colored French curves and graffitilike brushstrokes -- are now most visible as fixtures of corporate lobby art, Mr. Stella has secured a legacy as a masterly interpreter of space, someone who pushed the boundaries of painting. This kind of achievement merits more than the treatment it receives in FRANK STELLA: An Illustrated Biography (Rizzoli, $75). Sidney Guberman, an artist and Mr. Stella's classmate at Princeton, is diligent about quoting from the best of what has been previously written about his subject, neither cowed by nor dismissive of what has gone before. But from a close friend -- and well past the halfway mark of Mr. Stella's career -- we expect something extra. Mr. Guberman has plenty of anecdotes from the time he has spent with Mr. Stella over the years, but most of them are not very illuminating. He is at his best when he addresses the art directly, as in his explanations of the relatively complicated working techniques that Mr. Stella used to make his irregular frames and surfaces of serious sculptural depth.

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Short Takes,"As an alternative to those trivial compendiums of literary opening passages sold near bookstore cash registers, how about a collection of last lines from Gina Berriault's very short stories, WOMEN IN THEIR BEDS: New and Selected Stories (Counterpoint, P.O. Box 65793, Washington, D.C. 20035, $25)? Consider this stand-alone triumph: ""He lay facedown under the tree and bit off some grass near the roots, chewing to distract his smile, but it would not give in, and so he lay there the entire day, smiling into the earth."" Or: ""She heard his breath take over for him and, in that secretive way the sleeper knows nothing about, carry on his life."" Ms. Berriault is nothing if not consistent. In these 35 stories, one struggles to find a sentence that is anything less than jewel-box perfect. And the author uses her gift for language to do more than show us the world through her characters' eyes; we are also forced to think about it from their point of view -- no small feat for someone who favors third-person narration. These are complex characters, and although many stories run only a few pages Ms. Berriault never falls back on cliches: an aging male librarian, for example, is no shrinking violet; instead, he sports ""a Borsalino fedora"" and ""English boots John Major would covet."" Most of Ms. Berriault's characters are caught at moments of divergence: in ""Soul and Money,"" a lapsed Communist confronts God and Mammon in Las Vegas; in ""Lives of the Saints,"" the son of a famous religious artist undertakes his own sort of pilgrimage, visiting his father's works, and discovers that life is more lasting than art. Yet in the smooth flow of Ms. Berriault's writing, few of these people manage to register the emotional pitch needed to transcend their crises. It is not a matter of stoicism; instead, most seem dizzyingly unaware of the option to act on their own behalf. Thus the stories, so exquisite to wend through, leave one a little cold. Like their characters, they seem trapped by the perfection of Ms. Berriault's prose. Tobin Harshaw",1996-05-05T05:00:00+0000

Eight new schools in the current five-year plan would be affected, for which $400,000 has been earmarked, said Michele Cohen, director of the Board of Education's art program.

He walked these streets in Washington Square."" As Warren spoke, he smiled with a sort of fierce exultation, and the class was under way. He read some sentences aloud from James's novel ""Washington Square,"" and told us to notice the adverbs. Warren didn't mangle a sentence with analysis, but rather urged us to ""get it,"" and savor the richness of Jamesian implication.

But while Mr. Wegman's subjects, being Weimaraners, look mostly soulful, doleful or moderately embarrassed, Vivian Olausen, a housewife now in her 70's, can personify any affect you can name. And what a game gal she is! In MOTHER (Penguin Studio, $24.95), she allows herself to be dressed up in frumpy housedresses and ratty furs, bedraggled hats and hideous wigs, and, in more than 50 deliriously funny pictures, submitted to any number of indignities. There is a program here: many of the images are a commentary on the lot of women in the 1950's, a period when, Ms. Olausen believes, depressed housewives dragged themselves to the cocktail cabinet or medicine chest for relief (see ""Mother's Little Helpers,"" with Mother spaced out on Valium). Mrs. Olausen, on the other hand, remembers the decade as one in which she had fun pottering around the house and entertaining, and everyone drank (see ""Mother as Enabler""). But while the pictures of Mother carrying a huge wooden cross through the supermarket or chained to an ironing board or, best of all, in pink baby-doll pajamas and marabou mules (pace Marabel Morgan) make a feminist point, others transcend dogma to attain an almost Monty Pythonesque lunacy. Only consider ""Mommy Deer,"" in which Mrs. Olausen, antlered and befurred, is tied to the roof of a car. Worth noting, too, that the car is a Plymouth Volare, one of a vast number of authentic, and frequently covetable, props and artifacts that repay careful study. (Remember Ike buttons? Cookie jars in the shape of French poodles? Paint-by-numbers sets?) Pass this book around among your friends, and watch them have conniptions. Sarah Ferrell",1996-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Evelina Galang's stirring debut collection of stories, HER WILD AMERICAN SELF (Coffee House Press, paper, $12.95). Whether the person asking is a bystander at a bus stop, a school classmate wrinkling her nose at the smell of a box lunch of rice and fish, or a film director known for his sleazy attitude toward Asian women, none are satisfied when the answer turns out to be Michigan, Wisconsin or New York. But if the ignorance and insensitivity of strangers is borne with graceful yet sarcastic humor, the pressures of home -- under the zealous gaze of parents eager for their daughters to partake of the ""land of opportunity"" -- yield a frustrated, rebellious sadness. In ""Miss Teenage Sampaguita,"" a visiting aunt observes her brother's tyrannical hold on her niece, who is expected to become a doctor and is deprived of everyday pleasures like the right to date or even talk on the telephone. And in ""Talk to Me, Milagros,"" a silent child watches as her lawyer father, recently arrived from the Philippines, is reduced to working as a busboy in a diner. While a number of Ms. Galang's stories lack a certain dynamic force, all are told in an elegant, mesmerizing style. The finest, ""Filming Sausage,"" is sharp with tension, while the brief, chantlike monologues that frame the collection are as lyrical as prayers. Abby Frucht",1996-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Yes, sir, scrapping the gasoline tax. That's the sort of leadership America needs; that's the sort of spirit of sacrifice the country's been missing: a President who's ready to sacrifice the budget, to sacrifice the environment, to sacrifice energy conservation, to sacrifice oil reserves in order to save the American people 4.3 cents a gallon. And when Mr. Dole's sidekick Dick Armey, the House majority leader, suggested that we consider cutting the education budget to make up for the lost gas-tax revenue, well, then and there I knew I was a Dole man. I mean, cutting education to save Americans a few pennies a gallon at a time when their gas is already the cheapest in the world -- that's the kind of thinking that will keep us the world's most competitive nation in the 21st century.

The daughter of Johnny Cash, she released her first album in 1979 and was immediately recognized as one of country music's freshest singer-songwriters. Those familiar with her much-publicized private life (her marriage to the country star Rodney Crowell, which ended in divorce four years ago, was tabloid manna) will spot bits and pieces of it scattered throughout her first collection of stories and sketches, BODIES OF WATER (Hyperion, $19.95), some of which reads more like autobiography than fiction. But there is no angry score-settling in this pensive book, which takes as its subject the landmarks of a woman's life: love, marriage, childbirth, disillusion, renewal. Unusually for a lyricist, Ms. Cash has a straightforward, sharp-eyed prose style (""I was 22 years old, and my feet were a little too big for my body. . . . I had two cats -- a serious mistake -- as I had been looking for an image and thought they might help"") and, despite a few awkwardly self-conscious patches, her first book reads like the work of a far more experienced writer. This is not ""celebrity"" fiction: it is a collection of stories that happens to have been written by a celebrity, and it is very good. Terry Teachout",1996-05-19T05:00:00+0000

I placed no value on looks. Having not had this rite of passage explained to me, I hadn't a clue that beauty was the prerequisite to adolescent stardom. Certainly, this new longing for boys had made me awkward in their presence; but I had noticed that they were awkward, too. Accustomed to being chosen first for any team of girls, I didn't question success that night, couldn't remember failure, so carefully had I buried nursery angers under trophies of recent accomplishments. I'm sure I was prepared to solve any hesitancy the boys might have in approaching us girls by taking the initiative myself. Assuming responsibility was who I was. In recent years my life had been a great adventure, in which there had been no comparisons made to my mother and sister. In my mind, they were boring in their tedious arguing over my sister's looks and her evenings with boys. ",1996-05-19T05:00:00+0000

It said the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Direct Access Diagnostics could sell its Confide kit at clinics and pharmacies and other stores. The company said that after a trial run beginning next month in Texas and Florida it would market the kit nationwide early next year. People using it are to anonymously mail blood samples to a laboratory and use a special code to get the results by phone a week later. Federal health experts estimate that up to a million Americans are infected with the virus, HIV-1, but studies suggest that fewer than 20 percent have been tested.

us,At Sea The Hawaiian Way,"IN approximately 400 A.D., waa kaulua, or double-hulled sailing craft, took Polynesian settlers, their domestic animals and staple plants from the South Pacific to Hawaii. For the last 20 years, the study and painstaking reconstruction of these traditional canoes has come to symbolize the revival of Hawaiian culture. This resurgence is widely apparent, from museum programs on the history and revival of Polynesian voyaging, music and crafts, to viewings of traditional canoes and a five-month schedule of outrigger races. There have been four ""voyages of rediscovery,"" sponsored by Hawaii's Polynesian Voyaging Society, to prove that Hawaii was settled, not by accidental drifting from South America but through an advanced science of celestial navigation. The seminal voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti and back in 1976, was that of Hokulea (Arcturus, or Star of Joy), designed after traditional craft and built from modern materials. In the most recent expedition, in 1995, the Hokulea sailed in record time from Hawaii to Tahiti and Micronesia, accompanied by two new canoes, the Hawaiiloa and the Makalii (the Pleiades).",1996-05-26T05:00:00+0000

In spite of his opposition, though, the House, after a two-month battle, voted last week to lift the wage to $5.15 from $4.25.

Something between an indentured servant and an adopted daughter, Catherwood is eventually married off to Gabriel Lyte, who takes her across the Atlantic to a world ""fresh and curious"" that appears to be ""just league after league of woods and swamp and wild river."" Feeling herself ""the newest of all created things,"" the young woman confronts her new home, outside Albany, with a keen eye for the ""lovely-fierce"" sensuousness of nature. Then one day she and her infant daughter become lost in the wilderness, and for months they wander about, trying to find their way. Through her harrowing ordeal, Catherwood learns to divest herself of sentiment and fear, including the fear of ""man judgment,"" until she comes to understand that there are ""many roads through wilderness, many paths to the city."" In describing this process, Ms. Youmans's language is trenchant, graceful and, in places, sumptuously archaic, filled with a richness that provides more than just period color. Her prodigious powers of description render with acuity both small moments and large: the sea crossing, childbirth, snowfall, the slitting of a fawn's throat, the ""rammish"" stench of a trapper. Ms. Youmans has written a subtle, intelligent novel about one of the most enduring issues in the American experiment: how to embrace ""the world and God"" as ""better"" than men dream.

But their eerie realism was so startling to audiences a century ago that their viewing often incited panic. In FROM PEEP SHOW TO PALACE: The Birth of American Film (Columbia University, $29.50), David Robinson, a film historian, provides a diligent overview from the moment cinema was just a flicker in a magic lantern to the golden years between 1893 and 1913, when scientists and technicians laboriously fitted together the ""pieces in a puzzle"" and created feature films. Mr. Robinson's chronology is painstakingly thorough, if at times tedious, and he dissects the various stages of motion picture development with scholarly zeal. His portrayals of the great cinematic innovators Thomas Edison, the Lumiere brothers and Georges Melies provide some vivid accounts of publicity mongering, patent wrangling and ego interference as the race for notoriety accelerated. But, finally, the book seems to need a slightly more humorous approach to a subject brimming with pratfalls, and leaves the casual reader craving more anecdotes about the personalities that catapulted the entertainment into the pre-eminent American art form.

The dispute started in July, shortly after Luxottica Group of Italy bought U.S. Shoe for $1.3 billion, largely for its Lenscrafters eyeglasses chain. Nine West, which is based in Stamford, Conn., already had an agreement with U.S. Shoe to buy its footwear group for $600 million. After the purchase closed, Nine West said it was owed $105 million because of a balance sheet discrepancy. Luxottica, meanwhile, contended that Nine West owed it $10 million. Under the settlement, U.S. Shoe plans to pay $25 million to Nine West, while Nine West plans to buy back $67.5 million worth of the 3.7 million common stock warrants it had issued to U.S. Shoe.
