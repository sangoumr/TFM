us,"Peter Hujars Photographs, Curated by Elton John","Though not a duet, Elton Johns latest project is a harmony of sorts. An avid collector of black-and-white photography, the singer has handpicked 50 Peter Hujar prints for an exhibition at San Franciscos Fraenkel Gallery. Opening next week, Peter Hujar curated by Elton John showcases the photographers breadth of subjects, which range from seascapes to beefcake to pets. Id long wanted to invite a formidable guest curator to dig into Hujars work, says Jeffrey Fraenkel, whos represented the artists estate since the early 2000s. I came up with about a half dozen names, mostly writers and visual artists, but the idea of Elton seemed unbeatable. Besides the fact that John has acquired 15 works by Hujar since 2011, the union made emotional sense to Fraenkel. Hujars work focused on the [queer] cultural scene, male erotica and other issues that overlap with Eltons interests, says Fraenkel. Hujar is perhaps best known for his images of members of the cultural vanguard of 1970s and 80s New York  among them Fran Lebowitz, Susan Sontag and David Wojnarowicz, who was Hujars partner. John made a point of choosing some of the photographers less-seen portraits, including those variously depicting a young Stevie Wonder, a middle-aged Peggy Lee and the Warhol acolyte Jackie Curtis in her open casket. The show doesnt shy away from the tough pictures about illness or death, which are main components of Hujars work, says Fraenkel. Hujar himself died of complications from AIDS in 1987. Fittingly, all proceeds from the shows first two sales will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation. On view from Sept. 8 through Oct. 22, fraenkelgallery.com.",2022-09-01T13:00:16+0000

us,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,"Watching Seth A Smiths debut feature is a grueling experience. But since Tin Can is a hybrid of science fiction and body horror, consider this praise. The film begins with the news that an untreatable disease dubbed Coral is spreading uncontrollably, covering the afflicted in Cronenbergian growths that look like creepy white plastic grafted onto flesh. Just as the scientist Fret (Anna Hopkins, The Expanse) has a breakthrough in her search for a cure, she is knocked out and wakes up, after an indeterminate amount of time, hooked to various tubes in a small capsule. Shot almost entirely in punishing close-ups, the scene might trigger oppressive claustrophobia in some viewers. Not that the rest of the movie pulls away all that much. Smith complements the suffocating visuals with an elaborate sound design involving an anxiety-inducing assortment of squeaks, gurgles, moans, whispers, whimpers and clangs that makeTin Can well worth watching with headphones. Explanations are dispensed in a slow drip  the idea of rich people getting themselves put under until Coral can be controlled is all too credible  but the movie succeeds as a medical nightmare come to life.",2022-09-02T14:00:04+0000

Together with James Joyces equally groundbreaking experimental novel Ulysses, which appeared at the same moment, The Waste Land seemed to epitomize the radical new brand of art and literature that would come to be known as modernism; as Eliots friend Ezra Pound put it, the poem felt like the justification of our modern experiment since 1900. Even those who disliked it recognized the poems enormous significance and influence  the American poet William Carlos Williams, who viewed Eliots poetic project as the antithesis of his own, later lamented that The Waste Land wiped out our world as if an atom bomb had been dropped upon it.",2022-09-02T17:31:32+0000

Such opulence was not uncommon for the time, but whats noteworthy is that these scenes were cast not in stone but in butter.

Instead, the designer has lent his eye for color and print to Orior, the Irish design studio and furniture manufacturer. Ive always loved creating work that toes the line between ostentatious and pragmatic, he says. I think theres something really exciting about bringing that fantasy into the real world and seeing how people interpret it in their everyday lives. This four-piece offering of distinctive chairs certainly delights in that tension: Rogerss gradient dot print, which brightened street style this spring, highlights the joyful sweep of a wingback chair the designer chose for his own home, while a duo of graphic black-and-white prints originally paired on an evening gown bring a mod mood to a chair inspired by 1960s Scandinavian style. The collaboration is rooted in the mutual admiration between Rogers and Oriors creative director, Ciaran McGuigan, who initially met at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Orior remains a family- and friends-run company, says McGuigan (his parents, Brian and Rosie McGuigan, founded the brand in 1979), so it means everything to us to have partnered with Christopher in this way. Bringing an additional facet of community is the fact that all proceeds from the collection will be donated directly to grass-roots organizations identified with the support of Color for Change, whose work uplifts and supports the Black community.

The Paralympic athlete and double amputee Aimee Mullins appeared in the show wearing a pair of intricately hand-carved ash legs designed by McQueen, who also paraded his signature bumsters and cutaway coats through the dimly lit warehouse. For the finale, the model Shalom Harlow walked out in a papery muslin dress with a billowing underskirt of white tulle and a belted chest harness  and then stood on a revolving wooden turntable, like a music box figurine, between two ominous-looking mechanical robots shipped in from an Italian car factory. They engaged with her in an eerie, menacing dance, and then began shooting paint at her, covering her dress with black-and-neon yellow graffiti. Harlow, who trained as a ballet dancer in her youth, flailed her arms as she spun around. And when they were finished, she later recalled, they sort of receded and I walked, almost staggered, up to the audience and splayed myself in front of them with complete abandon and surrender. The performance  like High Moon (1991), the Rebecca Horn installation that inspired it, of two rotating guns shooting red liquid at each other  was provocative and operatic, exactly the kind of spectacle that made McQueens shows so exhilarating to watch.",2022-09-15T14:00:16+0000

An impasse in bargaining brought workers to the brink of a strike that could have started as soon as Friday, with far-reaching consequences for the already mangled supply chain as well as inflation and Amtrak service. The main sticking points had to do with scheduling and sick time: Labor groups were asking that workers be allowed to see a doctor or attend to a personal matter without risking disciplinary action. White House officials got involved in trying to bring the two sides to a deal both because of the economic impact of a work stoppage and the political impact on President Biden and his party before the midterm elections. Martin J. Walsh, the Labor secretary, helped broker the tentative agreement, which gives workers one additional paid day off and the ability to go to medical appointments without penalty, labor unions said. It still needs to be ratified by union members  a process that could take weeks  but workers have agreed not to strike while the votes are tallied.",2022-09-18T11:00:06+0000

Purchased by Businaros grandfather in 1924, when it was already near derelict, the house was used for agricultural storage, its only residents farm tools, surplus grain and dormice for decades, except for a brief stint during World War II. Still, determined to transform it into a family home, Businaro uprooted his wife, Lucia, and their three sons from Padua, and moved in the following year. Federico, the middle child, now 58, remembers that initially they slept all together in the one room whose ceiling didnt leak; Lucia cooked their meals on a camping stove. Built in 1627 for Francesco Giovanni Tassello, a prosperous doctor, IlPalazzetto stands at the center of a 50-acre estate of fertile farmland. An 8,600-square-foot cube with a red clay-tile roof and ivy-covered tan plaster facade, the house is a so-called minor villa, yet Tassello clearly had major ambitions: Above the trompe loeil columns and doorways that decorate the 20-foot-high walls of the salon on the second floor, a ribbon of frescoes depict scenes from Virgils Aeneid.

us,A Gold Necklace Fit for a Pharaoh,"The gold collar is an ancient form of adornment; around the third millennium B.C., the Egyptian hieroglyph for the word gold itself took the form of a necklace that was bold, broad and suited for a pharaoh. Designers at the Parisian haute jeweler Van Cleef & Arpels, which has been headquartered in the same space on Place Vendme since 1906, became fascinated with such antiquities after the British archaeologist Howard Carter unearthed King Tutankhamens tomb in 1922. In the years since, the house has produced many Egyptian revival works, including 1947s thick gold Wave necklace punctuated with small diamonds. This newest homage, featuring an asymmetrical spray of stones that seem to defy gravity as they cling to the necklaces convex surface, is made with a proprietary tool developed in the 1960s to create a textured relief on each articulated section. While modern techniques may render a monumental piece of this nature both more delicate and more comfortable to wear than those the pharaohs coveted, the impression remains one of supreme elegance.

us,A Renaissance for the Italian Rainbow Cookie,"After working for three decades with gold and oxidized silver, the Brooklyn-based artist and jewelry maker Darcy Miro experienced a revelation with a fistful of clay during a visit to a Fort Greene ceramics studio in 2019. So many years of burning myself and getting metal shards stuck in my feet and my hands  and then I felt the clay, she says. The sensuality was unparalleled. Miro, 49, bought her own kiln shortly after and started making small ceramic pieces, then moved on to bigger and bigger ones. The result is an exuberant debut collection of furniture that includes a desk bearing a sculpted hand; a sofa covered with polka-dot ring- and pretzel-shaped pottery and upholstered in ethically sourced alpaca fur; and a coral-inspired vase with protruding eyeballs. While shes no longer solely focused on producing metal cuffs and rings, Miro wants her furniture to feel every bit as precious as her jewelry. If you can have one thing and you love art, she says, well, maybe that thing is also a desk. So now you have art and a desk.  Gillian Brassil",2022-09-22T13:00:12+0000

But now, a bustling, trimmed-down version of the market by Mr. Seetoh and Urbanspace has made its debut in Midtown Manhattan, with 17 vendors, 11 of which come from Singapore. Mr. Seetoh selected them all. There had to be a cross-section of Chinese, Indonesian, Malay, Nonya, Filipino and Singapore stalls, he said. There is even what Mr. Seetoh calls Singapore-Western food, like the curries sold at a spot called Smokin Joe. A few stalls, like Lady Wong for Indonesian sweets, are based in New York. There are also several halal vendors, Mamaks Corner with Indian noodles, and Padi dNYC for Singapore Malaysian fare. A big bar anchors the 51st Street end of the market. A highlight, Mr. Seetoh said, is Wok & Staple from Dragon Phoenix in Singapore, said to have originated chile crab. Its all fast but not fast food, he said. Its made to order.

Goldberg, a native New Yorker, lives in New Jersey, in a gated community previously inhabited by Thomas Edison and the Colgate family, of toothpaste fame, which means her garden is measured not in yards but in acres. In the greenhouse there was a pineapple plant, grown from cutting off the top of the fruit; around the corner were the vegetables  tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants. Not that she eats them, she said, but theyre nice to have around. In one corner of the yard, flowers in Crayola shades grew next to a small sign: Emmas Garden, named for her mother. Clusters of grapes dripped from gnarled vines, and garden gnomes stood watch all over the place. As we meandered, I joked that I felt as if I were in the Garden of Eden, and I asked her if she ever felt like God. Well, yeah, she responded matter-of-factly, but Ive played God so often that its sort of understandable that I would. ",2022-09-28T09:00:31+0000

An exercise in louche minimalism, it was perfect for a couple  with a leather pad for seating on the cement floor and rigid, Donald Judd-esque plywood dining chairs  but hardly right for a family. Once they had a child, they moved into a post-and-beam midcentury tree fort, as the pair called it, with a hollow barn door that separated the living space from their babys room, preventing them from ever throwing dinner parties. So in 2019, when they purchased a 1950s ranch-style property in the Eastside neighborhood of Eagle Rock, the first goal, says Breer, who was pregnant with her second child during the renovation, was to get our kids bedrooms as far away as possible so that we can live our lives at night.",2022-09-28T11:00:14+0000

Even now, at 82, the Italian-born, New York-based polymath continues to rage with the force of a Technicolor tornado. Among his recent objects is this resin triptych screen, an abstract depiction of Manhattans high-rises with a fiery red sun on the horizon. Like much of Pesces work, which often combines spiky sociopolitical commentary with Dadaesque brio, the room divider is audacious, colorful and definitely not minimalist. Its a companion piece to his blobby 1980 Tramonto a New York sofa, which evokes the titular metropolis with foam-filled armrests as skyscrapers and a stuffed scarlet sun backrest. At the time he made it, he was concerned that the city had lost its ability to inspire, roiled as it was by recession and crime. In resurfacing the skyline motif, Pesce strikes a hopeful note, reminding us that misery tends to be transitory. I thought of the screen as not only functional but also an expression of positivity and optimism for a better world in the future, he says.

Officially, the sanctuary  home to snow leopards and what may be the last couple of hundred hanguls (Kashmir stags) in the world  is closed when night falls.

But Is It a Force for Good?,"In 2002, Martin Elling, along with three colleagues at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company, published an article in the firms quarterly journal intended to gin up more business from the pharmaceutical industry. Ellings article argued that drug companies were missing an opportunity by not tracking how often individual physicians were prescribing certain drugs. By aggregating such data, pharmaceutical salespeople could target their marketing pitches to the doctors most likely to become heavy prescribers, and the sales reps themselves could also be better evaluated by their companies. Soon enough, a relatively unknown drug company called Purdue Pharma came calling, retaining McKinsey in 2004 to help increase sales of its opioid pain killer OxyContin  which had already topped $1 billion annually. In the face of a worsening national opioid addiction crisis and multiple state and federal investigations, prescriptions of higher-strength OxyContin pills had begun to level off. Among other recommendations, McKinsey, led by Elling and his team, suggested turbocharging sales through more innovative and aggressive marketing tactics. Between 2004 and 2019, Purdue paid McKinsey $83.7 million in fees.",2022-09-29T13:00:07+0000

In 2001, when the German designer Tomas Maier arrived as the brands creative director, the fashion industry was at the height of It bag mania and the accompanying obsession with monograms, flashy hardware and other embellishments.

The film perhaps clinched the association between the two-tone wristwatch and the decadence and materialism of the era  Richard Gere also wore one to play a corporate raider in Pretty Woman (1990)  but now, decades on, the accessory has re-emerged with designs that are a reminder of the styles playful and subtle possibilities.

The Bell & Ross BR 05, shown here in black steel and gold, has the brands signature silhouette  a circular dial on a rounded square  but in this iteration, the contrast between the charcoal, rose and silver sheens grants it a bold sophistication. The Breitling Chronomat B01 42 is more muted in its mix of materials but no less impactful: The red gold on the bezel is also used for the crown and pushers and neatly adorn the strap, giving small flashes of color as it moves  a flourish that can elevate any outfit.",2022-09-30T13:00:05+0000

As far as I could tell, there is no historical, cultural, or sociopolitical reason for its period setting, which has no significant bearing on the themes, characters or plot; it doesnt even strengthen the films relationship to its most obvious influence, The Exorcist, which came out in 1973. In any case, the 80s, in this movies conception, are nothing more than a nebulous composite of vaguely evocative signifiers: big hairdos, fluorescent tracksuits, Trapper Keepers, and an old hit by Tiffany or Rockwell on the soundtrack every few minutes. I suppose as long as Stranger Things continues to be popular, were going to see a lot more like this.",2022-09-30T15:00:02+0000

us,Five Science Fiction Movies to Stream Now,"The movie Butt Boy was fairly divisive when it came out a couple of years ago, but the least you can say is that the director Tyler Cornack fully committed to the story of a man who becomes obsessed with  lets just say the title was pretty descriptive. Now Cornack is confirming the warped singularity of his vision with Tiny Cinema, an anthology of six stand-alone shorts that straddle the line between sci-fi, horror and comedy. (The movie derived from the Tiny Cinema videos Cornack has been posting online.) What links the chapters, as they are called, is the sense that the characters are stuck in nightmares that have their own comically horrific  or horrifically comic  absurdist logic. A common setup is to take a word or an expression literally and see what happens, as in Game Night, where Bert (Austin Lewis) becomes obsessed with the sentence Thats what she said, and the chapter with an unprintable title referring to a common insult. Few movies have described some single peoples desperation to find their soul mate as economically as Edna, in which the title character (Olivia Herman) starts dating a corpse she found floating in a river. Despite its tight duration, Edna even manages a hilarious second act. Cornack balances storytelling economy with an expansive approach  a rare feat.",2022-09-30T16:00:09+0000
