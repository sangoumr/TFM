The Atlanta-based musician, lead singer of the popular indie rock band Deerhunter and mastermind behind the more esoteric solo project Atlas Sound, is tall and lanky and moves with a long, excited gait thanks to a genetic condition of the connective tissue called Marfan Syndrome. Hes gone through wild periods of provocation involving onstage cross-dressing and fake blood. Hes written song lyrics inspired by subversive Dennis Cooper novels. Spending time with him is a roller coaster ride that sweeps those around him up through various random-seeming whims and high-strung emotions. Despite all of this, or more likely because of all this, he is prolific with at least eleven albums and EPs to his name since 2005. His latest album, Parallax, released under his solo moniker, further proves Coxs lo-fi genius, showcasing his deftness at weaving multilayered lyrics through harmonizing electronic tones and across undulating beats to create catchy but complex pop songs. Its worth noting that the albums title refers to the optical effect wherein our perceptions of various objects relative positions depend on our distance from them  if you drive down a highway, the tree line whizzes past while faraway objects like the sun barely move at all. Its one of those facts in nature that seems intuitive and yet, upon examination, gets quite confusing quite fast. The same can be said of Coxs songs. Here we present an exclusive stream of the complete Parallax album (out next week, Nov. 8, from 4AD), along with a few words from Cox explaining the meaning of and inspiration behind four of his favorite songs  explanations he offers in his own signature fashion, without making any distinction between the technical, musical, literary or lyrical aspects of his work.",2011-11-02T13:00:28+0000

us,Long Live the Pixies,"So I happened to be in Portland, Me., last night, attending a concert by the Pixies at the State Theater. The bands frontman, alternatively known as Black Francis and Frank Black, has said that these reunion shows are purely about cashing in on the bands indie-rock credibility. However, having now seen them live, I can tell you that this is not the whole story. They simply played too well, and were too obviously moved by the unconditional love of the crowd, which cheered as vociferously for the B-sides as for the singles. Frank howled as ferociously as ever, and it was inspiring to see Kim Deal, the bass player, in such apparently sound mental and physical health. This I did not expect. In 2002, a story in this magazine by Ethan Smith detailed the problems, personal and otherwise, she had making a record for her other band, the Breeders. It included this memorable exchange between Kim and her twin sister, Kelley, who had been in and out of the band a few times:",2011-11-02T22:42:30+0000

Mr. Shields found a lonely talkative octogenarian who had scores to settle and a reputation that badly needed restoring. Vonnegut had once told Martin Amis that the only way he could regain credit for his early work, those books from the 1950s and 1960s once so beloved by college kids, would be to die. He died on April 11, 2007, less than a year after Mr. Shields first approached him. And the two did not spend much time together. But Vonnegut gave the go-ahead that has allowed Mr. Shields to construct And So It Goes, an incisive, gossipy page-turner of a biography, even if its hard to tell just how authorized this book really is. Denied permission to quote from Vonneguts letters, Mr. Shields relies on paraphrases and patchwork to create a seamless-sounding account.

Currently, Pakistan admits fewer than 2,000 types of Indian products. Both countries have said they want to more than double trade between them, to $6 billion a year. Consumers in Pakistan are likely to benefit more from the change, gaining access to more and cheaper Indian goods. Pakistani businesses will likely face stiffer competition, especially in auto parts, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods. Policy makers also hope the move encourages progress on other trade issues, like Indias product-quality standards, which Pakistan says inhibit its exports. ",2011-11-03T15:51:47+0000

The pop diva has been touring without a break since early June, performing nearly 60 concerts on three continents to promote her album Loud (Def Jam). A concert promoter for Live Nation in Sweden, Kristofer Akesson, told the Associated Press that Rihanna, who is 23, is exhausted and doesnt feel well. Her publicist in New York said she was suffering from the flu. The singer called off a concert in Malmo in southern Sweden on Monday, and sent a photograph of her arm with the tube from an intravenous drip to her followers on Twitter with a note saying, Sorry Malmo!!! She was not hospitalized as some news outlets reported. She performed Tuesday night in Stockholm, then called off a second performance on Wednesday night after consulting with a doctor.Rihanna joins several high-profile performers who have cancelled major concerts for health reasons this year, among them Adele, who is undergoing surgery to repair bleeding in her vocal chords, Taylor Swift, who had a bout of laryngitis, and Caleb Followill, the lead singer for Kings of Leon, who cancelled half his bands tour to rest his voice. Rihannas decision to cancel two shows came as her single, We Found Love, featuring Calvin Harris, rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. It was the 11th No. 1 single she has recorded, giving her the same number as Whitney Houston and more top singles than Stevie Wonder or Janet Jackson.",2011-11-03T19:28:57+0000

Each year at the time of the fair, Eyck switches gears from curator to editor by selecting a different designer with whom he delves into a traditional material and craft. Past explorations have yielded flax rope furniture and lighting by Christien Meindertsma, brightly colored striped woolen blankets and pillows by Scholten & Baijings, and pewter objects by Studio Job. For Schwarm, he worked with the German artists Beate Reinheimer and Ulrike Rehm, known as RaR, who are fascinated with the dizzying diversity of the animal kingdom, particularly among insects. To wit, Schwarm features 10 different shapes, or genuses, and 63 species, each with a different glaze. They are being sold as a limited-edition set or individually, for the less entomologically inclined. For more information, go to thomaseyck.com. ",2011-11-03T20:00:35+0000

Among the most significant are former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfelds Known and Unknown and former Vice President Dick Cheneys In My Time, memoirs by perhaps the two most important figures (other than the president) in the years of terrorism and war. Both books have received mostly negative reviews  largely deserved. Rumsfelds book is dense and bloated, although modestly candid.

The first volume of the biography hed wanted Forster to write  which made the blacking-factory episode public  appeared in 1872, two years after Dickens died at the age of 58, and its successors keep coming.

The government is also closing embassies in East Timor and Iran, he said. The Vatican withdrew its ambassador to Ireland in July after an Irish government report said the Vatican had discouraged bishops from reporting cases of sexual abuse to the police, a charge the Vatican rejects.

I loved the information that those photographs contained, he recalled, and visualizing what life was like at those points in time. Mallea was invited to Havana to give a presentation on his research, which led to more talks, and before he knew it, the architect had a book contract. He made eight trips in all, accompanied by his partner in life and in the firm M(Group), the interior designer Carey Maloney, who served as a stylist  but only in a manner of speaking, given what Mallea called the almost guerrilla-style photography of the book.

us,"After a Soaring Career, Joan Didion Considers Her Final Approach","Joan Didions new book, Blue Nights  the phrase refers to the long summer twilights in the Northeast, where she lives  is her first title in more than half a decade, and the waiting audience has never been as large. For years, Didion has stood as something of a literary beacon, guiding other writers through the chancy straits of narrative reporting. It was not until she published The Year of Magical Thinking in 2005, though, that her work became a signal light to travelers along the mainstream too. Magical Thinking narrated the unexpected death of her husband, John Gregory Dunne, through the rhythms of obsessive memory. Blue Nights takes a similar approach. The books chief subject is Didions daughter, Quintana, who died in 2005 after a long hospitalization, but the account ranges across several decades, scrutinizing memory fragments and details for clues foreshadowing Quintanas death. Didion dwells on her own ailments as well  she was 75 at the time of the writing and a victim of shingles, an aneurysm, neuropathy and a mysterious blackout  and although none of this territory is new, her account is sharp and unsettling in the alchemic proportions fans have come to expect. Reading Didion today, more than ever, means submitting almost fully to the strange authority of the voice on the page.",2011-11-04T16:35:57+0000

It had a thunderous canned-orchestra melody, like an endless loop of some bombastic moment from Wagner or Danny Elfman; a sternum-rattling bass line; and skittering electronic percussion that brought to mind artillery fire. When the track was finished, he e-mailed it to a rapper named Waka Flocka Flame. Luger had recently spent a few months in Atlanta with Waka, sequestered in a basement, producing most of the music for Wakas debut album. Waka had asked him for one more beat, one that could potentially be the albums first single.",2011-11-04T16:37:58+0000

In the foyer, a turn-of-the-century painting of a bourgeois Swedish interior hangs beneath one of Isamu Noguchis oversize paper lanterns, and underfoot is a colorful mid-20th-century rug by Barbro Nilsson for the renowned Swedish workshop MMF. Under a midcentury nude painted by Birger Ljungquist, Gustafsons great-uncle, sits a simple 1950s stool by the Swedish designer Carl Malmsten. Walk through an angled doorway into the living room, a high-ceilinged space with the graceful proportions and architectural ornament typical of late-19th-century buildings, and the mix gets even richer. An upholstered 19th-century Swedish bench along the window and a group of slipper chairs, all from Gustafsons family, blend easily with sheepskin-covered wood chairs designed in the 1930s by Bruno Mathsson and tables by Josef Frank. Vases by Scandinavian Modern ceramics masters like Axel Salto and Berndt Friberg are clustered atop a traditional tiled fireplace, and the immaculate plaster walls (which are painted, aptly enough, Stockholm White) are hung with Gustafsons spare, elegant watercolors. Venture into the apartments long corridor, however, and youll find up-to-the-minute bathrooms and a sunny, south-facing kitchen in which crisp, utilitarian cabinets provide a clean backdrop for an antique wooden table and chairs.

The savagery of the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan may have culled the global population by about 11 percent; two bloody upheavals in China  the An Lushan Rebellion and the collapse of the Xin Dynasty  each may have felled about 6 percent of humanity. Those are but 3 of the 100 worst atrocities in history, as cataloged by Matthew White in The Great Big Book of Horrible Things, an amusing (really) account of the murderous ways of despots, slave traders, blundering royals, gladiators and assorted hordes. Estimating the tolls from such horrors is an inexact science, given wars nature and the mysteries of antiquity. The deadliest multicides are more plentiful in recent centuries, given that there were more people to kill and better ways to kill them on a grand scale.

With sympathy  for the individual, not his deeds  it portrays a 20th-century titan who, with secrets and bullets, a will to power and the self-promotional skills of a true star, built a citadel of information in which he burrowed deep.",2011-11-08T20:53:27+0000

Mr. Chvez, left, who said he had surgery in June to remove a malignant tumor, said he would invite President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil; her predecessor, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who began treatment for throat cancer late last month; and President Fernando Lugo of Paraguay. There will be no cancer or force that can hold us back because Latin America is experiencing a rebirth, Mr. Chvez told Venezuelan state television on Sunday.

us,TransCanada Shuts Pipeline After Troubles With Power," The company proposing a controversial oil pipeline that would stretch from Canada to the Gulf Coast had a related pipeline shut down twice this week after it experienced power problems. The company, TransCanada, said that its Keystone pipeline, which runs from Alberta to Cushing, Okla., went down for three hours on Tuesday after a Canadian utility that powers the pipeline dealt with shortages. It shut it down again on Tuesday night to inspect equipment, but restarted it on Wednesday morning after finding nothing amiss, the company said. Nothing was related to the safety of the pipeline or compromised the safety of the pipeline in any way, a company spokesman said. The interruptions were ill timed for TransCanada, which is in the midst of a bitter battle over whether its proposed Keystone XL line will be approved by the State Department. Opponents of the pipeline, which would carry Canadian oil sands crude, are increasing efforts to have it rejected or rerouted amid concerns that a spill could damage the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska. And the State Departments inspector general agreed this week to look into assertions that an environmental review of the project was mishandled by the State Department because it was conducted by a company with financial ties to TransCanada.

us,Lounge Act | Moss and Maharam,"Talk about a makeover. Among the latest offerings at the SoHo design mecca Moss is this pair of vintage Eames Lounge Chairs, which Murray Moss decided to re-cover in Hella Jongeriuss Repeat Dot fabric from Maharam. The chairs (which have been manufactured by Herman Miller since 1956) have a built-in pedigree because theyre made with Brazilian rosewood veneer, the material that was originally specified by Charles and Ray Eames, but which was discontinued in 1992 when Brazilian rosewood landed on the endangered species list. Jongeriuss eye-popping fabric, however, is what really makes them  it takes a design icon from the Mad Men era and catapults it into the 21st century. (As with many Moss creations, these dont come cheap: the chairs are $16,000 each, or $30,000 for the pair.) Theyre just the first (or first two) in a planned series of one-off furniture pieces on which Moss and Maharam will collaborate. And for a glimpse of what other designs Maharam might bring to the project, see Maharam Agenda (Lars Mller Publishers), a new book on the innovative textile company by Michael Maharam, who has run the family-owned business with his brother, Stephen, since 1997. The book not only describes the brothers risk-taking design agenda, but it looks like an agenda, too, complete with a soft cover (an embroidered design by Jongerius) and woven bookmark  a tip-off right there that this isnt going to be your average corporate coffee-table book.",2011-11-10T14:00:59+0000

Charlotte Rampling, 65 years old and un-retouched (both on screen and in real life), is one of them. The daughter of a British colonel and NATO commander, Rampling attended tony girls schools in France and England. She modeled briefly, before trying films, and burst onto the scene in Georgy Girl (1966), in which she played a flirt who is the embodiment of Swinging London. Today, after five decades on screen (including a star turn in Viscontis classic, The Damned), and modeling for everyone from Helmut Newton to Juergen Teller, Ramplings career shows no signs of abating. In The Mill and the Cross (currently in theaters), the Polish director Lech Majewskis visually ravishing examination of a Breugel painting, she takes on the Virgin Mary; in Melancholia (opening Friday), the bad-boy Danish director Lars von Triers latest, her character is based upon von Triers despised mother. And in the fashion world, Rampling continues to inspire: Marc Jacobs designed much of his fall 2011 collection for Louis Vuitton after her role in The Night Porter (1974), Liliana Calvanis controversial, S&M-infused drama about a death-camp survivors affair with a Nazi officer (think: leather caps and suspenders).",2011-11-10T20:00:08+0000

The video, A Fire in My Belly, is again stirring up objections, this time from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, which objects to a sequence that shows ants crawling over a crucifix. The Brooklyn Museum plans to restore the video to the traveling Hide/Seek exhibition, which is scheduled to run there from next Friday through Feb. 12. Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio wrote to John Tamagni, the chairman of the museums board, about a month ago, requesting that the video be eliminated from the show, said Stefanie Gutierrez, the dioceses press secretary. Arnold Lehman, the director of the Brooklyn Museum, said the correspondence was private, but that he believed Mr. Tamagni had responded by assuring the bishop that nothing in the exhibition was meant to be offensive. Hide/Seek, which focuses on issues of sexual identity and gender, includes 67 artists and more than 100 works, Mr. Lehman added, saying the letter explained that we were reproducing the exhibition that was at the National Portrait Gallery as originally intended by curators. Before he died of complications from AIDS in 1992, Mr. Wojnarowicz testified in court about the video during a previous controversy and said he was thinking of how Jesus took on the suffering of the world. I wanted to make a symbol that would show that he would take on the suffering of the vast amounts of addiction that I saw on the streets, he said. And I did this because I saw very little treatment available for people who had this illness.",2011-11-10T22:59:58+0000

The team has lost two straight games, prompting the usual hand-wringing about eras ending and la belle poque coming to a melancholy fin. We have now endured over a half-decade of laments about how a team that routinely wins 11 to 16 games per year is not what it used to be, simultaneously criticizing Bill Belichick for his recent personnel decisions and genuflecting before the altar of his past accomplishments. No wonder otherwise sane people ardently root against this team.The Patriots need to prolong their dramatic swoon to William Shatner lengths, coupled with the usual noisy Jets chest thumping, has turned this into the most torturously overblown rivalry in the N.F.L. Unless you are a lifelong Jets or Patriots fan, you feel you have been clamped to your seat, eyelids taped open, neck immobilized and forced to watch. Its less a battle of two great teams (both are highly flawed this season) than a battle of attention hounds of differing styles. The Jets should win easily  the Patriots have only one starting-caliber cornerback to handle three very good Jets receivers  but let us again bid fond farewell to the glorious Patriots conversations that will dominate the following week make it almost not worth the trouble.

Curious readers may take this as a cue to flip ahead to Page 164, which is where (according to the Euclidean formula Cody graciously provides) the golden ratio falls in his own narrative. There they will find Cody on the verge of death, joined at his hospital bedside by his mother and the emotionally unstable pain management doctor who is about to become, disastrously, his girlfriend. They will find, in other words, the throttle shoved all the way forward. The resulting G-force of sex and death and insanity  and also, improbably, of music and math and modernist poetry  is the only evidence you need that for all its seeming formlessness, [Sic] is in fact as artfully constructed as a Tarantino film.",2011-11-11T17:46:02+0000

But he missed an equally important and extremely troubling part of the equation: cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to state budgets mean that even when we have medicines and vaccines, we arent in a position to get them to Americans quickly. Federal support for preparedness has been gutted, dropping 37 percent since fiscal year 2005, and state and local health departments have cut an estimated 44,000 workers between 2008 and 2010. After Sept. 11 and anthrax, we built up biodefense capabilities, but were moving backward. When the next tragedy strikes, we will not be ready.

His newest book, Uncanny Valley: Adventures in the Narrative (Counterpoint Press), collects pieces, previously published in Artforum, The New Yorker, Wired and elsewhere, about such disparate subjects as digital animators and human-rights monitors, but which are connected by the kind of distinct, inimitable narrative thread only Weschler can weave.

Judge Paul P. Biebel Jr. said that although the men had initially confessed in great detail, DNA recovered from semen in the victims body cast significant doubt on the confessions. DNA testing shortly after the murder excluded all four men. And last May, the DNA was matched to another suspect, Johnny Douglas, who had been convicted of a very similar rape and murder.

Intrigued, you will investigate further. And you will learn that McKenzie, a native New Zealander, had a three-second role as a nameless elf in Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring in 2001. (His father, Peter McKenzie, is a part-time actor who played a larger role in the film, as the human Elendil.) Furthermore, a sharp-eyed Israeli woman spotted the then-not-famous McKenzie and, smitten by his elfin beauty, dubbed him Figwit. (Its an acronym for Frodo Is Great . . . Who Is That?!?? which she claims is a more or less accurate transcription of her original reaction to seeing the elf.) This woman then established a Web site, Figwitlives.net, dedicated to all things Figwittian. There were local news stories. There were roving bands of Tolkienites that trailed McKenzie to Conchords shows. There was even a tongue-in-cheek documentary created in part by McKenzies girlfriend (now his wife), Hannah Clarke, which contains this quote from Ian McKellen when asked about Figwit: I do remember there were some very attractive young girls. Which one was he? McKenzie explains the Figwit phenomenon like this: My brother was also an extra. Basically all tall and skinny New Zealanders were elves in the film.",2011-11-17T17:56:37+0000

An exhibition that opened in Vienna yesterday, and that will later travel to Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris, features a selection from Van Notens spring 2012 collection alongside photographs by the London-born artist James Reeve that inspired them. Among the pieces are Reeves photo of buildings in La Rouviere, a housing complex in Marseille, and the shirt that Van Noten applied it to. I liked the mystery, the lights at night, the moment of wonder, where youre questioning whats happening on the other side of the windows, says Van Noten of the image. Reeve, too, considers the picture quite voyeuristic. Its like 1,000 small colorful television screens all lined up in rows on the hillside, he says. I have often seen people peering into the windows, trying to discover what kind of activity is going on inside. Other pieces on view with their corresponding photographs include Van Notens bridge shift and Circus, Circus top. Im used to seeing my work as two-dimensional, Reeve says. It was inspiring to see Dries translate it into dynamic forms  the way the ruffle skirts seem to almost play with the lights as they move, the colored crystals that he sewed into the windows of La Rouviere.

The Port Authority, which is responsible for the construction, has stopped approving new contracts, slowing work on the underground museum, which was to open on Sept. 11. The organizations have been arguing over the money for nearly 18 months, and tensions rose recently as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has sought to exert more control over construction projects in the city. Last month Mr. Cuomo nominated one of his deputies, Patrick Foye, to run the Port Authority and asked the agency to take over the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a joint city and state enterprise that has been working on the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center Foundation, whose chairman is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has maintained that poor management and delays by the Port Authority between 2006 and 2008 cost it more than $100 million. The delay in approving construction contracts was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday. Michael Frazier, the foundations communications director, said Monday, We are working with the leadership of the Port Authority to come to an immediate resolution that allows this historic project to move forward. Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said, Were working cooperatively with New York City and the memorial foundation and that work is continuing.",2011-11-21T23:37:21+0000

Cardinal Law, the first United States bishop to step down in the scandal, that began in Boston and spread nationwide. He was accused in hundreds of lawsuits of moving around priests known to have abused children and not reporting the abuse to the police. Victims had criticized the Vatican for having given Cardinal Law the post at St. Mary Major and for allowing him to serve on a Vatican committee that appoints bishops.

All you need to know about Arsenal, which has won five Premier League matches in a row, and has dragged itself all the way from 19th after three matches up to seventh, level on points with Chelsea and Liverpool above them, is defined by the winning goal Robin van Persie scored in Saturdays match at Norwich. Aaron Ramsey won the ball in midfield and was tripped, ending up on his stomach. Alex Song, who had an otherwise desultory, wasteful match, hurdled the prone Ramsey and advanced rapidly. He had Gervinho, streaking alone on the left, and van Persie, between two defenders on the right. He twitched, almost passing the ball to Gervinho, the lively Ivoirian who had already missed three sitters in the match, then changed his tune, rotated his body to pick out van Persie, who touched once, ran into space, and on his second touch lifted the ball over John Ruddy with his right foot, his weaker one, and just inside the near post.",2011-11-22T20:00:29+0000

Prime Minister Franois Fillon of France signed an extradition order for Mr. Noriega, 77, earlier this year, but a date of departure has not been determined, officials said. Panamanian courts have convicted Mr. Noriega in absentia in connection with the killing of political opponents, as well as on charges of embezzlement and corruption. He faces three 20-year prison terms in Panama, which he ruled from 1983 until 1989, when he was ousted by an American invasion. Convicted in a United States court in 1992 on charges including drug trafficking, Mr. Noriega was imprisoned in Florida before his extradition to France last year. A French judge sentenced him to seven years in prison on charges that he laundered $3 million in Colombian drug money through international banks and into French accounts in the late 1980s. The Panamanian president, Ricardo Martinelli, has vowed that Mr. Noriega will serve his Panamanian sentences in prison, and not under house arrest, despite his age and reported ill health, according to The Associated Press. The A.P. also quoted Mr. Noriega as telling the court through an interpreter: I want to return to Panama and prove my innocence. ",2011-11-24T02:07:24+0000

us,So Much Depends,"William CARLOS WILLIAMS was a furious poetic revolutionary  furiously working over a lifetime to reinvent American poetry, furious at poetry he considered backward, and at critics and editors who didnt get it. To many, including me, he was the greatest poet of the 20th century. Unlike Eliot and Pound, two of his rivals in importance, he refused to be an expatriate. When Pound wrote him from overseas, urging Williams to leave America, Williams incorporated the advice into a brutally terse and powerful poem in praise of staying home. He spent virtually all his life in Rutherford, N.J., close to the American voices that enthralled him. He was determined to make them the basis of a new poetic diction, one that has hugely influenced American poets and poetries since. Its not too much to say he was our Dante, making a distinctively American language out of slang, jokes, complaints and rants. Williams did this by endlessly reworking heavily enjambed line breaks and stanza breaks in exquisitely casual and deceptively ordinary poems  a red wheelbarrow shining after a rainstorm, a fire engine tearing through city streets, a woman whose body is covered with moles. He did this alone, and largely ignored by the mediocre stars of American literary life. His capacious, rigorously humane work has a delicacy of ear that hasnt yet been surpassed. All this, and poetry was his night job  his days were spent as hardworking Dr. Williams of North Jersey. ",2011-11-25T15:00:26+0000

The study of Western civilization, which dominated American education after World War II, has long been under attack, and is increasingly hard to find in our schools and colleges. When it is treated at all, the West is maligned because of its history of slavery and imperialism, an alleged addiction to war and its exclusion of women and nonwhites from its rights and privileges.

When you eat sugars, your body gets an initial surge of energy, your body scrambles to process it, and then you crash, Lipman says about sugar, a depression-linked carbohydrate. This process triggers the body to crave more sugar, and a vicious cycle of craving, eating and crashing begins. Sounds alarmingly familiar, eh? On the bright side, Lipman does promote a lot of sleep to combat sugar cravings around the holidays.

Patterson was chairman of the J. Walter Thompson ad agency for six years, and you can just see him scrutinizing that old couple in their flannel pajamas: how do I reach both of them? For Patterson, the answer since 2001 has been to write (or co-write) romances as well as the action-packed thrillers that made him famous. And its worked. In June 2008, Patterson scored simultaneous best sellers with the suspense novel Sail and the romance Sundays at Tiffanys. This week he does it again, as Kill Alex Cross, the latest entry in his signature detective series, storms the hardcover fiction list at No. 1, and his romance novel The Christmas Wedding holds strong at No. 9 in its fifth week.",2011-11-25T16:52:33+0000

The two pension plans, one for musicians and the other for staff members, cover about 200 people. Some musicians are likely to have their pensions reduced after the takeover. Although the governments Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures defined-benefit pensions, its insurance is limited. In the past symphony orchestras competed for and retained top talent by promising generous pensions, so musicians with many years in the Philadelphia Orchestra probably have earned benefits above the insurance limit. The orchestra, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, had asked for the governments help with its pensions, saying that it could not raise money if donors thought their dollars might end up in a troubled pension fund. The pension funds are set up in a way that makes the orchestra bear all the investment risk.

People love certain aspects of different polishes, Ferber says, pointing out that some of her customers choose Essie because it lasts the longest, while others rave about Chanels color choices. It became about how to meld the best of everything into one product, Ilyinsky says. After months of research in the field, the duo nailed their first six shades, which are named after streets in downtown Manhattan. A bright blue polish called Commerce was inspired by the West Village street where Ferbers clothing boutique, Mick Margo, is located. Church is a burnt red alternative to Wicked (a popular Essie shade), and Reade, a metallic charcoal, was named for the salons home base. With its five-free formula (no formaldehyde resin, camphor, formaldehyde, toluene or dibutyl phthalate) and easy-to-hold brush (the salons technicians work from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., so a little attention to ergonomic detail was in order), this new polish deserves a big hand.",2011-11-30T17:47:34+0000
