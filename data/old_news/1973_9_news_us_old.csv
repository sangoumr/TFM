At my neighborhood religious bookshop (which I do not visit religiously) I found exactly three titles by a man whose writing was so prodigious that even his official bibliographer had to despair of ever listing it all. Perhaps his monument is patinaed with obsolescence now, spattered with the pigeon droppings of indifference. But his critical biographiesnotably of Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson  surely still stand. One might expect him to be buoyed back into favor on the cur gious revivalism among the young; but its preliterate aspects do not favor Chesterton, a most literate man. Glossolalia was not his bag: his best writings are aglimmer with paradox and aphorism and wit; his prose rings in the air like Chinese wind chimes. He was conservative and orthodox but certainly not a Biblethumping Fundamentalist. Indeed, in Orthodoxy he confesses that what brought him to religion was not pious writings but rather the effusions of such skeptics as Darwin, Spencer, Nietzche, Shaw et al.",1973-09-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Another in the 'Slaughter' Series:The Cast,"""Slaughter's Big Ripoff"" belongs to the class of movie that seems to offer itself for judgment in terms of body count, quarts of gore expended, variety of weaponry, number of panes of glass shattered, excellence in portrayal of death throes and destruction of automobiles.It tempts the viewer to subtract points for a flaccid thigh on a bikinied extra in the background or a bald tread on the tire of a car sinking under water after hurtling off a cliff with the hero and his girl inside.For what counts is the surface of things and by no means their substance. On the level of relationship to reality, inner logic, nuance of character and even sufficient morality to distinguish the good guys from the bad (except in the realm of drugs, which Jim Brown, as Slaughter, deftly spurns) such movies as these make no pretense toward achievement.But even within its own terms, as latter-day cinema of sheer entertainment concocted out of conspicuous violence, facile sex, with-it locales and a theme of vengeance pitting a loner against the mob and crooked cops, ""Slaughter's Big Ripoff"" must be adjudged third-rate.It has the conceit to virtually ignore its hero's pastsomething of an affront to those who did not see ""Slaughter,"" the first in what promises to be a series of these filmsand the willingness to sacrifice its pacing to a long, aimless scene of Jim Brown's driving through the night while the mandatory rock tune performed by the singer James Brown takes over.As the story of how Slaughter wreaks vengeance on Duncan (Ed McMahon), the mob boss whose killer missed Slaughter while doing in some of Slaughter's friends, ""Slaughter's Big Ripoff"" falls short of inventiveness of plot and originality of style, but Richard Williams, as a pimp named Joe Creole, does seem to be having himself a good time.""Slaughter's Big Ripoff"" opened yesterday at the Cinerama and 86th Street Twin II theaters.",1973-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Dracula himself would have been no exception. It was thus during the early years of this century that one of Dracula's bastard sons made his way to Japan, liked it, settled down.""He settled into a tatty old Transylvanian castle smack in the middle of modern Japan, near a lake called Fujimi, which is the Lake of Dracula, which is the title of a new movie directed by Michio Yamamoto and released by Toho. It opened yesterday at the Elgin.If the idea of a Japanese vampire movie seems intriguing, ""Lake of Dracula"" leaves that idea all but untouched. The actors are Japanese, but the clothes, the conventions, the architecture  especially the architecture  are all carried over from the West. I've never seen such a movie for creaking doors, footsteps on the stairs and all the other paraphernalia that have so much to do with shock and so little to do with the deeper and more delightful forms of terror.Dracula himselfactually the great-grandson of Dracula, victim of some particularly goofy sort of curse that produces vampires only every third generationis almost pure animal. He doesn't seduce; he growls. His eyes light up like bicycle reflectors  which I think they possibly are.Akiko (Midori Fujita), the girl he wants to get his teeth into, is at the same time chased by the vampire and accused of paranoia by her fianc (Choei Takahashi), a young physician who reduces every fear to Freud.Between the predator and his prey there stands nothing much except some tangled forest, a thunderstorm and the previously mentioned doors and stairways. It is as if the whole mystique of repulsive attraction were being reduced to a collection of studio props.

The tensions persisting throughout the century between politics and art, high and popular culture, urban fantasies and provincial realities, public and private painting all came to the fore, most notably in the confrontations over Courbet's pictures at the 1851 Salon. The social history of 19thcentury painting has up to now been bedeviled by simplistic critical theories, and has produced few studies that really matter. This book (which the publishers have unnecessarily split into two thin volumes) on the period by Timothy Clark, an English art historian at the Camberwell School of Art, London, may indicate that this situation is about to change. He is a critic committed to the left, and a very good one for a change, acute on theoretical problems and exceptionally knowledgeable. Luckily for us, he is also a delightful writer who evidently loves painting, a subtle and witty reader of texts and pictures, a critic both daring and modest.",1973-09-02T05:00:00+0000

After all, the unexpected is the rule of the sea, be it weather or chance encounters with people. There was another attraction, too. The Lermontov was inaugurating transAtlantic service between New York and Leningrad. Until she made her series of three voyages from Manhattan's Pier 40 this summer (trips she will repeat next year) there had not been a regularly scheduled passenger service between the United States and the Soviet Union for 25 years.

To an American actor, a playwright's growth and reputation are matters for the playwright himself to take care of. The writer's early struggles, and experimental reaches, are no part of the star performer's business. Let the young fellow learn his trade, fight his battles, rise majesticallyand aloneto the top of his form, and then the star may very well think of favoring him by appearing in his newest piece. It had better be good, and right for the particular star, of course. If, a year later, the writer slips slightly off form, no phone call from him is likely ever to reach the performer again. His obligation, if any, has ceased. This is all rather silly, considering that without the playwright the actor really has nothing to keep his trade alive, but, in general, it's the way things are here.",1973-09-09T05:00:00+0000

Not that an Englishman needs to go to America to become acquainted with its various brands of spoken English. In 1929, as I well remember, millions of British cinemagoers saw The Singing Fool and caught those blatantly accurate and chillingly portentous words of Al Jolson (words enshrined in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations): You ain't heard nothin yet, folks. Indeed we had not, but from that moment on we heard a great deal. All the urban and rural dialects of the Union flowed back, on Vitaphone disk or sound track, to the country which had, so long ago, given birth to them. By the time the G.I.'s shambled into England in the nineteenforties (their boots made no noise, which was a delicate gesture), Anthony Burgess, the British writer, is currently at work on a novel about Napoleon. all the pertly gumchewing shopgirls were ready to do an authentic Southern drawl or Brooklynese singsong, according to what was required. Since the war, that particular gift of tongues has been taken away from the British go and hear London's version of The Front Pagebut, by God, the Paraclete was fluttering away madly in those days of earnest fraternization. The present position seems to be that Englishmen and Americans tolerate at all. Aitchlessness is not just a mark of lowerclass British speech (vide My Fair Lady); it is to be found among the conservative aristocracy (the chairman of the board of governors of the school where I taught, Lord Saye and Sele, always said, Thought we were goin ome when he found that a governors meeting was by no means yet finished); it was general in all British speech up to the 19th century.

For most of half a century until his death in 1971 he occupied a unique position on the inner fringe of American public life, powerfully influencing both the domestic and foreign policy of every Democratic Administration from Roosevelt through Lyndon Johnson. An acerbic, intense, arrogant man of small stature and immense vanity, he cultivated enemies almost as easily as friends.

Zanuck exploited so successfully in ""The Longest Day,"" and then virtually annihilated in the boredom of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""The film covers a period of approximately one year, beginning in the summer of 1944, when the Japanese high command decided to prepare the island for possible American invasion, and following through the invasion itself and the terrible hill-by-hill, cave-by-cave fighting that came after. Kihachi Okamoto, the director, uses some old newsreel clips (which become wildly distorted by the CinemaScope lens) and efficiently restages most key scenes, though in rather more massive detail than a nonmilitary student may be interested in.The most curious thing about the film is its difficult-to-define point of view. It seems to have reservations about the miltary men who denied adequate protection to Okinawa, and it seems to be very pro-Okinawa, one-third of whose population was slain in the fighting.Yet ""Battle of Okinawa"" gets so wrapped up in showing examples of the terrorthe slaughter of soldiers and the mass suicides of civiliansthat the spectacle of the carnage overwhelms any pity.

Even the stillimportant checks and plaids, no matter how im pressively sized, have a relaxed elegance. Witness, at left, the blockplaided jacket with a stitchedlook overpane.

us,Film: 'Retour d'Afrique':Tanner Work Explores Boredom in Geneva The Cast,"Movies about people in the dead-center of boredom are usually difficult to sit through. Boredom is contagious. It is the Asian flu of the arts. Given half a chance, it leaps off the screen to ravage the audience. At $3 to $5 a ticket, it is cheaper to stay home to search for flyspecks on the ceiling of a room that has not seen a fly in years.Alain Tanner, the Swiss director of ""CharlesDead or Alive"" and, most notably, ""La Salamandre,"" makes films about people who come perilously close to that numbing, anesthetizing dead-center, but escape it, not always for their own good. This is the source of Tanner's comedy, which, in his new film, ""Le Retour d'Afrique,"" is intelligent, humane and just a tiny bit irrelevant, at least to someone who does not share the feeling that he is being overwhelmed by the boredom of life in Switzerland today.Vincent (Franois Marthouret) and his wife Franoise, (Josee Destoop) are young, in love with each other, and thoroughly fed up with their roles as witnesses to great endeavors in other parts of the world, more specifically, the Third World. They live quite comfortably in Geneva, where he works as a gardener and she as an attendant in an art gallery. At night they go to movies with their friends and afterward have ponderous discussions about film, its meaning and its mission. But Vincent and Franois don't want to watch. They want to do.At last Vincent comes to a decision: They must either have a baby or immigrate to Algeria, which is the nearest Third World country they can reach (and the only one where they have a friend to help them get settled). Since Franoise flatly refuses to have a baby, they make preparations for Algeria. They give up their jobs, sell their car and their furniture, and say good-by to their friends, only to have their contact in Algeria cable them at the last minute not to come, that things are not working out there.""La Retour d'Afrique"" (Return from Africa) is about the emotional return of Vincent and Franoise to Geneva after spending two weeks holed up in their empty apartment as ersatz exiles, hiding from their friends to whom Vincent had grandly explained their emigration by saying: ""I don't want to suffocate in my own fat.""Much more, perhaps, than Tanner realizes, ""Le Retour d'Afrique"" is a very Swiss sort of movie. It has no great highs or lows. It is efficient, and it keeps wanting to be funnier than Tanner can quite allow it to be, as if the natural high spirits of Vincent and Franoise would somehow diminish their importance.Far from diminishing their importance, the few scenes in which we see Vincent and Franoise behaving with something on the order of exuberance give them and the film a striking identity. Otherwise, ""Le Retour d'Afrique"" is too muted, too gray, like the photography that was apparently designed to make Geneva look like the world's dullest suburb that Tanner thinks it is.The performances are attractive, especially those of Miss Destoop, who has a lot of the quality of Cher Buono, when Cher plays it straight, and of Juliet Berto, as a moody and funny Spanish exile in Switzerland.I suspect that the principal problem with ""Le Retour d'Afrique"" is its screenplay, which Tanner wrote himself. It is never strong enough to prevent the boredom and futility experienced by Vincent and Franoise from seeping into the experience of watching the film. It opened yesterday at the 8th Street Playhouse.",1973-09-17T05:00:00+0000

Furie, the Canadian-born director who made a couple of good, concise films early in his career (""The Leather Boys,"" ""The Ipcress File""), now seems to be turning out movies as if they were yard goods. His ""Lady Sings the Blues,"" which had the good fortune to star Diana Ross, ran almost two and a half hours and still never got around to telling the real story of Billie Holiday.His new film, ""Hit!"", is a caper movies that was apparently designed as escapist entertainment, though by the time it enters its third hour you may well think you've been trapped. It isn't easy to leave a movie after you've invested that much time and money in it, no matter how foolish it is. You have a right to know how it turns out.""Hit!"" has a screenplay credited to Alan R. Trustman (""The Thomas Crown Affair"") and David M. Wolf, but it looks very much like the sort of movie that was made up as it went along to match its landscapes (Los Angeles, Seattle, Marseilles).The story, for what it's worth, is about a black Federal agent (Billy Dee Williams) who, after his teenage daughter is killed by drugs, takes it upon himself to recruit, finance, train and transport to France a small band of private American citizens willing to assassinate the nine leaders of a Marseilles drug syndicate.Although the movie is about order outside law, it lacks even the offensive political purpose of something like Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry."" It's a movie out for kicks, but the kicks are so implausible, so humorless, so without redeeming style and wit, that to sit through it is to give oneself a false low. In addition to Williams, the cast includes Richard Pryor, Gwen Welles, Paul Hampton, Warren Kemmerling, Janet Brandt and Sid Melton, who are the members of Williams's very unlikely gang. Miss Brandt and Melton, for example, play a nice little old Jewish couple who go along on the assassination trip as a way of thanking Uncle Sam for giving them a second chance. Miss Brandt slices the throat of her victim. Melton shoots his two targets in the chest and face.""Hit!"" opened yesterday at the Loews State 2 and Orpheum Theaters.",1973-09-19T05:00:00+0000

This casual treatment is unfortunate since De Palma (""Greetings,"" ""Hi, Mom"") is a very funny filmmaker. He's most funny, so far, anyway, when he's most anarchic, and ""Get to Know Your Rabbit,"" though somewhat inhibited by conventional form, has enough hilarrious loose ends and sidetracks to liberate the film from its form.In outline, it's the story of a nice, clean-cut market analyst named Donald Beeman (Tom Smothers), who one day walks out of his office in the Los Angeles headquarters of Servo-Temp, Inc., to be a tap-dancing magician. It's Donald's aim to become perfectly seedy, which doesn't amuse his girl very much, especially when he comes home with the rabbit that's been issued to him at class. ""It doesn't suit you,"" she says crossly, and then remembers how nice he looked with his attach case colored burnt umber.Donald's path to Perfect Seediness is littered with lunatics, some more desperate than others, like the airline, pilot who, before each flight, climbs to the top of a tree and refuses to come down. ""It's just butterflies,"" says a stewardess to a kindly fireman who wants to help. ""If you can get him down now, he can still make the 10:52 flight to Detroit.""There's a depressed brassiere manufacturer (Allan Garfield), who dreams of finding a girl, someplace, somewhere, who appreciates a good, medium-priced bra. There also are old Mr. Delasandro (Orson Welles), who teaches Donald how to become a seedy, tap-dancing magician; Katharine Ross, a small-town girl who comes to worship Donald's lack of talent, and John Astin, a former executive at Servo-Temp whom Donald finds on Skid Row, clutching a wine bottle and a knapsack containing his dearest possessions (a matching pen-and-pencil desk set). Tom Smothers makes a very cheerful, optimistic novice, though his Donald is never a pushover for the con artists he meets. When Mr. Delasandro, after graduating Donald magna cum laude, asks the young man if he would like to consider himself Mr. Delasandro's spiritual son, Donald thinks a minute, then says no.Movies that promote the importance of non-conformity are almost always fraudulent or, what's worse, they're sentimental. ""A Thousand Clowns"" is a case in point. ""Get to Know Your Rabbit"" largely avoids those pitfalls, and with a great deal of comic exuberance. It also reinforces my expectation that De Palma will one day make a really fine American comedy.",1973-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Story of Dope Pusher Employs Technology,"A motion picture called ""The Story of Dope"" opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room. It is a concise and well-observed pastiche of self-congratulatory industrial films in general and an impudent take-off on that coffee commercial in which El Exigente determines the future of growers by bestowing his favor on their crop. Only in this case the crop is marijuana.Unfortunately, ""The Story of Dope"" is a film within a film, and to see it one must endure ""Arnold's Wrecking Co.,"" a sophomoric celebration of marijuana and youthful smarts at the expense of an assortment of cartoon characters who might as well be wearing labels identifying them as Typical Jewish Mother and Stupid Corrupt Pig Cop.The Arnold of the title is a preposterously straight and inept youth who comes to Philadelphia for a summer visit to his cousin Kenny, is forced to smoke marijuana, becomes an instant convert to its pleasures and proceeds to turn pusher. But he is a pusher on a mammoth scale, using the techniques and technology of big business in a concern he calls Arnold's Wrecking Co.The idea reads better than it plays, and one need not look far for the culprit. The movie is directed by Steve De Souza from a screenplay by Mr. De Souza. The part of Kenny is played by Steve De Souza. The rewards of self-indulgence are to be found in ""The Story of Dope""; the excesses are all too visible in ""Arnold's Wrecking Co.""",1973-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Using the C.I.A.:Ex-Agent Is Spook Who Sat by the Door,"In ""The Spook Who Sat by the Door,"" Dan Freeman (Lawrence Cook), a mildmannered, bespectacled, black social worker who seems to know his place, allows himself to become the token by which the Central Intelligence Agency becomes integrated.There is, of course, no thought of ever sending Dan into the field. Black men, otherwise invisible, have a tendency to be conspicuous as spies. They stand out. Dan is kept around the home office where he says ""yes, sir"" and ""no, sir,"" and escorts sightseeing parties through the nonclassified sections. That, however, is just one side of Dan. The other side is Dan Freeman as the superblack nationalist. After Dan has learned everything that the C.I.A. has to teach him about guerilla warfare and weaponry, he returns to Chicago to orgnize a black revolution that, at the end of the film, is about to bring white America to its knees.Like Dan Greenlee's novel, on which it is based, ""The Spook Who Sat by the Door"" is a difficult work to judge coherently. It is such a mixture of passion, humor, hindsight, prophecy, prejudice and reaction that the fact that it's not a very well-made movie, and is seldom convincing as melodrama, is almost beside the point.The rage it projects is real, even though the means by which that rage is projected are stereotypes. Black as well as white.Mr. Greenlee, who adapted his novel for the screen with Melvin Clay, and co-produced the film with Ivan Dixon, the director, couldn't care less about convincing white audiences of anything except black anger. The white characters are even more idiotic than can easily be explained by their roles as C.I.A. officials and United States Senators. The blacks are either poetic proles or members of the corrupted black middle class. ""This is not about hating white folks,"" Freeman says as the black revolution is about to begin. ""This is about loving freedom enough to fight and die for it.""In spite of what Dan Freeman says, the film equates the two. ""The Spook Who Sat by the Door"" stacks its cards, and in doing so, it raises black consciousness by trivializing several hundred years of black neglect.",1973-09-22T05:00:00+0000

The leaf peeping season, as it is somewhat mockingly called in New England, has just started in Maine and is expected to extend there at least through the third week in October. Elsewhere along the Eastern Seaboard, the leaves are likely to turn a little later, depending on the weather, but peak peeping time in many regions usually coincides, with the Columbus Day weekend, which this year is, Oct. 68. Should the season be a little late, the Veterans Day weekend, Oct. 2022, will give travelers another threeday period for a foliage trip.For those who enjoy participating in fairs and festivals along with color watching, a number of communities have planned events for the season. One of the biggest will take place Oct. 6 to 14 in North Adams, Mass., during the Northern Berkshire Fall Foliage Festival (more about this event in the next item). ",1973-09-23T05:00:00+0000

It was in 1912 that the museum first organized lectures in its galleries for high schools for the teachers and for stu dents. Discussions of the mu seum's responsibility to fur nish popular instruction transpired behind the scenes, with the secretary of the mu seum, Henry W.

Suppose, that is, that the retail provision of groceries had been nationalized, that food was paid for by taxes and distributed by Governmentrun stores. Each family would be assigned to a store, as it is now assigned to a school, on the basis of its location. It would be entitled to receive, without direct pay ment, a collection of foods, as its children are entitled to receive a collection of classes. It would be able to choose among foods, as its children choose among subjects. Presumably this would be done by giving each family some number of ration points and assigning point prices to various foods. Private grocery stores would be permitted (just as private schools are), but persons shopping in them would be taxed for the support of the public stores just the same. ",1973-09-23T05:00:00+0000

The vocational school offers an education in the techniques of picking pocketsthe work of cannons (master pickpockets), steerers (victim spotters) and stalls (who distract victims). From the Berlitz comes a language of kicks (pockets) and holding (retaining possession of a poke, or wallet.).The teachers are James Coburn as Harry, the cannon whose first law is ???Harry Never Holds""; Wal??? Pidgeon as the steerer, ???d Michael Sarrazin and his girl friend, Trish Van De???re, who hire on with the two old pros as stalls.Mr. Coburn covets not only cash and credit cards but Miss Van Devere. Mr. Sarrazin covets Mr. Coburn's skills and success; Mr. Pidgeon covets cocaine and immortality of a sort, and Miss Van Deverewell, without her, things would be a lot less interesting.For all its polish, there is a bittersweetness to ""Harry in Your Pocket"" and moments reminiscent of ""The Hustler"" and ""The Cincinnati Kid.""

But it's a minor triumph since the manufactured action in both is aimed largely at producing gore rather than persuasive logic or artistic excitement.There are no karate chops in ""Triple Irons,"" the Oriental martial-arts exhibition turned out in Hong Kong and dubbed into English. Its small distinction is David Chiang, as a one-armed, handsome hero, who is the handiest man around with two swords. And, to the accompaniment of comic-book dialogue, grunts, grimaces and scores of corpses, he finally dispatches Ku Feng, the bandit-villain and master of those destructive triple iron bars that cost him his arm in the first place. Even with a pretty heroine, Li Ching, around, a visit to this familiar, bloody kung-fu country isn't necessary.""The Man Called Noon,"" filmed on rugged, Spanish mountain locations, is fairly successful in maintaining some mystery, as Richard Crenna, its amnesiac, gun-fighter seeks to find his true identity and a hidden fortune.Under Peter Collinson's brisk direction, the chases, fights and shootouts are serious and practically continuous. But the equally serious characterizations cry for fuller explanations. Farley Granger, as a bearded, scheming judge, who, like Patty Shepard, is out to grab that fortune, and Rosanna Schiaffino, as the well-endowed heroine who aids and loves Mr. Crenna, may be occasionally effective but they are rarely as large as life.Mr. Crenna is fairly convincing in an underplayed performance that makes him as much an intellectual as a gunslinger. ""I get the feeling,"" he muses at one point in his search, ""that I've been here before."" That wise observation generally could apply to both ""The Man Called Noon"" and ""Triple Irons.""",1973-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,And Nowa Finnish Film Festival ':Change Is Sought Old-Fashioned Personality,"Just try telling someone that you're off to a festival of Finnish films and the response is likely to be, ""Did you say finished films?""Although film has become an international art, it's still hard to imagine that such countries as Brazil, Nigeria and, yes, Finland, have small film industries of their own. To let filmgoers here know that Finland is not just the country of saunas and Sibelius, the library at Lincoln Center and Cinema Dimensions, a distribution company, are presenting, through Saturday, 13 Finnish films in the library's museum.In recent years, the only Finnish director to emerge with any recognition was Jorn Donner, and most of his films have been Swedish productions. His bubbly sex comedy, ""To Love,"" starring Harriet Andersson, was shown several years ago at the New York Film Festival and then had a modest run here. Donner's worldly film, influenced by Ingmar Bergman's light comedies, had a kicky champagne spirit.Change Is SoughtI remember ""To Love"" because it aroused my curiosity about Finlandand the Finnish movie industry. Donner is not included in the festival. The sponsors understandably wanted to introduce other directors. His presence was missed.""There's a lot of talent in Finland,"" says Richard Anobile of Cinema Dimensions, ""but the films are not considered commercial on foreign markets."" He's right, but he hopes to change the situation with Finnish-American co-productions.The grand old man of Finnish theater and films is apparently Edvin Laine, whose three-hour epic of Finnish history, ""Under the Northern Star,"" opened the festival and will be shown again this week. The color, widescreen film, based on a popular Finnish trilogy, might be described as Finland's ""Gone With the Wind.""With a big cast in interweaving stories covering two generations, ""Star"" shows the plucky nation's suffering and stumbling progressfrom a grand duchy of Russia to independence and civil war. Like a Cecil B. DeMille pageant, the canvas is almost too cumbersome, the characters are cardboard and yet, despite elements of operatic kitsch, the director knows how to build suspense and pathos while giving a thumbnail sketch of Finnish history.Old-Fashioned PersonalityHis plot devices are old-fashioned, but you have to admire the unabashed sentiment of his last shot: a bedraggled soldier returning home in the howling rain. Obviously there was a personality behind this work, which I did not feel at all in the two other ""modern"" movies I saw.""Worker's Diary"" by Risto Jarva deals with contemporary life in Finland, which rises like a glassy skyscraper on the edge of a primeval forest. It touches, but only blandly, the monotonyand isolationin the marriage of a clerical secretary and her husband, a factory foreman. It's almost as if the director were embarrassed by the bleakness of his material.""Green Widow,"" by Jaakko Pakkasvirta, is a suburban housewife who finds relief from her philandering, boorish husband with a mini-affair of her own. The mad housewife, ably played by Eija Pokkinen, is the sort of striking Finn who usually runs to Parisone of the exotic Left Bank Lapps.But this ""Green Widow"" is strangely repressed. The social mores reflected in her life are related to yesterday, to the late nineteen-fifties. I refuse to believe that the ultimate Finnish decadence is a marijuana cigarette smoked in the late afternoon.My impression from these films is that the Finns have resources. What they really need is boldnessand cinematic vision.",1973-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Sisters' Goes Soft On Horror,"Grace Collier (Jennifer Salt) has several problems. She writes for a Staten Island newspaper that isn't as interested in news as it is in civic promotion. She has a mother who wants her to get married. ""The Cunningham girl,"" her mother says one day, ""is engaged. He's a doctor. Well, he's really a veterinarian, but all the animals are owned by wealthy people."" Grace's biggest problem is the Staten Island policeman who refuses to believe her when she says she saw a man murdered in an apartment across the way.This is pretty much the beginning of Brian De Palma's ""Sisters,"" a good, substantial horror film with such a sense of humor that it never can quite achieve the solemnly repellent peaks of Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion."" Never, however, does it become the sort of Nancy Drew detective tale it otherwise resembles, at least in outline.At the center of the story is a lovely French-Canadian girl named Danielle Breton (Margot Kidder), one of a pair of separated Siamese twins. Danielle, like so many young women in horror stories of this sort, has a terrible guilt complex about sex, and it is in her apartment that Grace thinks she saw a man repeatedly stabbed, then write ""help"" on the window in his own blood.The screenplay, by Mr. De Palma and Louisa Rose, cuts back and forth between Grace's investigation of the murder, with the help of a persistent though none-too-bright private detective, and Danielle's story, quite stunningly presented through news film and drug fantasies that take the narrative place of flashbacks.Mr. De Palma, best known for his anarchic comedy (""Hi, Mom,"" ""Get to Know Your Rabbit""), reveals himself here to be a first-rate director of more or less conventional material that has associations not only with ""Repulsion"" but also with Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" The ""Psycho"" associations are unfortunate, since they tip one important plot point sooner than is absolutely necessary.The performances are fine, especially Miss Kidder's as the loony twin whom we first meet when she's doing a walk-on on a popular television quiz show called ""Peeping Toms,"" which, like so many of Mr. De Palma's comic fancies, is just terrible enough to become a reality.An intelligent horror film is very rare these days. ""Sisters,"" which opened at three theaters yesterday, is just the thing to see on one of those nights when you want to go to the movies for the old-fashioned fun of it.",1973-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Badly 'Mixed Up Files':The Cast,"When Fielder Cook's ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" opens, we see 12-year old Claudia Kincaid (Sally Prager) running through the New Jersey wood, finally coming to rest hugging a tree. Claudia is a restless romantic. She wants to be Lady Guinevere. Any movie that defines an adolescent's restless romanticism in terms of tree-hugging is, I have found, usually a fake.Little girls hug cats, sometimes fatally. They hug dogs, horses, gerbils and, if allowed, they would probably hug parakeets, opossums, lions, tigers and polar bears. Little girls will hug almost any kind of creature, as long as it breathes and is soft to the touch. Trees are an adult fancy.It's not an accident that Claudia hugs a tree. ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" is one of those G-rated movies about children, not as they are but as they appear in television commercials for things like peanut butter and potato chips. They play out adult dreams in adult gestures.Claudia and her 10-year-old brother Jamie (Johnny Doran) run away from home and take up residence in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Thomas Hoving's ever-alert guards somehow never come upon them, even though the children clatter through the halls and exhibition rooms at all hours of the day and night. They are horribly stanch youngsters. They bathe nightly in the pool in the cafeteria (with their underwear on) and regularly change their socks.Somewhere along the line, they come upon a movie plot of sorts: they will authenticate the origins of a statue that has been attributed to Michelangelo. These children are not only clean, they are also scholarly.Their investigation leads them eventually to the home of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, described as a wealthy recluse, who is played in the film's last 25 minutes by Ingrid Bergman wearing a white wig and long black dress of the sort usually worn by the male lead in ""Charley's Aunt.""The screenplay by Blanche Hanalis is based on E. L. Konigsburg's novel, which, I am ??? may also be some interest in the fact that a large portion of the film was shot in the Metropolitan, with the museum's cooperation.I guess this gives the movie some quasi-educational status, which is the only status it deserves.

us,Screen: 'Day for Night':Truffaut's Own World Viewed From Inside The Cast,"Movie-making is a strange business, says Severine (Valentina Cortese), an actress who steadies her nerves by sipping champagne on the set of ""Meet Pamela,"" a rather tacky melodrama being made within Franois Truffaut's exhilarating new comedy about movie-making, ""Day for Night.""""As soon as we grasp things,"" says Severine, ""they're gone.""In one way and another, almost all of Truffaut's films have been aware of this impermanence, which, instead of making life and love seem cheap, renders them especially precious.Worthy adventures are risky; they are headlong plunges into the unknown. Whether they end with a shotgun murder (""La Peau Douce""), middle-class boredom (""Bed and Board"") or total isolation (""Jules and Jim"") is not so important as the acceptance of the gamble itself. The quality of an experience cannot be measured by its duration or its end. Longevity is for redwood trees.The original French title of ""Day for Night"" is ""La Nuit Americaine,"" which is what French movie makers call the method by which a scene shot in daylight is made to look like night through the use of filters. ""Day for Night"" is a hilarious, wise and moving chronicle about the members of a crew who come together for seven weeks at the Victorine Studios in Nice to manufacture a movie, an illusion that is, for the period of its production, more important than life itself.They include Ferrand (Truffaut), the director who observes at one point that making a movie is like a stagecoach trip through the old West (""At first you hope for a pleasant trip. Then you simply hope to reach your destination""); Julie (Jacqueline Bisset), the beautiful Hollywood star of the film within; Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Laud), a nice, nut-brained young actor preoccupied by movies and women, in that order; Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Aumont), the aging male lead of the film within, and Severine (Miss Cortese), Alexandre's co-star and former mistress, who is genuinely pleased for Alexandre when he reveals plans to settle down with his new young male lover.""Day for Night"" is Truffaut's fondest, most compassionate film, and although it is packed with references to films and film people (Welles, Vigo, Fellini, Buuel, among others) and although it is dedicated to Lillian and Dorothy Gish, it's not a particularly inside movie. That is, it has great fun showing us how movies are made, how rain and snow are manufactured, how animals are directed (or not), how acts of God can affect a script, but its major concerns are people working at a profession they love, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else.The movie people are different from you and me, Truffaut seems to say, but only in the intensity of their passions and in constantly having to differentiate between reality and its various reflections. Romantic alliances are always shifting. Infatuation is mistaken for love (and, for a moment, it may really be love). Severine becomes hysterical after fluffing half a dozen takes because the make-up girl is doubling as a maid in a brief scene. ""In my day,"" she screams, ""make-up was make-up, and an actress was an actress.""The performances are superb. Miss Cortese and Miss Bisset are not only both hugely funny but also hugely affecting, in moments that creep up on you without warning. It's no accident, I suspect, that the only characters who come close to being either evil (the jealous wife of the film's production manager) or uninteresting (Julie's doctor husband) are nonmovie people. In ""Day for Night,"" Truffaut is looking at the world from inside a glorious obsession: everyone outside looks a little gray and dim.""Day for Night,"" which begins its commercial engagement Oct. 7 at the Festival Theater, was the opening attraction of the New York Film Festival last night at Lincoln Center. Never has the festival been so appropriately begun.",1973-09-29T05:00:00+0000

The mordant commentary comes from occasional glimpses of the film crew itself and particularly from the presence and singing of Country Joe McDonald.The work of Saul Landau, who produced this film and served as one of its directors, also includes an earlier, well-received documentary on Fidel Castro. ""Que Hacer"" will remind some audiences of the Costa-Gavras films, ""Z"" and ""State of Siege,"" although it is less blatantly emotional.It shares the bill with a 30-minute documentary interview with Dr. Allende, with Mr. Landau asking the questions. History will render its eventual judgment, but at least in this film, Dr. Allende emerges as a compassionate leader who ""thought that man should have a different dimension.""The films opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.",1973-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"September 30, 1973/Section6 Part","Richard and Noriko Moore live in a loft in the midst of Manhattan's warehouse district. It's a comfortable, lightfilled place full of fresh ideas.  Peter and Juliet GlynnSmith, their two children, new baby and overgrown dog live in what once was a derelict Victorian. Its big, oldfashioned rooms are a real family home again, complete with back porch, yard and garden. Howard Feldman lives in a new old Colonial that he built in an orchard in PennSylvania when he could not find an authentic one to restore.  Bil and Ellen Ehrlich live in a stunning environment dedicated to 20th century art and design; it's in an anonymous building where you would never expect it. What all this diversity proves is something we've been saying for a long time: People make their places. Experts go on philosophizing about how we all ought to live, with what furniture and in what kinds of houses. But the public is not buying it. Their rebellious attitude reflects a change of priorities in our lives. With rents climbing, some families turn to less fashionable districts and industrial areas and are making them fashionable again. Others prefer to splurge on a yearly trip rather than amass a houseful of possessions. Some weigh the merits of a boat against the responsibilities of a weekend house. It all goes to show that what works for one family may not work for another. And it doesn't have to. That may be the biggest news of all. The public has acquired selfconfidence. A realistic look at what people are doing proves that they want to think for themselves, recognize their options and are not involved in following the leader. You won't be gauche if you hate turquoise and it happens to be next season's hot color. Nor are you hopelessly backward if your living room isn't drowned in patchwork. For those who cannot bear to live without trends, here are predictions: a lessening of the need for clutter. The hardedged modern of the Bauhaus is being increasingly soft ened by warm textures and natural woods. Status houses are on the wane and some bright architects even proclaim that dumb houses (the kind we all live in) are more newsworthy than the classy ones. THE HOME, this year, covers both clashing viewpoints and clashing budgets. Some of the projects shown cost less than $10,000 while others soar up to $125,000. Money isn't the pivotal point of good design. The sense of pride and pleasure that a home gives could never be measured in dollars.",1973-09-30T05:00:00+0000
