In the whole of the 1970's, he produced only three works for the stage, and ''Family Voices,'' the first time he has broken his silence since, lasts a mere 35 minutes. His scarcity value is such, however, that the play has been performed on BBC radio and, immediately afterward, was added to the repertory of the National Theater, with no less a director than Peter Hall in control of its mysteries and no less an actress than Peggy Ashcroft in one of its three key roles.",1981-03-01T05:00:00+0000

We met them in wheelchairs on hospital roofs, we met them in cottages on hospital grounds, we met them in therapy centers struggling to recover from strokes only to be firmly felled by the last stroke of all. Oddly, this preoccupation with mortality wasn't particularly morbid. Some of the plays-and some of the condemned figures in them-were remarkably funny, and quite a few of the narrative lines had to do with a last-ditch and eventually successful effort to mend broken relationships before it was too late.

At its first New York performance last night, by the New York City Opera, the reasons for such currency were sometimes easy to understand. Miss Musgrave's work, a retelling of the Scottish queen's rise, struggles to maintain power and sudden fall, has a few telling moments when her music and the dramatic action interlock and reinforce one another. Perhaps the opera's richest such episode comes at the end of the first act, in a ballroom interlude that does not stop the action to permit the ballet to come on, as in most opera dance scenes, but propels the drama forward. Wendy Hilton's choreography and the nimbleness of the City Opera cast, headed by Ashley Putnam as Mary, helps Miss Musgrave's score mightily at this point.",1981-03-02T05:00:00+0000

In frames with a built-in thermal barrier this doesn't happen because there is a plastic insert that stops the transmission of heat. At any rate, your only solution now is to put up storm windows in the cold weather -either inside or outside, or maybe both.",1981-03-05T05:00:00+0000

The report said that the two sides had agreed that the preservation of Communism in one country concerned all Communist nations. Western analysts viewed the unexpected meeting as a new warning to Warsaw's leadership that it must resolve economic turmoil in Poland quickly. (Page A1, Column 1.)

Wherever you went, gloom and depression prevailed, even when the radio with its stream of tragic music and mournful communiques was turned off. You felt guilty cruising the lake in a canoe with too obvious relish, or taking a spin on your bike, just for the fun of it, heading nowhere in particular. We played soccer after a while - no one was telling us not to - but kept our voices below their usual frenzied pitch, out of respect for our mourning elders. Both my parents seemed genuinely sad. Alma, looking at Stalin's portrait hanging over the piano in the living room, remarked, as she had at previous times but with more feeling, what a remarkably human, kind, and wise face the man had; and I, looking at his enigmatically twinkling eyes, dimpled chin, and picturesque mustache, and hearing how lovingly she spoke of him, and how grandly Mozart's Requiem commended his soul to the highest heaven, I was deeply moved, and felt privileged to be able to join, if only for a moment and to a feeble, juvenile degree, in ''the world's deep sorrow and gratitude.''",1981-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Not so surprising? After all, where better to reach fashion-conscious New Yorkers than on their most fertile turf? But the curious fact is that not one of these stores sells the sort of fabrics generally associated with chic interior design. Indeed, these shops feature a look that would appear to be the sophisticate's natural enemy: colorful, small-scale, floral-printed imports that evoke images of rose-covered cottages on dusty European country lanes. Hardly the thing for New York, one would think. But one, it is clear, would be wrong, for these pretty little prints are enjoying a boom here; moreover, they are selling out in Paris and London, too. (The French sometimes call it le style anglais; here we call it ''country'' without specifying which one.) How is it that cosmopolitans all over the globe have been bitten by the same cuteness bug? Apparently, small-scale prints satisfy a longing that high design cannot touch. And it seems that few are immune to their charms.

us,THE AMERICAN PRISON: A TINDERBOX,"Like the Attica riot, the uprising at the New Mexico State Prison at Santa Fe earned a place in the nation's collective consciousness of terror. For 36 hours last year, gangs of convicts seized control of the maximum-security penitentiary on the outskirts of a city whose name, to much of the rest of the nation, had formerly meant sun on stucco, working ranches and Indian art. Now it became the focus of an intense hell: Prisoners, wielding knives, clubs, stolen riot gear and acetylene torches, took 12 guards hostage, stripped them and dragged them through the 24-year-old fortress, savagely beating, slashing and in some cases sexually assaulting them. But the worst was reserved for fellow prisoners, especially suspected informers and other outcasts of prison life, such as the mentally disturbed or retarded. Gangs raped them repeatedly, blow-torched their eyes and genitals, lynched men from tiers, decapitated them or fired tear-gas canisters point blank into their faces. When it was over, authorities counted 33 bodies. Physicians treated about 90 more for drug overdoses, stab wounds, fractures and traumatic amputations. Just as disturbing as the fact that Santa Fe happened at all are the strong indications that similar horror could now erupt at any moment at any one of several major prisons in the United States because of severe overcrowding.

These vessels are shaped more or less like a long oval and are outfitted both with a rack and a lid. A common lament is that these cookers are expensive, take up a lot of storage space and, in some households, might not be put to all that much use during the course of a year. While we would feel deprived, indeed, if we did not own a fish poacher, there is a solution for those who do not: Place a fish or fillet in a length of heavy-duty aluminum foil, add wine and seasonings and fold the foil to enclose the fish. The fish may then be baked and served either hot or cold. Although it is not technically poached or steamed fish, the result of foil baking is similar enough to seem almost interchangeable with that of the more proper method.",1981-03-08T05:00:00+0000

As long ago as 1971, Czechoslovakian weapons en route to the Irish Republican Army were seized in Amsterdam, and for some years it has been known that the infamous (and seemingly ubiquitous) ""Carlos,"" the Western European terrorist ringleader who disappeared from view in 1975, received training in Cuba and the Soviet Union, as well as in the Middle East. The State Department's revelations, however, provide virtually inconvert ible proof for what has long been treated skeptically or gingerly. Skepti- cally, because, before Jimmy Carter discovered that Leonid I. Brezhne ""lied"" to him about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the dominant attitude in Washington was far too mature to sponsor the deadly antics of international terrorism. Gingerly, because those in the United States intelligence community who knew better found their memorandums spiked and their careers amputated if they made their knowledge available to their superiors. Firm documentation of Soviet and Soviet-satellite support for terrorism is therefore not new, although welcome. What would be even more welcome from the academic community is a serious attempt to place the Soviet support of terrorism in perspective. Those few journalists and scholars who have documented this support in the past generally have been more concerned with proving their case than with explaining the purposes of Soviet involvement.",1981-03-08T05:00:00+0000

Spending: Reductions of $13.8 billion were added to the $34.8 billion in cuts made public on Feb. 18. In each case the reductions are as compared with spending levels if current programs were continued unchanged. The latest, relatively small reductions involve more than 200 programs. The large cuts last month affected 83 programs. Total savings, including changes in user charges and off-budget payments, have now risen to $55.9 billion from $49.1 billion. Revenues: Revenue projections are slightly reduced, to $650.3 billion from $650.5 billion. Deficit: Remains unchanged from earlier Reagan Administration forecast of $45 billion. Government Borrowing: There is to be a reduction in total Federal credit demand of $21 billion from what President Carter proposed. The Reagan Administration will take $127.9 billion from the capital markets. Programs: Cuts affect nearly every department and agency. New reductions involve, among others, the programs of the Department of Agriculture for food and nutrition, the Department of Education, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Rural Electrification Administration. Significant policy changes proposed included deferring or canceling new Veterans Administration hospitals; providing less money for Commerce Department shipbuilding programs; reducing credit assistance for the Small Business Administration; broadening cuts in the Labor Department's Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs; dropping or cutting several Army Corps of Engineer water projects; providing less discretionary money for the Department of Health and Human Services; deferring unfunded pension increases of the Railroad Retirement Board; reducing mortgage insurance and loan guarantees for the Federal Housing Administration and the Government National Mortgage Association, and terminating the mortgage association tandem and Indian housing programs.",1981-03-11T05:00:00+0000

City jails house inmates awaiting trial who cannot make bail or who have been denied bail, inmates sentenced to a year or less and those headed for state prisons.

And the Ohio Ballet's opening at the Brooklyn Academy last night did not disappoint. If there were no jolts of discovery in the program of four works by Heinz Poll, the company's founder and raison d'etre, this was an evening of intelligent, tasteful ballet. ""Fantasy in F Minor,"" which takes its name from its schubert s core for two pianos, is Mr. Poll at his most lyrical and i nventive. The dancers flow on and off singly, in twos and t hrees and in rippling flocks of men or women. The pace is n on-stop but gentle, punctuated by fleeting duets for Andrew C arroll and Tricia Vandor, all elegiac line, and trios for a c lear, strong women's ensemble that consisted of Debra Force, J udith Schoaff and Judith Denman. Solos for earthy Louis Russo r evealed him as the dancer with the strongest whole-body attack i n a company in which unfurling limbs are at a choreographic p remium. .

In the fall he will open his own club in a New Orleans hotel where, for the first time in his life, he will be able to settle down with his band for more than 30 weeks each year (the club is supposed to be completed in January but, as anyone who has dealt with building contractors knows, nothing is ever finished on schedule).",1981-03-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Music View; CONTEMPORARY OPERA JUST DOESN'T 'SING',"The disappearance of song from contemporary opera is one of the great unsolved crimes of our time. It is well known that the victim was alive and frequenting opera houses all over the world just before World War I. Since then there have been occasional rumors to suggest that song, once famously hearty, still survives in certain dark corners, though in a sadly emaciated condition. So, optimists and other innocent folk who remember song with some affection make sure to hurry to the opera whenever a new work is announced. Only recently, for instance, the unregenerate lover of rhapsody and lyricism could sift through Thea Musgrave's ''Mary, Queen of Scots'' at the New York City Opera in hope of turning up significant traces of the vanished art form. Vain hope.",1981-03-15T05:00:00+0000

The reason for this is obvious and understandable. Except for the museum, Cleveland offers the visitor interested in the visual arts few other attractions worth the trip. Yet the museum itself, though much smaller than the Met and no rival to it in the scale of its collections, has a reputation for great quality, and it is a reputation well earned. Cleveland's permanent collection of Western European art is one of the finest in the country, and even its collection of modern art - a field that many of the museum's critics have accused it of neglecting - is actually ampler and contains more treasures than outsiders have been led to believe. The effort required to see the Cleveland Museum is therefore worth making.",1981-03-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Food; THE VERSATILE CORNISH HEN,"rench chefs and many serious home cooks often lament the fact that here they are unable to find the small poussins or young chickens that are so widely available in the markets of France. Poussins differ from just any young chickens in that they have reached maturity and developed flavor, yet they generally weigh only about one pound or slightly more. On rare occasions one can buy these little chickens in rural areas where poultry farms exist. An excellent substitute for the small birds, however, is the Rock Cornish hen, which is said to be a cross between a White Rock and a Cornish game bird. The word game, in the case of these hens, has long since lost its meaning, for the chickens do not smack in the least of a wild bird. Nonetheless, they are a delicacy and are remarkably easy to prepare. One unstuffed bird, roasted or grilled, will serve one. When filled with a meat stuffing, one bird will suffice for two servings. Here are two recipes for Cornish hens, one with a sausage stuffing, another for deviled, breaded Cornish hens.",1981-03-22T05:00:00+0000

There will be lots of leather, velvet and corduroy worked in subtle and intricate patterns, often quilted for extra punch. The low-heeled boot or shoe will remain the key to balancing the new proportions.

Certainly Thomas Babe, who has adapted the text from a translation by Erik J.

And director Arthur Penn, trying his hand at Ibsen after a distinguished career dealing with contemporary stage and screen materials, has at the very least been guilty of letting so many leaden out-of-kilter epithets stand. He's even let stand some of Mr. Babe's more painful flippancies.

Readjustment to a normal life was the prime objective. ''1984'' -hardly the type of book demanded of the times - was hardly written to satisfy folk wishing to forget living under wartime government controls. The book's chilling vision of life in a totalitarian society was startling. It stunned millions who could not believe such a way of life would ever develop.

Buildings like Saarinen's TWA terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport or his Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, D.C., both completed after the architect's death in 1961, were of interest to architectural cognescenti and laymen alike.

Hours after Mr. Haig had seemingly put his prestige on the line in saying that he regarded the possibility of Mr. Bush's getting the position with ''a lack of enthusiasm,'' the White House named Mr. Bush to the foreign-policy post. (Page A1, Column 6.) Polish unionists became more militant, calling a four-hour warning strike for Friday and a general strike to begin next Tuesday as a protest against police violence in Bydgoszcz last week and the authorities' refusal to make amends. But the union's leadership made clear that the stoppages would be called off if negotiations set for today with Government leaders proved satisfactory.

A duke takes a wife whose way of expressing her love is to insist on opening up all the doors to his past. ''Was I the first one?'' she coyly asks Bluebeard. As any soapopera viewer knows, that kind of feminine inquisitiveness invariably ends in trouble. And so it does for Judith, the insatiably curious wife in Bartok's musical treatment of the Bluebeard legend. Though it has been produced by the New York City Opera and occasionally turns up in a concert version, this dark and ultimately mysterious work seems destined to stand just outside the doorway of the standard operatic repertory, too important to be ignored and yet too peculiar in its appeal to be invited inside.

He has looked at three or four places, we learn, but has been dissatisfied with all of them. Ian Richardson, an omnipresent narrator who may also be Nabokov himself, has now escorted Mr. Sutherland to what will turn out to be the home of 12-year-old Lolita. But Mr. Sutherland doesn't meet Lolita right off. He meets Lolita's mother, played by a roly-poly apparition named Shirley Stoler and caricatured to within an inch of her girth. Lolita's mother is a widow, Lolita's mother is on the make, Lolita's mother offers not only a room but the promise that ''I might even let you take a liberty or two with me.''

At 24, he decided - how seriously, we cannot know -to let himself die of hunger because of his failure that year to win the coveted Prix de Rome. (It wasn't until his fourth attempt that the artist now recognized as the greatest of the Neo-Classical painters finally did win it.) At 35, he suddenly emerged as the most esteemed painter of his generation - a hero of the Salon who, on the basis of his spectacular artistic achievement, was given lodgings in the Louvre on orders from the King of France. Yet 10 years later, in 1793, as a Deputy to the National Convention, David cast his vote for the execution of this same sovereign - an action that gives him, among the painters we now admire, a certain distinction, to say the least.",1981-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Could it be that Rye Town chose to build its own high school rather than to send its children to the high school in the incorporated portion of the Town of Rye?

Other major problems in southern Africa will also be studied by the mission.

By Stansfield Turner The changing balance of strategic nuclear forces between the United States and the Soviet Union has in the last few years been a major focus of attention for the American intelligence community. Until the late 1960's, the United States was militarily stronger than the Soviet Union by virtue of its superior nuclear arsenal. We felt secure. The Soviets didn't, and they set out to correct the imbalance. The result has been that in the last several years all of the best studies have shown that the balance of strategic nuclear capabilities has been tipping in favor of the Soviet Union. It is not easy for the layman to gather enough information to make a judgment, but a careful study of the evidence shows that we do deserve to be worried. Even if the perception that there has been a change in the balance were, to some extent, overstated, that perception itself could damage the position, authority and role of the United States in world affairs. The perception as well as the fact must be redressed so that the Soviet Union sees no advantage in using its nuclear arsenal against us.",1981-03-29T05:00:00+0000

I dismissed it as anti-Communist propaganda. But by 1979, I had published my own book, ''The Vietnamese Gulag.'' Can those who have suffered the horror of Communism ever convince those who have not experienced it? From 1945, when I was born in the village of Caivon in Vinh Long province, 100 miles south of Saigon, until I left Vietnam in May 1978, I never enjoyed peace. My family's house was burned three times in the war against the French. To escape the fighting, my parents moved from one village to another throughout my youth. Like the majority of Vietnamese patriots, they joined the resistance forces fighting the French. As I grew up, I myself saw how the peasants were oppressed by the local officials of the successive Saigon regimes, how they were victimized by the French bombardments. I learned the history of my country's thousand-year struggle against Chinese occupation and its century-long effort against Western domination. With this background, my compatriots and I grew up with a hatred of foreign intervention.",1981-03-29T05:00:00+0000

LIVING AND WORKING UNDER ONE ROOF","here was a time when living above the store was something less than desirable, for it implied that a separate residence was unaffordable. But times have changed. Today, more and more people yearn to live above, below or adjacent to their businesses, a way of life that exchanges the commuter's long train ride or the exhausting fight against traffic for the convenience of walking down the stairs or across the hallway. In major cities like New York, it is not uncommon for a vacated town house or apartment to be snatched up by a neighbor whose at-home business has outgrown his present dwelling.

That is why the more famous the conductor, the more likely he is to want to confine his dealings to one kind of composer: the dead kind.

Mr. Hwang's works have the verve of well-made American comedies and yet, with little warning, they can bubble over into the mystical rituals of Oriental stagecraft.
