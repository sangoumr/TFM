In addition to starring in the part of a gigolo-piano player in gilt threads who finds love, the rock celebrity who likes to dress up also directed and collaborated on the music. (His album, ''Parade: Music From 'Under the Cherry Moon' '' was released in March, so the movie, which opens today at the Criterion and other theaters, can be thought of as incidental pictures.) It's in black and white - you know, homage to the B films of the 1940's; well, maybe B-minus - and is set on the French Riviera, as conceived by a fan of fan magazines. Everybody in the glitter set seems to love Chris, the gigolo, though not as much as he loves himself. He falls for a poor little rich girl (Kristin Scott-Thomas, who turns in quite an appealing performance under the circumstances), and after some awkward banter, she falls back. He speaks execrable verse to her to prove his sincerity. But her ruthless father is put off by seeing his lovely daughter in the arms of this peculiar young man, as what sane father would not, and in the end Prince is able to direct himself in a death scene.",1986-07-03T05:00:00+0000

President Reagan ''unveiled'' the monument by triggering a 1.4-million-watt series of laser beams that shot a mile across the harbor and bathed the statue in successive stages of red, blue and white light. Then, after a program of music and dance, speeches and swearing-in ceremonies for new citizens, the statue's torch flamed into golden brilliance. [ Page A1, Columns 5-6. ] Three great fleets advanced on New York City - sailing ships from the east, warships from the south and pleasure boats from everywhere. The Coast Guard said they formed an armada of 25,000 vessels. [ B4:4-6. ] The scene in Upper New York Bay was dizzying as aircraft crowded the skies and vessels covered the waters from shore to shore. Into this swirl steamed the Queen Elizabeth 2, flying a 100-foot-wide American flag and carrying 800 Chrysler Corporation dealers. [ A1:6. ] Traffic was light in Manhattan but the lure of crossing New York Harbor for only 25 cents proved so great that the police had to board Staten Island ferries and order people to disembark. A throng of 20,000 had formed to await ferries at Manhattan's Battery Park when police officers started ordering passengers off and officials closed the ferries to cars. [ B6:4-6. ] The concept of the Statue of Liberty has always exceeded its physical presence. The icon is a global symbol of hope, freedom and opportunity for newcomers.",1986-07-04T05:00:00+0000

Iowa, Mr. Reagan reviewed an international flotilla of warships and then went to a luncheon meeting on Governors Island with President Francois Mitterrand of France. at which the two Presidents discussed arms control and relations with the Soviet Union, which Mr. Mitterrand will visit next week. [ 1:6. ] On a day of flawless weather, New Yorkers and visitors were in a mood appropriate not only to the Fourth of July, but a singular Fourth of July, one that celebrated their roots and their unabashed pride in their country.

The tour firms will also organize historical and literary tours for individuals or parties of fewer than 15 people, who are driven by a chauffeur-guide or drive themselves. (Many hotels give special rates to groups of least 15 people, which is also the number generally required to hire a tour bus.) Among tour organizations that tailor special-interest tours in Ireland for groups or individuals is C.I.E. Tours (122 East 42d Street, New York, N.Y. 10168; 212-972-5600 or 800-243-8687).

In winter, when the homeless are most at risk, even the weather is against him; welfare as an issue is a target for critics all year round. When George Gross left his job in Washington as chief lobbyist for the National League of Cities to take over at the Human Resources Administration in 1984, several city officials had turned the job down. His predecessor had resigned while H.R.A. was under attack for its handling of foster care, child abuse and the homeless, and for trying to silence whistle-blowers. Last week Mr. Gross left the agency to become executive director of the State Financial Control Board. Alan Finder, a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times, asked him to talk about his two years in the post. Excerpts follow. Question.

It has been in one respect a stimulating experience, this chance to hear some of the best young talent. In another it has been a depressing experience. All this talent, all this preparation and dedication - and so little to say in one major segment of the repertory! That segment is Romantic music. In the early 1960's I wrote a piece for these pages bewailing the prevalent literalism and uniformity of international music-making, especially among pianists. Most of the younger ones sounded alike and were hard to tell apart. Every age makes music its own way, and the 1960's was a period in which the printed note all but strangled the artist. So intent was everybody on textual fidelity, on strict rhythms, on the ideal of ''musicianship,'' that the concept of the artist was all but abandoned. It has remained abandoned. But this is all wrong, even historically wrong. Until recent times an interpreter was supposed to bring his own mind, heart, sensitivity and knowledge to the music, refracting the composer's message through his own personality. Composers historically were quite willing to go along when they had confidence in the artist. But in the 1960's -and, alas, today -the artist has abdicated his role. He is content to be a reproducer rather than a co-creator.",1986-07-06T05:00:00+0000

The Swan, a theater built within the former premises of the original Memorial Theater, will, of course, have the more long-range effect, allowing the Royal Shakespeare Company to expand its repertory and its perspective. As Trevor Nunn, joint artistic director of the company, said, this will be ''a theater for the performance of 16th-, 17th- and 18th-century plays which can be seen as broadly contextual to our house dramatist, William Shakespeare.'' In the past, a limited number of those plays have been presented at the Other Place, Stratford's small theater, which presumably will now concentrate on new works and more tangential classics.",1986-07-06T05:00:00+0000

Born into a musical Memphis family and a pianist with his father's big band and on early B. B. King recordings while still in his teens, Phineas Newborn Jr. was in every sense a prodigy. By the time he made his classic Atlantic, RCA and Contemporary jazz albums, in the 1950's and early 60's, that prodigious abundance of technique was getting him compared with the virtuosic Art Tatum, and dismissed by some as all fingers, no heart. That was never true, and certainly isn't now. In his maturity, Mr. Newborn is one of the masters of jazz piano, with an immediately identifiable tone and touch, great harmonic originality, and, as a kind of signature, octave runs that seem to fairly whip along the keyboard. Shows are around 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M. through Sunday, with a $10 music charge and $6 minimum.",1986-07-11T05:00:00+0000

Collapsing oil prices were the force behind the drop. Producer prices were unchanged in June, and experts predicted that they would be flat or lower for July. Since energy, financing and other costs are also dropping, industrial output and employment could get a much-needed lift. Experts said that the Fed, in cutting its discount rate, had little reason to fear higher inflation. [ Page 1. ] Many U.S. banks lowered their prime lending rates by half a percentage point, to 8 percent, the lowest level since January 1978. Moving one day after the Fed cut its discount rate, the banks said their own cost of funds had fallen in recent weeks. Experts said that small and medium-sized companies, as well as less-developed countries, would benefit the most from the reduction. [ 33. ] Tax conferees must set the limits of ''middle income.'' The decision will have sweeping ramifications for many issues, including the top individual rate, and it will determine whether the plan is viewed as fair, which could have an impact on the national elections in the fall. [ 33. ] The Fed's policy-making committee, by 11 to 1, voted not to change monetary policy at a May meeting, minutes of the session show.

John Irving's novel explores abortion and the relationship between a spiritual father and son -Dr. Wilbur Larch, a Maine physician who performs abortions and directs an orphanage, and the orphaned Homer Wells. Benjamin DeMott wrote in The Book Review last year that ''at its best, this novel is an example, now rare, of the courage of imaginative ardor.'' THE HUNGRY SELF: Women, Eating, and Identity, by Kim Chernin. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Why are so many otherwise ''normal'' women obsessed with food, dieting, fat and exercise instead of wholeness and autonomy, Kim Chernin asks. Her answer is that such women are fleeing self-development and that female identity is in crisis. In 1985 our reviewer, Phyllis Chesler, found this work ''an inspired psychoanalytical meditation on contemporary female identity and eating disorders.'' But she said the author ''leans too heavily on feminist or psychoanalytic insight as a way to control self-destructive behavior.'' CARPENTER'S GOTHIC, by William Gaddis. (Elisabeth Sifton/Penguin, $6.95.) At the center of William Gaddis's third novel is the stormy marriage of the Booths - Elizabeth, an heiress, and Paul, a media consultant - who live in a Victorian house on the Hudson River, north of New York City. But ''plot is what Mr. Gaddis travesties and teases and two-times and swindles,'' our reviewer, Cynthia Ozick, wrote last year.

His point, almost incidentally, is that these rooms are completely innocent of clock radios, electric hair dryers or video games.

Before this year, his most recent album was ''Of Human Feelings'' (Antilles), recorded in 1979, released in 1982 and still very much in the forefront of musical developments. This year has now brought two new albums from Mr. Coleman, first his collaboration with the guitarist Pat Metheny, ''Song X'' (Geffen), and now ''Opening the Caravan of Dreams,'' the first release from the Caravan of Dreams label. (The album can be ordered by mail from Caravan of Dreams Records, P.O. Box 886, Fort Worth, Tex. 76101.) Beginning with Ornette Coleman's earliest recordings, which ushered in ''free jazz'' at the end of the 1950's, his music has articulated a process of constant evolutionary change. But two continuing factors have lent the sometimes vertiginous departures a sense of stability overall. One is Mr. Coleman's personal approach to the alto saxophone, which is firmly rooted in the blues and has changed surprisingly little since his apprenticeship in rhythm-and-blues groups during the 1950's. The other is his continuing efforts to mold attentive, responsive bands and keep them together, with minimal personnel changes, as long as possible.",1986-07-16T05:00:00+0000

Fein recently reported in The Times from the Jacob Riis Houses: ''Despite the threat of pregnancy and the prospect of child rearing at so young an age, teen-agers in the project said they usually did not practice birth control. They are not ignorant of birth control methods, they said. They just don't want to use them.'' Neither did most of the 3,400 students at four inner-city Baltimore schools described in a new study for the Alan Guttmacher Institute. Like the kids at Jacob Riis, they are poor, live in projects and take early sex for granted. Of the girls in the seventh and eighth grades, 47 percent were sexually active. So were 92 percent of the boys in ninth grade. Eventually, however, the study found, the pregnancy rate at one pair of schools dropped by 30 percent while at the other pair it increased 58 percent. What explained the difference? The students among whom pregnancy declined participated in an intensive prevention program designed and staffed by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. At the other schools, used as a control group, students got only the sex education courses required by the state of Maryland. The special program ran for nearly three years. It brought a social worker and nurse into each school to provide individual and group counseling. It also provided medical and contraceptive services at two clinics nearby. By the end of the program, the junior high boys were visiting the clinics as much as the girls; the median age for a girl's first intercourse had risen from 15 1/2 to more than 16 years, showing again that access to contraceptives need not encourage early sex.",1986-07-19T05:00:00+0000

Even small tremors may be studied for clues to a larger seismic pattern or as possible harbingers of a big quake, which many experts say is probable in the next 30 years. So the two moderate jolts in Southern California in the last two weeks have prompted a flurry of public speculation and scientific activity. Some seismologists rushed to the desert epicenter of the July 8 quake north of Palm Springs, which, at 5.9 on the Richter scale, was the strongest California has felt in seven years. Although a 5.3-magnitude quake off the coast of Oceanside last week was the largest recorded offshore in the San Diego area since seismic records were started in 1932, it caused much less interest, partly because little can be done to study underwater faults. What did they mean? Last week, Katherine Roberts, an editor of The Week in Review, asked several experts for their assessments of the recent seismic activity and the state of earthquake prediction. Following are excerpts from their remarks. THE TIME IS NIGH The segment of the San Andreas Fault that runs west from Bakersfield in the Central Valley down through the north and east of Los Angeles last ''broke'' in 1857, with a magnitude of 8 and a quarter.

A SWELL-LOOKING BABE, by Jim Thompson. (Black Lizard/Creative Arts, $3.95.) A hotel bellboy is drawn into a robbery scheme that ends in murder in this crime thriller by Jim Thompson.

The same publisher has reissued two more Thompson novels, AFTER DARK, MY SWEET and WILD TOWN ($3.95 each). The latter, set in a West Texas oil town, is about an ex-convict who has been lured into a job as a hotel detective in a plot to kill the proprietor.

Buck, an evangelistic outlander who for a decade had headed the respected Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, took over as the museum's director. And, partly inspired by the success of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a once-ailing institution whose remarkable turnaround over the last two decades has today made the borough a mecca for the performing arts, he set out immediately to help the Brooklyn Museum fulfill what he sees as its ''spectacular'' potential.",1986-07-20T05:00:00+0000

As deeply believing Christians, they fearlessly said Amen! to Paul's celebrated warning to the Galatians - ''Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap'' - and pronounced slavery ordained of God. Theodore Rosengarten reminds us that we know much more about the slaveholders than about their slaves, for they left vast quantities of diaries, journals, account books, family letters and other public and private papers. Those sources reveal the people who presided over that enormity as, more often than not, admirable men and women who struggled heroically to build a Christian civilization.",1986-07-20T05:00:00+0000

Johnson tries to convince his readers that he is not a die-hard conspiracy theorist, but rather merely a dispassionate analyst reviewing the facts surrounding the tragic fate of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. In that, at least, he fails. All 269 passengers and crew members died when a Soviet fighter shot the airliner down after it had strayed well into Russian territory on Sept. 1, 1983, on its way from Anchorage to South Korea. In the nearly three years since, a variety of people, including Mr. Johnson, a fellow in politics at Oxford University, have theorized that the plane may not have been in Soviet airspace by accident, as the official American investigations suggested, but was instead on a secret surveillance mission for the United States. Although Mr. Johnson says, ''I became acutely dissatisfied with the 'official' explanations of the event offered by the Reagan Administration,'' he repeatedly acknowledges that ''readers will have to decide for themselves what to believe.''",1986-07-20T05:00:00+0000

us,THE POWER OF VICTIMS,"STEALING THE LANGUAGE The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America. By Alicia Suskin Ostriker. 315 pp. Boston: Beacon Press. $19.95. THE subtitle is misleading. The first chapter of ''Stealing the Language: The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America'' simply gallops through women's poetry from 1650 to 1960 - 44 pages for more than 300 years. The remaining chapters focus on women's poetry from 1960 to the present, with only occasional reference to women poets as ''historical'' as H.D. In that accelerated first chapter, some extraordinarily interesting poets are given short shrift, among them Edna St. Vincent Millay, Amy Lowell and Emma Lazarus. (Lazarus is mentioned in one sentence acknowledging late 19th-century poets who ''wrote on humanitarian issues.'') This is all the more unfortunate in light of Alicia Suskin Ostriker's wonderful analysis of Emily Dickinson's poetry. Mrs. Ostriker is brilliant at close reading, but she rarely puts her talent for it to work in this book. I would have been interested to read her at length about other long-lost poets, like Frances Osgood, who is tantalizingly quoted but given only brief attention here. ''The Emergence of Women's Poetry in America'' would indeed be a book worth writing, but it is not the book Mrs. Ostriker has produced.",1986-07-20T05:00:00+0000

The Internal Revenue Service requires I.R.A. withdrawals - technically known as distributions - to start no later than the end of the year in which you turn 70 1/2. But for the year in which you begin taking distributions only, the I.R.S. allows a three-month grace period - until April 1 of the following year. So while you have until April 1987 to take your distribution for 1986, you must also take your 1987 distribution by Dec. 31, 1987.",1986-07-20T05:00:00+0000

It seems, for that instant, that he's found all those things we all crave: He's one with nature, he's found the perfect partner, he's at peace inside, and he's bursting with enthusiasm. Then Charlotte tells him that she has made a vow to her dying mother that she would marry Albert.

The director Frank Corsaro has taken this denigration one step further in his current production of ''Carmen'' at the New York City Opera.

He has done that once again with his current single, ''Higher Love,'' and his new album, ''Back in the High Life'' (Island). He is also planning his first American tour in a decade, which will bring him to Jones Beach on Aug. 31 and to New York's Pier 84 on Sept. 12 and 13. ''I'm a slow worker,'' Mr. Winwood said with a shrug. ''I'm trying to step up production, but I think you've got to do it till it's good, and there's no point in just throwing a record out there. I guess I'm fortunate that I've developed my career so I can afford that luxury.'' Mr. Winwood, who is 38 years old, has been singing and writing hit singles since the mid-1960's, when he was the teen-age belter for the Spencer Davis Group. From 1967 to the mid-1970's, he was with the eclectic band Traffic, and during one of Traffic's breakups, he worked with the guitarist Eric Clapton in the group Blind Faith. After Traffic's dissolution, he started a leisurely solo career, releasing albums in 1977, 1980 and 1982. While making ''Back in the High Life,'' Mr. Winwood also had another studio booked, where he completed a soundtrack for a Granada Television documentary on the cyclist Robert Miller.",1986-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, JULY 23, 1986","The Economy The nation's growth slowed sharply in the second quarter to a lackluster 1.1 percent annual rate, the worst performance since late 1982, when the current expansion began, the Commerce Department said. The report was seen as perhaps the strongest evidence so far of the widespread and persistent weakness in the economy. The department also revised upward the first-quarter growth rate for the G.N.P., to 3.8 percent from 2.9 percent, still far short of the Administration's 4 percent target for the year. Administration spokesmen cited the report's bright spots, particularly strong consumer spending, but Democrats used the data to criticize the effect of Reagan policies on jobs, income and productivity. [ Page A1. ] The South's farming losses are estimated at $1 billion, and most of the region's corn crop has been burned by a severe drought. [ A1. ] The Senate Finance Committee approved about $3 billion in Medicare savings as Congress began action on spending cuts and revenue increases in the 1987 budget resolution. [ B8. ] International Bankers are receptive about providing Mexico with up to $7 billion in loans, twice the amount previously being considered. The new stance reflects bankers' growing confidence that Mexico's accord with the International Monetary Fund might work. Some say their only alternative is to risk losses on existing loans. [ D1. ] Mexican officials signed the pact in Washington. [ D14. ] Companies Safeway Stores, putting itself on the auction block, said it had held talks about a leveraged buyout with an unidentified party and rejected a $3.6 billion bid by the Dart Group as inadequate.",1986-07-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.The wooden soffits on our 50-year-old house need paint, but to avoid maintenance - the land slopes and the soffits are up high - I want to cover them with aluminum soffits, some with perforations. However, the old soffits appear to be moldy or dirty, particularly on one side. Must the wood be cleaned before the aluminum is installed? A.If the stains are mold or mildew, they should be washed off first, or they will spread and could do other damage. Someone will have to climb up to install the aluminum anyway, so the mold can be washed off at that time with a bleach solution. If you are putting aluminum over wood, the aluminum should have openings its entire length, not at intervals. Q.Believe it or not, my wristwatch, which has a quartz movement and a plastic case and strap, became stuck to my bureau several weeks ago. Prying with a knife scratched the finish, and hot water didn't help. The watch is running fine and is causing many laughs. How can I get it off? A.Try cold cream. Lift the plastic as high as you can; spread the cream under it, and let soak an hour two. Pry with a plastic scraper - the kind for removing ice from windshields or for defrosting refrigerators and freezers. Used with care, these won't scratch the wood or finish.",1986-07-24T05:00:00+0000

The electric guitarist Vernon Reid is a prime mover behind the Black Rock Coalition Orchestra, which celebrates the contributions black musicians are making to contemporary rock, of both the commercial and the more futuristic varieties. The compositions of precursors like Sly Stone account for some of the material. But members are reportedly composing more and more original music, and with Mr. Reid, the keyboardist Geri Allen and the vocalist Bernard Fowler in the band, that can't be bad. The concert takes place Sunday at 8 P.M. in the band shell, which is a block from the Brooklyn Seventh Avenue stop on the F train. Admission is free. Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet featuring Curtis Fuller, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, near West Fourth Street (242-1785). Three horns, three rhythm - the classic format for playing the music once called hard bop. It was good enough for Art Blakey's mid-60's Jazz Messengers, good enough for the original Art Farmer-Benny Golson Jazztet, and it's still good enough for the Jazztet, which has matured, refined the music but retained its feeling and punch. Mr. Farmer's trumpet and fluegelhorn are warmly thoughtful, Mr. Golson is as persuasive an exponent of the Coleman Hawkins-Ben Webster approach to the tenor saxophone as you'll encounter and Curtis Fuller is twice the trombonist he was in the 60's, which is saying a lot.

In the 12 years that Joan Armatrading has been making records, the West Indian-born, British singer-songwriter has probably written and recorded more songs that have become cult classics than any other pop composer of her generation. Artistically, Miss Armatrading, now 35 years old, is a fascinating mass of crosscurrents and contradictions. Her music synthesizes folk, reggae and, on her later albums, a harder electronic rock in combinations that are often surprising. Her rich, swooping folk-jazz voice is also interestingly at odds with a stage personality that is modest to the point of shyness. While her first-person dramatic monologues have the quirky complexity of confessional songs, they embrace too many different characters and points of view to be taken as anything but fiction. Expect to hear the whole range of Miss Armatrading's work, including ''Show Some Emotion,'' ''Love and Affection'' and ''Willow.'' Graham Nash opens the show, which is tonight at 7:30.

Here, step by step, is how their ''victory'' was achieved: 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee, which has a Republican majority, rejected Mr. Manion's nomination on a 9-to-9 tie vote, on grounds that he was not qualified. But Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Republican, and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Democrat, voted to send the nomination to the Senate unapproved. 2. Before the floor vote, the Justice Department notified David Durenberger of Minnesota, Democrat, that his choice for a Federal district judgeship, David Doty, would be nominated after being held up for 10 months. On June 26, Mr. Durenberger, who had opposed the Manion nomination, voted for it. 3. That day, after getting what they thought was a pledge from Slade Gorton of Washington, Republican, to oppose Mr. Manion, Democrats agreed to a plea by Bob Dole, Republican, the Senate majority leader, for a vote. But Mr. Dole said that two Republican supporters of Mr. Manion, Paula Hawkins of Florida and Bob Packwood of Oregon, were out of town. The Democrats agreed to withhold two of their own votes to balance these absentees. 4. Barry Goldwater of Arizona was not on the floor for the vote. Republican leaders, who represented Mr. Goldwater as a Manion supporter, prevailed on Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, Republican, an opponent of the Manion nomination, to withhold her vote to balance Mr. Goldwater's absence. 5. Mr. Packwood later said he had not asked for his vote to be ''paired'' and did not know how he would have voted.",1986-07-25T05:00:00+0000

Although the additional surcharge was slight, is it - and the pass-along itself - authorized, considering the rapidly falling price of oil? . . . R. B., Brooklyn Answer: Yes. According to Charles Hogg, of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the formula used to determine the amount of the pass-along and the surcharge includes such variables as what type of heating system - electric, gas or oil - is used as well as the size of the apartment. You can find out if the amount of your surcharge was appropriate by visiting or calling the division's Brooklyn office at 91 Lawrence Street. Noisy Pump Question: We live on the ground floor of a cooperative building. The co-op has just put a new water pump in the basement that is causing the floor in our kitchen to vibrate. The new pump is also noisier than the old pump. Do we have any recourse in getting the co-op to install a quieter pump? . . . D.

IN ''Metropolis,'' Jerome Charyn has written a love song to cities in general and to New York City in particular. It is also a passionate invocation of his own life and of the earlier immigrant days of Ellis Island. (Someone - I cannot believe it is the author -has given the book the foolish subtitle ''New York as Myth, Marketplace, and Magical Land.'' Just ignore the cheap alliteration.) The best things about this roller coaster-written, hypnotic, ambitious, often brilliant, often utterly wrongheaded and fascinating book are its author's voice and its beautifully lived-in subject. In the invisible place where subjects and authors are mysteriously joined, a fortunate meeting has occurred between a ''Bronx Iroquois'' and the anarchic city he has soaked up through his nerve endings, a pairing that extends here to the borders of poetry, mythology and politics. This last category, in my opinion, takes Mr. Charyn onto tricky ground; he occasionally lurches and retrieves his footing mainly by the sheer energy of his language and poetic drive.",1986-07-27T05:00:00+0000

At the same time, it raised the growth rate for the January-March quarter to 3.8 percent from the 2.9 percent calculated earlier.

And I can neither paint nor write I only can set other people right. All people that can write or paint do tremble under my complaint. For I am a chicken, and I can chirp; and my name is Thomas, Thomas Earp. How good a weapon is literature for settling scores with someone by making his person or art an object of ridicule?

TOWARD the end of his days as a student of law at the University of Granada, the poet Federico Garcia Lorca stopped showing up for exams. The faculty was hesitant to throw him out, however. He had published a book of poems, and he was cultured and widely read. If not the poet, then the university might gain honor from the young man's degree. So, when he failed to appear for the examination in penal law, the committee sought him out in the courtyards, led him to their chambers, asked his opinion of the death penalty and waved him on. Civil and private law, canon law, public finance - one way or another he passed each one. Then came the last, and again no candidate. Again, allowances were made, a special session arranged. The topic was mercantile law; what exactly, the examiners asked the poet, was a merchant? Garcia Lorca knew that. They gave him his degree.",1986-07-27T05:00:00+0000

With its impossibly muddled libretto and intermittently captivating music, this is the sort of faded period piece that must be taken as is or not at all. Once the listener accepts the intellectually blasphemous idea that any change will only be for the worse, a mood of tolerant resignation may overtake him. Given a moderately well-sung performance, secret flushes of affection may then be felt. Guilty pleasures, as musical intellectuals and other puritans know, are the best kind, after all.",1986-07-27T05:00:00+0000

AWHITE HOUSE speechwriter, Timothy Burnham - wearer of plaid boxer shorts, gobbler of multivitamins, disciple of Samuel Johnson -reluctantly vaults from the contented obscurity of siring 400-word toasts and forgettable proclamations to become the President's confidant. His abrupt transit was not sought, nor is it smooth. Within days Burnham gains Q clearance - access to nuclear secrets - loses his politically pious wife, becomes amorously entwined with a honey-haired Soviet spy and defuses a Cuban crisis of sorts by cutting a deal with a transsexual in-law. Not your average bureaucrat's 8 to 4:30 tour, but then Burnham is not your average bureaucrat. He is profane, well-read, insubordinate, creative when pressed and certainly funnier than most foot soldiers in the long gray flannel line. At the top he becomes predictably pixilated with power, though, happily, he does not dull out before his equally predictable fall.",1986-07-27T05:00:00+0000

It could also appeal, but analysts said that was unlikely.

None of the musicians wanted to play bass, so a singer, two guitarists, and a drummer constituted the group at its first performances.

[ D14. ] The tax revision deadlock was apparently broken by several Senate concessions. Lawmakers said that the Senator conferees had agreed to raise some business taxes, especially for banks, and to allow more generous deductions for certain individuals. Representative Rostenkowski, head of the House delegation, said he would make a counteroffer today that would modify the Senate proposal only slightly.

The problem is apparently being caused by excess water in the ground around your basement walls. The best way to solve it is to have a good waterproofing contractor excavate around the outside walls.

Logan's not entirely original theory that ''of all mankind's inventions, with the possible exception of language itself, nothing has proved more useful or led to more innovations than the alphabet.'' Not only has it ''contributed to the development of codified law, monotheism, abstract science, deductive logic, and individualism, each a unique contribution of Western thought,'' the alphabet ''has also served as a model for classification.'' More significantly still, ''it has provided us with a conceptual framework for analysis and has restructured our perceptions of reality.'' As Mr. Logan concludes: ''These effects take place independent of what we read. The information that is coded is not important; it is the act of coding itself that has been so influential and acted as a springboard for new ideas.'' In other words, the medium of the alphabet has been the message.",1986-07-31T05:00:00+0000
