us,PULSE; Making Scents Of the Past,"It used to be possible to tell magazines apart by smell alone: women's glossies reeked of perfume; respectable science periodicals did not. But this month, National Geographic features a story, ''Perfume, the Essence of Illusion,'' illustrated (aromatized?) with the signature fragrances worn by Napoleon Bonaparte and Cleopatra. The Emperor's citrusy cologne (a sort of eau de Lemon Pledge) was recreated by Jean Kerleo, the chief perfumer at Jean Patou (creators of Joy). The formula for Napoleon's scent survived in his valet's estate, and was loaned by the Osmotheque, a fragrance museum in Versailles, France. An Italian chemist mixed Roman unguents to reconstruct what Cleopatra might have doused the sails of her barge with when receiving Mark Antony. Readers have been asking to buy the scents, but National Geographic has no plans to develop them commercially. In France, no one seems to want to cheapen Bonaparte's name by reducing it to a marketing campaign. And Cleopatra's scent, with its rare alchemy of myrrh, balsam and saffron, is roughly 10 times as expensive to produce as Napoleon's, let alone a few ounces of Gucci Envy.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Not One of the Boys,"Scholars have had a difficult time reconstructing the life and career of the painter Mary Cassatt, an American expatriate who settled in Paris in 1874 and showed her work with the inner circle of the French Impressionists throughout that decade. Not only was the genteel, Pittsburgh-born Cassatt intensely private (she did not keep a diary and destroyed most of her letters), but she was routinely neglected by the fiercely nationalistic French art press, who belittled her as a foreigner and an unmarried woman. She was also undervalued at home by a still tradition-bound art audience, who did not appreciate her unconventional use of color and asymmetrical compositions until late in her career. Cassatt's access to fresh experience was similarly restricted by her sex and class. Unlike her male contemporaries, who could paint scenes from the Parisian dance halls and brothels, Cassatt's subject matter was confined to that which befitted her lofty upper-middle-class station: mothers and children, and women in domestic settings. Despite these impediments, argues Judith A. Barter, curator of American arts at the Art Institute of Chicago in MARY CASSATT: Modern Woman (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, $65), Cassatt managed to present an image of women that reflected their growing self-sufficiency and responsibilities. Cassatt's friendship with her mentor, Edgar Degas, her innovations in work with pastels and her critical role as art adviser to the Havemeyers, the wealthy American benefactors of the Metropolitan Museum, are also examined. This book, while by no means revolutionary, expands upon what has been a limited, sentimentalized view of Cassatt. Andrea Barnet",1998-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Fencers, Drinkers and Sausage Makers","The beasts in Magnus Mills's dark and funny first novel, THE RESTRAINT OF BEASTS (Arcade, $22.95), are its three central characters: the nameless narrator, a rather unassertive English foreman for a fence contractor in rural Scotland, and his assistants, Tam and Richie, slacker metalheads and lifelong drinking buddies. Previously assigned to build a fence for Mr. McCrindle, a local dairy farmer, Tam and Richie have done a predictably negligent job, and when the narrator joins them to complete the work, things begin to go hilariously, fatally wrong. The first of many dire work-related accidents occurs, killing Mr. McCrindle; the luckless band of fence builders simply buries him and moves on to the next job. Things only get worse. More accidents, more deaths, more nonchalant burials, a brutish and unvarying routine of working by day and drinking by night -- the plot seems as suffocating and claustrophobic as the apparently ubiquitous fencing that's mysteriously going up everywhere. When the narrator and his two henchmen meet with and are employed by the sinister Hall Brothers -- rival fence-builders who are also ranchers and sausage makers (a skill of which they are ominously proud) -- the narrative takes on an even more nightmarish aspect. In the process, ''The Restraint of Beasts'' slyly reveals itself to be much more than a black comedy about mind-numbed laborers building an endless series of fences; rather, it is a witty, intricate fable about a working-class hell constructed by its own inhabitants. Mills, himself a former fence builder and bus driver, writes merciless deadpan dialogue. And he uses it to create a clever, uncompromising fever dream, similar in mood to the Coen brothers' film ''Barton Fink,'' with its increasingly compromised central character and escalating atmosphere of unseen menace.

Bassist, songwriter and arranger Mark Randall Jordan who had been a founding member of the New York based alternative pop band, PAXTON, died peacefully in his sleep on October 30th following a 2 year battle with liver cancer. He was 33 years old. The Lamar, MO native first moved into the national music spotlight in the late 80's with his band ''Donnie and the Rock'' while touring with the ''The Kinks.'' In the early 90's Randy appeared on two widely successful albums with Sony Record's ''The Front'' and ''Baker's Pink'' and had toured extensively throughout The United States and Europe sharing the bill with music superstars including Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, and Lenny Kravitz. In 1995, Mr. Jordan co-founded the band ''PAXTON'' with his close personal friend and confidant Jann Paxton. Although most known for his bass playing, Randy was instrumental in the arranging, mixing and songwriting of the band's recent debut album on Nemperor/Razor and Tie Records and his song ''Which Way Do You Go'' was the band's first release. A private memorial service was held yesterday at the home of Underdog Music, CEO, Christopher H. Browne. In lieu of flowers, it was Mr. Jordan's request that a small contribution be given in his name to God's Love We Deliver or City Meals on Wheels. Mark Randall Jordan was baptized at The Grace Lutheran Church in Lamar, MO and is survived by his mother, Mrs. Erma Lee Jordan and his beloved sister Judy Jordan. He will be missed by all his band mates and fans, past and present. ''Randy was know for his kindness and generosity by all who were privileged to know him.

A dedicated pediatrician and longtime faculty member of the Department of Pediatrics. A native of Germany, Dr. Meldola received her medical degree in 1934 from the University of Hamburg. The rise of the Nazis interfered with her medical education-as a Jew she couldn't obtain an internship in a recognized hospital. She spent the next four years assisting her father Eduardo, also a physician in his medical practice. In 1938 she immigrated to Holland and worked underground in two hospitals in Amsterdam during the Nazi occupation until she was deported to the concentration camps of Auschwitz Bergen Belsen and Buchenwald where she also served as a physician. Dr. Meldola immigrated to the United States in 1947. After completing a research fellowship in tuberculosis at Bellevue Hospital, an affiliate of NYU Medical Center, she became a faculty member in the Department of Pediatrics in 1953. She was also in private practice for many years in New York City. She retired in 1983. We extend our deepest sympathy to her family. Robert M.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Before He Was Elvis,"Two months after Elvis Presley released his first album in March 1956, a photographer for Seventeen magazine named Marvin Israel caught him on tour at the University of Dayton. ELVIS PRESLEY 1956 (Abrams, $17.95), a gritty compilation of dozens of previously unpublished black-and-white photos, was the result. Seventeen probably passed because the photos of the rising teen idol were too raw: the black-rimmed, raccoon-like eyes, the pitted skin and the electric current that seemed to ripple through Presley's spine. We also see his natural charm: a picture of a smiling Elvis, en pointe, knees splayed, cradling his leather-embossed guitar; a gauzy picture of his Pharaonic features that makes him look like a god from ancient Memphis. Portraits of the fans capture an era: girls in their Junior League best with polka-dot bows, and their gape-mouthed, sullen dates; a leather-jacketed Natalie Wood look-alike scowls in front of a 30-foot-tall cutout of Presley at the premiere of ''Love Me Tender,'' his first film, at the Paramount in Times Square. Israel, who went on to become one of the most influential photo editors of the 1960's, commissioning work by Diane Arbus, Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander, had an intimate access to Presley before he became a superstar that comes across in the photos. The text is perfunctory (''in 1956 Elvis was a rocket'') and identifying captions would help, but the images speak for themselves. Eric P. Nash",1998-11-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Carver in Short,"The novel Raymond Carver occasionally spoke of writing never materialized. Who can say, had he escaped death from lung cancer at the age of 50, whether it ever would have? Carver was disposed to the short form, and if he is the story writer of Teacher's Scotch and domestic dissolution, then in ALL OF US: The Collected Poems (Knopf, $27.50) he is their poet as well. The four volumes collected here by William L. Stull (who also provides ample biographical material, a chronology and exhaustive appendixes) were mostly written in the 1980's, during the final decade of Carver's life; they capture in verse much of the same pared narrative power that distinguishes his fiction. Throughout the book, simple declarative sentences pile up like collection notices as Carver's plain-spoken diction lends immediacy to his characters' downward spins and sporadic redemptions. As an offshoot of his desire to blur the lines between poetry and prose, Carver even arranges passages from the stories of his beloved Chekhov, lining them up like verse. For Carver himself, however, the strongest poems begin where his own stories end, in moments of lyrical insight that leave narrative to one side. In ''September,'' ''Near Klamath'' and ''Late Fragment,'' for example, he discovers his own perfect music and density of expression. Other poems, while sharing the melancholy humanity of his stories, never quite realize their potential as verse. Still, their willed artlessness and unflinching emotions commend them to us. Like the fresh rolls a baker offers to grieving parents in one of Carver's stories, each of them is ''a small, good thing.'' David Yezzi",1998-11-08T05:00:00+0000

It is true that there have been, and will continue to be, excesses in the name of liberty; people of good will are striving to work out correctives that are fair to all. But the mix of extreme intolerance and aggression that characterizes the agenda of today's conservatives is precisely what our Founding Fathers were at such pains to preserve us from.

Among those dismayed by Mr. Horgan's argument was Sir John Maddox, who in two stints as editor of the British journal Nature (from 1966 to 1973 and from 1980 to 1995) provoked controversy himself with commentaries on everything from the Big Bang to homeopathy.

It was for them the end of the road that is, until a lone figure began to stand tall against the tide of selfsympathy, with her own failedparenting scars clearly visible and with a passion for gentle confrontation, she led generations of parents to the hard-ground of vital, responsible parenting. And Daytop overnight became ''A Family Repair Station'' with Roxy both teacher-extraordinaire and role model. Tennyson phrased it aptly in his mourning over Maud: ''There has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate!'' Her memory is deeply cherished; her footprints a lasting guide.

He began his undergraduate degree at University of Southern California and graduated from the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. He received a masters degree from the American Film Institute in screenwriting. He later graduated from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, and became a member of the California Bar.

Given the chance, he would certainly have become one of the major figures of the west coast contemporary art scene. Robert was the Vice President and Director of Legal Affairs for the Anaheim Indoor Marketplace. Robert is survived by his parents Lois and Barry Weiss of Tenafly, New Jersey, his sister Janet Dwork of Jupiter, Florida, and his brother-inlaw Dr. Thom Dwork, and his nephews Teddy and Alex.

The liquidation came in tandem with Safeway's joining the Standard & Poor's 500. Safeway said the sale was meant to put more of the company's shares into the public float. Of the 20 million shares sold, about 17 million were owned by Kohlberg Kravis outright and 3 million were owned by an affiliate, SSI Equity, Safeway said. The sale brings the firm's stake down to 13.2 percent from 16.7 percent.

Ronald B.'s game of choice is football: he keeps his own statistics, makes his own power ratings and has pipelines to locker rooms in every N.F.L. city. More important, he has great instincts. ''I just get a feeling in my gut,'' he says. All told, Ronald B. claims that he's right 58 percent of the time -- and for a gambler, that's huge.",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

And through the eyes of his young narrator, a 22-year-old aspiring writer named Cricket Collins, we see the experience not just for Cricket and his fellow Americans but also for those Britons and Australians who join them as English teachers in Japan, flocking to the Orient in search of an alternative to the traditional European adventure. It is the late 1970's, when life in Japan is particularly enticing to an aimless recent college graduate, and Cricket and his peers find the elegant beauty of the tea ceremony, the calming discipline of Aikido and the politeness of the Japanese people to be both alien and irresistible. But Galef adds a layer of complexity to this account of Cricket's adventures, revealing the vulnerability that may result from too rapid an effort to shed one's own cultural skin. When Cricket hooks up with a Japanese girlfriend, he hopes their relationship will increase his sense of well-being, making him feel more firmly established in her country. Not surprisingly, and much to his chagrin, his contentment is brief -- and is followed by a breakdown that leaves him weakened and shamed. In the months that follow, as Cricket must choose between returning to a homeland where he no longer truly feels at home and remaining in a place where he may never be truly accepted, Galef produces a chilling denouement for this nicely detailed exploration of cultural dislocation.

Billed as ''The Complete Recording,'' the two-CD set is in fact a good deal more complete than the several previous recordings of the score. An appendix after the finale of the show as presented in Millburn last spring includes eight numbers cut from various productions of the show (although two from the 1987 London production are still unaccounted for), sung by the Paper Mill cast members and recorded under Mr. Sondheim's acute ear. Liner notes include full lyrics and three short essays, and the cover art faithfully depicts the Millburn cast, right down to Ann Miller in her slit-to-the-thigh blue-sequined sheath.

Kim Novak, as a local beauty who absconds with the drifter, is not quite convincing. Neither is the premise of the play, but a good cast and director make the picture work.

De Bossen, from Belgium, did a killer version of ''Dagger Moon.'' After 10 years of limited success at home, overseas fame is the band's perverse badge of status: they are just too alternative for the U.S. market. ",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Children's Books in Brief; Let's Misbehave,"First, let's give David Shannon his due as a deeply serious illustrator of children's books. He has collaborated with the estimable Jane Yolen on such worthy volumes as ''Encounter,'' the story of Columbus's discovery of the New World as recounted in halting English by a native Taino boy, and the based-on-fact proto-feminist fable ''The Ballad of the Pirate Queens.'' His portrayal of America's mythic giant, Paul, avec famille et ox in Audrey Wood's book ''The Bunyans'' earned an ABC Children's Booksellers' Choice award. And the sports fable Shannon wrote and illustrated, ''How Georgie Radbourn Saved Baseball,'' was a 1994 New York Times Best Illustrated Book. So it is with great relief for children everywhere that I can now report David Shannon is applying his considerable talents to the sillier side of life. To wit: earlier this year ''A Very Bad Case of Stripes'' (a colorful ode to self-acceptance) and now his latest book, NO, DAVID! (Blue Sky/Scholastic, $14.95; ages 2 to 6) -- a hilarious compilation of toddlers' wrongdoings. As the author's note explains: ''A few years ago, my mother sent me a book I made when I was a little boy. It was called 'No, David' and it was illustrated with drawings of David doing all sorts of things he wasn't supposed to do.'' Shannon remains true to the spirit of this earlier work with a restrained prose style -- ''No, David!'' ''I said no, David!'' and ''That's enough, David!'' Likewise, the quasi-stick-figure drawings of little David are a clearly humorous homage to his original depictions. Parents might weary of the chastising tone -- until they start chuckling, probably about where I did, at the two-page spread of an open-mouthed David hollering through a mouthful of vegetables. Children, on the other hand, will recognize immediately that they have found a kindred spirit. M. P. Dunleavey",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

He was born March 18, 1906, in Atlantic City, NJ, a son of the late David and Bertha (Beckman) Degenstein. Mr. Degenstein's family moved in 1906 from Atlantic City to Philadelphia, where his father established D. Degenstein & Company, a ladies' coat and suit manufacturing company. Mr. Degenstein married the former Claire Elizabeth ''Betty'' Weis, who died February 25, 1978. On January 3, 1980, he married the former Lore A. (Tromsdorf) Stock. Mr. Degenstein was a graduate of the Charles Morris Price School of Advertising and Temple University, both of Philadelphia. He began his career at Stern and Company, Philadelphia, with a brief stint at Progress Manufacturing Company in New York City. During his Philadelphia days, he met Claire Elizabeth Weis and her father, Sigmund, both of whom cast an important influence upon Mr. Degenstein's life. Following his marriage to Betty Weis, he moved to Sunbury, PA, where he was an executive at Weis Pure Food Stores, later called Weis Markets, Inc. He continued in that company's work as it grew to a most successful chain of supermarkets now serving a six-state area. Mr. Degenstein was a member of the Sunbury Rotary Club since 1950 and was past president; president of Susquehanna Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Sunbury Industrial Drive; member of the board of the Sunbury Youth and Community Center during the construction of the pool and skating rink; director of the YMCA; member and past president of the Susquehanna Valley Country Club; served on the Susquehanna University Board of Directors and was an honorary member of the Susquehanna University Board of Directors at the time of his death; and was recently named an honorary life member of the Americus Hose Company, Sunbury. He was a member of B'Nai Zion Temple. He was chief benefactor of the Degenstein Foundations, which have benefited Pennsylvania's Susquehanna Valley since the 1970s. He was chief benefactor of the Lore Degenstein Gallery at Susquehanna University through an endowment made by him in honor of his wife. He was also chief benefactor of the Degenstein Scholars Program which benefits students in the university's Sigmund Weis School of Business. In addition to his wife, surviving are three stepsons, Marlin Stock of Orwigsburg, Steven Stock of Selinsgrove and Charles Stock of Santa Barbara, CA, one stepdaughter, Nancy Stock Hunsinger of Danville; three step-grandchildren; one brother and sister-in-law, Lester and Lila Degenstein of New York, NY; sister-in-law, Janet C. Weis; four nieces, Susan Mindel, Nancy Wender, Ellen Goldstein and Jane Zweifler; and two nephews, Walter Zweifler and Lee Degenstein. He was preceded in death by one sister, Anita Zweifler, and one brother-in-law, Sigfried Weis. The funeral was on Friday, November 13, at the Degenstein Center Theater at the Charles B.

Yahoo! stock opened for business at $4.33 a share (split-adjusted, I scarcely need to mention), and by the end of that first day, the stock had risen 154 percent. That's a bigger first-day gain than even during Netscape's fabled I.P.O. Presto! Filo and Yang, who held 31 percent of the stock, were suddenly worth a combined $270 million.

Genetic tests have linked Jefferson to Hemings's final child, Eston, born in 1808. But even historians who defended Jefferson for decades are finding it hard to believe that he avoided Hemings while the two were young and vital and made her his lover only as he approached the grave.

The one by Ann Hassett, illustrated by John Hassett (Walter Lorraine/Houghton Mifflin, $15; ages 3 to 8), is funny and whimsical and engaging, while the one by Anne Isaacs, illustrated by Stephen Mackey (Dutton, $15.99; ages 3 to 5), is just pretentious. The Hassetts' Nana Quimby, plump and bespectacled in sneakers, apron and purple polka-dot house dress, is in the middle of baking chocolate chip cookies when she sees a cat who needs help. Five, then 10, then 15, on up to 40 cats end up in the tree outside Nana Quimby's window. She calls the Fire Department: '' 'Sorry,' said the firehouse, 'we do not catch cats up a tree anymore. Call back if that cat starts playing with matches.' '' The police are interested only if the cats rob a bank, and the pet store says, ''Call back if the cats wish to buy a dog.'' The zoo, the post office, the library, City Hall, nobody wants to help, so Nana Quimby throws the telephone out the window and into the tree, and the cats walk across its wire and into her arms. When the town that wouldn't help finds itself overrun with mice and calls her, they find out just how much help they can expect in return: '' 'Sorry,' said Nana Quimby, 'the cats do not catch mice anymore. Call back if you wish to hear cats purr.' '' John Hassett paints a delightful world with grape jelly-bean clouds and noodle cats with spaghetti tails who curl and drape and leap in every which way and every which color. This is a book to read and reread, with cats to count and recount, and little visual details like satellite dishes and mice on windowsills to spot with each new pass. Sadly, Anne Isaacs, the author of the Caldecott Honor book ''Swamp Angel,'' loses her footing with her collection of poems about a cat up a tree. The verse is filled with embarrassing metaphysical vocabulary: how does one explain phrases like ''Pour down your cold, transmuting fire'' to a small or medium-sized child, and why would one bother? John Donne meets T. S. Eliot this ain't; and Stephen Mackey's murky oil paintings of poets, pyramids and moonlight lack spark and wit. What's in a name? Jen Nessel",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Elegant in a white suit, surrounded by crystal, mirrors and candlelight, Chanel commandeered the entranced former king for an intimate talk, barely interrupted by dinner. She was nearly 87 at the time. So begins CHANEL: Her Style and Her Life (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $35), a fascinating and visually stunning biography by Janet Wallach, the author of ''Desert Queen,'' a biography of Gertrude Bell. Born into poverty in 1883 and motherless before her 12th birthday, Chanel spent her adolescence in an orphanage, abandoned by her father. At the age of 18, she was sent as a charity student to a convent boarding school where she learned to sew. Chanel started making pared-down and simply styled clothing for herself, and began a career. Already an established figure by the start of World War I, she came to include in her circle Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau and Diaghilev; Stravinsky was yet another lover. Wallach wryly observes that while Chanel pursued painters, poets and musicians, she ardently desired the extravagance that only aristocrats could provide. She was an inveterate snob throughout her life. Arrested after World War II for her liaison with a German officer, she escaped imprisonment and public humiliation, Wallach surmises, ''perhaps with the help of Churchill,'' an early acquaintance. About her Nazi lover, Chanel said feistily, ''At my age, when a man wants to sleep with you, you don't ask to see his passport.'' Lynn Karpen",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

He also, or so it was said, took brand-new shirts from Brooks Brothers and painstakingly frayed the cuffs with sandpaper. This was at Yale in the late 60's, during the last wheezing gasp -- the final catarrh -- of the patrician ethos that held that the ultimate status, the highest social perch, belonged to those who seemingly paid no attention to status. That poor Yalie, with his tape and sandpaper, made the fatal mistake, of course: he cared too much and, worse, was seen to care. But in other respects he understood the code perfectly. In those days, old was still good. Shabby was good. Instead of renting a tuxedo, for example, or even buying a new one, it was far cooler to borrow your great-uncle Ned's -- that hand-sewn mohair dreadnought, now mossy with age, that he wore to the Stork Club in the 40's while squiring tipsy debutantes. What recommended this mothy garment was not just its special flask pocket or the cigarette burn on the left lapel but that it (quietly) advertised you as someone who came from tuxedo-wearing stock, the sort of people who donned formal wear all the time and not just on self-conscious occasions.",1998-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Dorsey hired Oliver away from Lunceford's organization in 1939, and the musical effect was immediate: as Mr. Faddis joked, it ''changed the complexion'' of Dorsey's music.

To try to break the cycle, some citizens' groups in Bosnia are proposing a commission to write a common history. The goal may be elusive, but is well worth a try. The idea shows how more and more nations emerging from tyranny or war are designing independent groups, commonly known as truth commissions, to examine the causes and tell the full story of past crimes.

To make it case, the committee has opened an exhibition observing its 25th anniversary, to continue through next month at the Newark Public Library, 49 Washington Street. Photographs, documents and artifacts demonstrate that the committee has helped establish three historic districts in the city and has worked to have 60 buildings, parks, cemeteries and sculptures listed on the national and state Registers of Historic Places. Among them are Gutzon Borglum's 1916 sculpture ''Indian and Puritan'' at Washington Park, shown here. Drawings of seven landmarks by Richard LaRovere of Jersey City are available as note cards (some as postcards) at the Newark Museum gift shop, or by mail by calling (973) 622-4910. The exhibition is open during library hours: Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5:30 P.M., and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 8:30 P.M.",1998-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Over the course of the next several years, the man who made ballet a modern art enshrined the woman who would become his fifth wife in a series of roles that bear her imprint to this day. Since his arrival in America in 1933, journalists had been asking Balanchine what constituted the ideal body for a dancer. He replied that he was looking for long legs, a strong back, light bones (''like a bird's'') and a small head. In his other ballerinas he had found two -- maybe three -- of those qualities; in Tanaquil Le Clercq he hit the jackpot.",1998-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Crowds cheering the troops into World War I, the folly of the Treaty of Versailles, the masses on their feet in Nazi salute at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin -- and on and on. THE CENTURY (Doubleday, $60) is comprehensive, balanced, eminently readable and fairly onerous, taken cover to cover. The narrative by Peter Jennings, the broadcaster, and Todd Brewster, a former editor and writer at Life, is a good textbook history of the American experience of the 20th century, told from the perspective of the American 1990's, rather than what might have been more interesting, the century as seen from each of its successive eras. Important phases and events are captured in a series of first-person accounts, most filling a single page, with a boxed biography of the speaker and several photographs, often snapshots; together these form an effective, and in some ways more satisfying narrative, and are the real meat of this book. The photo selection of Katherine Bourbeau is excellent, with an eye for the unfamiliar image (John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon in a handshake that separates rather than brings them together; students at Harvard mourning Kennedy's murder), while a familiar image like Dorothea Lange's ''Migrant Mother'' is treated as subject rather than illustration, and captioned with a quotation from the photographer, describing the circumstances of the shot.

The Sirene Spa at 1044 Madison Avenue (79th Street) has that covered. When Sirene discovered that roughly 20 percent of its customers were going through divorces, it designed an acupuncture program. Dr. Helen Zhang, a physician who is Sirene's chief acupuncturist, says the treatments ($55 for a 45-minute session) focus on the kidney, liver, spleen and skin meridians for common complaints associated with divorce: irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, insomnia. Chip Brown, author of ''Afterward, You're a Genius,'' an investigation into alternative medicine due from Riverhead Books in January, said that while acupuncture can treat problems that often come up on an analyst's couch, divorce acupuncture cleverly packages a general tonic.

Jacob Rosenbaum is a gay activist, yet he is more successful in accepting his sexuality than in sustaining intimate relationships. In contrast, his brother, Jonathan, has embraced the strictures of Orthodox Judaism at a yeshiva in Israel. Although Jonathan expresses disgusted hostility when confronted with his brother's life as a gay man, Jacob still cares for him and mourns the loss of the closeness they once had as children. Reconciliation becomes possible only when their beloved grandmother falls into a coma after a severe stroke, precipitating a family crisis and exposing secrets that have shaped the lives of all her loved ones ever since she and her husband fled the Holocaust for America. As he blends the past and the present, Lowenthal uses luminous language that often imbues ordinary gestures and events with deeper meaning. ''The Same Embrace'' is an eloquent exploration of the nature of faith, the consequences of judgment and the stubborn endurance of family ties. Linda Barrett Osborne",1998-11-22T05:00:00+0000

But James Austin, chairman of the school's Initiative on Social Enterprise, saw an important business principle at work.

us,Poetry in Emotion,"What do close friends talk about? Big issues like religion and family, love and health, but filtered through details of daily life. Alicia Suskin Ostriker, an English professor at Rutgers University who lives in Princeton, sees her poetry as a means to ''to fill the center'' those details surround, to strip away the censorship. Her latest collection, ''The Little Space: Poems Selected and New, 1968-1998'' (University of Pittsburgh Press, $16.95 in paperback), her ninth poetry collection, was a National Book Award finalist this year. Many of the experiences and emotions in it are told from a woman's perspective: events like pregnancy and childbirth, marriage and motherhood, aging and illness. Some perspectives are Jewish (one poem is titled ''Holocaust,'' another ''Diaspora''). Some are both. All are written so that readers who have been in these places feel a kinship with her and those who haven't can understand. Friends talk about the weather, too. A new poem, ''April One,'' begins:",1998-11-29T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; What Women Want,"Female sexual passion is often portrayed as sophomoric romance or as the ecstasy following a high-end shopping spree. The Erotic Lives of Women (Scalo, $45) is different, and should be honored as one of the most gutsy and imaginative erotic books of the decade. Linda Troeller, an American photographer, and Marion Schneider, a German writer, photographed and interviewed 30 women from the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa. They include a Brazilian singer, a Japanese-American flower designer, a black American legal secretary, Islamic housewives and Moroccan belly dancers. None of these women are model look-alikes, but each is irrefutably seductive in her story and image. The honesty in the interviews is extraordinary. The kinds of excuses, politically correct slogans and gauzy fuzz that frequently suffocate erotic candor are simply not here. The women tell their stories straight out, and leave it to you to be aroused, disturbed or enlightened. The photographs and the interviews were done at the same time, to create a match between image and text, and the experiment proves to be unexpected and moving. One woman, Nadia, a 36-year-old cigarette vendor in Morocco, answered: ''Living by myself, earning my own money, that is most erotic for me. . . . Being able to smoke cigarettes wherever I like to and to smoke hashish when I feel like it gives me such a strong feeling.'' She is depicted spreading apart her djellaba like a pair of wings.

But Senator Orrin Hatch was right to send up a warning about Ms. Reno's motives. The need for an independent counsel with broad powers to examine the White House's 1996 fund-raising has been established by journalistic accounts and Congressional hearings, and by legal opinions from the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the former chief prosecutor of the Justice Department's campaign-finance task force. So far Ms. Reno has managed to avoid taking their advice by singling out subsidiary activities like Mr. Gore's phone calls and citing narrow legal grounds for preliminary inquiries. In the days ahead, Mr. Hatch warned, we will learn whether the Attorney General will undermine ''the rule of law and integrity of the Department of Justice'' by preventing an unbiased inquiry into the Democratic effort to circumvent campaign laws, to use White House invitations to entice donors and to collect suspicious foreign contributions.",1998-11-29T05:00:00+0000

At a table in the elegant long drawing room, I proposed that he fill out the account of Wilson he had begun in a short memoir published a few years earlier. Berlin had offered there an impression of Wilson's ''curiously strangled voice, with gaps between his sentences, as if ideas jostled and thrashed about inside him,'' emerging in ''short bursts, emitted staccato, interspersed with gentle, low-voiced, legato passages.'' His own deep soft voice also came in bursts, trailing off at the end of a breath and emphatically resuming. For two and a half hours (with an intermission for tea) he displayed a penetrating intelligence, warmth of heart and moral seriousness that reminded me of the same qualities in his old friend.

''A person doesn't have a right to so much happiness,'' Olivia tells herself one day while they're talking about buying a beachfront vacation cottage in Rhode Island. Naturally, soon after they take up residence, David goes out jogging and is killed by a reckless driver. At first, RUBY (Picador USA, $22) resembles one of those stories in which a tragedy-beset heroine is portrayed as bravely picking up the pieces. But Ann Hood's sly, incisive novel soon breaks free from this familiar ground, deftly exploring the strange rhythms of mourning, the unpredictable and unavoidable demands of sorrow. Months after David's funeral, a grief-numbed Olivia returns to the beach house, intending to tidy the place up before selling it -- only to discover that a pregnant teen-age runaway has taken up residence. Clever and voluble, Ruby quickly explains that she has been shunned both by her mother and stepfather and by the baby's frat-boy father. Olivia formulates a plan that feels to her like fate: She will take Ruby in, care for her and pay her medical bills -- if Ruby will let Olivia adopt the baby. While lies, betrayals and manipulations give the plot its undeniable page-turning pull, Hood's caustic wit, brightly detailed prose and thoughtful delineations of two women struggling with private, powerful regrets supply ''Ruby'' with rich and surprising emotional depths.

Then there are the wondrously eccentric characters, including one grand old dame (the former owner of the sable coat) and a supremely self-centered little girl named Pansy.

''It started off as a little bit of a joke,'' says Craig Yarde, the company president, ''but we think it sends a message that we're all in this together.'' The one-stop bathroom, which will feature a common hand-washing area with private stalls, is inspired by the Fox network show wherein annoyingly whimsical lawyers debate life's mysteries in a unisex bathroom. It might even be a trend. According to Andrew DuBrin, an industrial psychologist, space planners find that unisex facilities are increasingly popular among workers.
