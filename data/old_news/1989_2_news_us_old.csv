us,Dining Out Guide: Romantic,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Bouley ** (Nov. 20, 1987), 165 Duane Street (608-3852) - With Valentine's Day approaching, many couples are seeking restaurants that have not only good food but a romantic ambiance as well. Bouley, one of New York's prettiest restaurants, serves a Provencal menu in its dining room decorated with Impressionist paintings and 18-foot window boxes, now planted with tulips and wildflowers. Current appetizers include cured gravlax of tuna, and Maine salmon with crab meat, tomato horseradish and chervil vinaigrette. Among the entrees are sea scallops with verjus sauce on puree of celery root; rack of lamb, and roasted pigeon served on sweet onions and red cabbage. An appropriate dessert might be the ''romantic chocolate plate'' with five chocolate treats. The five-course lunch is $32 prix fixe; the nine-course tasting menu at dinner is $65. A la carte prices at dinner are $6 to $16 for appetizers, $19 to $27 for entrees. Open noon to 3 P.M. and 6 to 11 P.M. Friday, 6 to 11 P.M. Saturday. Closed Sunday. Restaurant Raphael ** (Nov. 28, 1986), 33 West 54th Street (582-8993) - Elegance and tranquillity in a town house setting are characteristics of this restaurant. The long rectangular dining room has a decorative fireplace and pale yellow walls alternating with murals of southern France. A romantic dinner could begin with duck confit salad or seafood ravioli in saffron sauce. Among the entrees are marinated and roasted lamb with green lentils, poached lobster with fresh pasta, and veal medallions with rosemary sauce. For dessert, passion-fruit mousse is recommended. Appetizers are $9.50 to $10.50, entrees $19.50 to $28. Dinner 6 to 10 P.M. Friday, 6 to 11 P.M. Saturday. Closed Sunday. The Terrace ** (March 21, 1986), 400 West 119th Street (666-9490) - The Terrace has many romantic enticements, among them sensational views uptown and down. Well-spaced tables are delicately appointed with tall candles and single red roses, and the menu leans toward classic French with a light touch. Some of these preparations include appetizers of Wellfleet oysters with sauce mignonette, and terrine of roasted eggplant, tomato and sweet pepper. Featured main courses are medallions of salmon with caviar and sorrel, grilled beef fillet with red-wine-marrow sauce, and breast and confit of Muscovy duck with port wine and figs. Raspberry napoleon is an exceptionally good dessert choice. On Valentine's Day the Terrace offers a $58 prix fixe menu from 6 to 9:30 P.M. (A $20 deposit is required.) Regular a la carte prices are $9.50 to $21 for appetizers, $24 to $28 for entrees. Open 6 to 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Trastevere ** (Sept. 6, 1985), 309 East 83d Street (734-6343) - This tiny slice of a Roman-style restaurant has a candlelit, brick-walled dining room. Trastevere's traditional homespun offerings are prepared with quality ingredients and include appetizers of lightly fried spiedino alla Romana made with prosciutto, mozzarella and anchovy sauce, and mussels in garlic-spiked tomato broth. Good pasta choices (which can be divided as a first course) are linguine with white clam sauce, and cappellini primavera. The limited entree menu has three chicken, three veal and four seafood dishes. Appetizers are $5.95 to $7.95, entrees $10.95 to $24.95. Open 5 to 11 P.M. Friday to Sunday. Water's Edge * (Jan. 2, 1987), East River Yacht Club, 44th Drive at the East River, Long Island City, Queens (718-482-0033) - There is romance on the industrial waterfront of Queens: the Water's Edge, cool-white and glassy, offers a stunning panorama of midtown Manhattan and a setting designed to inspire heartfelt conversation. The menu includes appetizers of grilled quail breasts and chestnut ravioli, and white bean and shrimp chili. Recommended entrees are sauteed Dover sole and rack of lamb. Other choices from the current menu are grilled bluefin tuna, and veal chop with a potato napoleon, green peppercorns and cognac. Strawberry shortcake might be a romantic's choice for dessert. For Valentine's Day, the restaurant will offer a four-course dinner for two for $100 from 6 to 10:30 P.M. The shuttle boat from East 23d Street will operate off-season for that evening only.

President Alfredo Stroessner was the Western Hemisphere's senior leader. Page 1 News analysis: The Paraguay coup followed an intense power struggle within Gen. Alfredo Stroessner's regime between two factions warring to control the country after his death. 5 Vice President Quayle, in El Salvador, forcefully re-emphasized the United States' commitment to human rights, but declined to link American aid directly to the Government's human-rights record. 5 An accounting of Stalin's victims by a Soviet historian appeared in a mass-circulation newspaper. The report indicated that about 20 million died in camps, forced collectivization and famine. 1 The chief U.S. arms negotiator for talks over strategic missiles in Europe will be Richard Burt, the Ambassador to West Germany, the White House announced. 3 The Israeli Foreign Minister's view of the P.L.O. is that the group has remained unchanged and that a recent finding that Yasir Arafat's wing has ceased guerrilla attacks against Israel is irrelevant. 4 Tutu asks U.S. Jews to urge Palestinian pact 4 Britain is pressing to end sanctions by the West that were imposed on the Soviet Union after its forces swept into Afghanistan in 1979. The Bush Administration has not indicated its position. 3 Kabul's imminent collapse is predicted 3 Iran and Iraq have shown movement in their long-stalled peace negotiations, offering small concessions in talks with a United Nations mediator, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar reported. 3 National 6-10, 50 The number of workers surged last month, creating a record in the proportion of working-age people who held jobs. The number of those who wanted jobs also grew, slightly increasing the unemployment rate. 1 New Jersey's jobless rate drops, New York's is up 50 A rise in the dollar was stopped by another round of coordinated dollar-selling in the foreign exchange markets by the Federal Reserve Board and European central banks. 33 1988's average global temperature was the highest that has been recorded in this century, British scientists said. The findings do not contradict a recent report about average temperatures in America. 1 Arctic air around much of the nation continued its assault of bitter cold, sending temperatures plunging from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Lakes and icing the landscape from Texas to New England. 10 The White House counsel held a job as chairman of a $500 million company for six years while working for Presdient Bush. And the counsel, C. Boyden Gray, lacks familiarity with Government ethics procedures. 1 Dr. Louis Sullivan will not take pay from outside sources while serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Bush aides say, in a move to head off criticism of the Administration's ethical standards. 8 A plan to rescue the savings industry that puts the burden on private industry rather than taxpayers will be submitted to President Bush today by the Treasury Department, officials and industry experts said. 1 The fight over Congressional pay heated up with angry protests, criticism of the Senate from the Democratic leadership of the House, and an angst-ridden meeting of Democratic lawmakers. 1 AIDS testing as a prerequisite for marriage in Illinois has detected few cases of the disease in the program's first year, officials say. But it appears to have prompted thousands of people to get married elsewhere. 6 Philadelphia's child welfare agency has had its license revoked by Pennsylvania state officials for failure to meet the rising incidence of child abuse. The officials said government generally must do more to protect children. 6 Oil exploration and drilling in Alaska at the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was backed by Interior Secretary Lujan, who said energy resources on public lands should be exploited in an acceptable manner. 8 John Tower has sat through hearings on his confirmation as Secretary of Defense with grim-faced stoicism as former Senate colleagues, Federal agents and reporters raked through his personal life. 8 William Bennett's new role as leader of the Federal effort against drugs will clash with the roles of other Administration officials, Mr. Bennett acknowledged.

us,FICTION,"THE BODY POLITIC. By Victor Gold and Lynne Cheney. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) When art seeks so blatantly to imitate life, one asks, at the minimum, that it be done creatively. In ''The Body Politic,'' a slim novel annotated with fictitious transcripts and official-looking memorandums that attempts to hook readers with its snapshots of power plays inside the White House and on Capitol Hill, it unfortunately is not. Many of the worst cliches in American politics have been thickly strung together in this book by Victor Gold, a Washington author and the biographer of President Bush, and Lynne Cheney, a novelist and the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. It opens with an upper-crust Yankee Republican Vice President who serves an immensely popular but not too bright Commander in Chief. Inconveniently and unceremoniously, the Vice President dies of cardiac arrest while in bed with an extremely aggressive White House correspondent for a major television network. The plot unfolds over the next 200 pages: how and why the White House staff, the network star and the Vice President's wife agree to a cover-up that seeks to keep alive ''Stewart Bulloch (Bully) Vandercleve - Vice President, former Governor, ex-Ambassador, one-time Secretary of Defense, erstwhile perennial candidate for the Republican presidential nomination'' until after the Wisconsin primary. Dubbed Operation Avis, the plan to keep Bully alive is assisted by his able press secretary, Frank Lee, and a black mimic whose voice so closely resembles that of the dead Vice President that he can conduct a convincing telephone conversation with the President. Balanced precariously on a shaky foundation that mixes national security with the good of the Republican Party, this scheme is all too successful. Bully Vandercleve becomes a cult hero, although he hasn't been seen for months, and he emerges as the long-shot but likely winner of his party's nomination. Even in an election year, this would hardly be credible.",1989-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Hunt was one of the great eccentrics of American business - a man who thrived on high-stakes gambling, both at the poker table and in his business dealings. He also played high-risk games in his personal life. Through most of the years of his long and ostensibly happy first marriage, Hunt maintained separate family households with, successively, his two mistresses and his children by them. All told, Hunt fathered 15 children, the best known being Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who also gambled big in their unsuccessful bid to corner the world silver market in 1979-80. This love of high-risk wheeling and dealing is one of the major legacies H. L. Hunt left his children, Ardis Burst suggests in ''The Three Families of H. L. Hunt,'' her detailed family saga. Ms. Burst, a freelance writer in San Antonio, documents this provocative family history in a reportorial style that is heavy on facts but somewhat less satisfying when it comes to analysis. At times, distinctions between the many children and their families begin to blur - perhaps inevitably, since it would be difficult for any son or daughter to loom larger than H. L. Hunt himself, whose image was best captured by his daughter, June: ''He did not see himself as having to go by the ethics of - anything. . . . It was as though he was a god unto himself who could make his own rules. And the end justified the means.''",1989-02-05T05:00:00+0000

Except for upper-income black families, there really hasn't been any progress over the past decades. In fact, there has been some slippage. The median income for black families is $18,098.

Intensely ambitious and devoted to quality, David Puttnam, the British producer, attracted attention in the early 1980's with such films as ''Local Hero,'' ''Chariots of Fire'' and ''The Killing Fields.'' Success led Mr. Puttnam to become head of a major studio, Columbia Pictures, even though Hollywood and its mindless ''product'' represented everything he purported to detest. After a series of incautious pronouncements, Mr. Puttnam quickly alienated most of the prestigious agents, producers and movie stars he had to deal with. Finally, Columbia's parent company, Coca-Cola, dismissed him after a year. In the course of ''Fast Fade,'' we learn a lot about how movies are made today and especially how studios function within the huge multinational corporations that now own them. The endless backbiting that apparently sustains people in the film industry also offers its own perverse fascination. However, Andrew Yule's cautionary tale is too often invested with an air of grand tragedy that it does not deserve, and his obsessive dissection of Mr. Puttnam's downfall eventually becomes tiresome and repetitive. The writing is pedestrian when it is not gee-whiz, and Mr. Yule, the author of ''Hollywood-a-Go-Go,'' unfortunately seems to think that readability is best achieved through the piling on of cliches. We hear too much about what everybody thinks of Mr. Puttnam and not enough about what it all means. After a host of excruciatingly detailed analyses of each participant's motivation - compounded by a ''Rashomon''-like complexity of competing versions that are rarely reconciled - the reader may ultimately decide that he does not really care whose fault it all was.",1989-02-05T05:00:00+0000

There are those who still watch replays of the Mets' miraculous finish in the sixth game of the 1986 World Series or the Giants' drubbing of the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI. ''Wait Till Next Year'' brings, to those who care to look again, replays from New York's 1987 seasons in professional baseball, football and basketball in alternating chapters written by Mike Lupica, the New York Daily News sports columnist, and William Goldman, the novelist. The scenes include Dwight Gooden weeping silently when confronted with a report saying his urine tested positive for cocaine, members of the Yankees setting fire to a press statement by George Steinbrenner and Mark Gastineau being spat at by his teammates as he crossed the Jets' picket line during the 1987 strike. Mr. Lupica provides most of this action in sections called ''The Reporter's Notebook,'' which are an undigested collection of observations. Mr. Goldman's contributions, called ''A Fan's Notes,'' are presumably intended to tell the season's story from the point of view of the die-hard fan and thus shed light on the passion of fandom. Mainly he free-associates about players of earlier eras (better than today's, he insists), familiar sports arguments like Chamberlain versus Russell (Wilt all the way, he says) and sports announcers, and offers heated recitations of statistics. Mr. Goldman is a pretty good play-by-play guy himself when he describes one football game in Columbia University's monumental losing streak.

Nicholas Guzzone, a partner in the development, known as The Parking Club, said 24 units have been sold. He said the garage, which is park and lock, will be attended 24 hours a day. As an added sales inducement, Mr. Guzzone noted that the monthly maintenance fee, $115, includes 24-hour limousine transportation to and from the garage for owners living within a mile and a half of it, a radius that would encompass parts of Brooklyn Heights and Carroll Gardens.

In the author's fourth novel about depressed esthetes living in the cracks of New York's crumbling underside, an illustrator named Marian kills herself with a drug overdose. In 1987 our reviewer, Roberta Silman, said Madison Smartt Bell has ''an uncanny understanding of the way many people must struggle to live.'' THE PAPER: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune, by Richard Kluger with the assistance of Phyllis Kluger. (Vintage, $16.95.) Incorporating Horace Greeley's New York Tribune and James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald, The New York Herald Tribune earned a reputation as a newspaper that took stylish writing as seriously as good journalism. Tom Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin got their starts at New York magazine, which was once part of the paper's Sunday fare. Richard Kluger, who edited The Herald Tribune's Sunday book section in the 1960's, has told the story of the ill-fated newspaper, which died in 1966, with ''a narrative sweep that is always absorbing and sometimes breathtaking,'' The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in 1986. EMPEROR OF THE AIR, by Ethan Canin. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $7.95.) In the title piece of this collection of short stories, a high school astronomy teacher's campaign to save an old elm tree threatens to erupt into a neighborhood war. Though some of the stories are excessively artful, David Leavitt said here last year, ''one comes away from reading the best of them with the refreshing sense of having encountered a writer earnestly devoted to his craft.'' MONEY AND CLASS IN AMERICA: Notes and Observations on the Civil Religion, by Lewis H. Lapham. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Whether they inherit their fortune or accumulate it on their own, millionaires are an unsavory lot, Lewis H. Lapham claims, doing little to sustain the ''architecture of civilization.'' Writing last year in The Book Review, Andrew Hacker said this polemic is ''acerbic in tone; hyperbolic when not hit-and-run; withal, an amusing and provocative tract.'' WOODCUTTERS, by Thomas Bernhard. Translated by David McLintock. (University of Chicago, $10.95.) Having escaped an interminable dinner party with the most obnoxious of culturati, a writer takes revenge with this fictional diatribe on the pretensions of Vienna's artistic circles. Last year our reviewer, Mark Anderson, called the novel ''an unusually intense, engrossing literary experience.'' BUDDY BOYS: When Good Cops Turn Bad, by Mike McAlary. (Charter, $4.95.) Until 1986, when the scandal was uncovered, an alarming amount of the crime in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section was committed by the police. This book was constructed from interviews with the offenders, and ''the voices . . . are pure cop,'' Edna Buchanan said here last year. The book is ''searing, outrageous and painful. . . . Contrite and regretful, the Buddy Boys tell their sorrowful stories, but it seems that what they regret most of all is getting caught.'' PAST CONTINUOUS, by Yaakov Shabtai. Translated by Dalya Bilu. (Schocken, $11.95.) Nine months after the death of his father, an Israeli intellectual commits suicide. Densely woven from the stories of three friends in Tel Aviv, this novel is ''a long, complex, ambitious work of literature,'' Alan Lelchuk said here in 1985. It is ''part elegy, part etiology, with a music all its own.'' TALKING TOMBSTONES: And Other Tales of the Media Age, by Gary Gumpert. (Oxford University, $7.95.) When these essays on the sociological effects of the electronic media were published in 1987, our reviewer, Neil Postman, compared the author to Marshall McLuhan. The book, he said, ''is well written; it has the stamp of a distinctive personality; and it is filled with the only kinds of sentences that generate thought about the familiar - strange and open-ended questions.'' THE COUNTRY-HOUSE BURGLAR, by Michael Gilbert. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $4.95.) After a mysterious explosion rocks a quiet English village, Liz Artside sets out to find the culprit and to exonerate her son. ''The author has invented one of the most ingenious methods of setting fire to a house, not to mention its occupants, that you are likely to encounter,'' one reviewer said in 1955. Harper & Row has also reissued the author's novel CLOSE QUARTERS ($4.95). First published in 1947, it tells how a young Scotland Yard detective spends his holiday investigating strange goings-on at a cathedral where his uncle is dean. MEDICINE, MIND, AND THE DOUBLE BRAIN: A Study in Nineteenth-Century Thought, by Anne Harrington. (Princeton University, $12.95.) While the right brain is now the cerebral hemisphere of choice, it was once considered the seat of criminality and madness. In 1987 our reviewer, Elaine Showalter, said this book ''casts cold light . . . on the perennially fascinating process by which science, despite all its pretenses to objectivity and truth, reflects individual, cultural and philosophical prejudices.'' VOYAGER, by Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan with Phil Patton. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) Working with a freelance crew of independent aeronautical designers, Jeana Yeager and Dick Rutan in 1986 became the first people to fly around the world on a single tank of gas. Their book ''gives the reader a good sense of who they are and why they were the right ones for this monumental undertaking,'' Michael Collins said here in 1987.",1989-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"EGYPT AFTER NASSER: Sadat, Peace and the Mirage of Prosperity. By Thomas W. Lippman. (Paragon House, $22.95.) Drawing on his years as The Washington Post's resident correspondent in Anwar el-Sadat's Cairo, Thomas W. Lippman provides a dyspeptic survey of the failure of Egypt's political leadership to meet the growing needs of the country over the last 20 years. Rambling and occasionally repetitive, ''Egypt After Nasser'' makes abundantly clear his unfavorable assessment of much of Egyptian life, from the prevalence of slovenly work habits and appalling sanitation to pervasive economic mismanagement, political corruption and religious intolerance. Mr. Lippman shares the inclination of many Egyptians to lay the blame for the country's woes at the feet of its political leaders. He suggests that, for all his good intentions, Gamal Abdel Nasser ran the country into the ground with his socialist fervor. Similarly, Mr. Lippman believes, despite his best efforts, Sadat was too lazy, theatrical and out of touch with Egyptian realities to seize the economic opportunities presented by the oil boom and the collapse of Beirut during the 1970's. Finally, Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's successor, is once again well-meaning, but too unimaginative and plodding to meet the challenge of staggering population growth. Filled with useful facts and figures and lots of the humorous anecdotes Egyptians like to tell about themselves, ''Egypt After Nasser'' is both informative and very funny in places. It might be a good book for a dedicated devotee of current affairs to take along on a Nile cruise; it would make a knowledgeable, if cranky, traveling companion.",1989-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE CAGE KEEPER AND OTHER STORIES. By Andre Dubus 3d. (Dutton, $17.95.) The characters in this debut collection of seven stories are not a happy bunch. They include a teen-age girl who allows two boys to sexually abuse her, a waitress who cheats on her Vietnam-veteran boyfriend and a convict by the name of Forky who is not to be trusted handling eating utensils. They're all desperadoes and small-time losers, helpless to avert the downward drift of their lives. Good intentions don't get them too far; in the story ''White Trees, Hammer Moon,'' for example, a former alcoholic named Rory kindly decides to take his two stepchildren on a camping trip and ends up spending it in drunken oblivion. Like much recent fiction, the stories in ''The Cage Keeper'' unfold against a harsh fluorescent backdrop of all-night convenience stores and anonymous doughnut shops. Andre Dubus 3d shares with his writer father a talent for delineating the everyday pathos of obscure, unglamorous lives. But his voice isn't always convincing. He relies heavily on words like ''lookin,'' ''drinkin'' and ''smellin,'' which risk reducing his characters to stereotypes; and in some of the stories, profanities seem almost as common as the word ''the.''

Fans, impresarios and managers from all over the country were lined up in eager expectation to hear her American debut in the Verdi Requiem, with the Collegiate Chorale Saturday night at Carnegie Hall. It didn't happen. And thereby hangs an unusual tale, amusing to some and heartbreaking to others, of clashing personalities and last-minute choices in the world of high-powered singing. Ms. Sweet had already been engaged by the likes of Zubin Mehta, Carlo Maria Giulini, Lorin Maazel, Simon Rattle and Giuseppe Sinopoli.

The racer reported by radio at midday yesterday that it was 300 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge.

us,Dining Out Guide: Two-Star Chinese Restaurants,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times, with the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Auntie Yuan (June 13, 1986), 1191A First Avenue, near 65th Street (744-4040) - The original kitchen staff of this stylish restaurant was exclusively female, an ''auntie's garden,'' in the words of the owner. And auntie's garden is an approximate translation of this restaurant's name. The all-black decor accented by pinpoint lighting is the scene for food that rivals Chinatown's best. Some of the most notable are appetizers of barbecued quail glazed with garlic paste, and cold sesame noodles. Recommended entrees are crisp orange beef, steamed salmon with black beans, and Peking duck. For the Chinese New Year, which started at midnight Sunday, a 10-course dinner ($45 prix fixe) is being served through Wednesday. Appetizers are $5 to $14, entrees $15 to $23. Lunch: noon to 4 P.M. Friday; dinner: 4 P.M. to midnight Friday and Saturday, until 11 P.M. Sunday. Chin Chin (Oct. 16, 1987), 216 East 49th Street (888-4555) - The Chin brothers work the dining room like a political advance team, greeting patrons, answering questions, then stepping back to monitor the proceedings. . Shredded duck salad with rice noodles and coriander, and pan-fried dumplings are good ways to start. Main courses include an excellent Peking duck; three-glass chicken, and prawns Sichuan style. Appetizers are $3.50 to $8, entrees $12.50 to $19.50 (Peking duck dinner is $26 a person, minimum of two people). Lunch: noon to 4 P.M. Friday to Sunday; dinner: 5 to 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday, until 11 P.M. Sunday. China Grill (Nov. 27, 1987), 60 West 53d Street (333-7788) - East meets West, at least on the plates, at this oversize restaurant inspired by Chinois on Main, one of Wolfgang Puck's southern California successes. The menu combines the simplicity of Oriental cuisine with whimsical New American style in such offerings as Chardonnay steamed mussels, and Beijing oysters served with vinegar sauce laced with shallots. Recommended entrees include Shanghai lobster, grilled squab with fried noodles, and sizzling whole fish, quick-fried and served with a soy-based ponzu sauce. Appetizers are $7.50 to $14, entrees $11.50 to $25.50. Lunch: noon to 2:30 P.M. Friday; dinner: 5:30 P.M. to midnight Friday and Saturday, 6 to 10 P.M. Sunday. Fu's 1395 Second Avenue, at 73d Street (517-9670) - Review on page 22. Phoenix Garden (March 6, 1987), 46 Bowery, inside the arcade (962-8934) - To reach this source of exceptional Cantonese cuisine, one must enter a garish Chinatown arcade. The experience is worth it for the authenticity of the food and the efficient service. Among the recommended dishes are roast squab with lemon sauce, salty baked chicken, lobster with ginger and scallions, and snow-pea leaves in crab sauce. A house specialty, seasoned and deep-fried ''pepper and salty'' shrimp, is almost addictive. Until the end of Chinese New Year celebrations on Feb. 20, Phoenix Garden offers traditional banquet dinners for groups of 10 ($328 per banquet). Lunch and dinner from $3.50 to $18.

us,Review/Music; Listening For a Mahler Connection,"Shostakovich's spiritual and technical debt to Mahler, evident even in his earliest music, grew steadily over the course of his commissar-hounded career. In no work is the Mahler connection more plainly and painfully exposed than in the Soviet composer's Symphony No. 8 in C minor, a dark and frequently violent work that he completed in 1943. Perhaps because of its undisguisedly fearsome nature, the wartime Eighth has never been as favored, either by conductors or the public, as some of his more plausibly heroic symphonies. It is nevertheless a masterly score whose nerve-exposing intensity can be felt keenly in a performance such as Leonard Slatkin conducted on Thursday evening with the New York Philharmonic.",1989-02-11T05:00:00+0000

The Soviets have left behind a lot of weaponry, they said. Page 1 At Afghan guerrilla talks, confusion reigns supreme 5 Soviets say 89,000 troops are home 5 The Vatican declared racism a sin, issuing a document that touches on apartheid, anti-Semitism, tribal conflicts, the rights of aboriginal peoples and the discrimination encountered by migrants. 1 Panama's economy has survived months of sharp contraction and concerted pressure from the United States, and in a remarkable show of resilience some sectors are reporting a modest rebound. 4 Salvadoran political parties agreed in principle to meet with leftist rebels to discuss a peace initiative that would lead to rebel participation in national elections. 3 President Bush met Canada's leader, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, in Ottawa and agreed to pursue an accord to reduce acid rain, a commitment Canada has eagerly sought. 3 News analysis: Jamaica's election of Michael Manley as Prime Minister occurs when the Caribbean country's economy is on the rise. But doubts run high over whether Mr. Manley can continue the progress. 3 A liberal view of Hungary's uprising in 1956 - that a neutral Hungary would not be a Soviet threat - was printed by the official press. Differing views on the uprising are considered the focus of a deeper debate over pluralism. 28 Bonn defers decision on short-range missiles 3 National 6-10, 32 The biggest price increases in years were recorded last month by the Government's producer price indexes. Upward pressure on interest rates to head off higher inflation in consumer prices appears likely. 1 Large banks increase prime rate 35 Stocks drop sharply amid inflation and interest-rate worries 38 Depositors withdrew $8.1 billion more from savings associations than they deposited in December, a record, the Government said. Industry experts predict that January net withdrawals will be greater. 1 Lawmakers assailed Bush proposals for the budget only a day after welcoming the President on Capitol Hill. ''We started reading the fine print,'' a Senator said. 1 Ronald Brown was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He is the first black to head a major American political party, one that has become better financed in recent years but remains dispirited. 1 Man in the news: Ronald Brown, the son of middle-class parents in Harlem, is a well-paid, powerful lawyer and lobbyist for several big corporations. He is also deeply rooted in liberal Democratic politics. 8 A request to halt the North trial was denied by a Federal appeals court panel that told the Justice Department it could only prohibit disclosure of classified information in the case against Oliver North. 6 C. Boyden Gray's financial reports should be amended to show $86,900 that the White House counsel has said he earned in 1985 and 1986 but did not report, the Office of Government Ethics has suggested. 10 New control over Federal secrets proposed by a Presidential order will be countered in a campign mounted by the A.C.L.U. The order would give agency heads sweeping authority to deny access to information. 32 The examination of John Tower, nominee for Secretary of Defense, has confounded Federal agents and senators trying to cut through the fog of gossip about his private life. 10 John Tower's surgeon found ''no evidence that the Senator abuses alcohol,'' after conducting extensive tests, the surgeon said. 10 A clash between U.S. and Texas officials came in the border town of Harlingen, where local officers raided the Federal immigration office, evicting workers and aliens because of alleged fire and health code violations. 6 Anti-black violence against a church in Alton, Ill, is worse than any in the church's 125-year history, members say. Two fires last year follow years of vandalism. 6 Michael Milken sought a ruling from a Federal judge to reject or modify a Government settlement with Drexel Burnham. Under the plea-bargain, Drexel would dismiss Mr. Milken and withhold compensation. 35 Illinois students locked in punishment boxes 32 Regional 29-32 Abortion opponents trying to block a Long Island man from ordering an abortion for his comatose wife failed in appeals to New York Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court. 29 Governor Kean's next post will be as 10th president of Drew University, a liberal arts college in northern New Jersey. Mr. Kean would assume office when his term as Governor of New Jersey expires next January. 29 Some local school board members in New York City are taking steps to circumvent a new law intended to reduce conflicts of interest, the sponsor of the bill says. He is considering legislation to close loopholes. 29 The removal of radium in Queens from an abandoned medical supply plant is about to start, and Federal officials are planning a campaign to head off neighborhood fears about the operation's safety. 31 A small fire in Queens mushroomed into tragedy, killing three people in a high-rise, because of errors commonly made by fire victims, the authorities said. 31 Most of Yonkers seems reconciled to the construction of low-income units in white neighborhoods, six months after the city attracted nationwide attention by defying a court order. 30 Queens man who said police beat him is cleared in case 30 Goodman imbroglio splits New York G.O.P. 31 Neediest Cases 32",1989-02-11T05:00:00+0000

Chocolate can be refrigerated if it is in plastic wrap, foil or the original box, but the cold may make it brittle. If refrigerated chocolate has been kept too long, the texture may change and fillings may weep. Chocolate can be frozen, but that does not lengthen its shelf life. Freezing can also change the texture of chocolate that contains nuts, praline or fruit.

Anthony as Tonto to Elizabeth Cady Stanton's Lone Ranger will be surprised, and perhaps provoked, to read in ''Susan B. Anthony: A Biography of a Singular Feminist'' that Anthony was a charismatic leader who was, for decades, the heart of the women's movement, that she often had to cajole or blackmail her older friend into political participation and that she may have desired Stanton sexually. Kathleen Barry, a sociologist at Penn State University, narrates Anthony's political evolution with skill and acumen, but her sympathy for her subject leads her to take Anthony at her word on matters of motivation and feeling. Ms. Barry celebrates Anthony's decision to remain single as of immense significance both in her ability to develop feminist theory and in providing a respectable alternative model for women who did not wish to marry. Yet Ms. Barry never gives psychological or emotional dimension to that decision, nor to the important related matters of Anthony's attitudes toward her mother and toward her own sexuality. While providing extensive evidence to the contrary, Ms. Barry insists that Anthony had no ambivalence about being a woman and contends that her childhood and psychological makeup were in no way unusual, that she was simply a female counterpart to the Jacksonian common man. This otherwise thorough and adventurous biography is marred by Ms. Barry's failure to consider the psychological growth of Susan B. Anthony as yet another historically specific aspect of her life, and this in turn undermines some of her more controversial claims about her subject.",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

It's probably no great surprise that even a collection of work as specialized as one devoted to contemporary feminist women writers of Catalonia could bring together such characters as a vagabond, a lapsed lesbian and a woman who says her rosary during sex. But a gang-rape victim who quits her job and devotes her energies to tracking, trapping and emasculating her assailants? A widow who rebels against her lowered social status by crowding her house with clocks, old calendars and house plants? Such is the breadth and bounty of this anthology of short stories and novel excerpts from five Catalan writers, as rendered into English by a number of attentive translators. Kathleen McNerney, an associate professor of Spanish at West Virginia University, complements this introduction to the work of Carme Riera, Helena Valenti, Maria-Antonia Oliver, Isabel-Clara Simo and Montserrat Roig with an informative introduction and brief descriptions of each author's interests and style. As in all good stories, the characters in ''On Our Own Behalf'' could as easily live in Michigan or Illinois as modern Spain. But here in the United States, it is common to find literary celebrations of friendship between women - while in even the most recent of these pieces, which dates from the mid-1980's, women are mostly isolated from other women.

us,Outbreak of Road Shootings Plagues Detroit,"Every year, the police here receive two or three reports of highway shootings. But ever since Michael K. Warner was shot and killed on Interstate 75 south of Detroit around midnight Nov. 19, the shootings have multiplied and the reports have multiplied even more. The police say that the shootings seem to be unrelated and that some are imaginary; often stones or debris are the culprits. ''Somebody loses a window, they think they got shot at,'' said Inspector Gerald Johnson of the state police. But about half the 28 shootings reported since November are probably authentic, the police say. As with a string of 30 freeway shootings in Los Angeles in the summer of 1987, most seem to start with fights between drivers, who are replacing the angry honking of a horn or flashing of lights with the firing of a gun. ''If people weren't carrying guns in cars,'' said Inspector Johnson, ''this wouldn't be happening.''",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

There are moments when their work suggests every one of these things, but none of these labels does either of these architects justice, and one turns away from the whole issue of style with relief. It is the architecture that is important here, not the category. This exhibition transcends ideology; it presents the work of two very different architects who share only a common commitment to the seriousness of their art, and to the possibility that architecture can enrich social experience.",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

''Governing the $5 Trillion Economy,'' (a Twentieth Century Fund essay, Oxford University Press) makes the case that the budget deficit is not the primary problem. Rather, it is that the United States needs to make better use of all its resources. As Mr. Stein put it at a recent luncheon in New York, George Bush was wrong when he said we had the will to spend but not the wallet. ''I think it is the other way around,'' said Mr. Stein.

us,Playing His Songs,"Some of the most memorable songs on Broadway this season were written by an all but forgotten lyricist, Andy Razaf. The American-born son of an Malagasy nobleman, Razaf wrote the words to more than 500 tunes, mostly in the 1920's and 30's, before he died in 1973. Among them are seven songs in the long-running ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and five in the recently opened ''Black and Blue'' - including the title songs. The latter, with its refrain, ''What did I do to be so black and blue?'' is considered America's first racial protest song. His fans hope that Razaf's name will someday be as deeply embedded in the lexicon of American music as those of his chief collaborators - Fats Waller, Eubie Blake and W. C. Handy. One fan, the singer Bobby Short, recorded an album of Razaf songs in 1987. ''He is probably the most outstanding black lyricist we've ever had,'' said Mr. Short.",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

The drawers drawer, if you will. But we were of Irish descent and reticent in certain areas, and so we called it the sock drawer. Or was the name simply due to the number of syllables in underpants as against socks? (We would never have shortened it to panties! We hated the word panties. It has connotations.) There were 10 children, so to avoid total chaos, my mother liked to have a system when she could. For her laundry system, she set up metal shelving in the cellarway and affixed our names to it with masking tape. She put each child's pile of folded clean clothes above the name. You were responsible for emptying your pile. If you didn't, it got quite high, in inverse proportion to the contents of your bureau. Paul, for example, almost never emptied his pile.

Although the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard has drawn inspiration from his travels around the United States, and has included verbal snapshots of New York City and Los Angeles, Monument Valley and Salt Lake City, his illustrated book contains little in the way of travel writing - that is, the sights, sounds and textures of daily life. Instead, Mr. Baudrillard's goal is to define what he calls ''astral America, not social and cultural America . . . but the America of desert speed, of motels and mineral surfaces.'' He escorts the reader through an abstract nation, one elaborately draped around a handful of leitmotifs - space, speed, cinema, technology and, most of all, the desert. In the deserts of the Southwest, Mr. Baudrillard detects an essential American emptiness, a ''brilliant, mobile, superficial neutrality, a challenge to meaning and profundity.'' What's more, he characterizes the desert as this country's ''primal scene,'' the taproot of its culture, politics and even its sexuality. But here, as at various other points throughout his densely composed text (fluently translated by Chris Turner), Mr. Baudrillard will leave most American readers rubbing their eyes with disbelief: his astral America has jumped the rails from hermetic to solipsistic to nonsensical. The author has been canny enough to prepare an escape hatch for these occasions. ''Perhaps,'' he admits, after advancing one ticklish thesis, ''this is merely the crazy notion of a European, a fascination with an unreal America.'' A mixture, in fact, of crazy notions and dead-on insights, ''America'' is a valuable (and voluble) picture of what Mr. Baudrillard calls ''the only remaining primitive society'' - ours.",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW &NOTEWORTHY,"LIVES OF THE TWINS, by Rosamond Smith. (Avon, $3.95.) After Molly Marks moves in with her psychotherapist, she embarks on a secret affair with his estranged identical twin. Written pseudonymously by Joyce Carol Oates, this is ''a marvelous metaphysical novel,'' Susan Fromberg Schaeffer said here last year. ''The use of a pseudonym oddly clarifies the novel's concerns - the pressing need both for a double (or soul-mate) and for a unique viewing, a new look at a face we think we already know.'' THE TRIAL OF SOCRATES, by I. F. Stone. (Anchor/Doubleday, $9.95.) For almost two decades, I. F. Stone was editor and publisher of I. F. Stone's Weekly, a oneman effort to expose all that he found venal about Washington politics. Late in life, he retired from the enterprise and immersed himself in the world of Golden Age Greece, trying to understand how the Athenian democrats he so admired could have put Socrates to death. Last year our reviewer, Julia Annas, said that Socrates was not the enemy of democracy that Mr. Stone has made him out to be. But she called the book ''a noble and urgent 20th-century reflection on an ancient theme'': the danger that a supposedly free society will answer its critics by betraying its very ideals of free expression. MONGOOSE, R.I.P., by William F. Buckley Jr. (Dell, $4.50.) Recruited to help assassinate Fidel Castro, the Central Intelligence Agency operative Blackford Oakes uncovers a counterplot to kill President John F. Kennedy and launch a nuclear missile at the United States. This novel, the eighth in the Blackford Oakes series, is ''a remarkably complex, compelling and literate thriller,'' Robin W. Winks said in The Book Review last year. William F. Buckley Jr. ''gives us his best book - fiction or nonfiction.'' THE FORBIDDEN ZONE, by Michael Lesy. (Anchor/Doubleday, $7.95.) Taking personal journalism to an extreme, Michael Lesy kills a steer at a slaughterhouse and lets himself be strapped into an electric chair, all to learn what it is like to make one's livelihood dealing routinely with death. ''Mr. Lesy does indeed venture to places few of us have ever glimpsed,'' Lis Harris said here in 1987, ''and he forces himself to confront the worst they have to offer.'' FIRE LAKE, by Jonathan Valin. (Dell, $3.50.) Late one night, the Cincinnati private eye Harry Stoner is called to a motel where his old college roommate has tried to commit suicide. In 1987, The Book Review's Newgate Callendar called the author ''an expert writer who provides coherent plots and believable dialogue.'' FEARFUL SYMMETRY: The Search for Beauty in Modern Physics, by A. Zee. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) In trying to divine a pure crystalline order beneath life's seemingly erratic surface, theoretical physicists look for abstract mathematical patterns they call symmetries. In The Book Review in 1987, Ronald Kahn called this ''the first popular book to specifically focus on the search for beauty in physics, and it has no competitors.'' FAMILY LIFE, by Mary Elsie Robertson. (Penguin, $8.95.) During an annual family vacation on Nantucket, Philip Sloan, an anthropologist, leaves the family cottage to move in with his lover. Writing in The Book Review in 1987, Patricia Mandell said this novel ''insightfully portrays the inexorable and irreversible deterioration of a family.'' AND WE ARE NOT SAVED: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice, by Derrick Bell. (Basic, $9.95.) Using two fictional narrators, a black civil rights worker and her colleague, Derrick Bell explores America's failure to achieve true racial justice. The result is ''a fascinating and provocative contribution to the continuing search for a more perfect union,'' Vincent Harding said here in 1987. Basic Books has also reprinted IF I HAD A HAMMER . . . : The Death of the Old Left and the Birth of the New Left, by Maurice Isserman ($8.95). In the book, a historian of radical politics argues that the 1960's campus revolt was not a cataclysm but rather a continuation of the leftist undercurrents of the supposedly docile Eisenhower years. ''Mr. Isserman takes us through the tangled jungles of leftist politics in the 50's and 60's,'' Gus Tyler said here in 1987. ''For veterans of those days of rage, his diligent narrative will evoke nostalgia and nausea, a glad-sad remembrance of scenes on the barricades.'' THE TALLULAH BANKHEAD MURDER CASE, by George Baxt. (International Polygonics, $5.95.) The actress is joined by Dorothy Parker and Lillian Hellman in a murder mystery set amid the Red Scare of the 1950's. The novel ''sketches deft parallels between the paranoia induced by a serial killer and the mania generated by McCarthy-era blacklisting,'' one reviewer said last year. THE TIES THAT BOUND: Peasant Families in Medieval England, by Barbara A. Hanawalt. (Oxford University, $8.95.) A historian finds remarkable parallels between families in medieval times and today. ''One comes away from this stimulating book with [ a ] sense of wonder,'' David Levine said here in 1986. THE ALL-GIRL FOOTBALL TEAM, by Lewis Nordan. (Vintage, $5.95.) In Arrow Catcher, Miss., a boy and his mother escape the weird life around them by creating a fantasy world based on characters in the Sears, Roebuck catalogue. In this and other stories, Lewis Nordan shows a ''distinctive gift for blending the grotesque and the ordinary,'' Ursula Hegi said here in 1986.",1989-02-12T05:00:00+0000

Two of the events took place in Loew's Summit Hotel: the Pug Dog Club of Greater New York and the Empire Miniature Pinscher Club of Greater New York. The best pug was a fawn, Ch. Sheffield's Jersey Bounce, owned by Margery Shiver and Michael Wolf and handled by the latter. Barbara Zagrodnick, a professional handler, showed her Ch. Goldmedal Morning Star TT to the breed honors at the pinscher event. The dark mahogany gained his championship on his first birthday last Aug. 20. ''He's just a good little dog,'' said Richard Hammond, the judge, after he singled out the 8-pounder. GOLF Sauers Wins by a Stroke: Gene Sauers chipped in for a birdie on the final hole yesterday to win the rain-shortened Hawaiian Open tournament in Honolulu by one shot. Sauers took the lead with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole, then finished a final-round 65 by chipping in from just off the back fringe of the green for the second victory of his six-year PGA career. He finished the 54-hole event in 19-under-par 197, the best three-round score on the PGA Tour this season.(AP) Mowry Wins Seniors Title: Larry Mowry made a 5-foot par-saving putt on the 18th hole yesterday to edge Al Geiberger and Miller Barber by one stroke and win the 50th PGA Seniors championship.

Mowry finished with a 72-hole total of seven-under 281 on the 6,530-yard Champion course.

A little over an hour later, Hemery took the lead in the 1,600-meter run from Joe Tuttle of Moor Catholic with one and a half laps to go and won the race in 4 minutes 21.5 seconds with Tuttle second at 4:22.4.

Cherokee Colony, with Rafael Meza, finished third, two lengths farther back in the race of a mile and an eighth, which drew seven starters. Super Diamond, clocked in 1:46 4/5, paid $13 for $2 to win.

French banking sources said other French and foreign banks had signed similar agreements.

Indonesia's outstanding foreign debt stood at about $40 billion last September, of which $35 billion was owed by the Government. * In Amman, Jordan, police sealed the offices of at least three brokerage firms yesterday and posted armed guards at their doors, witnesses said.

us,Afghan Turmoil: Wars and Coups of 2 Centuries,"1839-42 British Indian forces, fearing a Russian thrust into India, occupy Afghanistan. Guerrilla wars break out and eventually prompt a British retreat. Guerrillas turn the retreat into a massacre. 1878-80 Second British-Afghan war erupts, again because of British worries about Russian intentions. 1880-1901 Rule of Abd ar-Rahman brings peace and strong central authority. 1901-19 Abd ar-Rahman's son, Habibullah, upholds his father's absolute rule and keeps the country out of World War I. 1919-29 After Habibullah's assassination, his son Amanullah seizes the throne. A third military confrontation with the British ensues; it is inconclusive. An uprising by tribal chiefs forces Amanullah into exile. 1929-33 A tribal assembly elects Nadir Khan as ruler. He rebuilds the army and establishes a legislature. The accession of his branch of the family over Amanullah's divides the Afghan elite; he is assassinated. 1933-53 Nadir Khan is succeeded by his son, Zahir Shah, who continues his policies and remains neutral in World War II. But real power begins to shift to other members of the royal family, in particular those who serve as Prime Minister. 1953 With Zahir still the nominal leader, Lieut. Gen. Mohammad Daud, the King's cousin and brother-in-law, becomes Prime Minister and pursues modernization with increasing ruthlessness. 1956 Afghanistan starts a five-year plan for better roads and communications, to be financed with American and Soviet aid. 1963 Prime Minister Daud resigns and is succeeded by the first government chief not of royal blood, Dr. Mohammad Yousuf. He repairs relations with Pakistan and embarks on more liberal policies, including the introduction of women's suffrage. 1965 Student riots and factional fights in Parliament force the Government to resign. The radical left gains strength. July 1973 A coup ends the 40-year reign of Zahir Shah, who goes into exile in Rome. The coup leader, General Daud, proclaims a republic but rules in an authoritarian fashion. April 1978 President Daud is killed in a coup. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan forms a pro-Soviet Government led by Noor Mohammed Taraki. September 1979 Mr. Taraki is killed and his former Deputy Prime Minister, Hafizullah Amin, takes over. December 1979 The Soviet Union begins wide-scale intervention in support of the Afghan Government, sending the first of more than 100,000 troops to fight Muslim guerrillas. Mr. Amin is killed and is replaced by Mr. Taraki's Vice President, Babrak Karmal, who returns from exile in Moscow. June 1982 Indirect talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the base for most guerrilla groups, begin in Geneva under United Nations sponsorship. Feb. 8, 1986 Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the new Soviet leader, says withdrawal will come ''in the nearest future.'' May 4, 1986 Mr. Karmal resigns and is replaced by Najibullah, former head of the secret police. Jan. 1, 1987 Moscow and Kabul announce a cease-fire plan and call for negotiations, but the guerrillas fight on. April 14, 1988 Accords providing for Soviet withdrawal are signed in Geneva.

Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Brandywine ** (July 29, 1988), 274 Third Avenue, near 21st Street (353-8190) - Dedicated beef lovers who prefer their steakhouses less clamorous than the norm may appreciate this warm, neighborly restaurant with equestrian artwork hung on dark cherrywood walls. At lunch, the menu offers main-course salads (grilled quail with arugula and straw potatoes, for example) and lighter cuts of beef. Recommended appetizers include broiled shrimp with garlic butter and herbs, and house salads. Porterhouses, T-bones and filet mignon are cooked precisely to order. In addition, there are veal chops, lamb chops with roasted garlic cloves and grilled fish. Home fries and sublime mashed potatoes are not-to-be-missed side dishes. Appetizers are $5 to $9, entrees $16 to $28. Open 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Friday and 5 to 11 P.M Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Friend of a Farmer Diner's Journal (July 11, 1986), 77 Irving Place (477-2188) - The husband and wife owners have created a country-kitchen atmosphere in which to have their homespun cooking. Lunch and weekend brunch feature homemade breads, buckwheat pancakes, salad sandwiches and brown-egg omelets served in individual cast-iron pans. The restaurant recently began serving dinner with such straighforward American dishes as chicken pot pie, grilled fish and vegetarian plates. (No liquor license, but patrons may bring their own wine.) Brunch is $6 to $8; dinner entrees are $8.95 to $14.95. Open 11 A.M. to 10 P.M. Friday and 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. La Colombe d'Or *** (Sept. 16, 1988) 134 East 26th Street (689-0666) - The charm of French Provincial design is inspiration for La Colombe d'Or's inviting terra cotta and brick dining room. Among the appetizers are house-smoked salmon salad and grilled quail with goat cheese and noodle frittata. Two typical Provencal entrees that are recommended are poached fresh cod over fennel and arugula with a potent aioli sauce, and salmon glazed with mustard and olive oil and served with a butter-and-chive sauce. Grilled chicken with red wine, olives and rosemary is another choice; the house specialty is bouillabaisse. Appetizers are $4.50 to $12, entrees $16 to $25. Open 6 to 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Pesca * (Nov. 21, 1986), 23 East 22d Street (533-2293) - Patrons dine in the warm light cast by the glazed salmon-pink walls of this elegant seafood cafe. Seascapes and other nautical art are the decorations. The kitchen has a flair for risotto (shrimp and primavera are two from the current menu). Other good choices are the mixed seafood chowder with salmon and shellfish, and San Francisco-style cioppino, an Italian fish stew. New to the menu are carpaccio of tuna and sauteed trout almondine. Appetizers are $4.95 to $9, pastas and risottos $16 to $18.50, entrees $19.95 to $25. Open 6 to 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday, until 10 P.M. Sunday. Positano ** (Jan. 25, 1985), 250 Park Avenue South, at 20th Street (777-6211) -Housed in a lofty neo-Gothic building, Positano is an informally chic restaurant painted pink and white. The cuisine is related to that of the Campania region of Italy's Amalfi coast. A variety of salad plates are colorful and refreshing with well-balanced vinaigrettes. Most of the pastas are superior. Sauteed baby squid with garlic, olive oil and parsley is recommended, as are the grilled red snapper and, when it is available, osso buco. Appetizers are $8 to $10, pastas $14 to $16, entrees $18 to $26. Open noon to 3 P.M. Friday and 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday.

us,NONFICTION,"WRITERS ON ARTISTS. Edited by Daniel Halpern. (North Point Press, $25.) Proust on Chardin, Sartre on Tintoretto, Huxley on El Greco, Hemingway on Miro - writers discussing painters hold the irresistible promise of insight beyond formal analysis, interpretation beyond conventional art history. But writers commenting on painting is tricky business: they risk turning visual images into words, replacing the art under study with their own. In ''Writers on Artists,'' edited by Daniel Halpern, the editor of Antaeus, some of the 41 authors collected in the anthology do transmute into literature the works of artists from the 16th century to the present. Norman Mailer reduces Picasso's fragmented visions to bouts of sexual violence, and Gertrude Stein, caught in her verbal incantations, never quite delivers Matisse. But as Zbigniew Herbert points out when he credits Stendhal with saving Piero della Francesca from oblivion, writers have a long history of making discoveries before art historians. Not limited by academic strictures, not writing for tenure, writers enjoy a wide-angle perspective on painting that basically comes out of fiction: they see works as expressions of character, time, place and feeling. The writers in this anthology seem most comfortable when they know the biographical facts or actually know the artist. In ''Caravaggio and the Unseen,'' Stephen Koch conjures the demimonde of Roman streets that were the painter's milieu and inspiration, and suddenly we understand the subtext in the realist's paintings. John Ashbery, who lived downstairs from the painter Jane Freilicher, weaves the people and ideas into a portrait of the times and notes that paintings that influenced her also influenced him. Like many anthologies, ''Writers on Artists'' suffers discontinuities, but the essays nonetheless form a strong history of art, one based on an unexpected point of view. It is not a classically linear history but a pointillist history of stories and apercus and ruminations; surprisingly, the dots add up to a coherent whole.",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"LONGING. By Paul Reed. (Celestial Arts, $14.95.) A crucial test of a good writer is whether he or she can take a basically trite story and turn it into something memorable. In his second novel, Paul Reed passes that test. If ''Longing'' were the sort of teen-age saga that's devoured by 10-year-old girls, its plot would go like this: A girl moves to a new city, looking for love. She falls in with the wrong crowd, one that worships money and physical beauty. Then she meets the boy of her dreams, but her friends warn her not to fall for him. He's in love with another girl, they tell her, and will only use her to win back his true love. But the girl, blinded by her desire for this boy and in love with the idea of being in love, ignores these warnings. The inevitable happens and she loses the boy to the girl he was in love with all along. At the end, she realizes that she was lured by the glittery facade of her new friends and that their lives are hollow, their loves mirages. If you change all the girls and all the boys in the story to young men, you'll have an outline of ''Longing.'' What makes the book work is Mr. Reed's sensitivity and his sheer writing ability. When the narrator is unsure of his lover, for example, he looks for the subtlest signs of betrayal: ''Like a filter through which passes only the purest of a substance, I sifted through hours of conversations and glances to isolate each betrayal of love - the sigh, the faint glint in the eye, the sad gaze out the window at sunset.'' This story takes place in the early 1980's, when AIDS was just a dread rumor and when promiscuity was not feared.

Fans of television's ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' will enjoy ''The Ultra Rich,'' Vance Packard's thumbnail sketches of 30 individuals whose average net worth was $330 million when he began interviewing them in 1985. He concludes, not surprisingly, that they are far too wealthy for their own good, or anyone else's, and that the concentration of vast wealth among a fortunate few is bad for the American economy. And they are stingy to boot: although his subjects' collective worth is close to $10 billion, Mr. Packard found that they gave about one-third of 1 percent of that amount to philanthropic foundations. Mr. Packard proposes that the Government tax net worth in addition to income and place a cap on the amount of individual inheritances. Although Mr. Packard states that he wanted to engage his subjects in some frank talk about their bloated bank accounts, he devotes more space to how those fortunes were made - and spent - than to insights about their social relevance. However, the life style details are delicious. We learn that Robert Guccione, publisher of Penthouse magazine, furnished his live-in lover's bathroom with a gold-leaf toilet seat, a Picasso and a Dali; that Samuel LeFrak, a New York City builder, scrapped plans to build a 135-story skyscraper because he ''didn't want to intimidate the Statue of Liberty''; that Georgia Frontiere, the seven-times wed owner of the Los Angeles Rams football team, cannot get into a Newport, R.I., golf club, even though she owns a house on the grounds. Mr. Packard relates all this in a brisk, chummy style. His portraits of the rich are surprisingly sympathetic, given his conclusions.

At her elbow, Sydney Bachman, a fashion consultant to Bloomingdale's, cooed her approval of a particularly lavish design. ''We like the square neckline,'' she prompted Carbone. The dress in question -Bachman had rendered it precisely in felt-tip marker - was inspired by a period costume created by British designer James Acheson for the movie ''Dangerous Liaisons.'' At Bloomingdale's directive, that neckline and a myriad of other nuances evoking 18th-century France, would find their way into a line of lingerie commissioned by the store.",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

We had stopped our car along the side of the road to show out-of-state guests a spectacle worthy of a cowboy's boast. An unsown rice field, muddy from the winter rain, had been transformed into a shimmering white mass by 50,000 snow geese culling every bit of seed. Pecking for food, their large white bodies and black-tipped wings moved like a fluttering blanket across the land. My husband and I waited for the moment we knew would leave our visitors breathless, and soon it arrived. The flock took flight and the sun played on the thousands of white-and-black wings, creating a vast checkerboard against the sky. For several moments, the amount of time it took for every bird to leave the ground, the huge mass hung suspended above the field, then slowly moved off toward other seed-strewn acres, wings and bodies glinting in the sun.",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Gripping Saga,"FOR THE NEW YORK METS, spring training has just gotten under way in Port St. Lucie, Fla., but Bob Ojeda, a left-handed starting pitcher, has been warming up almost daily since the cast came off his throwing hand in mid-November. By now, Ojeda says, his arm is strong, the muscles in his hand have been resuscitated by exercise, and his catchers are telling him his ball is moving as well as it ever has. Ballplayers are ever-optimistic this time of year, of course. But for Ojeda it's remarkable there's a season to look forward to at all, after the accident in his yard last fall that imperiled his career. On Sept. 21, Ojeda, 30 years old, mishandled a hedge clipper at his home in Port Washington, L.I., nearly severing the left middle finger at the top knuckle. Doctors were forced to fuse the bones at the end of the finger, permanently depriving the top joint of its flexibility. They purposefully set the joint at an angle between 10 and 15 degrees, hoping to accommodate the pitcher's grip on a baseball. (It is the foreground finger at right.) Ojeda says repetition is making the artificial grip familiar, and that the loss of flexibility has not interfered with his delivery. ''I'd never thought about this before,'' Ojeda says. ''But what I discovered is that my fingertips only sit on the ball just before it leaves my hand, when it's too late, really, to make any difference. Your 'touch' comes into play at the top of your delivery and as your arm comes forward, but it's the touch of your whole hand, the palm, the length of the fingers.''",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

From the townships to the large cities, the remote villages to the white suburbs, Ms. Karodia, a South African writer who now lives in Canada, depicts a land deformed by rage and random violence. Racists and sadists roam through these pages with impunity. Their victims hide, avert their eyes or set out for somewhere else with their lives' belongings rolled into awkward bundles. When they fight back, they're cut down. More disturbing, the cruelty is not confined to the white police or the Government. Out of frustration and rage, blacks turn on other blacks. Husbands beat their wives, then abandon them. Sons murder their fathers. And even when the characters are kind and innocent, voracious misfortune takes over. Ms. Karodia's heroes and villains are a varied lot, black and white, men and women, rich and poor. She is able to convey many voices easily and quickly. But, unfortunately, some of her stories have a tinny ring, with writing that is disappointingly plain in patches, prone to ham-handed descriptions and threadbare phrases. In the sad title novella, for example, a young man awaits his brutal father's return from prison, wondering what the old man will be like, and concludes with a cliche: ''A leopard never changes its spots.'' But in the end, these lapses fade from memory. What remains is Ms. Karodia's clear vision of the South African tragedy. The obligatory note on the dedication page reads: ''The characters in this book are all fictitious and are not based on any known person, living or dead.'' Would that it were so. J. R.

Tom Lorenz, the author of the highly praised 1980 novel ''Guys Like Us,'' has returned to print with a rewarding coming-of-age story set in Chicago. ''Serious Living'' is the comic but also poignant tale of 21-year-old Ritchie Kohler, high school graduate and truly ordinary guy. The younger of Big Joe Kohler's two sons, Ritchie seems so unlikely to succeed that his father has groomed him since childhood to take over the family's shabby corner grocery. Bored to death with this fate, Ritchie strains his already tense relationship with his father through on-the-job antics - and when he finally breaks free, he heads for the Oasis, a swank nightclub near the airport that looks ''like a sheik's palace.'' The club is run by his old friend Mars, a guy with ''definite criminal tendencies.'' Soon Ritchie is rooming with Mars, tending the Oasis bar and scoring with women like never before. The high life is his until he unwittingly causes the firing of an Oasis waitress, an aspiring torch singer named Louise. In this cynical yet determined woman, a single mother damaged by men, Mr. Lorenz has wrought his most complex character. And with her growing attraction to Ritchie - and his growing responsibility for both her and her young son Joey - both Ritchie and the novel deepen. He is now a man taking care of others, remembering how the widowed Big Joe once cared for him.

But with ''Spike,'' his first album since 1986 (when he released two), Mr. Costello has taken the time to make his tunes and arrangements as well crafted - and crafty - as his words. It's his best album since 1981's ''Trust.'' Although Mr. Costello's first songs established him as an articulately venomous observer of characters and scenes, he went on to write narratives, free associations, love songs, political parables and pure conundrums, spewing aphorisms as often as other rock songwriters used the word ''baby.'' Between albums, he recorded singles, EP's and enough unreleased material to fill two catch-up albums, ''Taking Liberties'' and a 1987 British compilation, ''Out of Our Idiot.'' And he put out batches of genre experiments - soul, country, jazz, Beatlesque pop, punk - and widely varied assortments that assured he would never be typecast. Just to make sure, he multiplied his pseudonyms, among them the Coward Brothers (with T Bone Burnett), the Imposter, Napoleon Dynamite and his real name, Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus.",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW & NOTEWORTHY,"THE IMMORTAL BARTFUSS, by Aharon Appelfeld. Translated by Jeffrey M. Green. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $7.95.) A retarded daughter helps a concentration camp survivor break out of his bleak inner world. Last year our reviewer, Leonard Michaels, said the novel ''offers an extraordinary adventure in character portrayal that is reminiscent of 'The Stranger' by Albert Camus, but more extreme in its vision of alienation, more daring in its art.'' THE CARE OF STRANGERS: The Rise of America's Hospital System, by Charles E. Rosenberg. (Basic Books, $12.95.) Equipped with millions of dollars of sophisticated machinery and staffed by doctors imbued with the power over life and death, the modern hospital has become a monument to America's reverence for technology and expertise. Charles E. Rosenberg's story of the institution's rise is ''a splendid history,'' our reviewer, Gert H. Brieger, said in 1987. ''Very well written and rich with interpretation, it deserves a wide audience not only among those concerned with medicine but also those with an interest in cities, social welfare and the professions. We are all patients, and Mr. Rosenberg does much to interpret the complex culture of medicine we all must confront.'' CHRONICLE IN STONE, by Ismail Kadare. (New Amsterdam, $10.95.) In an old stone city in Albania, a young boy's neighbors include an inventor who is making an airplane powered by perpetual motion. Ismail Kadare's fiction ''has been compared with that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez,'' Leonie Caldecott said here last year. ''Certainly he induces the same ironic double take in his readers, by means of the child's magical view of life that is larger than most adults realize.'' A TIME OF CHANGE: A Reporter's Tale of Our Time, by Harrison E. Salisbury. (Bessie/Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) In the second volume of his memoirs, Harrison E. Salisbury, the former Times reporter and editor, describes such journalistic coups as persuading the Chinese Government to let him retrace the footsteps of Mao Zedong's Long March. ''Mr. Salisbury fairly earns his bragging rights,'' Thomas Griffith said here last year. His book is ''a lively and fascinating tale by a hardworking, exuberantly contentious journalist who has brought his own stubbornly independent witness to many of the major events of our times.'' A DRAM OF POISON, by Charlotte Armstrong. (International Polygonics, $4.95.) In 1956 our reviewer, Anthony Boucher, said that reading this ''bubblingly gay and warm story of attempted suicide [ is ] an experience as delightful as it is unclassifiable.'' STRANGER IN THE FOREST: On Foot Across Borneo, by Eric Hansen. (Penguin, $8.95.) Trekking through the jungles of Borneo, an American adventurer learns about barter, blood sacrifice and the ancient art of headhunting. ''It is beguiling to encounter a man who is more interested in the people he meets than in discussing his own considerable courage and endurance,'' Tim Cahill said here last year. ''And there is a charm beyond simple romance in Mr. Hansen's insights.'' Penguin has also reprinted NOTHING TO DECLARE: Memoirs of a Woman Traveling Alone, by Mary Morris ($7.95). In 1988 our reviewer, Molly Peacock, called this account of a trip through Latin America ''the union of a travel book and a journey into the self. The vibrancy of this union is on every page.'' THE LAST SHIP, by William Brinkley. (Ballantine, $9.95.) In the aftermath of a nuclear war, the passengers on a United States destroyer search for an uncontaminated land to begin civilization anew. Last year our reviewer, Andrew Postman, said the novel ''draws on the legacies of Melville and Conrad but is full of its own nuclear-age quandaries and horrors.'' CLOAK & GOWN: Scholars in the Secret War, 1939-1961, by Robin W. Winks. (Quill/Morrow, $14.95.) Since World War II, Yale University has provided the Office of Strategic Services and its offspring, the Central Intelligence Agency, with very well educated spies. This history of the relationship ''is not only an entertaining contribution to the secret history of the 1940's and 50's, it is also an important one,'' Godfrey Hodgson said here in 1987. A SCRAP OF TIME: And Other Stories, by Ida Fink. Translated by Madeline Levine and Francine Prose. (Schocken, $6.95.) Set in Poland during the Holocaust, this collection of short fiction won the first Anne Frank Prize for literature. In 1987 our reviewer, Johanna Kaplan, said the stories ''allow us powerful imaginative passage to an unimaginably infernal world.'' THE PALACE FILE, by Nguyen Tien Hung and Jerrold L. Schecter. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $10.95.) To persuade Nguyen Van Thieu, the President of South Vietnam, to sign the Paris peace accords, the United States made secret promises of military support that it had no intention of keeping, the authors argue. ''An extraordinary collection of previously undisclosed exchanges of letters between Mr. Thieu and Presidents Nixon and Ford combines with the authors' interviews with many key Americans and Vietnamese to make this an important study,'' George McT. Kahin said in The Book Review in 1987. THE CHINESE EMPEROR, by Jean Levi. Translated by Barbara Bray. (Vintage, $8.95.) During the third century B.C. a Chinese emperor tries to achieve perfect order in an oppressive, all-powerful dynasty. In 1987 our reviewer, Jonathan Spence, called this historical novel ''an ambitious and at times extremely powerful book, where moments of ghastly violence are interspersed with flickers of rare beauty.''",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

According to the Federal Department of Agriculture, two-thirds of the country's annual crop of nearly 400 million pounds is produced in the county by 160 growers, the largest concentration anywhere. Almost every mushroom for sale in the Northeast is from this region. Through European history mushrooms were reserved for royalty.Mushrooms have been blamed for the deaths of Emperors Tiberius and Claudius, Czar Alexander I, Pope Clement VII and Charles V of France. (Indeed, the poisonous varieties were a favorite of the Borgias.) Although there is some evidence of cultivation by the Japanese as long as 2,000 years ago, the common Agaricus campestris was first grown at the beginning of the 18th century in limestone quarries near Paris (the word comes from moisseron, the moss in which they were grown), but it wasn't until early in this century that they became affordable. At 14 calories a cup, low in fat, cholesterol and sodium-free, they are a good diet food.

Yet Catherine Mann, herself a one-time Hollywood reporter, has done exactly that. ''Rumors'' has all the hallmarks of a perfunctory nod to the literary form en route to the big payoff: the television mini-series. There are crises and cliffhangers galore and countless opportunities for commercial tie-ins. And even the thumbnail characterizations cannily lend themselves to cameo appearances by members of the Hollywood firmament. The plot revolves around an ace reporter's efforts to uncover the truth about the grande dame of glitter, Renata Desmond, the ruthless owner of a mighty show-business newspaper. The rumors surrounding Desmond are shocking and incredible, but it should come as little surprise that the truth is even more decadent and implausible. Myriad subplots introduce an array of distracting personalities, among them a debauched, corpulent studio head, a brash Texas millionaire and an enigmatic beauty with the requisite checkered past. This is a frothy concoction of sex, scandal, manipulation and affectation - a production that looks like a mock-up of a stage set or a phony counterfeit bill.",1989-02-19T05:00:00+0000

It is a thrill to read ''The Way to the Western Sea,'' an intimate account of the cross-continental expedition up the Missouri River, then on to the Pacific Coast undertaken by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark from May 14, 1804, to Sept. 23, 1806. Their exhaustive agenda of diplomatic, commercial and scientific research was set by a visionary Thomas Jefferson. The motley Corps of Discovery traversed the newly acquired Louisiana Territory in a frequently flooded keelboat and two pirogues that often had to be hauled over boggy islets. David Lavender, the author of ''The Rockies'' and ''Land of Giants,'' writes virile, disciplined, yet personal prose. We jig with drunken oarsmen around the campfire and collapse on bark mattresses. We share their provisions of elk jerky, licorice, wild plum and catfish. Mr. Lavender also describes the murky psychological eddies in the relations between the explorers and British, French and Indian traders, as well as with the White House. He also tells of Lewis's brutal self-flagellations in his journal. His mission nearly over, at age 31, he had ''as yet done but little, very little, indeed, to further the happiness of the human race or to advance the information of the succeeding generation.'' In future, he ''would live for mankind as I have heretofore lived for myself.''

The weekend talks also resulted in a temporary agreement for the resumption of some American beef exports to Europe. [ Page D1. ] A dispute over the FSX fighter plane is considered by many a sign of how trade friction and technological competition are beginning to color the U.S.-Japan military alliance. Some Americans view the plane as a symbol of technology being handed away to foreign competitors. [ D1. ] Capitalism is slowly creeping into Angola, undermining one of the last strongholds of socialism in Africa. A liberalized foreign investment code took effect last year, and areas now open to the private sector include retail trade, industry, farming, trucking, restaurants and hotels. The changes come as the Soviet Union loses its hold in several African countries, including Ethiopia. [ D6. ] Carrefour's U.S. stores are operating more smoothly after some serious startup problems. The French company, which pioneered the hypermarket, has adjusted its formula to increase the appeal of its stores to American consumers.

A New York City native, he coached with Bill Parcells, now the Giants' head coach, at Army (1968-69) and the Air Force Academy (1978). Groh was the head coach at Wake Forest from 1981 to 1986 and the special-teams coach for the Atlanta Falcons in 1987. At South Carolina, he was considered a candidate for the head coaching job after Coach Joe Morrison suffered a fatal heart attack Feb. 5. Groh was not interviewed for the vacancy.

In December, the Oklahoma football program was placed on probation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Since then, five Sooner football players have been arrested. Owens did not attend the news conference. His letter was read by J. D. Roberts of Oklahoma City, president of the O Club, a group of former Oklahoma athletes. Roberts, referring to the Oklahoma football coach and athletic director, said the letter meant the 1949 team was calling for ''some sort of action, I suppose to relieve people of their jobs.''

[ Page A1. ] Chase Manhattan Bank raised its prime lending rate by half a percentage point, to 11 1/2 percent, the second increase in less than two weeks. The Republic National Bank was the only major bank to follow Chase's move immediately. [ D1. ] Congressional experts estimate that President Bush's proposal to cut taxes on capital gains would increase the Federal budget deficit instead of reducing it. [ D1. ] Durable goods orders fell 3 percent in January, reflecting drops in transportation and military orders. Some analysts said the report could portend a slowdown in economic growth. [ D2. ] Sales of new domestic cars and light trucks rose 2 percent in mid-February, but analysts said the improvement was still not good enough to clear inventories and avert a discounting war. [ D4. ] COMPANIES Sears, Roebuck will cut prices by up to 50 percent on more than 50,000 items in an attempt to revive its sagging profits and rebuild market share. To put new prices on 1.5 billion pieces of merchandise, Sears will close all 800 of its stores on Tuesday.

[ D4. ] I.B.M. agreed to settle a $100 million lawsuit brought by a small company in Maryland, which contended that I.B.M.'s personal computers had violated a patent on word processing. [ D4. ] MARKETS The Fed, in an apparent signal that it has raised short-term rates, aggressively drained reserves from the banking system. At the time of its open market operation, the overnight Federal funds rate was at 9 9/16 percent. [ D14. ] The dollar declined against most major currencies. But it received an unexpected lift when the Chase Manhattan Bank raised its prime lending rate to 11 1/2 percent.

Sam Nunn Democrat of Georgia (Chairman) ''The key test, not withstanding the White House 'spin control' on the F.B.I. report, is that John Tower most likely could not qualify for duty at the Strategic Air Command control center in Omaha. He has an exceptional talent that could be put to use, but with regrets, I must conclude not as Secretary of Defense.'' J. James Exon Democrat of Nebraska ''Perhaps in spite of his extraordinarily lucrative financial ties to the country's largest defense contractors involving hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars, Senator Tower could still bring an open mind to the awesome decisions that lie ahead on our national defense. But America should not be forced to take that chance.'' Edward M. Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts ''The allegations and information which concern me the most are those which suggest a long-standing habit of excessive drinking. Those allegations and that information do not come from one or even a few sources. It comes from a great many unconnected sources. The allegations and information are not limited to a particular time period, but span the last several decades.'' Jeff Bingaman Democrat of New Mexico ''Several thousand individuals have been named by Presidents to become a member of their team and the Senate but a mere 11 times has rejected those nominations. Eleven out of thousands. That indicates to me, and indeed tradition and history confirm it, that while this institution is by no means a rubber stamp, historically we have accepted the President's judgment and his decision that he needs an individual to serve him in a specific capacity. That decision and that judgment has been rendered by the President of the United States George Bush. I accept it and I shall vote for John Tower. '' John W. Warner Republican of Virginia ''It's a very sad day when I see friends turn against such a man, admitting that there's no smoking gun. . . . We are clearly setting new standards here if John Tower's nomination is refused. I don't believe that he's a saint. I believe he's a good man.

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Bargains in Ski Gear,"Sales of ski equipment are early because of meager snow in many areas. Shops are advertising 20 to 50 percent off. Shoppers need to be knowledgeable, and also cautious about bargains they don't need or that are not suitable. Here are some pointers: Boots Bring the socks or orthotics that you use while skiing. Try on boots from at least three manufacturers to learn which shape and size fit best. Your toes should have room to wiggle, but your heels should not move up, down or sidewise. Spend at least 15 minutes wearing both boots before deciding to buy. When you remove them, examine your feet for red spots that indicate where stretching is needed; all-over pinkness means the boots are too small. Negotiate a guarantee for adjustments and refitting. Skis Ideally, you have been thinking about this purchase all season, testing skis at resorts and questioning instructors. The sales person should ask how long you have skied, the terrain you prefer, what type of turns you make, what boots you wear and your goals for improving your technique. Top-of-the-line recreational skis, perhaps originally priced at $300 to $500, are usually superior to midpriced skis, especially for intermediates who plan to improve. Beware of stiff racing skis and ignore cosmetics. Bindings Better bindings have been paramount in reducing injuries. Each year manufacturers introduce subtle technological and design changes, which can mean big discounts on old models at the end of the season. The shop should have technicians certified to install the brand you buy, and you should be asked your height, weight, age and skiing ability so toe and heel units can be adjusted. Shop around, compare prices and try to negotiate a free or discounted installation if you buy new skis.",1989-02-25T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 A riot against ''The Satanic Verses'' in Bombay left at least 12 people dead and 40 wounded. The rioting reportedly began when demonstrators tried to march on the British diplomatic mission. 3 Sabotage in Mozambique has risen in the five months since the Government signed a cooperation pact with South Africa. The Maputo Government says South Africa supports the rebels responsible for the raids. 5 Mexico plans to pardon hundreds of political prisoners to defuse complaints about human rights violations. It moved simultaneously to rid itself of a police official accused of rights abuses. 3 Salvadoran troops raided guerrillas at a field hospital and killed five medical workers and five wounded rebels, the Roman Catholic Church reported. 3 President Bush met other leaders after Emperor Hirohito's funeral to discuss East-West relations and military tensions in several regions. 7 President Bush returns to China on Saturday for a 40-hour visit that will include talks with top leaders, withwhom he is on familiar terms. Mr. Bush is expected to raise human rights issues. 7 An Iranian-directed group blamed for the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon may have had a role in the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 in December, American officials said. 6 Lebanese man gets life term in fatal hijacking 6 Moldavia is getting a new identity as the Soviet Union ends its insistance that the tiny Soviet republic comprises a distinct ethnic group. The Soviets created Moldavia in the 1920's to keep the land from Rumania. 4 Warsaw asks Soviets to tell truth about the Polish massacre 2 National 8-12, 30 The Federal Reserve raised the rate on its loans to banks, the discount rate, pushing its drive to halt inflation by putting upward pressure on interest rates. 1 Rise in interest rates leads to a 43.92-point drop in the Dow 35 Trying to save the Tower nomination, Republicans faced an uphill battle against a Democratic majority and the weight of weeks of allegations about the conduct of their former colleague. 1 President Bush continued support for Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, declaring that he stood with the embattled nominee despite his rejection by a Senate panel. 10 News analysis: The alcohol issue in the Tower confirmation process has raised another question, for months unspoken: whether the Senate has a double standard about drinking. 1 Nine passengers were lost after part of the outer skin of a United Airlines jumbo jet ripped away shortly after takeoff in Honolulu, sucking out the nine to the Pacific Ocean below. 1 Experts look at cargo door as likely source of mishap 6 A black lawyer was selected to direct the Justice Department's civil rights division. The lawyer, William Lucas, has drawn criticism from some groups for his views on civil rights enforcement. 10 Oliver North's lawyer said attorneys for the Government had been ''outrageous'' in trying to portray Nicaraguan rebels as ''killers and warmongers,'' according to the record of a session with the trial judge. 9 Do Republicans play racial politics? The party says the election of a former Klansman in Louisiana is an affront, but Democrats say it is an inescapable result of a two-decade Republican strategy. 8 Chicago's blacks are mobilizing to hold on to the mayor's seat as the Democratic primary approaches. Polls show the city's Acting Mayor, Eugene Sawyer, gaining on his white opponent, Richard Daley. 8 Outside scientists will re-evaluate the Energy Department's calculations on the radiation exposure around the Fernald uranium plant and the cancer risk to people who live there, Senator John Glenn said. 8 Sponge hunting has brought a boom for divers in Tarpon Springs, Fla. A worldwide shortage has increased the price of a sponge from $4 to as much as $16, drawing would-be hunters from around the country. 9 A sheriff's deputy was arrested in Los Angeles and the authorities linked a gun he owned to the killings of three prostitutes last fall. 12 Officer convicted in refugees case 7 Regional 31-34 Shelters will take mental patients directly from New York City hospitals to relieve overcrowding on psychiatric wards treating the homeless, the Koch administration has decided. 1 A Koch aide has resigned under pressure, Mayor Koch of New York City said. The aide was in charge of the Mayor's Talent Bank, which has come under scrutiny for helping the politically connected get city jobs. 1 Poor people have a right to lawyers in New York State to fight evictions just as indigents facing criminal charges do, advocates for the poor said in a class action lawsuit. 31 A shortage of affordable housing has prompted Connecticut lawmakers to search for a way to overrule local officials without violating a Yankee tradition of town autonomy. Critics say the quest is doomed. 31 Officials are worried about summer, trying to devise steps to prevent the reappearance of floating garbage that fouled beaches in the last two years. 31 Snow shunned New York City again.

The enthusiasms of the rail fan, like a taste for olives, are not readily communicated to the uninitiated. To most people, the romance of the rails means the lure of travel and faraway places. For the rail fan, the faraway places mostly serve as a backdrop for the machines, which he regards with a fondness most reserve for babies or pet cats. Adolf Hungry Wolf, a rail fan to the core, is a former railroad fireman who lives with his family in a collection of old cabooses in the Canadian Rockies. ''Off on a Wild Caboose Chase,'' his disquisition on the vanishing caboose (now rendered obsolete by technology) and other bits of railroadiana, may interest other train freaks but will likely reinforce the general reader's impression that these guys are pretty weird. Many of the stories are of the loyal-dog-awaits-deceased-master variety, told in a gee-whiz manner that quickly cloys. The photographs, normally a train book's glory, are depressingly muddy. On the plus side, Mr. Hungry Wolf does have a few teen-age disaster stories that will warm the heart of any former adolescent who ever wreaked havoc on a summer job. Like the time he was too late relaying a signal and sent a freight car rolling off the Los Angeles docks into the Pacific Ocean.

One of the wires links the button to the bell or other signaling device; the other wire links the button to the power source, a transformer connected to one of the household electric circuits. A third wire is connected between the transformer and the bell. At the transformer, high-voltage household current (120 volts) is reduced to low-voltage current (usually less than 16 volts), which is all that is required to power the system. Because of its low voltage, doorbell components and wiring are safe to handle, even when electricity is flowing through them.",1989-02-26T05:00:00+0000

These two men (one a former United States Secretary of Education and now President Bush's ''drug czar,'' the other a professor at the University of Chicago and author of ''The Closing of the American Mind'') symbolize the nostalgic return to what I think of as the ''antebellum esthetic position,'' when men were men and men were white, when scholar-critics were white men and when women and people of color were voiceless, faceless servants and laborers, pouring tea and filling brandy snifters in the boardrooms of old boys' clubs.

Each trip worked, but the most successful was that of ''World's Fair,'' with its lingering, affectionate, deeply textured evocation of the Bronx in the 30's. Clearly, this is where Mr. Doctorow (himself born in New York City in 1931) feels most at home, and even those who have never seen that particular time and place have the eerie sense that they must have been there in some previous incarnation, once they've read his description of the sweet-potato seller on Eastburn Avenue, or the candy store at Eastburn and 174th Street, or the Hindenburg floating majestically over Claremont Park.",1989-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Praised most recently for his biography of Tolstoy, he now deserves applause for this witty and tender, delightfully written and perceptive novel. Its hero is the orphaned Julian Ramsay, brought up, cared for if not absolutely loved, by his aunt and uncle in an English vicarage. His uncle is obsessed with the Lampitt family, local gentry who number among their members James Petworth Lampitt, a once-renowned, now utterly out of style Edwardian man of letters. Later this Lampitt is seized upon as a subject of biography by Raphael Hunter, a charming and unscrupulous character who weaves in and out out of Julian's life as rival, stimulus and nemesis. Julian Ramsay can surely take his place with the small handful of utterly real and intermittently delightful small boys in literature. And Julian as sullen adolescent and as chastened young man also ring true. If ''Incline Our Hearts'' were no more than a delicious account of Julian's coming of age, his passage through what Mr. Wilson calls the ''Gulag'' of the English public school system, this book would still be absorbing.

The Fed, which has been nudging short-term rates upward for some time, said it took the action ''in light of inflationary pressures.'' The discount rate has not reached 7 percent since April 1986. The increase influences the rate on overnight loans among banks, which rose to well above 9.5 percent. It prompted banks to raise prime rates for the second time in less than two weeks. The prime rate is now three percentage points higher than it was a year ago.",1989-02-26T05:00:00+0000

Jonathan Demme conjures some stereotypical gangsters ''with a comic garishness that is really something special.'' ''Everything we wear, eat or own fell off a truck,'' exclaims Michelle Pfeiffer as the mob wife. Dean Stockwell, in a role that won him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor, plays Tony the Tiger, and his ''shoulder-rolling caricature . . . is the film's biggest treat.'' (Maslin) Horse Feathers 1932. MCA. 1:06. $19.95. Black and white. The Marx Brothers get loose at Huxley College, with Groucho as the school's incoming president (''I thought my razor was dull until I heard your speech,'' he tells his predecessor). Chico plays a bootlegger, the sedate Zeppo is a student and Harpo is a dog catcher, but Groucho is the life of the party. A Fish Called Wanda 1988. CBS-Fox. 1:48. $89.98. CC. R. A London jewel heist precipitates lunacy in Michael Crighton's caper-comedy, which stars John Cleese, Kevin Kline, ''a master of slapstick when he chooses to be,'' and Jamie Lee Curtis, who can ''locate the laughter in a simple reaction shot.'' It sounds fine, but ''plays like an extended lampshade joke . . . the worse the material becomes, the harder the actors work for increasingly less effect.'' (Canby) Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam 1987. HBO. 1:25. $89.99. PG-13. The war is relived in the words of soldiers who wrote home ''in haste, without self-consciousness and, mostly, without pretense.'' The letters are read by professional actors, and when they attempt to act, ''the immediacy of the emotions becomes lost.'' When the letters are read straight, ''the effect is devastating.'' (Canby) U2 Rattle and Hum 1988. Paramount. 1:39. $24.95. PG-13. Phil Joneau's ''sinuous black-and-white style superbly showcases the simplicity and directness of the group's performing style'' in this concert documentary. Only when the film bursts into color for stadium appearances does it lose intimacy; the group is at its best in close-up ''when the camera's intensity matches their own.'' (Maslin) A Handful of Dust 1988. RCA-Columbia. 1:58. $89.95. PG. Evelyn Waugh's ''vicious, witty'' novel of 1934 about the last throes of upper-class English society has been transferred to the screen with ''erring good taste and misapplied intelligence'' by Charles Sturridge. The film's ''luxuriant look, left underdescribed in the novel, dulls the cutting edge.'' One bright spot is Anjelica Huston, who ''flies into the film in a biplane and takes command.'' (Canby) The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years 1988. RCA-Columbia. 1:30. $89.95. R.

Bobbie Ann Mason is ''very good at eliciting the special poignancy of people who don't really understand what is happening to them,'' Frank Conroy said here last year. A RENAISSANCE TAPESTRY: The Gonzaga of Mantua, by Kate Simon. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) In her exploration of the ancient city of Mantua and the family that once ruled it, Kate Simon recreates the days of the Renaissance, when Italy was divided into a crazy quilt of warring city states. ''A reader can savor the gossip about arranged marriages, corrupt popes and the alliance of the church with dynastic families,'' Herbert Mitgang said in The Times last year. ''Delving into the past through paintings, sculpture and tapestries as well as manuscript records, Miss Simon has put her reporting abilities to work, filling in the historical blanks.'' LAZAR MALKIN ENTERS HEAVEN, by Steve Stern. (Penguin, $6.95.) After a visitation by the ghost of a writer who died in her 20's, a man from Memphis collaborates on a series of cabalistic short stories set in a mythical neighborhood that is a cross between his hometown of Memphis and New York's Lower East Side. ''Reaching back to a neglected corner of the Jewish psyche, [ Steve Stern ] has taken well-worn materials and turned them alchemically into something rich and strange,'' Morris Dickstein said here in 1987. IN SEARCH OF MELANCHOLY BABY, by Vassily Aksyonov. Translated by Michael Henry Heim and Antonina W. Bouis. (Vintage, $7.95.) When a Russian emigre finally gets to move to the United States, he eagerly signs up for eight credit cards, joins the American Automobile Association and the Book-of-the-Month Club, and learns that America too has its petty bureaucrats. In 1987, The Times's Michiko Kakutani said that parts of Vassily Aksyonov's book have ''the passion, humor and verbal brio that distinguished his powerful novel 'The Burn.' '' A FRIEND FROM ENGLAND, by Anita Brookner. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $6.95.) Through her friendship with a younger woman, a British bookseller named Rachel Kennedy learns vicariously about the disasters of romance. Last year our reviewer, David Plante, called the novel ''a delicate portrait of a brave woman who suffers the loss of the world.'' WOMEN AND LOVE: A Cultural Revolution in Progress, by Shere Hite. (St. Martin's, $5.95.) In the third of her ''Hite Reports,'' the author reveals that an alarming number of the women who answered her questionnaires are sick of their male companions. ''If 'Women and Love' isn't good social science, it is a valuable, provocative, loosely argued, searching meditation on how culture influences love, illustrated by many hypnotizing, sad, sweet, chilling and lurid stories,'' Arlie Russell Hochschild said in The Book Review in 1987. THE PORK BUTCHER, by David Hughes. (New Amsterdam, $9.95.) A dying German revisits the French town where two events changed his life 40 years before: he participated in a massacre, and he met and lost the only woman he ever loved. This novel ''deftly explores the inescapable burden of the past on the present, and has much to say about the nature of love in our times,'' Gregory A. Schirmer said here in 1985. STEVIE: A Biography of Stevie Smith, by Jack Barbera and William McBrien. (Oxford University, $10.95.) When Philip Larkin called Stevie Smith's poems ''William Blake rewritten by Ogden Nash,'' her fans might have taken it as a compliment, Katha Pollitt said here in 1987. This biography of the eccentric English writer is entertaining and sometimes fascinating, she said. WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST, by Francine Prose. (Ivy, $3.95.) In one of these short stories, a disillusioned lover is amazed to discover that ''what you'd hoped was the start of your life could turn out to be a scene in someone else's porno movie.'' Last year our reviewer, Stephen McCauley, praised Francine Prose's ''strong, distinctive voice; her acerbic humor . . . and her unsparing, though not unkind, insight into the subtleties of character and the nuances of relationships.'' FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY: A Writer's Life, by Geir Kjetsaa. Translated by Siri Hustvedt and David McDuff. (Fawcett Columbine, $10.95.) When this portrait of the Russian writer by a Norwegian scholar was published last year, our reviewer, Maria Carlson, called it ''a readable and provocative biography that contributes a fresh viewpoint to our understanding of a difficult writer. [ It ] also demonstrates how much Dostoyevsky still has to say to today's reader.'' DOSTOEVSKY: The Stir of Liberation 1860-1865, by Joseph Frank (Princeton University, $9.95) is aimed at readers interested in a more scholarly and detailed approach. The third installment of a projected five-volume study concentrates on the years after Dostoyevsky's Siberian exile, when he made his literary comeback with ''Notes From Underground.'' In 1986 our reviewer, Harlow Robinson, called the book ''an important and conscientious study that is unlikely to be duplicated.'' CAT OF MANY TAILS, by Ellery Queen. (International Polygonics, $4.95.) What is the hidden motive linking a series of killings in Manhattan? This mystery story ''presents the puzzle-minded reader with a very pretty problem indeed,'' Anthony Boucher said in The Times in 1949.

us,HIS BEST WAS THE BEST THERE WAS,"Louis (Satchmo) Armstrong was one of the icons of the 20th century. The first major jazz soloist, he revolutionized the way the trumpet was played, and he changed forever the way music would sound. To the public at large, his stage presence - an image of joyous triumph over the blues - was instantly recognizable. Armstrong delivered the most serious kinds of artistic statements in a way that made people feel good; he was always himself, and his magic jumps off the pages of SATCHMO (Dolphin/Doubleday, $24.95), an imaginative assemblage of pictures and text. The book contains fascinating, previously unpublished photos of Armstrong performing and relaxing, scenes from his films and early life, reproductions of record labels, sheet music, an annotated restaurant menu and other memorabilia. The jazz critic Gary Giddins, author of the book and documentary film ''Celebrating Bird,'' provides a reliable, if necessarily sketchy, overview of Armstrong's career, a survey of his major recordings and some interesting observations about Armstrong's contributions to world culture. Especially welcome are the plentiful excerpts from Armstrong's diaries and letters. He was a genius of the spirit as well as of music, and his prose conveys much of his gusto for living, his warmth and generosity and his shrewdness. ''Satchmo'' is a valuable, jubilant look at a great man and artist, whose ability to fuse exaltation with profundity still inspires awe.",1989-02-26T05:00:00+0000

In September 1968, one of the world's most durable dictators, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, suffered a stroke that ended his nearly 40-year reign. A persistent rumor held that Salazar believed himself still in power until his death in 1970. His old Cabinet convened in his bedroom, supposedly to implement his will as he expressed it in supine winks, yawns and twitches. Meanwhile, a new Government, led by his protege Marcelo Caetano, filled the void. All this is the yeast for David Slavitt's witty 14th novel, ''Salazar Blinks.'' The narrator, Carlos, is a wily, much-censored poet and journalist. A political prisoner under Salazar, Carlos is transported, under orders from Caetano, to a new cell - a broadcast studio in Salazar's Lisbon residence, where his sentence is to transmit bogus news to the invalid's bedside radio. But Salazar, more alert than his keepers suspect, discovers the truth of this elaborate ruse when the insubordinate Carlos peppers his dispatches with clues. Thus an ironic burlesque is set in motion, with politicians, journalists and their lovers all manipulating the truth, all busily crafting their own notions about freedom and power. Carlos's ethical debates with himself, the reader and others are particularly spry and mischievous, especially since poetic justice is meted out against both the Salazar regime and this less than heroic scribe.",1989-02-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The Curtain Rises On Kelp Lasagna And Chopped Liver,"Although the current theatrical season has not yet provided much food for thought, it has given considerable thought to food. On stages all over New York, breakfast, lunch and dinner are being served along with beer, wine, schnapps, tea in a glass and blue tropical drinks with or without tiny umbrellas. Caterers and chefs should demand program credit. It has almost reached the point where one cannot tell a show without a menu. The obsession reflects the interests of a public that is captivated by the theatricality of the dining experience, by designer restaurants where presentation is as important as the food. People demand sizzle in their fajitas - show business for the money. In the theater, it may be an attempt to win back an audience that prefers to spend its entertainment dollar (or $100) eating rather than watching. Both ''Tamara'' and ''Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding'' capture two segments of the population by serving dinner along with drama. In the other examples of theater of food, the theatergoer becomes a voyeur.

He spoke before John G. Tower appeared on ''This Week With David Brinkley.'' SENATOR SAM NUNN Q. Senator, let's go right to the main issue here. You were perhaps not the first one to cast a stone against John Tower, but your stone was certainly the largest. Your committee went against him. Now, the White House Republicans are saying it is pure partisan politics. Does that make you angry? A. Well, not angry, but it's kind of amusing that the White House has done everything they could to break arms to get every Republican to line up behind the President. . . . So, when they talk partisan politics, I reject that. Q. Senator, the White House is leaking selectively portions of that F.B.I. report, showing that the charges are false, that they are phony charges, that the witnesses can't even remember being in the place where other people say they saw John Tower drunk. How do you combat that? A. I'm in a hopeless situation on that one, Andrea, because the President gave us that material from the F.B.I., and we receive other material on other nominees, on a confidential basis. I have not leaked anything on that report. I am not privileged to do that under the rules and under the understanding. And when the White House starts leaking it, as they have for the last week, on a selective basis, I think it's grossly unfair. If they continue to do this or if they put out information that they claim is a true representation of the F.B.I. report, and we decide it is not a true representation, then we would have no alternative but to open the hearings and go back and subpoena some people and have a full public airing of this. That would be unfortunate. It would not be the way to proceed, but the White House may force us into that. Q. Can you cite us any specific instances where you believe Senator Tower engaged in heavy drinking recently or in the '80's? A. Al, the information I have on that, the answer is, there is such information, but I cannot cite it because it's in the F.B.I. report. Q. Do you think he's a heavy drinker today? A. I have searched as hard as I know how and as conscientiously as I know how for a breaking point in what I consider a clear abuse of alcohol patter in the 1970's. I found no breaking point. . . Q. Let me just try one more. If Senator Tower and his doctor were to come to you this week, and say, 'All right, I'm going to quit. No drinking at all, and we will systematically verify this with you, Senator Nunn.' Would that satisfy you? A. Well, I cannot supervise the Secretary of Defense. . . . . so it depends on what he wants to do and what he says he wants to do.",1989-02-27T05:00:00+0000
