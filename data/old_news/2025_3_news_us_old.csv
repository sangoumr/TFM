In his film adaptation of the book, Ross does that to the audience: You see what the characters see, because its filmed from the main characters point of view. I wondered, Ross said, how do you explicitly film from the perspective of a Black person? It was an experiment that has paid off in critical acclaim.

The book is about Dylan, but also about the folk movement, youth culture, politics and the record business. For the writer and director James Mangold, Walds work provided an opportunity to tell an unusual story about the musician. You could structure a screenplay along the lines of what Peter Shaffer did with Amadeus, Mangold told The New York Times Book Review editor Gilbert Cruz. I dont really know what I learned about Mozart watching Amadeus. But I do know that I learned a lot about how we mortals feel about people with immense talent. Mangolds film A Complete Unknown is a chronicle of Dylans early years on the New York folk scene, and it avoids easy explanations for the musicians genius and success. What if the thing we dont understand, we just dont want to understand, said Mangold, which is that hes actually different? That hes just a different kind of person than you or I?

us,Inside the Making of Wicked,"One day, several decades ago, the writer Winnie Holzman was shopping in a Manhattan bookstore when a particular cover caught her eye. It showed a woman with a green face, a black hat pulled down over her eyes. The book was Wicked by Gregory Maguire, a retelling of L. Frank Baums Oz stories from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West. When I turned it over and read the little prcis on the back, it blew my mind, Holzman said. I thought it was such a brilliant premise. The book ended up on Holzmans bookshelf, with its enigmatic cover facing out. Years later, the composer Stephen Schwartz contacted Holzman to ask if shed be interested in adapting Maguires book for the stage. The musical they wrote together opened in 2003, and it is now one of the most successful shows in Broadway history. The producers started talking about a movie adaptation, but Holzman was cautious: We had to really kind of clear our minds and kind of reconceive the whole story. The film version of Wicked opened in 2024, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and with a screenplay by Holzman and Dana Fox. It is one of the highest-grossing movies of the year and is nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including best picture.

Thats all the truer if the experience challenges you to assess where you stand (or sit) in relation not only to whatever is being said or done onstage but to all of the reactions bursting forth around you.",2025-03-03T10:00:57+0000

Mattila, 40, doesnt mention the near-perfect symmetry of the buildings two 135-square-foot volumes (one a changing room, the other the sauna), separated by an open void that frames the forest; or the constructions elegant lock joints, folded like knuckles over the corners of its solid timber walls. Instead, she wants to discuss how the building works: Thin layers of linen packed between logs provide insulation; the stoves residual heat and air circulation below dry the sauna between uses; gaps around the windows and doorjambs allow the timber to contract over time as it loses moisture. If you think of a Finnish farmhouse, this is essentially how you build it: a log frame, an oven for baking and, once youve lived there for a while, you make another log frame and fill the gap between, Mattila says. The projects client, a 54-year-old conductor and violinist named Jan Sderblom, recalls asking the architects for a combination of timeless and archaic. So they gave him something virtually indistinguishable from the barns and saunas that Finns have built in their hardscrabble homeland for centuries.",2025-03-04T10:00:49+0000

In the time since, PB&J has dominated school lunchboxes and shown up in various packaged treats, from Uncrustables to M&Ms. Now pastry chefs like New Yorks Miro Uskokovic, 41, are embracing and updating the pairing. At Hanis, the East Village bakery that he co-owns with his wife, Shilpa, PB&J cake is a perpetual best seller. With desserts, you should never go too intellectual, says Uskokovic, who sandwiches wild blueberry compote, peanut butter buttercream and peanut-sesame crunch between layers of yellow sponge. I havent met many people who dont like PB&J. At Brio, an Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, the chef Maddy Caldwell, 24, serves a frozen version of the combo, topping her ice cream sundae with peanut sauce and quince jelly, while in Asheville, N.C., Owl Bakerys Lola Borovyk, 32, simmers local muscadine grapes into jam and then combines them with peanut frangipane and streusel in a twice-baked croissant. Its lowbrow meets highbrow, she says. At Hellbender, a Mexican American restaurant in Ridgewood, Queens, the executive chef Yara Herrera, 33, took inspiration from another childhood favorite: Jell-O. Her parfait features alternating stripes of silky peanut butter and concord grape gelatin with a topping of whipped cream and candied peanuts. Originally conceived of as a special, the dessert was so popular that its become a menu mainstay. Says Herrera, I dont think PB&J is ever going out of style.  Tanya Bush",2025-03-05T10:01:08+0000

Back then, specialty coffee shops were a rarity in Europe, Lane says. And yet Redzepi, the chef behind Noma in Copenhagen, was pledging to have a world-class coffee service at his restaurant. The following spring, Lane drove north and asked for a job. Noma has a hyper-fixation on local food  the bark, branches, crickets and reindeer on the menu can all be found in the Nordic region. One of the few exceptions is coffee. Its the most exotic thing in the restaurant, says Lane, who now manages the coffee and tea services at Noma. The restaurant began roasting its own coffee last year under the brand Noma Kaffe. This month, the beans will be packaged and shipped internationally for the first time as part of a subscription service. Offerings will change monthly, drawing from producers around the world. Some of them, like the Intzn family, a community of Indigenous farmers in Chiapas, Mexico, have supplied Noma in the past. The beans are roasted in Copenhagen and shipped to subscribers with notes on sourcing and brewing. These coffees are very easy to make, Lane says. They taste good at home. Noma Kaffe is the latest packaged product from the restaurant, which has been building out a pantry of consumer goods ranging from pumpkin vinegar to corn yuzu hot sauce. Noma Kaffe subscriptions will be available online beginning on March 6; from $65 for two bags of coffee beans, nomaprojects.com.",2025-03-06T10:03:48+0000

Its triple-height vaulted cellars, which Ai, a self-taught architect, renovated himself after leaving his native China in 2015, are now pristine and well-lit, but when he first visited the long-abandoned subterranean space, it was completely dark, he says, like an underworld. In that way, it recalls the underground home where the artist lived for five years as a child, a place he calls the black hole: a bare shelter on the edge of the Gurbantnggt Desert in the remote Xinjiang region, one of the sites where Ais father, the renowned poet Ai Qing, was exiled following Chinas Anti-Rightist Campaign in the late 1950s. In that half-buried home, Ai first encountered the authoritarianism and censorship that he has now spent four decades resisting, ridiculing and at times enduring again, as a defender of human rights and self-proclaimed political troublemaker. Today, he travels frequently, stopping in Berlin; Cambridge, England, where his sixteen-year-old son, Lao, his only child, attends school; and Montemor-o-Novo, a town in the countryside of southern Portugal whose sunny climate reminds him of his childhood in the desert. That approximately 20-acre property hosts a few assistants, as well as many cats, dogs, birds and fish and a reconstruction of his wooden Shanghai studio that was demolished by local authorities in 2011.

I just dragged the back of my nails across the strings, and it was a complete epiphany. I heard it. And not only did I hear it, I could feel it. Bell, who is best known for minimalist glass sculptures that explore the properties of light and color, has been collecting 12-string guitars ever since.

But they didnt reconnect for another 18 years, after finishing what Labaye calls first life full of 20-something relationships, homes and jobs and then decidingto co-create a line of industrial wood, leather and steel furniture (sold at Londons Charles Burnand gallery), a collaboration that established their professional and romantic partnership. The next year, in 2019, they completed their debut full-scale project, the renovation of Hotel de Pourtals, a pale-toned Eighth Arrondissement refuge that, as Labaye explains, needed a fresh sense of calm.
