In his film adaptation of the book, Ross does that to the audience: You see what the characters see, because it’s filmed from the main character’s point of view. “I wondered,” Ross said, “how do you explicitly film from the perspective of a Black person?” It was an experiment that has paid off in critical acclaim. “Nickel Boys” has been nominated for two Academy Awards: best adapted screenplay and best picture. In our special series devoted to Oscar-nominated films adapted from books, “The Book Review” podcast host Gilbert Cruz talks with Ross about why he made the film this particular way.",2025-03-02T00:44:14+0000
us,Is Bob Dylan Still a ‘Complete Unknown’?,"Elijah Wald’s 2015 book, “Dylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan and the Night That Split the Sixties,” traces the events that led up to Bob Dylan’s memorable performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. The book is about Dylan, but also about the folk movement, youth culture, politics and the record business. For the writer and director James Mangold, Wald’s work provided an opportunity to tell an unusual story about the musician. “You could structure a screenplay along the lines of what Peter Shaffer did with “Amadeus,’” Mangold told The New York Times Book Review editor Gilbert Cruz. “I don’t really know what I learned about Mozart watching ‘Amadeus.’ But I do know that I learned a lot about how we mortals feel about people with immense talent.” Mangold’s film “A Complete Unknown” is a chronicle of Dylan’s early years on the New York folk scene, and it avoids easy explanations for the musician’s genius and success. “What if the thing we don’t understand, we just don’t want to understand,” said Mangold, “which is that he’s actually different? That he’s just a different kind of person than you or I?” In the second episode of our special series devoted to Oscar-nominated films adapted from books, Cruz talks with Mangold about making a film centered on one of music’s most enigmatic figures.",2025-03-02T00:50:14+0000
us,Inside the Making of ‘Wicked’,"One day, several decades ago, the writer Winnie Holzman was shopping in a Manhattan bookstore when a particular cover caught her eye. It showed a woman with a green face, a black hat pulled down over her eyes. The book was “Wicked” by Gregory Maguire, a retelling of L. Frank Baum’s “Oz” stories from the perspective of the Wicked Witch of the West. “When I turned it over and read the little précis on the back, it blew my mind,” Holzman said. “I thought it was such a brilliant premise.” The book ended up on Holzman’s bookshelf, with its enigmatic cover facing out. Years later, the composer Stephen Schwartz contacted Holzman to ask if she’d be interested in adapting Maguire’s book for the stage. The musical they wrote together opened in 2003, and it is now one of the most successful shows in Broadway history. The producers started talking about a movie adaptation, but Holzman was cautious: “We had to really kind of clear our minds and kind of reconceive the whole story.” The film version of “Wicked” opened in 2024, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, and with a screenplay by Holzman and Dana Fox. It is one of the highest-grossing movies of the year and is nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including best picture. Holzman joins Gilbert Cruz, the editor of The New York Times Book Review, to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of adapting your own adaptation.",2025-03-02T00:51:40+0000

Now he has been nominated for a second Oscar: for his screenplay for “Conclave,” based on Robert Harris’s political thriller set in the secret world of a papal election.“It’s almost like mosaic work,” Straughan tells Gilbert Cruz, the editor of The New York Times Book Review, about adapting books. “You have all these pieces; sometimes they’re going to be laid out in a very similar order to the book, sometimes a completely different order. Sometimes you’re going to deconstruct and rebuild completely.” In this episode of our special series devoted to Oscar-nominated films adapted from books, Cruz talks with Straughan about his process of translating a book to the screen, and about the moments in ‘‘Conclave” that he found most exciting to adapt.",2025-03-02T00:52:53+0000

That’s all the truer if the experience challenges you to assess where you stand (or sit) in relation not only to whatever is being said or done onstage but to all of the reactions bursting forth around you.",2025-03-03T10:00:57+0000

Mattila, 40, doesn’t mention the near-perfect symmetry of the building’s two 135-square-foot volumes (one a changing room, the other the sauna), separated by an open void that frames the forest; or the construction’s elegant lock joints, folded like knuckles over the corners of its solid timber walls. Instead, she wants to discuss how the building works: Thin layers of linen packed between logs provide insulation; the stove’s residual heat and air circulation below dry the sauna between uses; gaps around the windows and doorjambs allow the timber to contract over time as it loses moisture. “If you think of a Finnish farmhouse, this is essentially how you build it: a log frame, an oven for baking and, once you’ve lived there for a while, you make another log frame and fill the gap between,” Mattila says. The project’s client, a 54-year-old conductor and violinist named Jan Söderblom, recalls asking the architects for “a combination of timeless and archaic.” So they gave him something virtually indistinguishable from the barns and saunas that Finns have built in their hardscrabble homeland for centuries.",2025-03-04T10:00:49+0000

us,The Chefs Making PB&J for Adults,"In a 1901 article in the Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science & Domestic Economics, the food writer Julia Davis Chandler introduced one of America’s most iconic culinary couples: peanut butter and jelly. In the time since, PB&J has dominated school lunchboxes and shown up in various packaged treats, from Uncrustables to M&M’s. Now pastry chefs like New York’s Miro Uskokovic, 41, are embracing and updating the pairing. At Hani’s, the East Village bakery that he co-owns with his wife, Shilpa, PB&J cake is a perpetual best seller. “With desserts, you should never go too intellectual,” says Uskokovic, who sandwiches wild blueberry compote, peanut butter buttercream and peanut-sesame crunch between layers of yellow sponge. “I haven’t met many people who don’t like PB&J.” At Brio, an Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, the chef Maddy Caldwell, 24, serves a frozen version of the combo, topping her ice cream sundae with peanut sauce and quince jelly, while in Asheville, N.C., Owl Bakery’s Lola Borovyk, 32, simmers local muscadine grapes into jam and then combines them with peanut frangipane and streusel in a twice-baked croissant. “It’s lowbrow meets highbrow,” she says. At Hellbender, a Mexican American restaurant in Ridgewood, Queens, the executive chef Yara Herrera, 33, took inspiration from another childhood favorite: Jell-O. Her parfait features alternating stripes of silky peanut butter and concord grape gelatin with a topping of whipped cream and candied peanuts. Originally conceived of as a special, the dessert was so popular that it’s become a menu mainstay. Says Herrera, “I don’t think PB&J is ever going out of style.” — Tanya Bush",2025-03-05T10:01:08+0000

One of the animals, he says, was named Dilys. “It’s really about if something moves me or about bringing things into a new light,” says Pontefract, 36.

us,‘Eephus’ Review: One Last Game,"This is by no means a rule, but anecdotally, there’s something about the sport of baseball that seems to attract hardcore cinephiles. Perhaps it’s because watching baseball, like watching a movie, is more or less the act of observing time pass. (And eating popcorn, or hot dogs.) Perhaps it’s because the sweeping arc of the baseball season, cut nearly into daily chunks by virtue of the number of games in a regular season, lends itself to slow-developing drama, a gradual tension build that echoes across eras and can twist itself into new shapes at any time. Also, a baseball player can have a longer career than athletes playing many other major American sports; with the greats, it’s easy to start writing some kind of epic biopic in your head.",2025-03-06T10:01:48+0000

But eight days before, I had a bad fall that resulted in multiple injuries, including eight stitches to my face that doctors said I could not expose to sun or water. The Tall Ship Experience website clearly states that I could cancel for a full refund up to seven days before the trip. But the company revealed it was just an intermediary and the Dutch organization actually running the trip, Tallship Company, had different rules, under which I was refunded 10 percent. I offered to take credit for a future trip, to no avail. Finally, I disputed the charges with my credit card issuer, American Express. But Tall Ship Experience provided a completely different set of terms to Amex, saying I canceled one day in advance. The charges were reinstated. Can you help?

And yet Redzepi, the chef behind Noma in Copenhagen, was pledging to have a world-class coffee service at his restaurant. The following spring, Lane drove north and asked for a job. Noma has a hyper-fixation on local food — the bark, branches, crickets and reindeer on the menu can all be found in the Nordic region. One of the few exceptions is coffee. “It’s the most exotic thing in the restaurant,” says Lane, who now manages the coffee and tea services at Noma. The restaurant began roasting its own coffee last year under the brand Noma Kaffe. This month, the beans will be packaged and shipped internationally for the first time as part of a subscription service. Offerings will change monthly, drawing from producers around the world. Some of them, like the Intzín family, a community of Indigenous farmers in Chiapas, Mexico, have supplied Noma in the past. The beans are roasted in Copenhagen and shipped to subscribers with notes on sourcing and brewing. “These coffees are very easy to make,” Lane says. “They taste good at home.” Noma Kaffe is the latest packaged product from the restaurant, which has been building out a pantry of consumer goods ranging from pumpkin vinegar to corn yuzu hot sauce. Noma Kaffe subscriptions will be available online beginning on March 6; from $65 for two bags of coffee beans, nomaprojects.com.",2025-03-06T10:03:48+0000

Its triple-height vaulted cellars, which Ai, a self-taught architect, renovated himself after leaving his native China in 2015, are now pristine and well-lit, but when he first visited the long-abandoned subterranean space, it was “completely dark,” he says, “like an underworld.” In that way, it recalls the underground home where the artist lived for five years as a child, a place he calls “the black hole”: a bare shelter on the edge of the Gurbantünggüt Desert in the remote Xinjiang region, one of the sites where Ai’s father, the renowned poet Ai Qing, was exiled following China’s Anti-Rightist Campaign in the late 1950s. In that half-buried home, Ai first encountered the authoritarianism and censorship that he has now spent four decades resisting, ridiculing and at times enduring again, as a defender of human rights and self-proclaimed political “troublemaker.” Today, he travels frequently, stopping in Berlin; Cambridge, England, where his sixteen-year-old son, Lao, his only child, attends school; and Montemor-o-Novo, a town in the countryside of southern Portugal whose sunny climate reminds him of his childhood in the desert. That approximately 20-acre property hosts a few assistants, as well as many cats, dogs, birds and fish and a reconstruction of his wooden Shanghai studio that was demolished by local authorities in 2011. Ai is used to constant movement, and to the possibility of displacement. “The concept of a home has never been truly established for me,” he says.",2025-03-11T00:43:02+0000

Its best bit is in the setup: After a family is killed at home in the early 1980s, the house sits empty until the present day, when it is converted into an Airbnb that the young couple Josh (Brandon Flynn) and Rohan (Nik Dodani) rent for a weekend getaway. “This place is a mansion,” Rohan enthuses, about what in the ’80s was an ordinary suburban household. The punchline is that in this economy, no one can afford to buy even a haunted house anymore. Yes, there’s a 400-year-old poltergeist terrorizing inhabitants.

In this alternative history, machines got on a fast track to sentience during the 20th century and waged war against humanity, which barely won. By the alt-1990s, hyper-capitalism and virtual reality have destroyed communal and social bonds — people are so addicted to V.R., which they mainline via helmet-like neurocasters, that they can go into vegetative states, oblivious to the world around them. The story is muted and evocative, and it leaves you with a powerful feeling of bereavement and grief for what we, as a species, have brought on ourselves.",2025-03-13T09:00:56+0000

us,"In Portugal, a Farmhouse Hotel That’s a Short Walk From the Beach","Set in a natural park within Portugal’s Algarve region, the farmhouse hotel Quinta do Pinheiro is a 10-minute walk from protected dunes, oyster farms and barrier island beaches that can only be reached by swimming or boating. Initially built in 1870, the estate was purchased in 2021 by the Dutch couple Martijn Kleijwegt and Monique Snoeijen, who wanted to restore the property and turn it into a retreat. Now there are five stylish cottages designed by the Portuguese architect Frederico Valsassina and his daughter, Marta, all with two or three bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen. Window frames were painted red, which is traditional to the region; floors were laid with local Santa Catarina tiles; and the old bread oven and distillery remain on the property. While there’s not a restaurant at the hotel, the staff can arrange for a chef. For a meal out, the town of Tavira — a Roman settlement founded in 400 B.C. that’s famed for its churches and bell towers — is a scenic 90-minute hike (or 25-minute ride on one of the property’s electric bikes) away. In May, it’ll become much easier for New Yorkers to visit this part of Portugal thanks to a new United Airlines direct flight between Newark, N.J., and Faro, the capital of the Algarve region.

us,1 Man. 12 Strings. 300 Guitars.,"The artist Larry Bell, 85, was born with severe undiagnosed hearing loss. “I didn’t know it, and neither did my parents,” he said. Unsurprisingly, music lessons were a struggle but, when he was about 17, he saw a strange guitar hanging in a pawnshop window in Downtown Los Angeles. “I had never seen anything quite like it because it had 12 strings instead of six,” he said. “I asked the man behind the counter if I could see it. I just dragged the back of my nails across the strings, and it was a complete epiphany. I heard it. And not only did I hear it, I could feel it.” Bell, who is best known for minimalist glass sculptures that explore the properties of light and color, has been collecting 12-string guitars ever since. Hundreds hang in their own climate-controlled room in his studio in Taos, N.M. Twelve-strings are more sensitive than six-strings: They’re difficult to tune and hard to play, and that’s what Bell appreciates. “My collection is about my passion for improbable things,” he said.",2025-03-17T09:00:49+0000

In the lead-up to independence in 1917, Finnish writers, artists and musicians drew on their singular language and regional folklore to assert a distinctive national identity. Architects played their part, too, combining decorative allusions to Finland’s sprawling landscape of lakes and forests with modern technologies like steel frames and electric lights: a new idiom for a new country.

Carl depicted them in more than a hundred Arts and Crafts-inflected watercolors, gamboling amid wildflowers and curled up in Gustavian chairs in rooms painted and stenciled in shades of ocher, crimson and teal. His paintings, which he published reproductions of in books translated into eight languages — “Ett Hem” (“A Home,” 1899) and “Das Haus in der Sonne” (“The House in the Sun,” 1909) — helped form Sweden’s national identity and imprinted on the world an indelible image of rural Nordic wholesomeness.",2025-03-20T09:01:05+0000

After nearly five years, the English art dealer and his wife, Margherita, an Italian psychotherapist, had outgrown their small home and were tired of the tourists. But the day before their scheduled return to London, where they have another residence, Ward-Jackson, now in his 80s, received a call from a real estate agent cousin of Margherita’s about a listing in Dorsoduro, a more intimate neighborhood separated from the crowded cafes of Piazza San Marco by the Grand Canal. Reluctantly, he agreed to tour the property: a 3,500-square-foot apartment on the piano nobile, or second floor, of a 17th-century palazzo. As he walked around the main hall — a “very scruffy” space, he recalls, with three bedrooms on one side and a study and the kitchen on the other — he was struck by how familiar it felt. On his way out, he bumped into an older woman. “Nicholas, how lovely to see you,” she said. “Are you back to buy your old flat?”",2025-03-20T09:01:56+0000

They had crushes on each other, Labaye says on a dreary March morning while the couple sit at an oval black glass dining table in their third-floor apartment in Paris’s Haut Marais. But they didn’t reconnect for another 18 years, after finishing what Labaye calls “first life” — full of 20-something relationships, homes and jobs — and then deciding to co-create a line of industrial wood, leather and steel furniture (sold at London’s Charles Burnand gallery), a collaboration that established their professional and romantic partnership. The next year, in 2019, they completed their debut full-scale project, the renovation of Hotel de Pourtalès, a pale-toned Eighth Arrondissement refuge that, as Labaye explains, needed a fresh sense of calm.

Upon spotting a 750-square-foot prewar apartment in the East Village, the couple sent their real estate agent to investigate. He called back to warn them that it wouldn’t stay on the market long. Flynn, who had been renting a place in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, decided to drive 11 hours in a snowstorm to visit the two-bedroom property himself. The pair had a few reservations — the closets were small, the bathroom was outdated — but made an offer anyway. Flynn, 31, who recently played Marlon Brando Off Broadway in “Kowalski,” liked that the top-floor residence was at least big enough for dinner parties, and Tannahill, 36, whose 2021 novel, “The Listeners,” was adapted earlier this year into a BBC series starring Rebecca Hall, loved what he calls the neighborhood’s “extraordinary punk and queer history.”",2025-03-20T09:02:21+0000

It had been there for more than half a century, built for the entrepreneur Romana de Vera, now 92, who’s beloved throughout the country for creating Romana Peanut Brittle, a popular packaged snack. Decades ago, she and her husband, Federico de Vera Sr., would take their 10 children there on the weekends; when they arrived, the kids would fling open the car doors and immediately run into the sea. But eventually, like many family homes, the place fell into disrepair and none of the siblings, now scattered around the world, could decide what to do with it: Should they sell it, especially given that developers had started illegally building near the coast on their land?

Carmona, 78, had come to this plot on a forested hillside on the advice of her son, Nelo Augusto, 49, who had happened upon the plot while driving among olive groves and coffee plantations in the south of the Minas Gerais state. Carmona traveled from her home in São Paulo, 120 miles to the southwest, as soon as she could; thanks to Nelo Augusto’s negotiations with the owner, she stayed the night at a peculiar two-story house that was then the property’s only building.

They had this beautiful hair and these divine bodies, and I would look in the mirror and think, ‘Well, I guess not in this life.’ That made me laugh,” she says. As Chula — her round face washed white, her lips a tiny red heart, her eyebrows painted into inquisitive asymmetry — Muñoz, who this spring will begin touring through Europe and Central and South America, has played a jilted bride and a doddering old lady. She’s used her open, expressive face and antic physicality to joke wordlessly about loss, aging in a woman’s body and other concepts that have long been overlooked in the male-dominated world of clowns. For Muñoz, laughter isn’t an end in itself but rather, she says, “a way to connect.”",2025-03-24T09:00:27+0000

Fish pie: a monochromatic pairing of milky cod and mashed potato. Mushy peas: boiled legumes puréed into pulp. Even summer pudding, filled with vibrant fresh berries, is encased in wet white bread. The English relationship to food is “ambivalent, highly discordant and often superficial,” writes the British anthropologist Kate Fox in her 2004 book, “Watching the English.” Maybe it was the Puritans’ self-deprivation, or the Industrial Revolution, which separated working-class people from the land, or the rationing of World War II, but the English have rarely approached food with the full-bodied passion of the French or the Italians.

Then in her mid-30s and raising three kids, Ms. Kali’s natural warmth and openness made her a popular waitress at the raw-food restaurant where she worked in San Francisco. When her doctor told her she had Stage 1 breast cancer, the fact that survival rates for her cancer type were in excess of 90 percent (and rising) did little to soften the emotional blow. Ms. Kali knew what cancer entailed: a barrage of medical treatments that seemed to sap people of their quality of life.
