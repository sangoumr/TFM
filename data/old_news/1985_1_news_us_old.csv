Instead, it sent oil futures plunging to their lowest level since trading began on the New York Merc. Narrowing the differential was necessary to make light crude oil more attractive to buyers, analysts say, but OPEC did not go far enough. But the refusal of Nigeria - one of the biggest OPEC producers - and Algeria to sign the pricing accord has made other OPEC moves appear less than decisive. Instead of the oil price increase that OPEC wants to see, analysts are predicting a continuing fall, to perhaps as low as $25 a barrel, as the oil glut persists.

And those gigantic balls of dense gas, Jupiter and Saturn. Planets come in many sizes and compositions, but everybody knows they have one thing in common: they orbit a star. This seemed a sufficient definition of a planet as long as astronomers stuck to the major bodies orbiting our own star, the Sun. Now, when the long search to find planets around other stars has met with its first apparent success - the discovery of a body about the size of Jupiter, though much denser, orbiting a faint star 21 light years away - astronomers are in a semantic turmoil. They are not sure what to call it. Is it truly a planet or more like a star? Or something in between, a would-be star that failed to achieve stardom? The point may seem too precious to be taken seriously. But as astronomers look into the heavens with increasingly sensitive instruments such as the $80 million telescope that the California Institute of Technology said last week it was building high up on an extinct Hawaiian volcano, or for that matter with spacecraft-borne telescopes soon to be launched, they are finding phenomena that stretch not only their imagination but the nomenclature of their profession.

Because proposals to reform the income tax would have the effect of reducing the incentive to make contributions, such Charles T. Clotfelter, professor of public policy studies and economics at Duke University, is author of the forthcoming ''Federal Tax Policy and Charitable Giving.'' proposals are likely to dampen the level of giving at the very time that Federal budget cuts are making private support more important. The Treasury tax plan unveiled last month is only the most recent of a series of proposals designed to alter the existing Federal income tax. Conceived in response to what is seen as the complexity, inefficiency and capriciousness of the current income tax, these tax-reform proposals would modify the existing income tax in two basic ways. First, they would bring down tax rates. The Treasury proposal would reduce the top rate from the current 50 percent to 35 percent. Top rates in other proposals are even lower: 30 percent under the Bradley-Gephardt plan and 25 percent under Kemp-Kasten.",1985-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Though both seemed slightly apprehensive at the start of the pas de deux, the partnering was secure and even daring. Mr. Merlo gave the lovely Miss Hlinka, one of the company's most exciting turners, ample chance to display her open, clear arabesque, which makes her look as if she will float off any moment. The role of the Cavalier is a small one, and one was left wanting to see much more of the engaging Mr. Merlo. His ballet manners were occasionally a little rough - as in one ambling entrance - but typically, he combined a fine, innate-looking classical technique and attack with an infectiously joyous expansiveness. Mr. Merlo is a dancer who looks as if he loves to dance.",1985-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Shultz wrote Israel's Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, two weeks ago that Israel's austerity program had not gone far enough to warrant the additional $800 million in aid requested for fiscal 1985. If this aid remains uncertain, and Israel's leaders cannot devise a realistic economic program, why is it that no one Penelope Hartland-Thunberg is a fellow in international business at the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Studies. Joyce R. Starr is director of the Near East Program there. has considered calling in the International Monetary Fund? In circumstances less dire than those of Israel, other sovereign debtors like Mexico and Brazil - with great hesitation and internal opposition - have sought I.M.F. guidance and aid. The Israeli Government is reluctant to ask for either, but it could be in the country's best interest. Certainly, Israel is in no better shape than Mexico and Brazil were when they requested help. The Israeli inflation rate is well over 400 percent annually; when Mexico and Brazil started negotiations with the fund in 1983, inflation in both countries was near 100 percent. Israel's external debt exceeds $7,000 per capita; in Mexico and Brazil at the height of their crises, the comparable figures were about $1,000 and $700. Most worrisome for Israel are its highly volatile non-Government foreign loans, which amounted to some $7 billion at the close of 1984. The possibility that such lending would not be extended was precisely what triggered the crises in Mexico and Brazil, and it was not until both countries agreed to restructure their economies along lines laid down by the fund that the banks agreed to maintain credits.",1985-01-09T05:00:00+0000

(In the days when my son called, it was only to find out what combinations of vegetables and grains provided complete protein for a vegetarian.) My daughter's calls are a far cry from the ones my best friend placed to her mother when she was a bride - a bride who had not cooked more than 10 or 15 times before marriage. She made her first long-distance call within a week or two of setting up housekeeping. Her questions involved a whole chicken. She had received an indoor rotisserie as a wedding gift, one of those so-called portable appliances that weigh so much it takes two people to lift them. My friend's mother explained in seemingly endless detail about rinsing the chicken, salting it and arranging it on the skewer. Her father, who filled the traditional role of outdoor cook, had to get on the line to explain how the chicken should be placed so that it was evenly balanced. But neither could tell precisely how long to cook the chicken because they had no experience with an indoor rotisserie (the accompanying directions did not include recipes).

They have been perfecting their routine for some four years now, projecting themselves as ''singing bards,'' or ''court jesters'' and employing music, poetry, mime, magic and comedy to comment on contemporary culture. This afternoon at 2:30 P.M. they bring their lighthearted act to the South Huntington Public Library, 2 Melville Road in Huntington Station.

The he-man against the elements, the outlaw, the superhero exist only as myths in the modern world; we are nature's elements, a technologically oriented people nonetheless caught in the sieve of history. There are suspense and an urgent intelligence to Mr. DeLillo's writing, a sense of the widening gyre and the tight-drawn net. ''White Noise,'' his eighth novel, is the story of a college professor and his family whose small Midwestern town is evacuated after an industrial accident. In light of the recent Union Carbide disaster in India that killed over 2,000 and injured thousands more, ''White Noise'' seems all the more timely and frightening - precisely because of its totally American concerns, its rendering of a particularly American numbness.",1985-01-13T05:00:00+0000

But reports that an evangelical group in California may have collected money for relief that never reached the famine victims in Ethiopia have cast a shadow over the fund-raising drive. Several officials of private charities were quick to call for some kind of government regulation of religious appeals, a proposal that has proved unpopular in the past. Without some controls to reassure the public, they say, the highly praised charity efforts of most religious groups will be hurt. The problem, said Robert Hohler, a Boston fund-raising consultant, is that most church groups have no legal responsibility to spend the contributions on famine aid or otherwise account for their expenditures because they are exempt from the financial accountability regulations that apply to other nonprofit organizations. ''Nobody in this business is enforcing standards,'' he said. ''You have people receiving enormous sums of money but in the field you see so little effect, you wonder where the money has gone.'' And the lack of enforcement, he said, ''imposes a tremendous burden on genuine assistance agencies.'' Some government officials agree. ''The thing about fraudulent fund raising is that it gives legitimate fund raisers a bad name,'' said Arthur E. Dewey, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Refugee Affairs. He has criticized what he called the ''false and misleading'' advertising by International Christian Aid, or I.C.A., which came under investigation after the local prosecutors received complaints about the organization's famine relief drive.",1985-01-20T05:00:00+0000

Her singing of the death scene, one of the juiciest moments for soprano in all of opera, was a model of tonal purity, with enough depth of expression to keep one involved in her portrayal of the bewildered Desdemona.",1985-01-22T05:00:00+0000

It has a good deal to say about loneliness and vulnerability, about sensitive losers and insensitive winners; it takes a wan view of the career open to ''modesty and merit'' (''very poor cards to hold,'' as one character observes). In the abstract, it could easily be made to sound like a study in shades of gray.

The image of the avant- garde writer in resistance to the status quo, keeping a critical distance from the establishment, used to be part of a sustaining myth for many poets and novelists well through the 50's. Today, if you raise the old question of ''selling out'' among writers, the response is likely to be not a tortured ''whether?'' but an ironic ''how?'' The 60's, Ronald Sukenick is working on a nonfiction narrative about the American cultural underground. A novel, ''Blown Away,'' will be published this year, as well as two other books. with an avant-garde vitality yet to be assessed, redefined much in American culture, including middle-class esthetic standards, but at the same time eroded the mystique by which artists had resisted the pressures of the marketplace. Nobody planned it that way, but there is a logic in the history of the situation. Subterraneans wanted simultaneously to rant at Moloch and be part of Moloch, as if you could bite the hand of oppression and then demand it feed you. However, the contradictions that caused the collapse of the underground, once apparent, may finally define its legitimate relation to the culture.",1985-01-27T05:00:00+0000

There were the ''caribous'' - party hard-liners who seemed prepared to plunge to self-destruction rather than abandon the dream of an independent Quebec. The allusion was to the thousands of caribous that drowned fording a swollen river in northern Quebec last autumn. Then there were the ''kangaroos'' - moderates who wanted to tuck the emotional issue of separatism in their pockets as the only way to hold power in Quebec's next provincial election, probably this year. The kangaroos beat the caribous nearly 2 to 1, but at the cost of aggravating party divisions. A walkout by several hundred independence militants raised questions about the political survival not only of Quebec Premier Rene Levesque, but also the party itself. The split, as a party member analyzed it last week, was ''a cleavage in generations,'' not so much in age as in thinking. For some French-speaking Quebecers, the vision of a Quebec independent of English-speaking Canada is undimmed. For the rest, including Mr. Levesque, the founder of the party, the ideal has been overshadowed by more prosaic realities. The Parti Quebecois came to power in 1976 on a wave of disgust with the Liberal Party's corruption and mismanagement. Labor unrest was so severe that Quebec was losing six million work days a year through strikes and lockouts, roughly one day for every citizen.

Rehnquist accused his Supreme Court colleagues of permitting the death penalty to become ''virtually an illusion,'' surrounded by so many ''arcane niceties'' that few death-row inmates faced any real prospect of execution. How dramatically the climate has changed since then, both at the Court and on death row, was underscored last week by another Rehnquist opinion, this time for a 7-to-2 majority. Revising a 17-year-old standard for the selection of juries in capital cases, the Court made it easier for prosecutors to dismiss jurors whose qualms about voting for a death sentence might make them sympathetic to the defense. Now it was the turn of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. to dissent. ''This Court,'' he asserted, ''increasingly acts as the adjunct of the State and its prosecutors in facilitating efficient and expedient conviction and execution irrespective of the Constitution's fundamental guarantees.'' The change in the Court's mood is reflected in the rising numbers of executions. For nearly 16 months after Justice Rehnquist's expression of impatience in 1981, there were no executions in the United States. There were five in 1983.

The three settlements - a fishing village along the shoreline, a cluster of older homes near the center, and an outlying circle of small farms - are all still there. But 20th-century roads are kept clear and collectors should have no difficulty making their way to the 15th annual Stonington Antiques Show. ",1985-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Like many of these fast-rising influential people, the Prime Minister considers the computer something of a talisman. Like them, his habit of mind appears to be that of the manager, the problem-solver, rather than the career politician or civil servant. He, too, favors a measure of free- market competition, decries over- regulation of business, and apparently intends to liberate the growing but still somewhat hamstrung private sector of the economy. In addition, after his landslide election victory late last month, he launched an efficiency drive in the public sector. 'A Good-Time Class'The somewhat amorphous ''five- star culture'' got its name from the salons and restaurants of glittering, relatively new five-star hotels such as Bombay's Taj Mahal and Oberoi Towers, which are frequented by the younger generation of business and professional people. Often attacked as self-seeking, profligate and uncaring about the malnourished masses, they are largely a ''have-a-good-time class,'' according to Aroon Purie, editor of India Today magazine. But they are also gaining recognition as people who hold the keys to industrial expansion and productivity and thus to the growth India is counting on as its population nears 800 million.

Sometimes this is like a processional: Here are the Freedom Riders; then comes the Cuban missile crisis; now President Kennedy is shot in Dallas. Touch football in Hyannis Port is interspersed. Robert Kennedy, as played by Brad Davis, is an upper-class urchin, a tough kid with a veneer of arrogance, who finds wisdom with the years.

The counsel concluded that none of the charges warranted a criminal indictment, so the President renewed the nomination. This week the Senate returns to the crucial question: What qualifies Mr. Meese for this job?","There is much to be said for letting Presidents have their choice in Cabinet officers. But unless the qualifications are cut to fit the candidate, Mr. Meese is not a desirable choice. Some senators seem in no mood to measure the nominee. For them the key factors now are President Reagan's landslide re-election and the independent counsel's report that Mr. Meese has done nothing criminal.
