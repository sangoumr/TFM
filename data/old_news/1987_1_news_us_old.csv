us,Q & A,"Q.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However, I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage, but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank, carburetor and fuel lines. However, storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there, covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First, cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor, so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top, filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom, against the concrete, or on the top, directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation, directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry.",1987-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Last year I was spot-on about the collapse of oil prices, wrong about the control of the Senate and almost everything else. Those who bet on the predictions made here last year are the object of snickering at their political naivete and envy at their new riches. Multiples, start your choices: 1. The world leader leaving the scene in 1987 will be (a) France's staggering Jacques Chirac; (b) Britain's Margaret Thatcher, too confident of whipping Labor's Neil Kinnock; (c) Corazon Aquino, jinxed by a Time cover; (d) Mikhail Gorbachev, shoved aside by Yegor Ligachev for throwing stones in a glasnost. 2. The new household name made famous by the Iran contra-temps will be (a) Gen. John Singlaub; (b) Roy Furmark; (c) Gen. Richard Secord; (d) Duane Clarridge. 3. Israeli-American relations will (a) improve as the sponsorship of the arms dealings by Saudis and Canadians becomes known; (b) suffer when an Israeli officer becomes a target of American prosecutors in the Pollard spy case; (c) be tested as Oliver North tries to pin the blame on David Kimche for the fund diversion. 4. The main Democratic problem will become (a) Mario Cuomo's ignorance of foreign affairs issues; (b) a voter backlash against Democrats for ''losing'' Central America after abandoning the contras; (c) Gary Hart's widening lead making the nomination race look dull; (d) Sam Nunn's inability to express heavy compassion for society's losers. 5. The main Republican problem will become (a) the cognitive dissonance following the moderates' rush to Bob Dole as hard-line, anti-Sandinista diehards turn to George Bush; (b) the Dole sense of humor about his support of subsidized grain sales to Moscow; (c) the inexplicable hurricane following ''the Robertson Curse''; (d) Jack Kemp's reluctance to heed the nautical maxim ''When the water reaches the upper level, follow the rats.'' 6. The historic event of the year will be (a) turmoil in China following Maoist resentment of mild repression of freedom-demanding students; (b) turmoil in the Soviet Union as the forces of change lose control; (c) turmoil in the U.S. as the President and Vice President are staggered by scandal; (d) turmoil in South Africa as black revolution begins; (e) the eerie lack of turmoil anywhere. 7. Hot political vogue verb of the year will be (a) immunize; (b) sharing; (c) distance oneself; (d) outcompete. 8. White House chief of staff at year-end will be (a) Don Regan; (b) Baker, James or Howard; (c) Paul Laxalt; (d) Drew Lewis; (e) Cap Weinberger. 9. A weakened Presidency will result in (a) Democratic insistence on a tax increase as the price for S.D.I.; (b) Soviet toughness in arms reduction negotiations to capitalize on President Reagan's need for a deal; (c) Soviet acceptance of space-defense testing rather than postpone a deal well into the next Presidency; (d) a Republican turn toward Jeane Kirkpatrick as nominee. 10. The new C.I.A. chief will be (a) an intelligence pro not known to the general public, like Gen. William Odom; (b) a trusted figure to restore credibility in the coming maelstrom, like William Webster of the F.B.I.; (c) a sitting senator, like Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming. 11. The sleeper best seller among the politerati will be (a) Michael Deaver's loyalist memoir of the Reagans; (b) Jenifer Harvey Lang's fearless ''Tastings: the Best From Ketchup to Caviar'' (Crown); (c) Jane Nevins's timely ''Toward 200: the Constitution and its Celebration'' (Richardson & Steirman); (d) Sam Donaldson's ''Hold On, Mr. President!'' (Random House), its title gaining an unintended double meaning. 12. The economic scenario will be (a) under 2 percent real growth, interest rates up, stock market down; (b) better growth, rates down, market up; (c) 5 percent growth, boom; (d) no growth, bust. 13. Replacing Paul Volcker at the Fed will be (a) a banker like William Butcher of Chase, or Gerald Corrigan or Karen Horn of the Fed; (b) an economist like Fed vice chairman Manuel Johnson, Alan Greenspan, Beryl Sprinkel or Martin Anderson; (c) George Shultz, the independent-minded team player accused of being a loner by huddled professional loners; (d) Donald Regan, who now might be willing to accept a demotion. 14.

Lightning Video. 50 Minutes. $19.95. Purists may be scandalized: the producers of this new animated version of the Robin Hood chronicle have pitted Little John against Robin Hood in a wrestling match, instead of the fabled bout with quarterstaves. (Could it be, judging from the production's flat television animation by Australia's Burbank Films, that the clashing staves were too expensive to render?) Reassuringly, the other elements of the Robin Hood legend have survived intact in this latest dramatization of life in the greenwood with the band of merry men. The production is nicely designed and wittily written. And it boasts another, not inconsiderable, asset: some wonderful voices, most notably those of Robert Colby's hearty Robin Hood and Helen Morse's endearing Maid Marian.",1987-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Soon after takeoff, the pilot reported an engine on fire. Page 1 A Cuban-American's role in supplying weapons to Nicaraguan rebels was described in his first public statement on the subject. The man, Felix Rodriguez, said he was ''marginally involved.'' #8 Military analysis: Central America is in for more violence in 1987, say Government and military officials, who expect a sharp upturn in fighting between the Nicaraguan rebels and Sandinista forces. #7 Self-government for Mexico City has recently become a focus for the Mexican opposition. A coalition of four leftist parties and Mexico's one rightist party is leading the campaign. #6 A bomb exploded in Johannesburg, and the police said a black woman was seriously wounded and two other people were slightly hurt. The explosion was the first in the city center for several months. #3 A recent wave of violence in India seen in protests over regional, religious and linguistic grievances has underscored the fact that national integration remains difficult. #14 Six New Delhi shelters offer warmth to many poor people and an alternative to sleeping outside. More than 100 people are reported to have died in a cold spell sweeping the plains of northern India. #15 The West's effect on Singapore may be cause for concern, says its Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who was educated in Britain. He worries that the country is losing its Asian cultural bearings. #16 Chad said Libya dropped napalm from aircraft on two northern towns that were retaken from the Libyans this week and that Libyan ground forces had begun an attack on one of them.

In the first minutes of the San Juan fire, Pat Walter, a 41-year-old pilot, initiated a daring rooftop rescue of trapped guests until larger Navy helicopters arrived. #22 Spending cuts for many agencies, but an increase for NASA, are envisioned in President Reagan's new budget. Documents show reductions for the Departments of Education, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Transportation. #1 The President faces surgery, a colonoscopy today and prostate surgery tomorrow. Experts say his chances of coming through the two grueling procedures with no major difficulty are good. #1 A U.S. study of Japanese education has linked Japan's economic success to the rigorous efficiency of its primary and secondary schools. The study sought to draw lessons from what it described as a ''learning society.'' #1 Tokyo looks at U.S. schools 10 The Constitution's bicentennial celebration began in Philadelphia with fireworks on New Year's Eve, touching off what promises to be a yearlong, thoughtful examination of the American political system. #1 The West's worst winter drought in a decade is keeping skiers off the slopes, particularly in California and Utah. Resort operators say they have already lost millions of dollars because of reduced business. #18 Boston is cleaning up its harbor.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE TRIUMPH OF POLITICS: The Inside Story of the Reagan Revolution, by David A. Stockman. (Avon, $4.95.) The former budget director's inside account of how economic policy is made is a ''devastating portrait of high-comedy incompetence and low deceit in the Reagan White House'' as well as ''a valuable document of the American political condition,'' Michael Kinsley said in The Book Review last year. THE GOOD APPRENTICE, by Iris Murdoch. (Penguin, $7.95.) Iris Murdoch's novel is the story of two stepbrothers - Edward, a university student who must cope with his guilt and grief after causing a friend's death, and Stuart, who renounces a brilliant career to devote himself to good works. The author has ''authentic spiritual originality,'' Harold Bloom said here last year. ''Miss Murdoch's particular mastery is in representing the maelstrom of falling in love. . . . No other contemporary British novelist seems to me of her eminence. . . . She has earned now the tribute she made to Sartre more than 30 years ago. She too has the style of the age.'' THE FIFTY-MINUTE HOUR: A Collection of True Psychoanalytic Tales, by Robert Lindner. (Delta Diamond, $6.95.) Robert Lindner's portrait of psychoanalysis takes the form of five case studies - including those of a bulimic woman, a rapist-murderer and a schizophrenic scientist. The author ''is a psychoanalyst as well as a fine storyteller,'' our reviewer, Jean Evans, said in 1954. ''In this book the reader learns something about the doctor as well as about his patients, and about the interplay that is psychoanalysis.'' ODESSA BEACH, by Bob Leuci. (Signet/New American Library, $3.95.) One step ahead of the K.G.B., a Russian black marketeer arrives in Brooklyn and muscles in on the mob. This is a Mafia thriller with ''an unusual twist,'' Newgate Callendar said here last year. ''Mr. Leuci is a very good technician who would appear to know a good deal about organized crime in New York. . . . Everything rings true.'' IMMODEST ACTS: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy, by Judith C. Brown. (Oxford University, $6.95.) Benedetta Carlini, a 17th-century nun and mystic, became a powerful abbess but fell into disgrace when she was accused of faking miracles and having a lesbian affair. Her story, based on papers discovered in Florentine archives, is ''fascinating and highly readable,'' Frederika Randall said here a year ago. SELECTED SHORT STORIES OF PADRAIC COLUM, edited by Sanford Sternlicht. (Syracuse University, $12.95.) These 13 early stories by Padraic Colum ''are in the main vignettes, chapters in the lives of the Irish peasantry at the turn of the century,'' Thomas Lask said in The Book Review in 1985. ''The writing is informal, uncluttered, colloquial with those precise images and turns of phrase that could have easily been shaped into formal verse.'' TENDER OFFER: The Sneak Attack in Corporate Takeovers, by Dorman L. Commons. (Penguin, $6.95.) The former chief executive officer of the Natomas Company offers a personal account of its unfriendly takeover by the Diamond Shamrock Corporation. This is ''the most human document to come out of the high-stakes takeover wars,'' Hal Goodman said in these pages in 1985. WHITE WATER, by Joyce Reiser Kornblatt. (Laurel/ Dell, $3.95.) This novel about a family brought together in Miami for a wedding moves with ''energy and narrative conviction,'' Kathryn Morton said in The Book Review in 1985. ''First novels often have problems of shape. But some, like 'White Water,' by the most promising authors, lift the reader over the rough structure on the strength of their wit and insight, the rich sound of voices and the energetic flow of invention.'' THREE CENTURIES OF HARVARD: 1636-1936, by Samuel Eliot Morison. (Belknap/Harvard University, Paper, $9.95. Cloth, $25.) This history of Harvard uses ''precise and luminous strokes'' to tell a story ''rich in details as to the customs and manners of three centuries,'' John Corbin said here in 1936. McKAY'S BEES, by Thomas McMahon. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $5.95.) Set in 1855, Thomas McMahon's novel is populated by scientists and tinkerers, chiefly Gordon McKay, who sets out for Kansas to build a city based on beekeeping. Not one of the characters is a stereotypical scientist, our reviewer, Edmund White, said in 1979. ''Science itself informs the descriptions that run through the novel, and in this regard Mr. McMahon,'' himself a scientist, ''is at his most original.'' THE EVIDENCE NEVER LIES: The Casebook of a Modern Sherlock Holmes, by Alfred Allan Lewis with Herbert Leon MacDonell. (Laurel/Dell, $7.95.) An authority on bloodstains, ballistics and fingerprints, Herbert Leon MacDonell has served as an expert witness in scores of murder cases, seven of which are recounted here. ''All are intriguing,'' one reviewer said in 1984, ''and one only wishes there were more.'' NOBODY'S ANGEL, by Thomas McGuane. (Vintage, $6.95.) The hero of Thomas McGuane's sixth novel, Patrick Fitzpatrick, is a 36-year-old former military officer who comes home to his family's Montana ranch. ''The play of wit is constant and redeeming,'' Vance Bourjaily said in these pages in 1982. NO SENSE OF PLACE: The Impact of Electronic Media on Social Behavior, by Joshua Meyrowitz. (Oxford University, $9.95.) The author examines how electronic media - particularly television - have altered Americans' sense of place and the ways we give and receive social information. In 1985 one reviewer called it a well-written and masterly study, ''a fine combination of perceptive analysis and creative synthesis.''",1987-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Let's be honest, batteries are good either to make toy robots whir forever, or to make flashlights work so you can play coal miner. The best that bottled water will get you is a full water pistol.

For a decade, the 1 percent level had been the outer limit of permissible military spending. So its abrogation, even by a hair-thin margin, produced a strong, if predictable, reaction.

The transition from high school student to college student is traumatic at best, but for the student-athlete the effect of this change is magnified. The star high school athlete has reached a level of prominence that few people attain. In college most of these stars receive considerably less attention, and this can make the transition even more traumatic. The pressures of competition in varsity athletics should be delayed until the sophomore year to allow the student-athletes time to adjust to their new scholastic challenges as well as the challenges of maturing, living away from home and adjusting to college life.

The heat is so oppressive and the landscape so bleak that one wonders why the Children of Israel chose to settle here and indeed, why it has been the site of confrontation for thousands of years. Until, that is, you enter the Galilee. This is the region most prominent in the Gospels, where the Sea of Galilee and the villages around it are mentioned frequently and from whose fishermen came Jesus' disciples.

They are covered with olive groves, fruit orchards, banana plantations and plentiful, lush vegetation. The climate becomes gentle and the Jordan reappears, flowing out of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee in a wide, meandering stream. In this lovely setting, at Kibbutz Kinneret, there is a baptism site, Yardenit, which is free to visitors.",1987-01-04T05:00:00+0000

Mandlikova, a Czechoslovak who has applied for Australian citizenship, broke Shriver twice in the opening set and won it in 26 minutes.

But Mandlikova recovered and dominated the match as she broke Shriver in the fifth game of the deciding set.

us,A LOOK AT THE TEAMS,"Boston College Coach: Jim O'Brien 1985-86: 13-15 over all, 4-12 Big East Current Record: 7-3, 0-0 Outlook: The Eagles are in desperate need of scoring and muscle. In the games before conference play started, they finished seventh among Big East teams in rebound margin while finishing last in scoring with a 66.4 point-per-game average. The Eagles have held the opposition to 62.5 points per game, second lowest total among league teams. The problem facing O'Brien in his first season as coach is scoring. Connecticut Coach: Jim Calhoun 1985-86: 12-16, 3-13 Current Record: 5-6, 0-2 Outlook: Jim Calhoun is known for his ability to get the most out of his players, though this year could be like getting blood from a turnip. He favors an aggressive wide open running game, but the Huskies lack the personnel this season to do it. Cliff Robinson, a 6-8 sophomore forward, and Jeff King, a spindly 6-10 center, provide most of the offense. Robinson and Gary Besselink, a 6-9 senior forward look to be one of the better rebounding tandems in the conference. Georgetown Coach: John Thompson 1985-86: 24-8, 11-5 Current Record: 9-1, 0-1 Outlook: Despite having only one senior on the team, Georgetown is a prime contender for the conference title. Reggie Williams, a 6-7 senior forward-guard, could be the smoothest player in the nation at his position. He averaged 26 points per game in the Hoyas' first nine games. Georgetown's strength has been an extremely athletic and talented bench that can go seven to eight deep. Georgetown's substitutes scored a league leading 33.1 points per game during the nonconference games. The challenge facing Georgetown is getting increased point production from its big players. Pittsburgh Coach: Paul Evans 1985-86: 15-14, 6-10 Current Record: 9-2, 1-0 Outlook: Paul Evans has incorporated a patiently opportunistic style of play that utilizes the Panthers numerous offensive weapons. Three Panthers finished among the top 10 scorers in nonconference play. Some other ominous statistics for conference rivals are that the Panthers held opponents to 37 percent shooting accuracy and led all teams in rebounding. Providence Coach: Rick Pitino 1985-86: 17-14, 7-9 Current Record: 9-2, 0-1 Outlook: Don't be surprised if Providence replaces one of the Big Four -Villanova, Georgetown, Syracuse and St. John's - in the conference's upper echelon. Delray Brooks, a 6-3 sophomore guard, has joined Billy Donovan in the backcourt and already is averaging 18 points a game. Donovan loves the new 3-point field goal and has been throwing them up from everywhere. In fact, the Friars are scoring points by the bushels - 91.9 per game - but they're still giving up too many - 73.4 - for a championship quality team. St. John's Coach: Lou Carnesecca 1985-86: 31-51, 14-2 Current Record: 9-1, 1-1 Outlook: Big East coaches picked St. John's to finish fifth in the conference this season, and it looks as if they may have set him up for coach of the year honors. The key for St. John's will be outstanding play from Mark Jackson, Willie Glass and Shelton Jones, with timely help from four players off the bench. Seton Hall Coach: P.J. Carlesimo 1985-86: 14-18, 3-13 Current Record: 9-1, 1-1 Outlook: Seton Hall is the most improved team. The question is whether they can win in the Big East. Mark Bryant, a 6-9 junior center, and James Major, a 6-0 junior guard are two of the Big East's better scorers. Rebounding is a problem, however, and the Pirates have to get more from their bench. Syracuse Coach: Jim Boeheim 1985-86: 26-6, 14-2 Current Record: 12-0, 1-0 Outlook: This may be the most versatile and well-rounded team Boeheim has recently coached. Dwayne Washington is gone but Greg Monroe, Sherman Douglas and the freshman guard, Stevie Thompson, could be the conference's most efficient backcourt.",1987-01-05T05:00:00+0000

The Bruins outshot the Canadiens, 40-20. But they were frustrated by the acrobatic goaltending of Patrick Roy before Walter broke a tie just 21 seconds after the Bruins' Reed Larson was penalized for high-sticking at 16:16 of the third period. Bobby Smith set up the deciding goal by circling the Boston net and letting go a soft shot, which Bill Ranford, the Boston goalie, blocked. The rebound popped a couple of feet into the air and Walter whacked home his seventh goal of the season. The Canadiens took a 1-0 lead in the first period as Shayne Corson converted a passout from Mats Naslund for his 10th goal at 14:15. The Bruins tied the score at 1:50 of the third period when Greg Johnston fired a 15-footer into the net.(AP) Capitals 6, Blues 4: Pete Peeters, making his first start in goal after being recalled from the minors, led Washington. Peters was brought up from Washington's minor league team in Binghamton over the weekend. He shut out St. Louis over the last 34:11. The victory snapped a three-game St. Louis winning streak and was only the fourth triumph for Washington in the last 11 games.Washington's Mike Gartner broke a 4-4 tie when he fired a slapshot past the St. Louis goalie, Rick Wamsley, from point-blank range at 15:37 of the second period.

Barkley scored 8 consecutive points in a 1:02 stretch of the fourth quarter, including two slam dunks and a 3-point shot, to give the 76ers a 100-88 advantage with 5:01 left. Michael Cage led the Clippers with 25 points.(AP) Pacers 144, Mavericks 135: Wayman Tisdale and Steve Stipanovich scored 27 points each to lead Indiana. The loss ended a four-game winning streak for Dallas, which also had won nine straight on its home court. The Mavericks' last home loss was 114-110 to the Los Angeles Lakers Dec. 5. Mark Aguirre had 28 points, Rolando Blackman 24 and James Donaldson 23 for Dallas. The Pacers, gaining their third straight victory, hit 65.3 percent percent from the field - the hottest shooting ever recorded against Dallas on its home court. Dallas last led at 99-97 with 2:44 remaining in the third quarter. Kyle Macy then hit a 3-point basket to put Indiana ahead for good. Indiana's 144 points were the most ever scored against Dallas in a regular-season game in Reunion Arena.

The targets of his manic imagination are large -including religion (''The Origin of the Brunists''), baseball (''The Universal Baseball Association, J. Henry Waugh, Prop.''), the Presidency and anti-Communist fervor (''The Public Burning'') - and the methods he employs are often equally subversive of literary and philosophical conventions. In ''Pricksongs and Descants,'' he rewrote the stories of Joseph and Mary, Little Red Riding Hood, and Hansel and Gretel. In ''Gerald's Party,'' he refashioned the old-fashioned mystery story, turning its orderly narrative process into a mirror of mayhem and fear.",1987-01-07T05:00:00+0000

This means that researchers can now use a calculator to solve mathematical problems without using numbers; A plus B works just as fine as 1 plus 2.

The ground is covered with sheet plastic and a coating of cement, and the foundation walls are cinder block with a small vent in one side. The problem is that although the Jacuzzi tub, sink and toilet in that room do not seem to be leaking, we are getting a dank, musty odor throughout the house that seems to come up through the floor. Can you suggest what to do? A.Sounds to me as though your main problem is not enough ventilation in the crawl space. There should be at least two vents on opposite sides to assure good cross ventilation. One accepted standard for the size of these vents is to make sure there is at least one square foot of unobstructed opening for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the crawl space (assuming that all the dirt is covered with plastic or cement; otherwise you would need about 10 times as much). Remember that if the vent opening has louvers to shed rain and screening to keep out insects this cuts the effective size of the opening by about half, so the vent's overall size must be about twice as big. Q.Our three-year-old house has oak parquet floors throughout. All was well last winter after we moved in, but then when the weather got very humid the floor began to swell and buckle in several places. Now that the heat is on, all is normal again. What can we do to avoid the same problem again next summer? A.My guess is that the flooring was put down without providing enough clearance around the edges (next to the walls) to allow for expansion and contraction. It's also possible that a careless workman nailed the baseboards to the flooring in those rooms (they should be nailed to the wall framing only). The problem this causes is that even if there is enough clearance the flooring cannot ''move'' when it expands. To check, pull off a section of baseboard in the room where the problem occurred and make sure there is at least one-quarter to one-half an inch of clearance for the flooring. If not, you may have to pick up and trim the last row of squares to allow for this.",1987-01-08T05:00:00+0000

The triumph prevented New York from tying the Major Indoor Soccer League record of 14 consecutive defeats set by the Kansas City Comets in 1981-82.(AP) N.B.A. Lakers 147, Nuggets 109: Byron Scott scored 23 points and Earvin (Magic) Johnson had 20 points and 12 assists in leading Los Angeles. The victory was the eighth in a row for the Lakers, who have a 26-6 record, the best in the N.B.A. The loss was the fifth straight for the Nuggets. The Nuggets took a 31-21 lead, but the Lakers scored 12 of the final 16 points of the first quarter to trail by only 35-33. Los Angeles then went ahead for good with a 9-0 streak to start the second period. The Lakers went on to score 18 of the first 24 points of the quarter for a 51-41 advantage. It was 73-57 at halftime and the Nuggets got no closer than 16 points after that.

Philadelphia clamped a lid on the Atlanta star, Dominique Wilkins, in the first half, holding him to only 2 points. Wilkins finished with 24 points.(AP) Celtics 119, Bucks 92: Kevin McHale scored 22 of his 28 points in the first half as Boston beat Milwaukee, gaining its sixth consecutive victory.

Robitaille scored his 24th goal at 2:50 of the first period, banging the third rebound behind the goaltender, Andy Moog. Dave Taylor and Grant Ledyard scored before the first period ended, chasing Moog to the bench. Roland Melanson stopped 28 shots in the Los Angeles net.(AP) Golf O'Grady Ties for Lead: Mark Calcavecchia played his last seven holes in seven under par and tied Mac O'Grady for the first-round lead yesterday in the $500,000 Tournament of Champions golf tournament at Carlsbad, Calif.

''I'm surprised to be able to score as well as I did,'' said O'Grady, who was fined and suspended last year by the commissioner, Deane Beman, for his criticism of the tour. Calcavecchia one-putted 12 times, including the last 7 holes. But he also three-putted twice, once from 4 feet, on the 11th hole. On the 12th, he started his big drive with a 20-foot putt for an eagle-3.

Iain Murray, skipper of Kookaburra III, said his crew had to bail the boat for the rest of the race to keep it from sinking. Both teams said they would be able to repair the boats overnight. Protests were lodged on each side, but the outcome of the race does not affect either boat's place in the finals.

The fourth year and seventh season of Vintage Jazz concerts is part of the Vineyard Theater's first Old Wave Festival, made up of one-time avant-garde music that is now rear guard - early music of the 18th century and traditional jazz from the early 20th century. The Vintage Jazz series opens tomorrow evening at 8 with the father-son team of Bucky and John Pizzarelli. Bucky Pizzarelli was a Swing Era guitarist with Vaughan Monroe's orchestra and has been a vitalizing co-leader of groups with the cornetist Ruby Braff and the guitarist George Barnes, as well as the leader of his own trios and duos and a versatile solo performer. John Pizzarelli has followed in his father's footsteps as a guitarist and is also a singer who is part of the forward-looking jazz contingent. The second concert in the series, which will continue through the next two weekends, will be given on Sunday afternoon at 3 by Jordan Sandke and his quartet. Mr. Sandke is in his eighth year as a trumpet player in the Widespread Jazz Orchestra, which draws on big-band jazz of the 1920's and 30's. His program with his group - Jaki Byard on piano, Mark Minkler on bass and Kenny Washington on drums - will include tributes to three landmark trumpet players, Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge and Fats Navarro.

A slender vertical bar of light seems to pin him there, and just as the agony reaches breaking point, the door tears away from its frame and sends the still-squirming Raskolnikov hurtling with it across the blackened stage. Like a passenger on a grotesque amusement-park ride, Raskolnikov finds other terrors awaiting - eerie echoes, more swinging doors, anonymous phantoms of the psychic underground.

The Lakers trailed by 99-94 with 2:55 remaining after three straight baskets from James Worthy, but the Jazz moved out of danger, 103-94, as Stockton fed Malone and Bailey for baskets.

The Clippers have lost 26 of their last 27 games and own the league's worst record at 4-29. The victory snapped athe Cavaliers' four-game losing streak. (AP) N.H.L.

(AP) America's Cup Australia IV Disqualified: A protest jury has disqualified Alan Bond's Australia IV from a race it won Wednesday against Kevin Parry's Kookaburra III in Freemantle, Australia. Even though the upset does not affect Australia IV's position in the final series to choose a defender, it does weaken the team's hold on that slot. If the syndicate should lose another protest - and there is a possibility that a previous protest hearing may be reopened - Australia IV could be knocked out of the finals and be replaced by Kookaburra II, Parry's other boat. Australia IV and Kookaburra III are scheduled to meet in a five-of-nine-race series beginning Jan. 14 for the right to defend the Cup. Parry's syndicate has asked the protest jury to reopen a case it decided in Australia IV's favor Wednesday. At issue was whether a new sail that Australia IV had introduced was rigged properly.

Boxing Olajide Wins Title: Michael (the Silk) Olajide of New York won the Continental Americas middleweight championship at the Felt Forum when he knocked out Richard Burton of the Bronx, at 1:38 of the fourth round in a scheduled 12-round bout. The rap against Olajide, who is ranked fifth by the World Boxing Association and seventh by the World Boxing Council, had been that he lacked the big punch. But he proved otherwise against Burton, knocking him down toward the end of the third round and putting him out for good in the fourth. Olajide, who weighed 157 pounds, is now 21-0 with 15 knockouts. Burton, who weighed 158, drops to 13-4 with 11 knockouts.

North may have planned many arms shipments to the Nicaraguan rebels through Portugal, according to Congressional sources who say the Senate Intelligence Committee has uncovered evidence. Page 1 White House documents show that considerations beyond the release of American hostages influenced the President's authorization of arms shipments to Iran. The documents were released to reinforce Mr. Reagan's claim that his approval was part of a broad-based policy.#1 News analysis: A Senate Iran report has raised questions about Israel's role in persuading Mr. Reagan to violate his own policies of never paying ransom to terrorists and of not supplying arms to Iran. #6 Three inquiries into aid to the contras have been shut down, the Justice Department said, and will not be resumed until they have been reviewed by the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair.#4 Jim Wright attacked Mr. Reagan, saying that the White House had ''breached'' its relations with Congress because of the Iran-contra affair. The new House Speaker said ''the law was violated.''#6 A new Nicaraguan constitution guarantees the right to hold meetings and lawful demonstrations and to publish uncensored news. But an existing state of emergency has the effect of suspending many of the new provisions. #4 A right-wing fund raiser gave cash to a senior Nicaraguan rebel official last year and to a contra rebel political office, contra officials say. Carl R. Channell worked closely with Oliver L. North. #5 Iran mounted a new offensive in the Persian Gulf war, and both sides reported heavy fighting near the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Each side's press agency reported heavy enemy casualties. #1 A bomb exploded in Johannesburg, ripping through parts of a department store and causing extensive damage. The store had been evacuated, and no injuries were reported. #4 A new segregated black township, Lethlabile, is one of South Africa's latest creations, a place to which people from another township have been consigned by an official design over which they have no control. 4 George Shultz praised Chad's forces and gave an optimistic assessment of its ability to combat Libyan troops in continuing battles in northern Chad. Mr. Shultz spoke as he flew from Cameroon to Kenya. #3 Fear of violence in France and a mood of crisis has resulted from crippling public sector strikes that continue on the railroads, the subway and bus systems and in the state-run power company. #3 New currency values for Europe are expected to be set this weekend, monetary officials indicated. A meeting to discuss realignment of the values is scheduled for Saturday, they said. #35 Intellectuals criticized in Beijing 28 National#7-8, 16, 50 The nation's unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a point last month to 6.6 percent, the lowest level since March 1980, the Labor Department said. Analysts said the figures were stronger than expected.#1 Jobless rate at 12-year low 50 A drug seems to halt an AIDS-related infection in six months of tests, a drug company said. Ribavirin is the first drug that has seemed to prevent AIDS from developing in patients with early signs of infection.#1 Five astronauts will fly the shuttle on its first flight once the current fleet repair operations are complete. The crew is the first to be comprised solely of astronauts who have previous experience in space. 7 Details of the San Juan hotel fire, pieced together through interviews with survivors and investigators, raise questions about the Dupont Plaza's response to danger, its safety equipment and procedures. 16 A football coach who stresses studies has been appointed by the University of Alabama, signaling changed priorities for the school and placing it in the forefront of a national movement to discipline college sports. 7 The merits of seat belts on Amtrak coaches and other commuter rail systems that use the Northeast Corridor will be considered by the Government's chief railroad safety officer, he said. #7 Oil drilling on a wildlife refuge is at issue, as debate over an Interior De partment proposal to allow oil drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge opened amid seemingly irreconcilable differences. 8 A ruling on treatment for the autistic students at a Boston school came when a judge approved an agreement under which he will decide case by case when the school may use punishment as a treatment. 50 $500 million in aid for the homeless has been proposed by leaders in the House of Representatives who say they hope to get the money by early spring. The package includes food, shelter and other aid. #31 Federal Customs officials charged three people from a New Orleans suburb with shipping oilfield equipment to Libya, in violation of an embargo ordered last February by President Reagan.#33 Smithsonian sets minorities goal 8 Washington Talk#8 Planning Holocaust Museum Regional#29-32 New York State will not appeal a Federal court ruling allowing a New Jersey dairy to sell its milk in all five boroughs of New York City, Governor Cuomo announced yesterday.#1 News analysis: Mario Cuomo has sent mixed signals over the last week about whether he will run for President. The Governor is under pressure from national Democratic figures to state his intentions. #1 More homeless people fill shelters in New York City than ever before. In the last week, as many as 10,108 people have used the city's shelter system, about 1,300 more than at the same time last year. #29 A housing plan may collapse almost a year after a group of New York City's leading developers proposed it. The developers had offered to build 3,000 apartments for middle-income New Yorkers at no profit.#29 A doctor testified in the Baby M trial that it was ''medically reasonable'' for Dr. Elizabeth Stern, the wife of the baby's father, to avoid pregnancy because she had a mild case of multiple sclerosis. #30 State to shift inmates with AIDS 6 Catherine St. shelter criticized 31 Schools get racism curriculum 31 Neediest Cases#32",1987-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Even worse, the cigarette smoke is intense as most of the French seem addicted to tobacco. Recently, however, we had a lovely dinner at a small Parisian restaurant (recommended by The New York Times). The food was excellent.

If you have never heard of George Halas, Don Coryell or Dan Fouts then you can stiff-arm Gene Klein's breezy story of what it's like to own your own National Football League team. But if you start browsing in it, Mr. Klein's straight talk and first-rate wisecracking will mousetrap you into the world of big, big men and huge amounts of money. Mr. Klein was a Bronx boy who played some football at New York University: ''The best thing that could be said about my hands is that I had two of them.'' After he made his first millions selling used cars in California, he bought, for $10 million in 1966, the San Diego Chargers, a name derived not from lightning but from the fact that the first owner, Barron Hilton, was in credit cards. George Halas, the thrifty founder of the Chicago Bears, is described by one of his star players as a man who ''threw nickels around as if they were manhole covers.'' Mr. Klein, who is 6 feet 5 inches tall, recalls attacking the great passer Dan Fouts during a salary dispute. Don Coryell, the coach whose complicated plays made the Chargers winners, urged his teams to be killer dogs chasing the rabbit, killer bees stinging the foe. One player recalls, ''When we were going to be playing on a wet field, he wanted us to be killer ducks.'' On drugs: ''If the user was a star, or superstar, we learned to live with his problem.'' Of luck: ''If someone throws a candy wrapper on the ground in San Diego, a candy tree will sprout.'' The team was sold in 1984 for about $50 million.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

These are the hard basics of running for President, particularly for an underdog like Senator Gary Hart in 1984: up before a cold New Hampshire dawn in a forlorn motel or a campaign worker's house to climb into a van driven by a campaign volunteer to accost hurrying factory workers at the plant gate or sleepy diners in a greasy spoon. Constantly scrambling for money and steeling yourself during shouting matches between campaign aides over whether Iowa or New Hampshire should get it. Doggedly persisting for nearly two years while reporters don't mention your candidacy or, if they do, brush you off as insignificant. Susan Berry Casey, co-director of Gary Hart's 1984 primary campaign in New Hampshire, has written a detailed - sometimes too detailed - chronicle of the New Hampshire primary. Her criticism of the press and television is harsh - and probably justified. They ignored and underestimated Mr. Hart all through 1983, overestimating at the same time Senator John Glenn's electoral muscle. Then a 16 percent Hart showing in Iowa became a victory of sorts that snowballed into the real New Hampshire victory a week later. Later, Hart the hero gave way to Hart the hack, whose age and name change were the subjects of reportorial investigations that helped sink the candidate. Despite it all, Ms. Casey is still hooked on Gary Hart and politics. She and her family have moved to Denver and the Hart command post for the next round of doughnuts at dawn in New Hampshire, Iowa and other 1988 primary and caucus states.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CLAY WALLS. By Kim Ronyoung. (Permanent Press, $18.95.) This earnest novel about Korean immigrants begins with a Los Angeles matron and her hired help bent over the rim of a toilet. The employer is pointing out a missed stain to the plucky Asian heroine, who calls her ungrateful benefactor sangnyun (''low woman'') and tells her where to put the job. From then on, the path is rocky for the Chun family, whose three-part story forms the core of this novel, one of the first about the plight of Korean Americans. The Chuns, married by arrangement, leave Korea in haste in 1919 to escape impending Japanese persecution. They settle among a large, politically active Korean community in Los Angeles, start a family, and fall into the business of selling produce, first with shiny apples on the street and later with an expanded wholesale setup. In political meetings they vent animosity for the Japanese overlords and arrange supply shipments for their fighting compatriots. Meanwhile, their second-generation children are turning into full-fledged Americans. Even more of a patriotic disappointment is their treatment by misunderstanding Americans. At father Chun's funeral, some of the mourning is over a grievous mistake on the Las Vegas death certificate; his race is listed as Chinese. And when the Government orders California's Japanese into internment camps for the duration of World War II, they include Koreans until someone goes to Washington to explain Korean history. These political-historical moments are the pearls in the novel, for the writing tends to get flat-footed and overexplanatory, and the tensions not peculiar to Koreans - such as adolescent sexual confusion - are treated routinely. Still, one is grateful for being invited into that closeted but lively world.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

Both shows, staged by Joe Layton, are unrelenting star vehicles in which the singer, then in her mid-20's, paraded front and center, without the support of famous guests. ''My Name Is Barbra,'' which aired in April 1965, was filmed in black and white and is the more memorable. In it, the star imagines herself as a kooky 5-year-old dashing about an oversized playground singing ''I'm Late.'' As a grown-up waif, she sweeps through a deserted Bergdorf-Goodman trying on outfits while singing ''Secondhand Rose.'' Though the star had plenty of brass even in 1965, her singing, higher and thinner then, is tinged with a vulnerability that has since vanished.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

Charlie (Yardbird) Parker, coming out of Kansas City, Kan., in the Depression, struggled in Harlem to find a voice on saxophone. He hit his stride in the 1940's and liberated improvisational rhythms with brilliant innovations that have exerted a profound influence on jazz since World War II. His work was revered by musicians but largely ignored in the popular media. It was just one irony in a life too large for the times. Mr. Giddins, a Village Voice critic and author of two substantial books on jazz, has written an elegant, incisive essay on Parker, and has included a series of black-and-white photographs that capture Parker with poetic grace. Addicted to heroin in his teens, Parker led a tragic life, stalked by his habit, enveloped at different times by three women who loved him deeply; after a 1947 detoxification, he showed new enthusiasm for family life and might have cultivated domestic joys had the habit not kicked back. Still, writes Mr. Giddins, the addiction ''never entirely subverted his personality. He remained dignified, open, generous, curious, concerned.'' He died in 1955, at 34. This book does not pretend to be a definitive biography; however, it is as penetrating a character study of Bird as any yet written and that is no small accomplishment.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

The attention paid to this minority of women serves to distract attention from the majority of women who have always juggled these demands. The overemphasis on women who work out of choice rather than necessity serves only to increase the demands on those who must work and whose contributions to family, community and profession are largely ignored.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THESE AMERICAN LANDS: Parks, Wilderness, and the Public Lands. By Dyan Zaslowsky and the Wilderness Society. (Holt, $22.95.) The voice of Robert Marshall echoes loud in ''These American Lands.'' Marshall was a founder of the Wilderness Society in 1935 and his memory and spirit likely still guide the organization. Thus it is not surprising that a book produced by the society is an unrelenting call for conservation and an almost unforgiving assessment of the way the Government has managed the more than 600 million acres of national parks, forest, resource lands, wildlife refuges, designated wildernesses, wild and scenic rivers and national trails. Moreover, it could be argued that the nation's parks and wilds need a passionate voice and stiff-necked advocate. But a polemic without a sense of perspective can quickly become shrill and lose the reader. Dyan Zaslowsky and the Wilderness Society, writing about the aggressive harvest of lumber in the 19th century and its effect on the nation's forests, say, ''We ripped at our forests in a frenzy of ignorance until, appalled by what we had accomplished, we fumbled toward a concept we chose to call 'Wise Use.' '' (It might have been enough to point out, as they did earlier, that in Michigan alone, by the end of the 19th century, enough white pine lumber had been cut to build 10 million six-room houses.) What is more, the book fails to convey the sense of history and beauty and wild longing that America's vistas often evoke. Still, this is a useful book and an important one. It catalogues the history and laws and major personalities associated with America's various public lands and the responsible Federal agencies, such as the National Park Service. At the end of each chapter, the authors suggest legislation or revisions in current laws and offer common-sense policies and guidelines.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

Worn summer and winter, casually and as Sunday best, these leather shorts or knickers are passed down from father to son, so that buying lederhosen is an investment that might cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars depending upon length (almost kneecap or knicker), embroidery (without or with, machine or hand) and whether the lederhosen is readymade or custom fit. The leather should be from Hirsch (stag) or Gams (chamois) as both are hardy animals, especially the elusive Gams, used to the rigors of winter and the aerobic exercise of leaping from crag to crag.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE LAY OF THE LAND. By Dean Crawford. (Viking, $16.95.) Jeremy and Leslie are wayward, late 1960's spirits, free from their spouses, eager to start anew, anxious yet happy to be living near one another - only there's something peculiar about their titillatingly close friendship. They are brother and sister. This first novel is narrated in a compelling voice by Jeremy, who recalls traversing the country in his van in 1974, when he was 24, following his 30-year-old sister in her Volkswagen bus. They drive from the East Coast to northern California, where they partly grew up and where they are resettling in the lush hills. Through flashbacks, Jeremy recounts their youth in California, Hawaii and eventually Connecticut; and he finely evokes the tumultous days of Richard Nixon, Vietnam, marijuana and women's liberation. Dean Crawford's writing can be abstract and careless, but an impassioned lyricism emerges when he's describing the California countryside: ''You know it's winter when the hills start turning green, spring when they look like Ireland, summer when they lighten to a shade of split pea on their way to becoming an inflammable blond again.'' The eerie beauty of California only abets the siblings' curse, their mutual attraction slowly engulfing them; the promise that something erotic and dangerous will happen keeps the pages turning. Mr. Crawford travels through vast emotional territory, but unfortunately is wary of journeying deeply into the incestuous miasma; too much is implied through innuendoes. However, the final chapters are rich with power and tension. The reader will feel chilled and unsettled - as if an Arctic wind blasted in.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

An affectionate and imaginative display of this is the ''Machine Age'' show at the Brooklyn Museum, which chronicles a kind of rediscovery of the social and emotional meaning of things that people made. At the same time it issues this stark announcement about our remarkable forward-looking system: the progress of the heart demands we look back, too.",1987-01-11T05:00:00+0000

In Italy, citizens of Milan drove out the occupying Austrian troops after five days of street fighting, and republican revolutionaries in other cities were overthrowing aristocratic or foreign rulers. In this atmosphere, Verdi's nationalistic fever came to a boil. He turned for a subject to a 12th-century legend of Italian heroism: the defeat of the Emperor Barbarossa by the armies of the Lombard League. By the time of the opera's premiere in Rome on Jan. 27, 1849, Milan was back in the hands of the Austrians, but Rome was still republican territory, and the premiere succeeded so well that the third act had to be repeated.",1987-01-13T05:00:00+0000

(AP) North Stars 4, Blues 4: Cliff Ronning, playing in only his fourth regular-season N.H.L. game, scored three goals within a 9:52 span of the second and third periods, sparking the St. Louis Blues to a tie with North Stars at home.

A.The color of the iris does not change with age, but the pupil, the apparently black hole at the center of the iris, may shrink with age causing the iris to appear lighter in color, according to Dr. Richard Thoft, chairman of the department of opthamology at the University of Pittsburgh. For example, Dr. Thoft said that bright blue eyes may slowly turn lighter as a person ages. Q.What causes plagues of locusts? A. Locusts, short-horned grasshoppers from the family Acrididae, have two phases: solitary and migratory. In the more normal solitary phase, the insects are sluggish and do not congregate much. Their color matches that of their surroundings. But in the migratory phase, locusts are much more gregarious, congregating in large, active groups. Their color changes to black and yellow. The locusts may eventually form large swarms of millions of insects and migrate to new areas where they can cause considerable damage. Although the reason locusts migrate is not clear, scientists believe that the availability of food and crowding are important factors.",1987-01-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Q & A,"Q.I used rubbing alcohol to remove a gummy adhesive (left when a price tag was removed) from a marble table top. Unfortunately, the alcohol also left a dull-looking spot. How can I restore the finish? A.Chances are that the marble was originally protected with a coat of wax or some type of sealer. The alcohol probably removed this coating along with the adhesive residue. I suggest you contact the manufacturer or dealer to see if you can find out what kind of wax or sealer was used. If you cannot get this information, try applying a thin coat of white paste wax and then buff vigorously. Or you can try one of the sealers sold by marble dealers for just this purpose. Q.We may buy a house with yellow aluminum siding. Although we have been told that aluminum siding cannot be painted, we may decide to attempt it. If we do, how long will the paint last? A.Aluminum siding can be painted. Several paint companies make latex paints designed for use on old, weathered aluminum siding. Other companies specify on their paint labels that their latex house paints can be used on this type of siding. Most do not require a special primer, but check the instructions on the label and follow these closely -especially on the preparation required before applying the paint.",1987-01-15T05:00:00+0000

Erect, steady and precise in all his movements, debonair in his bearing, he measured his every word, yet let it slip all but noiselessly. When present, he seemed to displace no air and demand no attention. From time to time a silent cachinnation and a look of benignity not exempt from mischief were his distinguishing marks. And when people went on and on about how astonishing it was that he had given up making art and seemed not to miss it, he let them finish, ruminating the while, quite possibly, on the enormous environmental work -''Etant Donnes,'' now in the Philadelphia Museum - that he had been elaborating in secret for almost 20 years.",1987-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Johnson broke his own indoor record in the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.44 seconds. Bubka broke his own indoor world record of 19 feet 6 1/4 inches in the pole vault by clearing 19 feet 6 1/2 inches. The meet's third world indoor record was produced when Protsenko triple-jumped 57 feet 11 3/4 inches, bettering the mark of 57 feet 6 1/2 inches held by Maris Bruziks. All the marks are now considered world records following a ruling by the International Amateur Athletic Federation that it would recognize world records, rather than world bests, in certain events including the dashes, the pole-vault and the triple jump.(AP) N.B.A. Hawks 130, Bucks 91: Dominique Wilkins scored 32 points, and Glenn Rivers hit a 76-foot shot at the halftime buzzer last night for the Hawks in Atlanta.

I want to prove to the world that I have something that works.'' Lucas is getting another chance to play in the N.B.A. because he volunteered for drug rehabilitation. . . . Allen Leavell, the guard signed by the Rockets when they released Lucas last season, has signed a 10-day contract with the team. Leavell fills one of the vacancies left when two guards, Mitchell Wiggins and Lewis Lloyd, were banned for at least two years after tests showed they had used cocaine.

All the action takes place in a dollhouse and a jitterbugging Cinderella rides off to the ball in a pink convertible. Another French company, the Paris-based Ballet de France, established in 1985, will also offer an unusual treatment of a familiar story. Gray Veredon's ''Romeo et Juliette,'' to be danced by the troupe Saturday night at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, retells Shakespeare's classic tragedy - but to Berlioz, rather than to the Prokofiev score most choreographers employ. (For an interview with Francoise Adret, artistic director of the Lyon Opera Ballet, see the Dance page of the Arts and Leisure section.) Among the American choreographers who are influential in France is Kansas-born Karole Armitage, whose works often combine classicism with punk. A ballet-trained dancer who was formerly a member of both the Geneva Ballet in Switzerland and Merce Cunningham's modern-dance company, Ms. Armitage has organized a new group, the Armitage Ballet, which opens Tuesday at the Joyce Theater.

Mary Sable, the heroine of Cleo Jones's third novel, is a Marin County housewife and aspiring writer; she takes care of a husband who neither appreciates nor understands her, and three children, who treat her as little more than a maid. Dutifully, she tends to waxy buildup, and spends most of her day preparing meals, watching soap operas, meeting with her women's networking group and fretting over her unproductive life. It seems the only thing capable of rousing her from this ennui is a good murder to solve. The murder in question is that of a conniving local soap star, Hermoine Leanders. As a woman fooling around with half the male population within commuting distance of San Francisco, is it any wonder that one day Hermoine's head winds up in a prize box on a television game show? A roundup of the usual suspects includes not only cast and crew, but also Mary's best friend, Jill, whose husband has succumbed to Hermoine's charms. Mary is elected by her women's group to do some behind-the-scenes sleuthing and exonerate Jill. Ms. Jones is a deft writer and the novel, which is as much a satire of life in the slow lane as it is a mystery tale, is highlighted by some delightfully macabre touches, like a human foot served up on a tray as an hors d'oeuvre. The plot, however, is rather thin and Mary does little real detecting, so hardcore mystery buffs will likely be disappointed. And all the characters, save Mary, are boobs. As a result, the novel, much the same as Mary's life, is unfulfilling.",1987-01-18T05:00:00+0000

A playwright was the last thing they considered him to be. If theater reviewers agreed on nothing else, they were certain that he could not write for the stage. ''The trouble of course,'' explained Ibsen's translator, William Archer, ''is that he is not at all a good dramatist.'' And the venerable critic of The Times of London, A. B. Walkley, agreed: ''An admirable speaker - and a detestable dramatist,'' he decided.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"WHEN PEOPLE PUBLISH: Essays on Writers and Writing. By Frederick Busch. (University of Iowa, $19.95.) A novelist and short story writer who teaches at Colgate, Frederick Busch hastens to assure his readers that this collection isn't intended as ''formal instruction, but as talk about writers and books among admirers of grown-up writing.'' Even so, it's tempting to urge that some of his more personal essays be required reading not only for aspiring writers but for all those who pull their editorial strings. They include wry hints of his doubts about teaching, looks at the nature and structure of fiction, reminiscences of his long apprenticeship as a writer (when the worst tortures were rejection letters that called him ''promising'' and every waking moment seemed like ''grist for the mill'') and particularly his thoughts about the tragicomic vagaries of the book publishing business. Mr. Busch is also wonderfully scathing in a critique of a one-month sampling of the fiction writers published in 16 popular magazines, in which he detects ''the new anti-Freudian psycho-piddle'' aimed at a market of contemporary Dagwoods and Blondies. Other essays ramble in and around the work of some of his favorite writers, using the thematic connections between, say, Hemingway and John Hawkes or Norman Mailer and Melville, the ''fiction-about-fiction'' of Conan Doyle, the idiosyncratic magic of Leslie Epstein's ''Steinway Quintet'' and the ''language of starvation'' in Dickens and Kafka to explore the posture of the writer toward the reading public (and vice versa) and what various writers' work has to say about telling stories.

In the introduction to ''Sports Spectators,'' Allen Guttmann, a professor of American studies at Amherst College, gives his working definition of a sports fan - an ''emotionally committed 'consumer' of sports events.'' Unfortunately, ''Sports Spectators'' lacks emotion. It is not a book for the sports fan seeking a quick, absorbing peek into a large part of the society to which he belongs. Mr. Guttmann's work is an often ponderous look at the history of those sitting in the grandstand from ancient Greece and Rome up to the present day's soccer and baseball fields. When the author moves from his historical narrative to his analysis of the sociological, economic and psychological elements of sports spectatorship, he meanders. In his care to include as many theoretical approaches to the subject as possible, he seems to submerge any thesis of his own. It is interesting to read that ancient Romans preferred their gladiators to be citizens rather than slaves - and if they were knights or senators, so much the better - because plebeian spectators were probably thrilled to see the high and mighty exposed to risks and hazards comparable to their own. ''We are what we watch,'' says Mr. Guttmann.",1987-01-18T05:00:00+0000

Now, however, handbags and belts made from the skins are back and despite their price tag - bags start at around $800 and can run into the thousands - customers have been lin ing up to buy them. Unfortunately, more than half of such skins come from protected animals. An alternative is an older bag, like the one above, which was made in the 50's. As for buying a new one, the World Wildlife Fund recommends asking for accessories made from American alligators, now abundant and legally hunted in the Southeast.

Americans' increasing fascination with their history is resuscitating dying cities and renewing interest and pride among residents and visitors. Perhaps most significant has been the notion of adaptive re-use: the adaptation of older buildings to uses other than those for which they were originally intended. The key to the success of this revitalization is a recognition of those buildings or streets that are, or once were, special - whether for architectural, historical or cultural reasons. In 1968, the old Ghirardelli Chocolate factory buildings in San Francisco were reborn as a vital, inviting complex of shops, restaurants, spacious courtyards and interiors, while still retaining the character and integrity of the original architecture.",1987-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,PARTIES TO HELP OTHERS,"Continuing a Cause Jan. 26 - Sports will be the theme at the seventh annual Thurman Munson Award Dinner - an event to aid the mentally retarded - at the Grand Hyatt Hotel starting with 6:30 P.M. cocktails. Before his death in a plane crash in 1979, the Yankee catcher had been active in promoting programs for the retarded. Sports figures, including Arthur Ashe, Henry Brown, Lou Piniella and Gary Carter, are expected to attend the benefit to continue his work for the New York City chapter of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children. Tickets, $275, from 212-254-8203, extension 242. Sweet 16 for Pilobolus Jan. 27 - It started almost as a lark 16 years ago when two former Dartmouth College students, Moses Pendleton and Jonathan Wolken, formed a dance company called Pilobolus, which has since earned a solid niche as one of the nation's more evocative modern-dance companies. The 11-member Connecticut-based troupe will be performing 16 works, including five premieres, in its season at the Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue, near 19th Street, through Feb. 22. The 7:30 opening-night performance of ''Carmina Burana, Side Two,'' will be followed by a dinner-dance benefit at Twenty-Twenty, 20 West 20th Street. Tickets, $75 for the performance alone and $175 for the performance and dinner-dance, from 203-868-0538. Benefit for a Theater Jan. 29 - It was 1969 and the five performers, who were internationally known musicians in their 20's, were not yet the stars they eventually became. In a one-hour film, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Daniel Barenboim, Zubin Mehta (double bass) and Jacqueline du Pre, whose career was cut short by multiple sclerosis two years after the film was made, are shown rehearsing and performing Shubert's ''Trout'' quintet. It will be shown at a benefit for Symphony Space, a nonprofit community-sponsored center for performing arts on Broadway, at 95th Street. After wine and hors d'oeuvres at 7:30 P.M., Isaac Stern will introduce the movie. Viennese desserts will be served afterward. Tickets, $100, from 212-864-1414. Welcoming a New Year Jan. 29 - To celebrate the Chinese New Year (4685), the Year of the Rabbit, and to support the activities of the China Institute Women's Association, a banquet will be held at the Peking Duck restaurant, 100 Park Avenue, at 40th Street. The Institute operates a school of Chinese studies in language, history, art and current affairs. It provides orientation and hospitality for Chinese students and scholars attending American schools. Cocktails at 6:30 P.M. followed by dinner and entertainment of Chinese dance and traditional and modern songs. Tickets, $60, from 212-744-8181. Waldorf Opera Ball Jan. 30 - The 32d annual Viennese Opera Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria will benefit the Margit Bokor-Norman Scott Memorial Fund for Cancer Research at Columbia University. The fund was named after two opera singers who died of cancer. Research supported by the fund has resulted in major advances in the past year, including the identification of genes involved in causing cancer, according to researchers at Columbia. The white-tie ball gets under way with 8 P.M. cocktails followed by performances by New York City Opera singers. The evening continues with dinner, dancing and performances by Metropolitan Opera singers. Tickets, $175 or $325 per couple, from 212-819-0158. In Boston Jan. 30 - The annual Consuls' Ball to benefit CARE will be held at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston starting with 7:30 P.M. cocktails. Dinner and dancing follow.

Granting Wishes Feb. 1 - Whether it's a new bicycle or a visit with Michael Jackson, a horse or a family vacation in Hawaii, a stint as a disk jockey or an appearance on a television show, the Starlight Foundation seeks to grant the wishes of chronically and terminally ill youngsters. A black-tie benefit for the four-year-old charity, which has granted about 1,000 such wishes, starts with cocktails at 6:30 P.M. at the Grand Hyatt hotel. Dinner and an auction of vacations will follow. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d will be honored and Marvin Hamlisch, Robert Klein and Maureen McGovern are scheduled to entertain.

us,The Iran-Contra Affair: A Cast of Characters,"Charles Allen: The C.I.A.'s national intelligence officer for counterterrorism, he received intercepted conversations from Iran and was one of the first to sound the alarm about problems in the covert action. Richard L. Armitage: Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, he was aware of the arms shipments. William J. Casey: The Director of Central Intelligence, he was recently operated on for a brain tumor. Investigators want to know if he or the C.I.A. illegally aided the contras. George Cave: A retired C.I.A. agent who speaks Persian, he was called out of retirement in March 1986 by the C.I.A. to work on the arms sales. He accompanied Robert C. McFarlane to Teheran in May 1986. Duane Clarridge: Chief of the C.I.A.'s European division, he helped Colonel North arrange for a flight by a European airline connected to the C.I.A. that carried arms to Iran in November 1985. Robert Gates: The Deputy Director for Intelligence, the agency's senior analyst, in the first months of the Iran initiative, he replaced John McMahon as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in 1986 and is now acting director in Mr. Casey's absence. Clair George: The C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Operations, he had overall responsibility for the clandestine help provided by the agency to the National Security Council. Manucher Ghorbanifar: The key Iranian middleman, he was distrusted by the C.I.A. He was developed as a contact by the Israelis and later by the National Security Council. When he was cut out of the arms operation in August 1986 he threatened to expose the secret dealings. Albert Hakim: An Iranian-born arms dealer and businessman who is now an American, he is a business partner of Mr. Secord. Adnan M. Khashoggi: A Saudi arms dealer who introduced Mr. Ghorbanifar to the Israelis, he remained as the deal's financier. He claims to have raised millions for the transactions from investors. Michael Ledeen: A part-time consultant to the National Security Council, he first broached the Administration's hope for better relations with Iran in 1985 meetings with Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel. He told the committee he was cut out of the dealings in December 1985. Robert C. McFarlane: National security adviser until Dec. 4, 1985, he continued to assist the Administration through December 1985 and went to Teheran in May 1986 at Mr. Reagan's request. John McMahon: C.I.A. Deputy Director until he resigned in February 1986, he objected to the November 1985 arms shipment and demanded the agency get Presidential authorization for any future activities. Yaacov Nimrodi: A former Israeli official in Iran and now an arms dealer, he helped bring together the participants and ease the first shipments. Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North: The dismissed National Security Council aide, he is said to have been the central figure in arranging the Iran arms sales and diverting profits to the contras. Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter: Mr. McFarlane's successor as national security adviser, he resigned last November after it was disclosed that he knew about the diversion to the contras of millions in profits on the arms sales. Maj. Gen. Colin L. Powell: When direct arms shipments began in 1986, he was Mr. Weinberger's senior military assistant. President Reagan: Among the issues central to the investigation, according to Congressional staff members, is whether the President knew and approved of the diversion of Iran arms funds to the contras. Donald T. Regan: President Reagan's chief of staff, he has survived calls for his resignation after the initial disclosures about the activities of National Security Council staff members. Richard V. Secord: A retired Air Force major general and an associate of Colonel North's, he was an American intermediary who arranged logistics, worked on negotiations and helped develop a second channel for the Iran shipments.

The 24-year-old Swiss was timed for the two heats in 1 minute 36.86 seconds. Dietmar Koehlbichler of Austria finished second in 1:37.40, giving an unexpected lift to the Austrian team, which has been lackluster this season. Five Austrians finished among the top 15 in their best showing so far. Yugoslavia's Bojan Krijaz was third in 1:37.44. Gazpoz went from fifth to third in the overall World Cup standing with 125 points, behind a countryman, Pirmin Zurbriggen, with 203, and Markus Wasmeier of West Germany, with 157.(AP) Walliser Triumphs in Women's Race: Switzerland's Maria Walliser easily won a women's World Cup giant slalom race in Bischofswiesen, West Germany, with two fast runs as Swiss skiers captured the top four places.

Last week, Ralph Pichler won the two-man championships. Although Hiltebrand had steering problems on the second day, the margin was large enough to enable him to hold off a strong challenge by Wolfgang Hoppe, the East German double Olympic champion of 1984. The total winning time was 4:22.65, with the runner-up sled clocked in 4:22.91. Matt Roy of Saranac Lake, N.Y., piloted USA I to ninth place in 4:25.72, leading the non-European entries.

Abdul-Jabbar finished with 15 points and James Worthy had 20 for the Lakers. Jeff Malone scored 27 and Moses Malone 21 for the Bullets.(AP) Bucks 100, Hawks 91: In Milwaukee, John Lucas, playing in his first game for the Bucks, scored a 3-point basket to snap a tie as they came from behind to defeat Atlanta.

Ricky Pierce led Milwaukee with 20 points. Mike McGee led the Hawks with 24 points. Dominique Wilkins, who missed part of the game with a knee injury, finished with 18. (AP) N.H.L.

Barr broke the scoreless tie at 9:55 of the third period on Detroit's 26th shot.

Atlaw Beligne of the Millrose Athletic Association was third in 54:00, followed by Martin Carle of Stony Point, N.Y., in 54.36 and Jim Kempton of Nanuet, N.Y., in 54:51. Cindy Gerard-Klein of the Atalanta Track Club shattered the women's meet record with a time of 57:09. The previous record of 58:06 was set by Cindy Wuss of the Atoms Track Club in 1985.

Baird to score a 5 3/4-length victory in the $75,000 Broadway Handicap for New York-bred fillies and mares 3-years-old and up at Aqueduct. The 4-year-old daughter of Vaguely Noble-Bold Rondo maintained a clear lead throughout, widening her advantage in the late stages. Wendy Walker outfinished She Skates, the favorite, for second. Indistinctly earned $45,000 for Flying Zee Stables after covering one mile and 70 yards on the sloppy strip in 1:43 2/5. She returned $53.40 for $2 to win. M.I.S.L.

A.Alcohol dilates the blood vessels, which causes a brief sensation of warmth as the blood rushes to the skin, according to Dr. Roger Maickel, professor of pharmocology at Purdue University. This effect causes many people to flush when they drink. After the initial warmth, however, the body starts to lose heat through the dilated vessels. The body's normal response to cold is to constrict the blood vessels to retain heat, Dr. Maickel said. Thus, in cold weather, alcohol has an adverse effect. Q. Why do raccoons wash their food? A. Scientists do not know why raccoons dip their food in water before eating it, according to Dr. Sidney Anderson, curator of mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. Dr. Anderson, who has observed this behavior in the wild, said that the raccoon is probably not washing its food but rather ''manually handling'' it with its forepaws. The effort is not to clean the food since the water may be dirtier than the food, he said. Raccoons who find themselves away from water rub their food in the dust or just in their paws before eating, he added. However, most raccoons feed near the water, and those in captivity have been known to dip their food in their water bowl.",1987-01-20T05:00:00+0000

Follow the technique below for stuffing and trussing the steak and then brown it well on both sides in a high-sided pan. I usually make a stuffing with sausage, bread crumbs, onions and fresh herbs - about a pound of stuffing for a steak between one and three-quarter and two pounds. The stuffed steak can be braised slowly with tomatoes, onions, carrots and herbs. Served with potatoes and a salad, it makes a restorative cold-weather meal. STEP 1: With a long boning knife, make an incision into the periphery of the steak to form a pocket while leaving a 1-inch rim. STEP 2: Spoon the stuffing into the cavity and pack it evenly. STEP 3: Use kitchen twine to tie the steak securely in four or five spots. Season the outside well with salt and pepper. It is ready for braising.",1987-01-21T05:00:00+0000

The 23-year-old Zurbriggen posted his 24th World Cup victory in seven seasons on the circuit with a two-run total of 2 minutes 33.82 seconds. Second was Joel Gaspoz of Switzerland, who missed his fourth victory of the season by 61-hundredths of a second. Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden was third. Zurbriggen's victory increased his World Cup total to 221 points, adding 9 more points to his lead over Markus Wasmaier. Wasmaier, a West German, is second in the overall standing with 166.(AP) N.H.L. Bruins 5, Nordiques 3: Charlie Simmer scored two power-play goals as the Bruins won their third straight game at Quebec this season. Simmer got his 16th goal at 7:46 of the first period. His second of the game, at 11:08 of the middle period, made it 3-1. Thomas Gradin's eighth goal, a short-handed score at 14:10, gave the Bruins a 4-1 lead. Keith Crowder and Rick Middleton had Boston's other goals against Clint Malacrchuk, who faced only 17 shots.(AP) North Stars 5, Sabres 0: Don Beaupre stopped 27 shots for Minnesota's first shutout since last March and Dino Ciccarelli scored twice, leading Minnesota to victory. Beaupre, who earlier this season was in such a slump that he was put in the position to refuse the team's request that he go to the minors, recorded his third straight victory. He has allowed only four goals in those three games and has helped Minnesota take a 3-point lead over idle Detroit in the Norris Division. Beaupre, who has three career shutouts, was in net for Minnesota's last whitewash, a 4-0 victory over Edmonton last March 11. Ciccarelli scored the only goal Beaupre would need just 1:21 into the contest when he tipped a pass from Neal Broten past the Buffalo goaltender, Tom Barrasso. The North Stars made it 2-0 after one period when Broten faked a shot to draw Barrasso's attention and then passed to Kent Nilsson, who wristed a power-play goal into the open net. After Brian MacLellan's power-play goal made it 3-0, Ciccarelli took a goalmouth feed from Keith Acton and scored to tie Philadelphia's Tim Kerr for the league lead with 17 power-play goals. Ciccarelli has 35 goals and 63 points, both good for third in the league. (AP) N.B.A. Bulls 103, Bucks 90: Michael Jordan scored 14 of his 31 points in the final quarter and a reserve forward, Gene Banks, scored 8 critical points in the same period for Chicago. With the Bulls holding an 86-82 lead with 3:35 left, Banks scored on an offensive rebound and added a free throw for a 7-point Chicago advantage. Banks finished with a season-high 18 points. Jordan, who received several stitches inside his mouth after being hit by an elbow in the first quarter, then added two free throws and a field goal to put the game out of reach after Terry Cummings made two free throws for Milwaukee. Cummings had 27 points for the Bucks and Ricky Pierce added 17. In the final quarter, the Bulls did not score from the field for almost four minutes. Then Banks made a layup and a short jumper, Jordan had a reverse layup and John Paxson hit a layup to give Chicago an 81-74 edge with 6:49 remaining. (AP)",1987-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Wood Loses Appeal,"A judge in United States Appellate Court has ruled against Leon Wood, the Nets' guard, in a case that tested the legality of the National Basketball Association's college draft and its salary cap provisions. Judge Ralph Winter, on behalf of a unanimous three-judge panel, held that the draft and salary cap were governed by labor law rather than antitrust law, and since they were subject to collective bargaining with the union, the draft and the cap were not subject to challenge by an individual player. Judge Robert L. Carter of the United States District Court in New York first rejected Wood's contention last February. Wood objected to the cap, which puts a ceiling on each team's total player salaries, and the draft, which assigns the rights to a player to only one team, ''because they assigned him to work for a particular employer at a diminished wage.'' But the appeals court said ''the choice of the employer is governed by the rules of the hiring hall, not the preference of the individual workers.'' Wood, who was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers, filed his suit in September 1984. Eventually, he signed a four-year contract for more than $1 million, including a signing bonus, with the 76ers. He was traded to the Washington Bullets, who then sent him to the Nets.",1987-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Q & A,"Q.About a year ago, motor oil spilled on the porch planking (pressure-treated 2-by-4's) and apparently soaked into the wood because the oil is seeping through the penetrating stain. How can I remove the oil and restain the planking? A.This will not be easy after such a length of time and it has been made worse by the stain that was applied. I assume that most of the surface oil has been washed off or worn off, but if there is any on the surface, use grease solvent (such as paint thinner or dry-cleaning fluid) and a lot of rags to wash off the grease. Then mix a paste of powdered portland cement and liquid grease solvent and spread this in a thick layer over the oily area. Slowly pour on additional solvent to wet it more, then immediately cover with sheet plastic to keep it from drying rapidly. Allow to sit for about 24 hours, then sweep off. Repeat if necessary. Q. On the advice of a paint store salesman, I recently used a high-gloss oil paint on part of the wood on the exterior of my beach house. But now a builder has told me the glossy surface will be almost impossible to paint over. Is he right? A.House paints vary from a matt finish to a fairly high gloss. Trim paints have a high, enamel-like gloss, but they should not be used on siding or shingles (too brittle).",1987-01-22T05:00:00+0000

Detroit trailed, 109-99, with 2:50 left, but Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars sparked a 9-1 Piston rally that closed the gap to 110-108 with 11 seconds left. Thomas, who finished with 30 points, scored after a steal, Dumars added a 3-point shot and Thomas scored on two more drives. After Stockton's two free throws, Thomas missed a 3-point shot and the Jazz held on, snapping their four-game losing streak.(AP) Lakers 112, Hawks 109: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 8 of his 26 points in the final 6 minutes 41 seconds as Los Angeles, helped by two late offensive rebounds, won in Atlanta. It was the fifth victory in a row for the Lakers, who have the league's best record at 31-8. Abdul-Jabbar scored 5 points in an 11-1 spurt that gave the Lakers the lead for good, turning a 96-94 deficit into a 105-97 lead with 4:39 to play. The Hawks, dropping their third game in a row, then got 8 points in succession, 6 by Kevin Willis, to cut the lead to 2 points, but Atlanta never could regain the lead.(AP) Celtics 130, Pacers 100: Larry Bird scored 26 points, Kevin McHale 24 and Robert Parish 22 in leading the the Celtics at Boston. Bird, who scored 72 points in 70 minutes of action in two previous victories over Indiana in Boston Garden, put on another dazzling show as he hit three 3-point shots. With Bird and Parish scoring 12 points each, the Celtics shot 72 percent from the field in taking a 41-26 first-period lead. Boston managed only 19 points in the second period, but still led by 60-48 at the half. The Celtics gained their 18th victory in 19 starts at the Garden this season.(AP) N.H.L. Whalers 3, Canadiens 1: Ron Francis, Sylvain Turgeon and Kevin Dineen scored goals to support strong goaltending by Mike Liut as Hartford moved a point from first place in the Adams Division.

Thomas and Jeff Jackson scored for Toronto in the first period and Doug Wickenheiser of the Blues scored the only goal of the second period. Thomas's second goal and 20th of the season came at 12:11 of the third period. He picked up a loose puck at the St. Louis blue line, shed a body check by Gino Cavallini, took one more stride as he approached a defenseman, Rob Ramage, and slapped a drive past the goaltender, Greg Millen. Doug Gilmour of the Blues narrowed the gap to 3-2 with 4:36 remaining, intercepting Thomas at the Toronto blue line and putting a wrist shot between the legs of the goalie, Allan Bester, on a breakaway. Seven St. Louis regulars missed the game because of injuries.(AP) Flyers 5, Blackhawks 5: Troy Murray scored his second goal of the game with 63 seconds left in the third period lifting Chicago into the tie. The Blackhawks had pulled the goaltender, Murray Bannerman, for an extra attacker, and Murray put a 5-foot shot past the Flyers' goalie, Ron Hextall, for his 17th goal of the season.

He will be eligible to play three years with the Hurricanes, starting with the 1988 season. At a news conference in Indianapolis, George said he had no animosity toward Purdue and thanked George King, the athletic director, for giving him the release that will allow him to transfer. ''I came to Purdue as you all know because of Coach Burtnett's passing philosophy and the fact I wanted to stay in Indiana,'' George said, referring to Leon Burtnett. ''Things didn't work out as we hoped this year.'' George first expressed concern about staying with the Boilermakers after Fred Akers was hired on Dec. 10 to replace Burtnett, who finished 3-8. George said that the passing philosophy of Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, was a major reason he decided to join the Hurricanes.",1987-01-22T05:00:00+0000

Senators nearly come to blows over the relative virtues of their states' farm products or industrial prowesses. Which is why the pending resolution on New Mexico's 75th anniversary as a state is so unusual. Sponsored by Representative Manuel Lujan Jr., it carries humility to the extreme. New Mexico, it con-cedes, is ''often referred to as either a part of a foreign nation or a separate nation altogether.'' Tourists inquire ''if passports are needed to enter New Mexico, if New Mexico's drinking water is safe and if New Mexico's currency exchange rate is favorable to the American dollar.'' To compensate for all these slights, Congress, under the resolution, would recognize 1987 as ''New Mexico's Diamond Jubilee Year'' and ask President Reagan for a proclamation saluting the anniversary and ''reaffirming New Mexico's status as the 47th state of the Union.''",1987-01-23T05:00:00+0000

Cox said that the right-hander would not pitch for the team in 1987, but might return the following season. Sutter's problem, which originally sidelined him toward the end of the 1985 season, is an entrapment of nerves in the right shoulder. His doctors say that, because of the nerves' failure to regenerate fully, there has been atrophy of muscle in the shoulder. Sutter, 34 years old, was first operated on in December 1985. He returned to the mound last year, but saw no action after May 27.

Mark O'Meara came in with an eagle 3 on the 15th hole to finish at eight-under 63 on the 7,000-yard, par-71 course and take the lead. Brad Faxon was second with a 64. The start of the tournament was delayed an hour and a half yesterday morning because a heavy frost made the greens unplayable until the sun rose high enough to thaw out the putting surfaces. As a result, 45 of the 144 players were unable to finish before dark, when play was suspended. Those players will complete their first round before the second starts. Horse Racing Tracks Closed: Yesterday's racing programs at Aqueduct, the Meadowlands and Roosevelt Raceway were canceled because of the inclement weather. The tracks were expected to resume regular programs today. N.H.L. Bruins 7, Canadiens 3: In Boston, Tom McCarthy scored his 21st and 22d goals last night and the Bruins skated to their fourth consecutive victory with Bill Ranford, a rookie, in goal. The Canadiens, weary from tough losses to Hartford on Monday and Wednesday nights and a half-hour hike through a driving snowstorm when their bus got caught in downtown Boston traffic earlier in the day, battled the Bruins to a 2-2 standoff for one-and-a-half periods. With their first home victory in four games with Montreal this season, the Bruins handed the Canadiens their third loss in four nights. Boston moved within a point of idle Hartford and within 2 of first-place Montreal in the Adams Division. Boston's Cam Neely broke the 2-2 tie at 10:48 of the second period when he took a pass from Rick Middleton and outmuscled Montreal's Petr Svoboda to score his 16th goal of the season with a short off-balance back-hand shot. McCarthy's second goal of the game made it, 4-2, at 18:10, taking a passout from Keith Crowder and beating the Montreal goalie, Brian Hayward, with a short flip to the stick side. Boston outshot Montreal, 14-8, in the second period, then nailed down the victory on third-period goals by Nevin Markwart, Middleton and Dwight Foster before Claude Lemieux scored for the Canadiens in the final minute. The start of the game was delayed for 24 minutes because many of the Bruins were late in arriving from their homes because of the storm.(AP) N.B.A. Lakers 118, Pacers 108: Magic Johnson scored 29 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and handed out 11 assists to help the Los Angeles Lakers to a victory over the Pacers in Indianapolis. The Pacers, who trailed, 63-52, at halftime, stayed close in the third quarter as Vern Fleming and Steve Stipanovich scored 10 points each. In the fourth quarter with the Lakers ahead by 95-91, Johnson scored 4 straight points and Los Angeles was never threatened. The Lakers, who improved to 32-8, jumped out to a 36-26 lead after one quarter as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 10 of his 20 points. Johnson had 12 points in the first half and James Worthy added 13. Worthy finished with 22. The Lakers were 30 of 35 from the foul line, including 11 of 12 by Johnson. Stipanovich led the Pacers with 25 points. John Long added 17 and Fleming had 15.

It means ''a noun that is formed from a verb and ends in -ing''; in the sentence Ducking a question is easy, the gerund is ducking. In addition, when you hold a witness's head under water, you are giving him a good gerundy ducking; however, when the same word is used as an adjective, it is not a gerund but a participle: ''the bobbing, weaving, ducking adviser took the Fifth.'' Hold your breath; count to three; you have now forgotten what a gerund is.) ''I hereby find that the following operation . . . is important,'' goes the once-secret document signed by President Reagan back on Jan. 17, 1986, ''. . . and direct the Director of Central Intelligence to refrain from reporting this Finding to the Congress. . . .'' In that sentence, finding is a gerund (a wha'?), and that noun is dear to executives because it has since 1859 had a judicial connotation: ''The result of a judicial examination or inquiry; the verdict of a jury, the decision of a judge or arbitrator.''

Are there weeks in which resorts are likely to be overcrowded? - B. F., San Antonio Answer: Assuming average snowfall - and there has been a lot of snow already - the ski season in the French Alps will be in full swing at the end of March. The season generally extends well into April. Many of the hotels in ski resorts close after the Easter holidays, unless Easter falls early. Easter Sunday this year is April 19 and in France the Easter school vacation is from April 11 until May 4. The two weeks around Easter are generally the season's busiest. But even when the season has officially ended, good skiing can usually be had through mid-May at such resorts as Courchevel, Chamonix and Val d'Isere. In July and August, at Tignes, skiers make for the Glacier de la Grande Motte, which has snow the year round, and at La Plagne, farther south, there's skiing in summer on the Glacier de Bellecote.

In ''The Big Picture,'' for instance, Ms. Chuma uses fast-paced, aggressive rock music and paintings and drawings of windows on a world seen from the upper air to focus on flight as a metaphor for modern society. She isn't talking about swan dives, either, but about such things as airplanes and airports.",1987-01-25T05:00:00+0000

For some years it has seemed to me that in New York we have a laboratory in which certain volatile developments in the art form may be observed at close range. Under the microscope we see, side by side, a Metropolitan Opera committed to an international star system that no longer works with any consistency and a New York City Opera that, on a shoestring, has gone a long way toward building a repertory company of mostly American artists. In the past, both the international system and the repertory system have produced impressive artistic results. The City Opera, for instance, has demonstrated in recent seasons that people will support a largely native-born company that judiciously mixes standard and unusual repertory. And in periods when there were enough genuine supersingers to go around, the Metropolitan certainly has had its share of triumphs.",1987-01-25T05:00:00+0000

We will be tempted, second, to politicize the event - to turn it into a competition over who can most cleverly co-opt the language of the Founding Fathers in the service of a modern political agenda.

us,FICTION: IN SHORT,"RECOLLECTIONS OF THINGS TO COME. By Elena Garro. Translated by Ruth L. C. Simms. (University of Texas, Paper, $10.95.) The narrator of Elena Garro's first novel, which originally appeared in 1963, establishes the tone of this dreamy, nonlinear story in the first paragraph. The reader must guess at the identity of the speaker by solving sphinx-like riddles: ''I am and I was in many eyes. I am only memory and the memory that one has of me.'' As the story of the Mexican village of Ixtepec unfolds, and an extraordinarily large cast of characters comes and goes, it becomes clear that the narrator is the voice of the town itself. Ixtepec is a small, desperate community in the post-Zapata Mexico of the 1920's. At the story's center is General Francisco Rosas, the execrable head of Ixtepec's Military Command who is obsessed with Julia Andrade, his wispy, sullen mistress. Though the book has the makings of a historical novel, the story's warping (and, at one point, complete stopping) of time keeps it from reading like a persuasive account of the Mexican Revolution. In fact, the lyric tone and fabulous plot solidly position the book in the tradition of Latin American magical realism. The old illusion-vs.-reality conflict is tackled with brio by Ms. Garro; one of her more likable characters stops the clock every night in an effort to live outside time. Her evocation of a town, its denizens and their collective memory (smoothly translated here) is luminous and affecting.",1987-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION: IN SHORT,"DON'T BET ON THE PRINCE: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England. Edited by Jack Zipes. (Methuen, $18.95.) Once, long before Perrault and the Grimm brothers gave us their helpless Little Red Riding Hood, there was a tale about a clever little girl who duped the wolf disguised as granny and fled into the woods. Centuries passed and, as Jack Zipes has documented in many studies of folk and fairy tales, our best-loved storybook heroines came to reflect the paternalistic values of Western society. What's a kid to do? ''Don't Bet on the Prince'' offers an appealing antidote, 16 feminist retellings and departures from the classics. The stories for children teach lessons: if you're kind, resourceful and brave, you'll find happiness; sit pretty and wait for the prince, and you'll be sorry. Too often, these tales do not cloak their morals in the spirit of enchantment that made the classics so alluring. The exceptions are Angela Carter's ''Donkey Prince,'' and Jane Yolen's ''Moon Ribbon,'' in which ''plain but good-hearted'' Sylva accidentally leads her wicked stepmother and stepsisters down ''a silver-red stair'' to hell. The stories and poems for adults - wry subversions of stereotypes - are richer. Meghan B. Collins creates a good witch's bad love affair in ''The Green Woman,'' Tanith Lee a sympathetic female werewolf in ''Wolfland,'' and Anne Sexton a ''Briar Rose'' spiritually imprisoned by Daddy. The four solid but stale critical essays might have been left out, though.

Wolfgang Leonhard would seem well qualified to deliver what he promises here - a ''new policy toward [ the ] USSR.'' Arriving in Moscow in l935 as a l4-year-old German, Mr. Leonhard spent the war years in the Soviet Union and at war's end was whisked off to Berlin as one of the original members of the ''Ulbricht group,'' charged with setting up a Communist state in what became East Germany. He defected in l948 and now teaches history at Yale University. Although he provides a useful account of how the Soviet system functions, his proposed ''realistic approach'' is disappointing - a combination of sensible but vague and not terribly new ideas. Mr. Leonhard's central argument is that a more sober Soviet foreign policy is inextricably tied to internal liberalization: moderation will come only with political strictures (whether formal or not) at home. The West should encourage liberalization by bolstering institutions like Radio Liberty; by firmly linking arms agreements and East-West trade to internal moderation; and by insisting that important trade deals, such as grain shipments and other dealings with the West be publicly acknowledged within the Soviet Union. He argues that the West must maintain relations not only with the Soviet Government, but with the Soviet people as well, and urges that the West vigorously support human rights groups within the Soviet bloc countries. Useful but familiar advice, and hardly the new course Mr. Leonhard promises between the ''primitive anti-Communism'' of the Cold War and the ''over-optimistic illusions'' that he believes accompanied detente.",1987-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.How do cats retract their claws? A.Cats retract and extend their claws by using two tendons, one above and one below the claw's center of rotation. The claw is retracted when tension is applied to the extensor tendon above the center of rotation. This moves the claw upward and backward. When tension is applied below the center of rotation through the flexor tendon, the claw is extended. The cat's ability to retract its claws prevents their becoming blunted by contact against the ground. To keep the front claws sharp, cats pull them against tree bark or other tough materials. The back claws are kept sharp through biting and normal use. Q.Where does nutmeg come from? A.Nutmeg, a delicately flavored spice, is ground from the seeds of the nutmeg fruit. Nutmeg fruit are golden-yellow and resemble apricots. They grow on a dark-leafed, tropical evergreen tree about 30 to 60 feet in height. When ripe, the fruit lose moisture and split to expose shiny brown seeds. The seeds are covered by a fibrous material which can be flattened, dried, and ground into the spice mace. The kernel inside the seed is nutmeg. It is often treated with lime to prevent damage by insects. Q.How does bleach remove stains? A.Home laundry bleaches contain agents such as chlorine or oxygen which whiten materials through oxidation, a chemical process that changes the coloring matter through reaction with oxygen. Bleach may also loosen soil compounds so that they are easily washed away. Liquid chlorine bleaches contain sodium hypochlorite which forms an oxidizing acid when added to water. Chlorine bleach can be used on cotton, linen, and most synthetic fibers, but it should not be used on fabrics with finishes that retain chloride, such as silk and wool. Oxygen bleaches contain sodium perborate or potassium monopersulfate and are safe for most washable fabrics.",1987-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Washburn in Clinic,"Chris Washburn, the Golden State Warriors' rookie center who was the third player picked in the college draft last spring, entered a drug-treatment clinic yesterday after voluntarily seeking help. The team said that Washburn, who was placed on the injured list Tuesday for a kidney problem, was expected to remain at the Adult Substance Abuse Program Drug Rehabilitation Center in Van Nuys, Calif., for a minimum of four weeks. The Warriors did not disclose what drug was involved. Dan Finnane, the team president, said, ''He has the support of all of us in the Warriors' organization.'' One of the players drafted ahead of Washburn, Len Bias, died of cocaine intoxication two days after being picked by the Boston Celtics. Washburn played in 27 games for the Warriors, averaging 10 minutes and 3.5 points. George Karl, the Warriors' coach, said, ''My failure with Chris Washburn was I started him too early in the season and played him a lot. He had made a big impression in training camp. I should have brought him along more slowly.'' Under the agreement between the National Basketball Association and its union, a player who seeks drug treatment is given three opportunities for rehabilitation.

us,Q&A,"Q.Behind the wood-burning stove in our home we have a wall of brown fieldstone. We would like to put a clear coating over this stone to bring out the color. Can you suggest anything that will not be affected by the heat from the stove? A.It depends how far away the stove is from the wall. Codes in many communities require that there be at least three feet between the stove and the nearest flammable materials. I know of no clear sealer or coating that is completely nonflammable. There are a number of clear sealers sold for use on masonry that will brighten the color. But if the stove is very close the heat could darken - or scorch - any sealer left on the surface of the stone (even though most of it will soak in). Q.My house has horizontal lap siding on the outside. The boards are about nine inches wide and three-quarters of an thick on the lower edge. They taper to about one-eighth-inch thick at the top. The boards were poorly installed; certain ones barely overlap. When certain boards shrink there is no overlap in places. Even though the nails seem to be the right kind (coated or screw nails), some have backed out and loosened -mainly because they were not driven into the studs, only into the black building board underneath. A.Where nails are improperly located, merely drive in new nails that will hit the studs. You can then pull the old nails out and fill the holes with putty. However, where the boards do not overlap properly, there is no easy repair. Those boards will have to be ripped off and nailed properly, even if this means taking off a few more boards than seem necessary at first glance. Q.We put in a cedar deck last spring and applied a sealer to protect the wood. When the wood is dry it is pale gray, but when it is wet it has a reddish color that looks more like cedar. We don't want to paint the wood, but we wanted something to bring out more of the reddish color. My husband read about using linseed oil for this, so he tried this over the sealer in one section. That section is now dark gray and is spotty looking. A.There are decking stains and pigmented wood sealers that can be used on wood decks to restore the original color - or close to it -and maintain that color. As you have discovered, linseed oil is not a good choice for a clear sealer because it usually oxidizes and turns black in time. Although the oil will eventually wear off, this may take years and the deck will still look spotty.",1987-01-29T05:00:00+0000

That was in Oregon, where the incumbent, Bob Packwood, a defender of abortion rights, won with 61 percent of the vote, polling 60 percent among men and 62 percent among women. Interestingly, the broadest gap appeared to be in Maryland, where both candidates were women. Forty-four percent of the men who voted cast ballots for the Republican, Lydia Chavez; only 34 percent of the women supported her.

If anyone can use the vast, reverberant space within the cathedral to improve their music, it might be the improvising duo of Don Cherry and Nana Vasconcelos. Mr. Cherry made groundbreaking records in the 1960's as the puckish trumpeter in Ornette Coleman's jazz quartets. Since then, he has delved into world music, listening to Latin, Caribbean, Arabian and African music and adding keyboards and doussn'gouni (African hunter's harp) to his collection of instruments. Mr. Vasconcelos, a Brazilian percussionist, can play anything that shakes, rattles, rings or taps; he and Mr. Cherry are longtime collaborators who bring out each other's humor and willingness to take risks. For this duo, the cathedral's echo should just be one more plaything. Tonight at 8; tickets are $10. Sam Rivers and the Rivbea Orchestra, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street (242-1785). The saxophonist-flutist-pianist-composer Sam Rivers has been an iconoclastic force in new jazz for nearly three decades, working in every style from free-form trio improvisation to short, snappy tunes that are as concise as pop songs. He gets the chance to convene a big band only once every few years, but when he does he attracts some of the city's best players. With reed, brass and rhythm sections at his disposal, Mr. Rivers has written dense, knotty compositions as well as pieces that sound like slightly warped mainstream big-band music. This time, he is likely to have new approaches as well. Tonight and tomorrow at 10 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M; there is a $12 cover and a $6 minimum.",1987-01-30T05:00:00+0000
