The decline in the growth rate was partly a result of a 0.9 percent decline in exports, the second consecutive quarter of falling exports. Some of the loss resulted from lower shipments of forestry products because of slower housing demand in the United States, the agency said, and a strong Canadian dollar also led to flat manufacturing output.

John Barlow, the American spokesman for the show, said yesterday that the show had indeed lost a Broadway investor in recent weeks after Christian Voice, a small British Christian group, had protested the show's broadcasting on the BBC in January. The musical, which recently closed its money-losing commercial run in the West End, features Jesus as a character and pokes fun at organized religion. But yesterday Mr. Barlow reiterated that plans for the show's transfer remain. ""While the widely covered but small scale religious protests in the U.K. surrounding 'Jerry Springer: The Opera' have not been helpful in the completion of raising the capital for the Broadway production, they have by no means brought an end to our New York plans,"" he said. Stephen Green, national director of Christian Voice, said that ""Jerry Springer"" was blasphemous and depicted Jesus as a sexual deviant who is ""a little bit gay."" ""I certainly hope it doesn't play on Broadway,"" Mr. Green said, ""because it brings shame on whatever nation that it's played in."" The show was short of its Broadway capitalization even before the protests; in October, the producer, Jon Thoday, said he still needed $7 million of an estimated $11 million budget before the show could open in New York.

The violin, the Viotti Stradivari, is named for Giovanni Battista Viotti (1753-1824), the most influential violinist of his day in Europe, who first alerted the world to the power of Stradivari's model when he played it before audiences in Paris and London in the 1780's and 90's. On condition of anonymity and in lieu of paying $2.69 million in inheritance taxes on its father's estate, the family of the owner has agreed with the British tax authorities, who have valued the instrument at $6.72 million, to accept $4.02 million to enable it to remain in Britain, although a spokesman for the Royal Academy says it would undoubtedly fetch more on the open market. The Royal Academy, which already has a collection of 15 Stradivari violins on public view, says its main reason for seeking this particular instrument is that of 550 of the violins that still exist, the Viotti is extraordinary, not just for its tonal qualities but also for its almost unbelievably fresh state of preservation. It has hardly been played in 200 years. PAM KENT",2005-03-01T05:00:00+0000

The tentative deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers was reached on Jan. 20.

There will also be 75,000 new jobs, the highest increase in 13 years, for background actors (known as extras). The contract will run from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2008.

A small but venerable concert organization in St. Paul, Minn., the Schubert Club, was forced to cancel Ms. Voigt's recital at the Ordway Center on Nov. 15 because she was already scheduled to sing with the Minnesota Orchestra in Minneapolis seven months later. Ms. Voigt has an exclusivity clause with the orchestra -- meaning, no other Voigt performance within 50 miles next season -- and the orchestra decided to enforce the clause after the Schubert Club announced her appearance nine days ago. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis first reported the flap. It did not matter to the orchestra that its Voigt dates, in May, consist of concert performances of Puccini's ""Tosca,"" a far cry from a simple recital. A spokeswoman for the orchestra, Gwen Pappas, said it typically has exclusivity clauses with major artists because of the small size of the market, to protect ticket sales. ""She was such a linchpin of our season,"" Ms. Pappas said. ""We were really banking on the marquee value of her name."" As for how the mixup happened, Bruce Carlson, president of the Schubert Club, said that he had a signed contract with Ms. Voigt and that her managers at Columbia Artists admitted overlooking the exclusivity clause. A spokesman for Ms. Voigt, Albert Imperato, denied that a contract was ever signed with the Schubert Club and said the two sides had only discussed the possibility of her performance. DANIEL J.

Fifteen days before the specials were to begin, however, Schwartz says it learned the rights had been given to HBO, forcing it to cancel contracts with DirecTV and others.

But Tuesday's series finale of the 12-season-long ""NYPD Blue"" upended that relationship: an estimated 16.02 million viewers said goodbye to Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz, right) and company, as opposed to the estimated 12.25 million who watched ""S.V.U.,"" which featured Matthew Modine as guest star. But Sipowicz doesn't sing Alicia Keys songs, so ABC's victory at 10 p.m. was good only for second place for the night: first place went to Fox, with its double bill of ""American Idol"" (an estimated 26.75 million viewers) and ""House"" (an estimated 15.69 million viewers). The pairing of those two shows -- one about finding talented singers, the other about a cranky medical diagnostician -- might seem odd, but ""House"" continues to keep a significant part of the ""Idol"" audience.

Dismissing the lawsuit was the ""only appropriate action"" to punish Rambus for destroying documents related to its patents and litigation strategy, Judge Robert Payne said at a hearing in Richmond, Va. The ruling might hurt Rambus's chances of winning patent suits against other memory-chip makers. The company, which gets most of its sales from royalties and does not make the chips it designs, contends that its inventions cover aspects of all memory chips in the $26 billion industry. Losing the cases could cost Rambus hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties. Rambus, based in Los Altos, Calif., said it would appeal the ruling. Rambus has a ""strong case on appeal,"" the company's general counsel, John Danforth, said in an interview.

Intel has sent samples of the so-called baseband chip, the main processor in a cellphone, to potential clients, the executive vice president, Sean Maloney, said Tuesday in an interview. The chip will be available after June. With consumers increasingly using their phones for surfing the Internet and playing video games, phone makers might sell as many as 740 million phones this year, according to the iSuppli Corporation. Mr. Maloney was put in charge of tapping that demand when he took over Intel's money-losing communications-chip unit in January 2004. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., failed to win clients for an older version of its baseband processor, code-named Manitoba. The new model, known as Hermon, uses a technology called wideband-code division multiple access, or w-C.D.M.A. The market for those chips will reach $10 billion in the next three years, according to the industry research firm IDC.

us,The Listings; NOAH SHELDON: 'ALMOST VEGETARIAN',"It's nice when art is exciting, but sometimes you just want to power down and relax, which is what this solo show, Noah Sheldon's first in New York City, lets you do. Mr. Sheldon, who is 29, studied composition at the New England Conservatory of Music before he studied art, so it's no surprise that the aural component of this charming show is important to creating a mellow mood, and creating that mood is the purpose of the work. To do so, Mr. Sheldon alters, enhances and invents realities in large and small -- and always very simple -- ways. He not only wants to transport us to someplace nice; he wants to make it extra nice. At the beginning of the show is a video he took of a forest in Venezuela, to which he's added digital fireflies that twinkle like a field of stars. To a nonblooming potted succulent plant in the gallery he's pasted plastic blossoms. The tinkle of wind chimes is always nice. No wind in the gallery, so he's made a simple little mechanical device that gives some hanging chimes a periodic jerk. To open all of this up a bit, he's installated a continuous slide show from his collection: pretty landscapes, distant horizons, dramatic clouds, interspered with comfy hints of home life. Finally, as the pice de rsistence, he's installed a functioning fountain, made of plywood (above). There are benches to sit on, the lights are low, the music, Enya's ""Oronoco Flow"" -- a traveling song -- plays extra slowly. You can practically feel your pulse slow down. One of the things that's nice about all of this is that the work isn't stuck in self-conscious handmade-ness, managing to have objects without being about objects, or about installation either. It's smart enough not to try to look smart, which too often these days means cute. That's such a relief.

Born on the memorable date of December 14, 1916, she becaue unforgettable to all who knew her. Raised as an only child in Jacksonville, Florida, she had a life-long love of the ocean.

Mrs. Gubelmann was educated in Art at the Ringling School in Sarasota, FL, as well as the Traphagen School in New York City. Her sure eye resulted in more awards in Flower Shows, Croquet Tournaments (she is an inductee in the Croquet Hall of Fame) and Skeet Shooting.

Besides being the consummate hostess, she was a member of the Colonial Dames, the Mayflower Society, The New York Yacht Club, the Garden Club of Palm Beach, The Bath and Tennis Club, The Everglades Club, and the Spouting Beach Rock Association.

When one of those friends, the violinist Maria Bachmann, asked him to expand her piece into something longer, he obliged -- with a vengeance. The piece that finally resulted was a half-hour work in five movements for four musicians, depicting, this time, not Mr. Moravec's friends but characters from his favorite Shakespeare play, ""The Tempest."" Mr. Moravec, above, called it a ""musical meditation"" on the piece and considered it one of the best things he'd ever written. Others evidently agreed. In 2003, Trio Solisti (Ms. Bachmann's trio) and the clarinetist David Krakauer gave the first performance of ""Tempest Fantasy,"" and it won the Pulitzer Prize last year. On Sunday, the trio and Mr. Krakauer are performing the piece -- which they've since recorded -- once again, framed by trios of Brahms and Ravel. ""David Del Tredici once told me, 'There's life before the Pulitzer Prize and life after, and they are not the same thing,""' Mr. Moravec said. Coming events in his post-Pulitzer life include world premieres of songs at Symphony Space in April and at Alice Tully Hall in May.

Because of that reduction, Fox placed second in households on a Wednesday -- the last night of February sweeps -- for the first time since the new season of ""American Idol"" began. NBC was No. 1 in that measurement of Nielsen's overnight ratings. Fox, however, did rank first in total viewers and among 18-to-49-year-olds.

Verizon Wireless, the nation's second-largest cellphone operator, will use the airwaves to send more calls and Internet traffic across its network. The company is eager to win back its spot as the No.1 cellphone company, when ranked by customers, which it lost to Cingular Wireless in October. NextWave filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 after it was unable to pay the F.C.C. for the licenses it won in auctions. On Tuesday, NextWave, based in Greenwich, Conn., won court approval of a plan to exit bankruptcy by giving shareholders as much as $3.2 billion and repaying creditors.

Fisher, the quintessential Jewish leader and visionary. He died Thursday, March 3rd at 96. For nearly half a century, Fisher was among North America's leading industrialist and charitable givers, supporting Jewish and general causes worldwide. For decades he served as a trusted advisor to U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers. By quietly forging new ties between Washington and Jerusalem, Fisher pioneered a new era in American Jewish activism and politics. ""In the world of Jewish volunteer leaders, Max Fisher was a giant. He was known to all as a prime mover, as someone who made things happen,"" said Howard Rieger, president and chief executive officer of United Jewish Communities (UJC). Fisher served as the top leader of UJC's predecessor organizations: United Jewish Appeal, Council of Jewish Federations, and United Israel Appeal. He was also president of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit. He was an honorary chair of UJC and founding chairman of the Board of Governors of UJC's overseas partner, the Jewish Agency for Israel. His daughter, Jane Sherman, serves as chairperson of the UIA and is co-chair of JAFI's Israel Committee. In recognition of his lifelong devotion, commitment and generosity to Jews everywhere, UJC and the Jewish Federations of North America named their New York headquarters in September, 2002 as the Max M. Fisher Headquarters of United Jewish Communities. ""May it stand as a memorial to him and his lifelong interest in UJC and the Jewish Federations of North America,"" Rieger said. To Max's wife, Marjorie Switow Fisher, his children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, we extend our heartfelt condolences.

us,The Listings; JUANES,"The Colombian rocker Juanes, shortened from Juan Esteban Aristizabal, sings about love and war, particularly the civil war that has torn Colombia apart. Amid the violence, Colombia has somehow generated extraordinary music, not only from Juanes but from musicians and bands as determinedly upbeat and proud of their country as Shakira, Carlos Vives, Cabas and Aterciopelados. Juanes, above, has not courted a North American audience by writing songs in English, but he's headlining at Madison Square Garden tonight anyway. He has become one of Latin America's superstars, with nine Latin Grammys among his many awards, and his popularity stems from something more than his good looks and his tunes, which draw easily on anything from Colombian cumbia to funk, new wave rock to bossa nova, reggae to waltz. He touches down in local music, then looks outward. For listeners across Latin America and Spanish speakers elsewhere, what comes across in Juanes's songs is an intense longing that spans romance, love of country and the yearning for peace. In ""Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor"" (""Nothing Matters Without Your Love""), a declaration of love that has been a hit in Colombia since last summer, he sings, ""I want to take back all the nights I lost, to conquer this overwhelming fear of death."" For all his earnestness, Juanes never despairs. His songs are not complaints; they insist on hope. Straightforward love songs and songs like ""Sueos,"" (""Dreams"") in which Juanes imagines ""an end to this unjust war"" and ""walking the streets of my country and finding only peace,"" reinforce one another's seriousness and determined optimism, rallied by music that makes its way toward buoyant choruses. The songs envision the possibility of happy endings even if, for the moment, they seem far away.

us,UP FRONT,"The Dec. 13, 2004, issue of The New Republic published an ambitious essay, ""A Fighting Faith: An Argument for a New Liberalism,"" by the magazine's editor, Peter Beinart. In it, Beinart argued that many liberals were trapped in the past, unwilling to confront the new challenges of the post-9/11 era. What liberalism needed, he wrote, was a commitment to a vigorous foreign policy, a willingness to use American power to face down enemies and dictators around the world. The article caused a considerable stir and helped begin a family conversation among people who generally agree on liberal principles but often disagree sharply on specifics like the Iraq war. The Book Review asked Beinart and the editors of two other influential liberal magazines to continue that discussion. The three spent two hours in the Times's offices hashing out liberalism's problems and prospects. An edited version of their discussion can be found beginning on Page 14; a longer audio version has been posted on The Times's Web site at nytimes.com/books. The three editors also recommended books for readers interested in pursuing this subject, and their suggestions can be found on Page 15.",2005-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Steady and buttoned-down, with a keen but very dry sense of humor, he was not like the rest of us flamboyant theater types; and yet today, in his first Broadway appearance since his sitcom success, he is starring in perhaps the silliest musical ever: ""Monty Python's Spamalot,"" which is in previews at the Shubert Theater and opens on March 17. Directed by Mike Nichols and also starring Tim Curry and Hank Azaria, ""Spamalot"" features Mr. Pierce, 45, as not-so-brave Sir Robin (among other roles): singing and dancing, clutching chickens, blessing hand grenades and generally putting his Yale education to good use.

A graduate of Poly Prep and Cornell University, he majored in English and began his avocation for journalism while working on the Cornell Sun. One of his post graduate jobs was with the NBC affiliate in Buffalo. From there he went to WNEW in New York City when that station was at it's peak, with well known on air personalities William B. Williams and Gene Klavan. Jim joined the large news staff and worked there for fifteen years covering city hall, disasters, politicians, and celebrities of the day from Jackie K. to Marilyn M.

He left in 1974 during the city's financial crisis when news operations were cutting back, and moved upstate to work in the press office of the Speaker of the Assembly.

The proponents of intelligent design need to be aware that even though they make no claims about who or what the designer might be, they lay the groundwork for multiple designers, in essence for polytheism.

James Patterson's 28th novel, ""Honeymoon,"" written with Howard Roughan, bumps down ""The Broker,"" by John Grisham, which had a five-week run in the top spot. On the nonfiction side, Jose Canseco's memoir ""Juiced"" pushes aside Malcolm Gladwell's ""Blink,"" which was No. 1 for four weeks. One title that is conspicuously absent from the hardcover nonfiction list is M. Scott Peck's 19th book, ""Glimpses of the Devil: A Psychiatrist's Personal Accounts of Possession, Exorcism, and Redemption,"" published in January. It is No. 55 on the extended list. There was a time when Peck seemed to rule this list. His personal-growth classic, ""The Road Less Traveled,"" with its famously succinct first sentence (""Life is difficult""), is arguably the most successful paperback in the history of the Times list. Published in 1978, ""The Road Less Traveled"" hung on the list for more than 13 years. Peck, who is now 68 and suffers from Parkinson's disease, has said that his new book, an account of two exorcisms he says he performed more than 25 years ago, will be his last. In recent interviews, Peck has been outspoken about how evil has made itself manifest in the world. Exhibit A, Peck told Salon, was the decision in the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court case. ""I wonder how that could happen,"" Peck said, sounding a bit like Dana Carvey's Church Lady, ""without Satan hanging around.""",2005-03-06T05:00:00+0000

That meant riding the subway all the way down to Rector Street -- I always took the local train so as to have more time with whatever novel I was reading -- and then walking over to the Weather Bureau on Battery Park Place, where I was instructed to say: ""I'm from The Times. I've come for the weather."" This was after the age of gaslight, it may be noted, but well before the advent of the Internet or fax machine. The weather came in the form of a mimeographed map, which was handed over in a plain brown envelope. On this particular evening, which abruptly ended my first term of employment at the paper, the Weather Bureau clerk said I needed to call home immediately. There was an emergency. My bride of 10 months then informed me that my mother was being taken by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital following an overdose of pills in her hotel room on the East Side.

Witnesses to the assault captured and held two suspects until the police arrived. They were identified as Raul Chavez, 20, of 1381 Castle Hill Avenue, and Neri Almonte, 21, of 1460 Beach Avenue. The suspects appear to have no connection to the dark Lincoln town car that struck the man, which then fled the scene, the police said.

If Charles's impending marriage to Mrs. Parker Bowles hasn't given Britain's royal family enough to worry about, it now can contend with moments like those in a new show created by the Danish choreographer Peter Schaufuss and based on the life of Charles's first wife, which opened last night in Manchester, England. The show, ""Diana the Princess,"" depicts Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip turning their backs on the proceedings and a corps de ballet of paparazzi, as well as music by Elgar and the Cure and sound bites from Diana's revealing television interview with Martin Bashir, Tony Blair referring to the ""people's princess"" after her death and her brother Earl Spencer's eulogy at her funeral. Mr. Schaufuss, who knew Diana in the 1980's when he was artistic director of the English National Ballet and she was its patron, conceived and choreographed the show. His partner, the British ballerina Zara Deakin, above, dances the role of Diana, while their son, Luke Schaufuss, 11, plays Prince William. ""It's not so much a ballet as a 'musical without words,""' Mr. Schaufuss said, ""a celebration definitely, and my personal take on this very special person and her short but telling life.

The first CT scan of the pharaoh's mummy showed no signs of damage to the skull or other evidence of foul play, Dr. Zahi Hawass, Egypt's chief archaeologist, announced. Researchers took more than 1,700 detailed three-dimensional images of the mummy two months ago, seeking answers to the unsolved mystery of how Tutankhamen died more than 3,000 years ago, at the age of 17. The research team, including scientists from Italy and Switzerland, did not complete its investigation until last week. The examination showed that the pharaoh may have suffered a broken leg shortly before his death, but this was not thought to be life threatening and may even have been caused by the embalmers. Though there was the possibility that Tut was poisoned, Dr. Hawass told The Associated Press that ""these results will close the case of Tutankhamen, and the king will not need to be examined again.""

Born in Clewiston, FL, he graduated from Princeton University in 1963 and began teaching science at Philadelphia's William Penn Charter School and the Buckley School in Manhattan. In 1975, Mr. Tokieda joined the Brearley Science Department, where for almost 30 years he rejoiced in the opportunity to inspire students with a love of science, teaching them to ask the right questions and lighting up the classroom with his knowledge, warmth, optimism and flair. A founder of the Brearley Employees of Color discussion group, he volunteered at the Children's Storefront School and consulted for the Children's Museum in Phoenix. He was a model of courage in fighting serious health problems over the last 20 years. We send our sincere condolences to his wife, Margaret Quigley Tokieda; his children, Kathryn J. Tokieda '98, and Charles P. Tokieda; his mother, Anna Imperial; and his brother and sister.

The third, Hadas Thier, 28, faced the same charges except for assault. A college spokeswoman, Mary Lou Edmondson, said that the students were escorted from the job fair because their chanting was disruptive, and that they had been told that any further protest had to be on the sidewalk outside. Tiffany Paul, another protester, said the students had wanted to remain in the hallway outside the fair so they could voice their opposition and talk to other students.

Cornell University mourns the loss of one of science's most universally admired figures and a giant of 20th-century physics, Nobel laureate Hans Bethe, emeritus professor at Cornell University. A devoted instructor, Bethe joined Cornell in 1935 after fleeing Nazi Germany. During World War II he was a key figure in the building of the first atomic bomb as head of the theoretical physics division at Los Alamos. Later, Professor Bethe became a persistent champion of nuclear arms control, helping to persuade the White House to ban atmospheric nuclear tests in 1963 and antiballistic missile systems in 1972. In 1967, Bethe won the Nobel Prize for his theory on the production of energy in stars. Although he retired from active teaching in 1975, Bethe continued to arrive regularly at his office at the Newman Laboratory on the Cornell campus. We express our sincere condolences to his wife, Rose Ewald Bethe, a 1941 graduate of Cornell University, his son Henry Bethe, his daughter Monica Bethe, and his three grandchildren.

The three men, age 17 to 22, were among nine people arrested on Monday in the previous night's theft of three pictures from the Restaurant Munch in the Hotel Refsnes Gods, in Moss, 37 miles south of the capital. The police recovered the works, including Munch's 1915 watercolor ""Blue Dress,"" though one of the lithographs had sustained an eight-inch scratch. Four of the original nine suspects have been released, police said, while two face charges of receiving stolen property. Of the three (one of whom is above wearing a hat and consulting with his lawyer) said to have been ringleaders, two pleaded guilty to grand theft in Moss District Court yesterday and were remanded to custody, Rolf Nissen, the prosecutor, said. The two were also charged with assault, accused of spraying a Mace-like substance at a hotel employee who walked into the closed restaurant while the theft was in progress.

us,The Listings; ROBERT MORRIS: 'SMALL FIRES AND MNEMONIC NIGHTS',"Since helping to discover Minimalism in the early 1960's, Robert Morris has churned through many different styles and modes of art-making. Some critics have seen his chameleonism as the symptom of an inauthentic sensibility; others as the sign of a strategic independence from the market-ordained law of one style per artist. Mr. Morris's new easel-size, encaustic paintings prove that he can still surprise both fans and detractors. It is surprising that he would make paintings that suggest Edward Hopper under the influence of de Chirico and Magritte; and more surprising still are the genuinely touching feelings of nostalgia, loneliness and sadness. Some of the nocturnal, moonlit images are like dreams of actual places from the artist's past: an elementary school ""Boys Room""; ""Indiana Street,"" a neighborhood with bungalows silhouetted against the setting sun; a New York cafe; and New York's old ""Union Station."" Some refer to art: a canvas leaning face to the wall in an empty room, above; and the American flag attached to the wall in another evoking Jasper Johns, another encaustic painter and an important early influence on Mr. Morris. Distant fires and explosions can be seen through windows in some paintings, and the antique radio featured in ""War News"" implies that the artist is thinking less about Iraq than about the war that was going on during his boyhood in the 1940's. Clocks are prominently displayed in the rooms in some of the paintings. It is getting late, they hint; time to take stock.

Thrust an umbrella into the air in one Manhattan subway station and music plays from a nearby motion-cued installation. Slashes of wild color suddenly appear and disappear, painted high above pedestrian sightlines, on the brick wall of a Midtown building before demolition. And this weekend through June 10, passersby who happen to look up at the NBC Astrovision sign in Times Square will see flashes of video of a meditative woman, motionless in desolate and teeming environments, in the last minute of every hour, 14 hours a day from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. The images for ""The 59th Minute,"" produced by Creative Time, are taken from three videos by Kimsooja, a young Korean-born artist who combines video, performance and sculpture. One is ""The Beggar Woman,"" in which the artist stands in an identical pose with her back to the camera, watched by crowds in Cairo, New Delhi, Shanghai and Tokyo. Ms. Kim lies on her side on a windy ledge in ""A Needle Woman"" and stands facing the Yamuna River in India as life moves by in ""A Laundry Woman,"" above. The lily will be gilded today by ""Conditions of Anonymity,"" a free hourlong group performance choreographed by Ms. Kim and presented in Times Square. Both the 40 dancers and the audience will range about the performance space. The performers will re-enact ""The Beggar Woman"" as a one-hour screening of the videos plays on the Astrovision screen. (""Conditions of Anonymity"" will be performed today from 2 to 3 p.m. in Times Square at Broadway and 44th Street. ""The 59th Minute"" may be seen daily at 6:59 a.m., from 10:59 a.m. to 5:59 p.m., and from 7:59 p.m. to 12:59 a.m. on the NBC Astrovision by Panasonic screen at 45th Street and the intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue in Times Square.

Introduced this week in London, plans for the structure call for a 492-foot tower with a slowly ascending, doughnut-shaped, air-conditioned capsule offering 360-degree views for as many as 120 passengers. The architects say the i-360 has a number of commercial advantages over the observation wheel, which cost $125.45 million to build. With lower construction costs of $19.3 million, as well as lower operating costs, it is suitable for smaller cities that couldn't attract the 3 million to 4 million visitors a year needed to sustain the wheel.

The jazz ministry serves its Samaritan function, but it is also a sort of social hub, and one of the hidden forces that holds the large community of jazz musicians together in New York. Aside from Sunday-evening jazz vespers, memorial services for departed jazz musicians and other regular events, the jazz ministry holds an annual fund-raiser centering on the legacy of Lester Young, above, a musician who will never pass out of favor. The 21st edition of ""To Prez With Love"" happens on Sunday evening, with an impressive lineup of musicians (and storytellers) spanning three generations, including Don Byron, Lou Donaldson, Junior Mance, Connie Crothers, Ron Blake, Gene Bertoncini, the radio host Phil Schaap and many others.

Yet as embodied by Ari Graynor, above, Alison the Valley Girl packs more than empty calories. In an increasingly revealing face-off with the play's title character, Eric Weiss (the excellent Adam Arkin), who has picked her up at a book reading in Los Angeles, Alison morphs before our eyes into a smart, self-sabotaging neurotic of the first order. Ms. Graynor's performance suggests that this barbed variation on the Britney Spears-era nymphet feels trapped in a predetermined future she knows she is powerless to escape. Though ""Brooklyn Boy"" is principally a study in that familiar bugaboo, the midlife crisis, Ms. Graynor (best known as Meadow's suicidal college roommate on ""The Sopranos"") makes it clear that being 20 is no piece of cake either.

us,Metro Briefing | New York: White Plains: Crackdown On Teenagers' Drinking,"In an effort to dissuade teenagers from changing the age on their drivers' licenses so they can buy alcohol, state and local lawmakers and law enforcement officials announced plans yesterday for legislation that would interrupt the teenagers' right to drive. Gov. George E. Pataki and Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, said at a news conference that under their proposal, teenagers found with fraudulent licenses would lose their real licenses until they were 21 or for a year, whichever was longer. Mrs. Pirro, who has made drinking by teenagers a top priority, said that current laws were not working. Possible prison terms of up to seven years for a doctored license are too harsh for teenagers, she said, and judges would now decide whether to suspend a license and for how long. Mr. Pataki noted that word of years-long license suspensions would spread and serve as a cautionary tale. Marek Fuchs (NYT)",2005-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Germany already has laws that sharply restrict neo-Nazi activity, including bans on the display of Nazi slogans and insignia or denying the Holocaust, but efforts two years ago to ban the largest far-right group, the National Democratic Party, were rejected by the courts. The new legislation was specifically aimed at blocking a plan by the party to march past the Holocaust memorial in Berlin on May 8, the 60th anniversary of Germany's defeat in World War II. The text of the new law cited an increase in far-right gatherings that ""resemble ever more the character of the Nazi regime's marches."" The vote in Parliament came a day after the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's conviction of a far-right rock bank known as Landser, or Foot Soldiers, whose songs were deemed to spread hatred against Jews and foreigners.

Kelley, originally proposed. The draft script by Mr. Kelley revolves around censorship charges that follow a principal's decision to block Fox News from appearing on school televisions, saying its programming ""almost rises to the level of hate speech."" In the rewritten script, the principal blocks an unspecified channel, described by a student only as ""the most fair and balanced one."" Other references to Fox News hosts, including Bill O'Reilly, right, and Brit Hume, were also removed. One of the show's producers is 20th Century Fox Television, a division of News Corporation, which owns Fox News. ABC asked Mr. Kelley for the changes, said Susan L. Sewell, a spokeswoman at the network, which is part of the Walt Disney Company. ""While real-life situations are often used as original inspiration for fictionalized programming story lines,"" she said, ""it is a longstanding industry-wide practice not to use real people or actual events."" The draft script's mention of ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism,"" a documentary that criticizes Fox News, did survive into the final version, although ABC refused to accept a commercial for the DVD release of ""Outfoxed"" that the movie's distributors wanted to appear during the episode. Ms. Sewell said ABC does not accept commercials about other media companies. The revisions to Mr. Kelley's draft script were posted by Rory O'Connor on his Weblog, www.roryoconnor.org, and on www.alternet.org. A spokeswoman for Fox News declined to comment.

It would have done more for the industries that pollute the air (and helped write the bill) than for the people who breathe it.

Mr. Leno, below, the host of the ""Tonight"" show on NBC, has been identified as a potential witness in Mr. Jackson's trial on child molestation charges and was thus subject to restrictions on talking about the trial laid down by the trial judge, Rodney S. Melville of Santa Barbara County Superior Court. But Judge Melville said from the bench that the order left Mr. Leno latitude to lampoon the trial in his monologue, as long as he steers clear of the part of the case that pertains to him. In recent days, Mr. Leno mocked his own legal predicament by turning to surrogate comedians -- including Drew Carey, on Thursday's show -- to tell his Jackson jokes. An NBC official said earlier in the week that no one at the network had sought the arrangement on legal grounds -- Mr. Leno was apparently taking his cues from Jerry Lewis, rather than the late Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.-- but Mr. Leno's lawyers were concerned enough that they had sought a clarification from the judge. ""It's not the court's intent to stop him from commenting on or telling jokes about the case,"" Judge Melville said yesterday, ""except those parts he's a witness to, and he knows what those are.""

Several centuries on, of course, sugar is something that many people try to cut back on, or eliminate from their diets altogether.

I didn't have to; the orchard was so dense that I could scramble from the limb of one tree to another, plucking the plump, red berries as I went along. The sweet juice made my fingers stick together, but I couldn't stop climbing. The trees stretched out as far as I could see, a glorious forest of mulberries, ripe for my picking. I loved mulberries, but until that summer in Tehran, I had only tasted them dried, from little plastic packets sold in the Iranian grocery story in San Jose. Riveted by the abundance, and the squishy texture of the berry in its fresh form-a whole new delight-I had spent the better part of the afternoon perched in the shady canopy of the orchard. ""Azadeh jan, I am going to count to three, and you had better come down,"" came Maman's glaring voice from somewhere far below. I gave in, but only because of the preliminary pangs of the hideous stomachache to come. Sedigheh Khanoum, one of the farmers who took care of the orchards at Farahzad and who had tended Maman's stomach when she was little, made me tea with sugar crystals, to soothe the cramps. And I lay content on my back on the Persian rug outside, as Maman chatted with Sedigheh about our life in America, debating whether tomorrow I should go after the delicate white toot, or the dark red.

Loving grandfather of David Adelson, Robert Adelson, James Adelson, Thomas Adelson, Alexandra Nash and the late Claudia Heyman, and 17 great-grandchildren, and sons-in-law Dr. Stephen Adelson and Stephen Heyman. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 60 years, Roseline Nadel Gussman. A graduate of Cornell University, he worked at Lehman Brothers before he entered the oil business in the 1930's. He was amongst the pioneers of the modern oil industry and was amongst the first to employ and perfect the method of oil well acidization which today is standard procedure in the industry for oil and gas well stimulation. At one time, Nadel and Gussman was the largest independent oil producer in Kansas, and for many years was the largest independent oil producer in Osage County, Oklahoma's largest producing county. Today, from five regional offices the company is a significant producer of oil and gas. For many years Herbert Gussman was the chairman of the executive committee of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and was instrumental in the merging with the Union Pacific Railroad. A great lover of music, he was a founder of the Tulsa Philharmonic, and although his first musical love was classical, for many years he studied jazz piano with his friend, the late Teddy Wilson. His friendships in the world of music stretched from Isaac Stern, Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Istomin, Jan Pierce to Vladimer Golschmann, all who would stay and practice at his home when they came to Tulsa. He leaves a collection of French Impressionist paintings that is considered one of the finest private collections in the country. Under the tutelage of his late brother Lawrence Gussman, he built a large personal collection of African art, and along with his brother, endowed and donated many works to the Gussman Collection at the Philbrook Museum of Art. A lover and a student of the game of golf, he played to a low single digit handicap through most of his life. Beyond all of his interests, his family came first. He was always there for them. His love for them and their own achievements were so evident to all. GUSSMAN--Herbert. The employees of Nadel and Gussman mourn our founder Herbert Gussman, a visionary amongst oil men who boldly lead us into new areas and new technologies. He enriched us both as a human being and by making us participants in the company's successes while always stressing the highest ethics in all of our transactions.

But there's at least one measurement by which ""Law & Order"" still wins: the total number of viewers who watch any ""Law & Order"" broadcast in the course of a week is well ahead of the combined ""CSI"" figure, given the older series's myriad syndicated repeats. The numbers above, from Nielsen Media Research, are for the week of Feb. 21-27, the last one before ""Trial by Jury"" upped the ""Law & Order"" ante to four shows. Of course, ""CSI"" still wins on average: there were 47 broadcasts of ""Law & Order"" shows on NBC, TNT and USA for an average of 1.96 million viewers per episode, and just 15 broadcasts of ""CSI"" shows on CBS, A&E and Spike, for an average of 4.37 million. Still, it's a sobering thought: in an age when Americans are divided by politics, and distributed among hundreds of cable channels, the equivalent of one-third of the nation's population spent an hour watching ""Law & Order"" that week.

Kate got her first pair from the rock writer Lester Bangs in 1976, while she was touring Britain with the Who. I don't know who gave Lester his. Maybe Roy Orbison back in 1954. ""It was a real shift, a transformative moment I have never come back from,"" recalls Kate, who has just published ""Rebel Music"" (Genesis Publications), an epic book of Bob Marley photographs. Wayfarers transformed me, too. Those shades instantly became a part of my face. I wore tortoise frames by day, black by night. In the late 70's, we all wore sunglasses around the clock. Some people thought it was about drugs, but it was really about cool: people couldn't read your eyes. In 1978, the Blues Brothers wore Wayfarers on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and the glasses began their ascent as a mainstream fashion accessory. They probably peaked shortly after 1983, when Tom Cruise wore them in ""Risky Business,"" and they were widely knocked off. Clich-phobic, I switched to Persols, but after some years I realized they were more Marcello Mastroianni than me, so I went back to my Wayfarers.

One of those head-scratchers has got to be Masaru Emoto's spectacularly eccentric book ""The Hidden Messages in Water,"" which argues that water has feelings, too -- and that the crystals that form in frozen water change shape when an onlooker shows the water words, or beams thoughts in its direction. Emoto's book is filled with photographs of the shiny, happy crystals that form when water is shown phrases like ""You're cute"" or ""Thank you,"" and also of the deformed, sorry-looking crystals that result when you show it ""You fool!"" or ""Satan."" Emoto's book has sold some 400,000 copies internationally, and it has lingered on the upper reaches of the Times extended paperback advice list for months, rising this week to No. 13. Emoto, who has studied alternative medicine in Japan, also notes that water is picky about the music it likes. Mozart and the Beatles' song ""Yesterday"" made it perk up, while heavy metal music freaked it out, making its crystals look malignant. All of this has broad implications for personal happiness and world peace, Emoto suggests, when you consider that our bodies are 70 percent water. ""When you have become the embodiment of gratitude,"" Emoto writes, ""think about how pure the water that fills your body will be.

Margiela sees his role as a philosopher, rethinking the basic premise of clothing -- how it is sized and sold, how it interacts with the body -- with his team of white-coated assistants. Over the years, this has resulted in frayed ball gowns, reversed seams, cloven-toed boots and, when he was designing for Hermes, the most perfectly cut pants and jackets on the planet. Now, with his high-flying partner, Renzo Rosso of Diesel, and a new, industrial-strength business plan, Margiela is hotter than ever. How to scale the ramparts and dispel the mystery?

That may seem an impossibly precise prediction, but judging by a report released last Tuesday by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, it is a good guess. According to statistics the group compiled, between 144 and 162 pedestrians have died in traffic accidents in the state in 7 of the past 10 years. Last year's total was 153, one shy of the 10-year average. The leaders of the group, which advocates for the rights and safety of cyclists and pedestrians, can't explain the constancy of the carnage in the crosswalks. But they say the number is too high and the state government is not doing enough to bring it down. ""It has stayed steady over the past 10 years despite the fact that walking has actually declined in New Jersey,"" said Michelle Ernst, author of the report. By one measure, New Jersey is one of the most dangerous states for pedestrians. It was one of only three states in which more than one of every five people killed in traffic accidents was on foot, Ms. Ernst said. The solution, she said, is more and better sidewalks and speed humps to slow traffic. ""The faster the car is going, the more likely a pedestrian who is struck is to die,"" Ms. Ernst added.

us,Distress Test: Earning an A,"Leather, a material associated with luxury, is getting down and dirty. A processing technique that involves washing the hide is taking away its pristine appearance, leaving it creased and slightly misshapen. For men, Rick Owens's burnt orange shrunken leather motorcycle jacket ($1,990 at Barneys) and Jil Sander's pea green leather jacket ($2,650 at Jeffrey) bear all the wrinkles of a garment after a spin cycle. Even men's shoes look kicked about, like Sciapo's faded black washed leather lace-ups (right, $250 at Barneys). For women, the washed leather handbags by Prada (below), which come in sage green and light blue in two sizes ($1,495 and $1,530), and Sissi Rossi's green, oval handbag with outside cargo pockets ($765 at Barneys Co-op) alleviate any worries about getting that first scratch. Women's washed leather jackets, like Duarte's teal motorcycle version (above, $665 at Bloomingdale's), are as casual and comfortable as washed jeans -- which is where the taste for distressed clothing started, said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director at Bloomingdale's.

Since the Belgian wunderkind set up shop in Paris in 1988, no one has seen a picture of him, and no face-to-face interviews have been granted. Margiela sees his role as a philosopher, rethinking the basic premise of clothing -- how it is sized and sold, how it interacts with the body -- with his team of white-coated assistants. Over the years, this has resulted in frayed ball gowns, reversed seams, cloven-toed boots and, when he was designing for Herms, the most perfectly cut pants and jackets on the planet. Now, with his high-flying partner, Renzo Rosso of Diesel, and a new, industrial-strength business plan, Margiela is hotter than ever. How to scale the ramparts and dispel the mystery? We figured that if anybody could do it, it would be that fashion and music provocateur, Malcolm McLaren. Herewith, the beginning of a correspondence.",2005-03-13T05:00:00+0000

""The gold line offers casual wear, like a jean jacket or a tropical-print T-shirt. And the classic line features regular vests for the army and police."" (He even makes knife-proof undershorts, popular with wardens.) The company has developed its own indestructible material, key to minimizing bulk and risk, he says. So when can we expect a bulletproof boutique at Barneys New York? Caballero says he's eyeing the Middle East before braving the United States or Russia. Aw, shoot.

The hip-hop-flavored song ""Razom Nas Bagato!"" (""Together We Are Many!""), by Greenjolly (right), was the anthem of Ukraine's recent Orange Revolution and was ubiquitous in the streets of Kiev during the demonstrations there. In its earlier version, it included the lyrics ""Falsifications -- no! Machinations -- no!"" and ""Yushchenko, Yushchenko is our president. Yes, yes, yes!"" Viktor Yushchenko won the new elections called in Ukraine after President Leonid Kuchma's administration was accused of rigging the first vote in favor of a hand-picked successor. Earlier this month, Eurovision's executive supervisor, Svante Stockselius, disqualified the song on the grounds that the contest is ""nonpolitical."" The BBC reported that last week the band submitted new lyrics at the request of the contest's organizers. Ukraine's Communist Party has accused the new Yushchenko administration of rigging the Eurovision vote to favor Greenjolly, a previously unknown group whose name, in its original Ukrainian, translates as ""sleigh.""

Lucille Hartmann says that the performance of her private school's choir helped propel it to international success, although the singers were not properly compensated. More than 8.5 million people saw the movie (starring, right, Grard Jugnot), the DVD sold in excess of 1 million copies, and the soundtrack has sold 1.5 million, according to the movie and soundtrack producers. A contract with the record producers gave the amateur choir's association 1 percent royalties -- a low figure in France -- but no contracts were made with the members of the group. ""The success of this movie has worn her out,"" said Ms. Hartmann's lawyer, Alain Jakubowicz. ""Her parents think it would be fair that she receive a share of the royalties.""

At one time, Nadel and Gussman was the largest independent oil producer in Kansas, and for many years was the largest independent oil producer in Osage County, Oklahoma's largest producing county.

""The episode is not sufficiently explicit or graphic to be deemed indecent,"" the commission said. In the scripted segment, Ms. Sheridan flirted in a locker room with the Philadelphia Eagles receiver Terrell Owens, dropping her towel for a shot that revealed her naked back. At the time, the National Football League called the sketch ""inappropriate and unsuitable"" for its audience and ABC Sports apologized.

The best-selling stents are coated with polymers impregnated with drugs that combat the tendency of vessel wall tissue to grow through and around the stent and form new blockages. Conor's CoStar stent, which stores drugs in tiny wells in the metal instead of using a coating, has performed well in European trials but the company is locked up in legal battles with Boston Scientific and Angiotech Pharmaceuticals over rights to use paclitaxel, the drug involved in those trials.

The union, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, said the contract called for improved prescription, dental and hospital benefits, with employer health contributions rising 67 percent -- to $7,284 a worker per year from $4,368 -- over the life of the contract. Wages, which are $9 to $17 an hour, will rise on average by little more than 5 percent over the contract's span, the union said. A ratification vote is set for later this month.

Russia has badly needed a success since the massacre at the Beslan schoolhouse last September, and the Foreign Ministry was indignant that the outside world did not entirely accept the ""liquidation"" of an ""international terrorist"" at face value. The fact is, the Russians killed the one Chechen leader with whom they might have begun a political process.

He said he would hold a discussion in Genoa today to ""shed light"" on the book. Vatican Radio listeners heard some of Cardinal Bertone's ideas in advance. Saying that the real intrigue was not to be found in the book's plot but in its marketing, the cardinal pointed out that it was published in the wake of Jubilee 2000, a holy year for the Roman Catholic Church that brought millions of pilgrims and tourists to Rome.

He is survived by his loving wife, Ruth, son Fred, daughter, Hilary, grandson, Josh Gray-Emmer, granddaughters, Tamar Dunn & Natasha Dunn, and sisters, Ethel Jones & Florence Schachter. ""Marty"" was born, raised, and spent most of his life in Brooklyn, New York. He was in the Army for five years where he served in the Pacific. He made friendships during those years that lasted a lifetime. He continued to write to and visit his army buddies and attend reunions of his battalion. Marty and Ruth were married in 1946. They worked hard but also knew how to have a good time by driving around the United States, signing up for elderhostel classes and trips and taking cruises that ranged from cargo ships to South America to luxurious cruise ships to the Caribbean and Alaska. Marty worked for the same company for 40 years selling commercial thermometers and gauges throughout the City of New York and New Jersey. He was active in B'nai Brith and served as President of the Marine Park Lodge, as well as its Treasurer for many years. Marty was an avid bowler who won many individual and team trophies while serving as the Marine Park League's Treasurer for over 20 years. He also played in a weekly poker game. Marty was loved and respected by everyone who knew him. Wherever he was, friends and relatives knew that he could be counted on. He loved New York City and knew every street and its history. Many friends and relatives who came in from out of town were fascinated by his tours of Manhattan. Ruth and Marty loved the theater and spent many wonderful summer afternoons taking their children to Broadway and off-Broadway shows which were always followed by dinner at a different restaurant. They also enjoyed the opera. After leaving his long time employment, he started his own business which he sold 10 years later when he and Ruth retired to the Clearbrook community in Cranbury, New Jersey where they made many new friends. When their health started to fail, they moved to Seattle, Washington so that they could be closer to their daughter, Hilary who lives on Vashon Island, a short ferry ride away.

Holding banners reading ""Pornographer Out of the Bolshoi,"" the protesters said that Mr. Sorokin's work was indecent and slandered Russian culture.

With Glenn Close, above, joining the cast as the cool and calculating Capt. Monica Rawling, the premiere drew an estimated 3.9 million viewers, winning back more than a third of the 2.8 million who watched last season's premiere, and 56 percent more than the average total viewers for last season, according to Nielsen Media Research. . . . Elsewhere on cable, the indie-film reality series ""Project Greenlight"" had its premiere Tuesday night on Bravo after two seasons on HBO, and its numbers were not great: an estimated 311,000 saw it. But it could grow in popularity over the season, as another Bravo reality show, ""Project Runway,"" did; it had a premiere of only 354,000 but finished big with a finale seen by more than two million.

After a catheter is inserted in a leg artery and threaded up to an obstruction in either of the two carotid arteries in the neck, a balloon is inflated to clear the vessel and a metal mesh stent is deployed to keep it propped open. Last September, the Guidant Corporation became the first company approved to sell such devices, but several competitors have been racing to enter the market.

A dancer bursts out extravagantly but is interrupted and exposed as vulnerable in Ms. Shick's latest piece, ""Repair,"" set to a score by Elise Kermani, a sound designer, that is triggered by sound-producing light sensors on the costumes. Reassuringly, those costumes and the sculptural set are the work of Barbara Kilpatrick, a longtime collaborator whose delicately powerful designs create the perfect worlds for Ms. Shick's intimate, poetic distillations of time and place. ""Repair"" features Ms. Shick and Jodi Melnick (above), another frequent collaborator. Tall, slender and supple, with a wide-cheekboned face ringed by a fluff of hair, Ms. Shick looks like a cross between an angel and one of Walker Evans's paradoxically beautiful Dust Bowl farm wives.

us,The Listings; BEN STILLER,"Neil LaBute has said that he didn't write the narrator of ""This Is How It Goes"" with Ben Stiller in mind, but anyone who reads the script might be excused for thinking otherwise. A likable writer with a weakness for bad jokes, the character (named simply Man) superficially resembles many of the nebbishy protagonists played by Mr. Stiller, above, in past films. Even his nervously staccato speech patterns will sound familiar to fans of ""Meet the Parents"" and ""There's Something About Mary."" For his long-awaited return to the stage, Mr. Stiller has chosen a part that he is perfectly suited for (much more so than the cocky salesman Richard Roma in ""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" which he was to play on Broadway several years ago before dropping out of the revival, leading to the production's collapse). But if this seems like old hat, remember that no playwright is better at tweaking audience expectations about celebrities than Mr. LaBute, who usually casts his plays with movie and television stars (preferably good-looking ones). To take the most recent example, ""Fat Pig,"" Jeremy Piven, best known as the oily agent in the television series ""Entourage,"" played a sweet, indecisive hero and Keri Russell (the angelic title character from ""Felicity"") was his bitchy ex-girlfriend. In ""This Is How It Goes,"" Mr. Stiller, who was last onstage almost two decades ago in a revival of ""The House of Blue Leaves,"" is not only an unreliable narrator, but an inscrutable one. He has returned to his hometown, but it's not clear why. He seems to be flirting with an old crush from high school, played by Amanda Peet, but what are his real intentions? And then there are the racially insensitive jokes. We know that Neil LaBute is up to something -- he always is -- but what exactly is it?

The third season ended with the incarceration of the drug lord Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris, above) and the death of his lieutenant, Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), bringing to an end the story arc that linked the first three seasons. Reached at home in Baltimore, where the series is set, David Simon, the creator, explained that each season has been thematically distinct, focusing in turn on the drug war, unionized labor and local politics. The fourth season will address the public school system. Though Mr. Simon declined to reveal any plot lines, ""some characters will continue, some will not,"" he acknowledged. A fifth season has been mapped out but not yet approved. HBO will begin shooting 12 episodes in late 2005 for broadcast sometime next year. JOEL TOPCIK",2005-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Simon was born on the lower east side and graduated from Stuyvesant High School and CCNY. A World War II army veteran, Simon later joined the N.Y.P.D., in which he served for 38 years. He rose through the ranks to become a three-star Chief. He was the N.Y.P.D.'s first Chief of Organized Crime Control and retired as Chief of Personnel. In 1976, Simon was the first recipient of the N.Y.P.D Shomrim Society's Asser Levy Award to the person who best exemplifies the strong commitment of Jews to police service. He was a mentor and role model to many. As Director of the Special Operations Division of the N.Y.P.D., Simon developed a new technique for negotiations in hostage situations and successfully obtained the safe release of hostages held in a sporting goods store in 1973. He later testified before Congress regarding his innovative approach to hostage negotiations, a method which is still in use today. In addition to his professional career, Simon was actively involved with Jewish causes. He was a founder of the Chabad Center of the Five Towns, a Grand Marshall of the Israeli Day Parade, and a volunteer with the Israeli Defense Force. He lived by the motto ""Do justly. Love mercy.

Last year's No Fun Fest bore the influence of Sonic Youth -- at least one band member performed on each of the festival's three days. This year, the No Fun Fest headliners include the wild -- and, sometimes, wildly unsettling -- Swiss extremist Rudolf Eb.er, who terrorizes audiences under the name Runzelstirn & Gurgelstock, as well as the long-running British act Whitehouse, known for pairing volatile musical tantrums with sadistic rants. (Visit www.nofunfest.com/ for the complete lineup.) Perhaps the most exciting act on the bill is Fe-Mail, the Norwegian duo of Maja Ratkje (above right), a singer and composer, and Hild Sofie Tafjord. The two record together as half of the excellent all-female quartet Spunk, which specializes in sharp (or sometimes gentle) jazz-inspired collisions. But as Fe-Mail, the two make more of a racket: on ""Syklubb fra Haelvete"" (Important), the duo's startling debut CD, full of splintered, screaming sounds that hinted simultaneously at terror and joy; don't be surprised if the duo's headlining performance on Sunday night finds ways to split the difference, too.

us,"Venice, Calif.","VENICE is a rarity in Los Angeles, a neighborhood where you actually want to walk. In fact, assuming your flip-flops are sturdy, it's possible to spend a weekend in Venice without getting into a car. Since it was designed as a beachside resort in 1905 by Abbot Kinney, who became a real estate developer after he dropped out of the family tobacco business, the neighborhood has seemed removed from the rest of Los Angeles's flashy, auto-centric urban culture. Even in the early 1990's, it was authentically bohemian: a run-down beach community where real estate was cheap, skaters and surfers ruled the boardwalk, and hippies and artists populated dilapidated Craftsman bungalows. Times have changed. Although Venice still has an abundance of artists, writers, surfers and plain old eccentrics, it also attracts A-list celebrities (Julia Roberts bought property there in 2002), fine restaurants and chic boutiques. The popular annual garden tour (May 7) is increasingly a showcase for designer landscapers and prominent architects. On the lush residential streets near Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Frank Gehry is designing a home for himself, and the local designer Steven Ehrlich has already built one. But even with property values and celebrity cachet on the rise, Venice remains quirky and laid back, a place where you might see entire families on bikes or an artist walking to the shore with a canvas in one hand and a beach chair in the other. Feel free to leave the stilettos at home. JANELLE BROWN",2005-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Fifty years later, if no longer quite the youngest, she is certainly one of the best regarded, not only for her eye but for doing lively shows of what she believes in, regardless of art-world fashions or trends. In her New York and Paris divisions, she has mounted nearly 800 exhibitions of contemporary and modernist painters, sculptors and photographers, with emphasis on 20th-century American art, French and American photography, Dada and Surrealism. Her Paris gallery, which operated from 1976 to 1998, focused on the work of significant French and American photographers and created a rewarding exchange by bringing the former to New York and the latter to Paris. Her current show, ""Zabriskie Gallery, New York/Paris: Season 1980,"" celebrates the gallery's 50th year by revisiting its 1980 season, with a display of works from exhibitions mounted at that midpoint of its existence. And it reveals its proprietor's wonderfully eclectic taste, with objects like a classical ""Head"" (about 1909) in white marble by Elie Nadelman; a finely executed charcoal drawing (1936) of three biomorphic forms in space by the British abstractionist Paule Vezlay (above); a rugged ""Landscape for the Forties"" (1946) by the out-of-mainstream painter Arnold Friedman; and two superb photographs of stately trees by the German Albert Renger-Patzsch. Bravo! to this very lively place and its vibrant proprietor. Would that it could be around for another half century.

Born August 9, 1941, Bruce Sharp was a man who was known for his big heart and dedication to family and friends as well as his pioneering entrepreneurship in the underground storage tank industry. A former Eagle Scout and Naval Reservist, Bruce Sharp started his own tank lining company in 1967 which specialized in lining underground storage tanks preventing leaks into the environment. By 1972, Bruce Sharp had developed his own tank lining material and process and began a national network of franchises that specialize in lining petroleum tanks. Bruce's revolutionary process became the industry leader by the early 1980's and shortly thereafter he began patenting ideas helping to improve underground storage tank designs.

Believed by some scholars to have been written around 1592 by Shakespeare, Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle -- and others, too, perhaps -- the play features a speech by More defending the rights of immigrants, delivered to quell an uprising by Londoners who feared that their jobs were at risk from Protestants fleeing persecution in Europe. No known performance of the play was recorded in Shakespeare's lifetime, perhaps because of comments written in the margin of a manuscript by the censor about the riot: ""Perform this scene at your peril.""

By 1972, Bruce Sharp had developed his own tank lining material and process and began a national network of franchises that specialize in lining petroleum tanks. Bruce's revolutionary process became the industry leader by the early 1980's and shortly thereafter he began patenting ideas helping to improve underground storage tank designs. He then founded his National Leak Prevention Association, which became nationally recognized by the EPA, and by the 1990's Bruce successfully began licensing patents to various tank manufacturers on a national level. In addition to the over 100 patents and being recognized as a leader in the petroleum storage industry, Bruce Sharp held both commercial and instrument pilot licenses, was an avid scuba diver, enjoyed sailing, was a certified Dolphin Trainer, loved snow skiing and was a licensed and registered pyrotechnician.

us,Comings and Goings,"Led by Northwest Airlines, major carriers raised ticket prices by $10 or more in the last few weeks, blaming the soaring price of jet fuel. Even Southwest Airlines, which limits its highest ticket price to $299 each way, said it was raising discount fares from many major cities, but only by $1 to $3 one way. American and Continental Airlines raised fares on most flights in the United States and Canada by as much as $20 round trip. The increase, matched by America West, is $5 each way on flights of 1,000 miles or less and $10 each way on longer flights. US Airways raised fares in ""select markets."" At the same time, these airlines have spring fare sales on thousands of domestic and international flights. United, US Airways, Northwest and American were among the airlines offering lower prices on tickets purchased for travel primarily between April and June. JetBlue Airways said this month that it was planning its own version of the East Coast shuttles run by US Airways and Delta. JetBlue said it planned regular service between Logan in Boston and LaGuardia in New York (but not to Washington), using new 100-seat regional jets. JetBlue has not set a starting date for the service, but it said a round-trip ticket would be about $100. That is lower than the walk-up prices charged by its competitors -- last week Delta quoted a shuttle price of $484.90 and US Airways $406.90 -- and it would be half the price of the high-speed Acela Express run by Amtrak. But Delta's chief marketing officer, Paul Matsen, said his company offered a price about that low to its corporate customers. In mid-March Delta joined American and Northwest in pulling pillows as a cost-saving move. It also raised the price of an alcoholic beverage by $1, to $5. But starting April 4, the airline is going to offer passengers free snacks, eliminating its food-for-sale program in coach. MICHELINE MAYNARD",2005-03-20T05:00:00+0000

How is it possible to produce that much red ink while slashing spending? Easy. Just cut revenue by giving huge tax cuts to -- surprise, surprise -- high earners and wealthy investors.

us,World Class,"Had it not been for Eaton Hall, the Duke of Westminster's English estate, would a French convent girl named Coco Chanel have seen the luxe in mannish tweeds? Chanel's love affairs often involved travel, and both pursuits were to influence her imagination. She was not alone in this respect. The explorations that took place in the latter part of the 19th century, especially to Arabia, fed the romantic longings of a string of remarkable women, as Lesley Blanch's book ""The Wilder Shores of Love"" makes clear. By the time Paul Poiret conceived his Oriental robes, much of fashionable Europe felt the lure of the East. Nowadays, with three or four collections a year to produce, and shops to be filled in Beijing and Moscow, designers can't afford the luxury of a grand tour. They must keep their own trains running. Which doesn'tmean that travel doesn't figure into fashion. Miuccia Prada based last year's spring collection around a travel theme, using skirts printed with picture postcards to suggest that the best way to open one's mind is to see a new country. Travelis an integral part of John Galliano's research at Dior; a trip to Egypt in 2003 yielded beautiful dresses in bandages of black and white organdy that reasserted the connection between Pharonic elegance and the sphinxlike poses of 1950's fashion photography. At the most recent haute couture shows in Paris, Jean Paul Gaultier made a mental voyage to Africa, picking up the trail of Yves Saint Laurent and Azzedine Alaa; Valentino named each dress after a world-class destination, as if thinking of his jet-setting clientele. Indeed, behind the chinoiserie prints and ""Viva Las Vegas"" showstoppers is an awareness of how important it is today for a couturier to be perceived as an international brand.Some designers, like Karl Lagerfeld and Alexander McQueen, consciously avoid travel themes, mainly on the grounds that it seems too easy to throw some astrakhan on the collar of a coat and say, ""Here we have Russia."" They prefer to explore moods or periods. The 60's and 70's saw a lessening of travel's influence in fashion, as designers felt the social vibrations of youth, political protest and rock 'n' roll. With the emergence of global luxury groups like Gucci in the mid-90's, there was a renewed interest in fashion's looking exotic. Still, a designer can be genuinely moved by his wanderlust, few more so than Francisco Costa at Calvin Klein. After visiting Yellowstone, he returned to New York and created a series of jersey dresses that brilliantly captured the natural Technicolor of a Western hot spring. It was better than a View-Master.

us,Inside the List,"GOD SQUAD: Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, the authors of the apocalyptic thrillers in the ""Left Behind"" series, have had their winning streak snapped. The pair's previous six novels all entered the Times hardcover fiction list at No. 1; their new one, ""The Rising,"" makes its debut this week at No. 2, behind James Patterson and Howard Roughan's ""Honeymoon."" LaHaye and Jenkins's new book tells the not-so-cheerful story of the birth of the Antichrist to a literature professor named Marilena; it's the first of three planned prequels to the events of the first book in the ""Left Behind"" series. ""The Rising"" may not have landed at No. 1, but LaHaye and Jenkins remain an outsize force in the publishing world. The previous 12 books in the ""Left Behind"" series have sold more than 40 million copies; these guys have even sponsored a truck on Nascar's Craftsman Truck Series circuit. (This was probably a doomed experiment; who wanted to drive a race truck with the words ""left behind"" stamped on it?) LaHaye and Jenkins have not been bothered by critics who find their books anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish and anti-United Nations, or by those who've pointed out that their prose does not exactly crackle and pop. ""Pedestrian writing, thin characters -- I can handle the criticism,"" Jenkins told Newsweek's David Gates last year. ""I write to pedestrians. And I am a pedestrian. I write the best I can. . . . The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to read.""",2005-03-20T05:00:00+0000

Gianni Agnelli and Aristotle Onassis were clients as well. The company's most famous model -- the compasso d'oro of 1954, a ""24-hour bag"" made for air travel -- is included in the Museum of Modern Art's modern-design archives. All this was achieved without a visible label or logo -- remarkable in today's brand-mad world. Valextra's handmade quality and sleek lines spoke for themselves. They still do, thanks to Massimo Suppancig, the Italian fashion executive who saved the prestigious but fading company two years ago. Suppancig, who grew up in Trieste but traveled often to Milan with his family, has always loved both the beauty of the past and the excitement of the future -- the ideal sensibility for his current post. ""The first thing I learned from my grandfather was a way of talking and moving and behaving,"" the elegant Suppancig says in his trademark immaculate white turtleneck.

After Delta Air Lines retreated yesterday morning from the latest fare increase, Continental also abandoned it, according to The Associated Press. Competitors were assessing their positions last night. Still, with oil prices expected to remain at record levels, industry experts predict that fares will keep rising.

us,"Arts, Briefly; Eminem Drops Lawsuit","Eminem, below, has asked a federal judge to dismiss his lawsuit against the publisher of the hip-hop magazine The Source, saying that remaining issues in the case are moot. The rapper, whose real name is Marshall B. Mathers III, had contended in his suit, filed in December 2003, that the magazine had violated his copyright by publishing lyrics disparaging black women that were attributed to him. Eminem, who is white, acknowledged that the lyrics were his but described them as the product of adolescent heartbreak, written before he acquired his fame. The judge, Gerald E. Lynch of Federal District Court in Manhattan, has displayed a zeal for the case, writing at length on the role of race in popular music. He has made several rulings in Eminem's favor, including enjoining online publication of the lyrics and awarding monetary damages for violation of that injunction. A lawyer for Eminem, Donald N. David, said the time and expense of a trial were no longer worthwhile because the discovery of the lyrics was no longer newsworthy. Michael S. Elkin, a lawyer for the publisher, said Eminem's request for a dismissal was a victory. He said, ""You can't stifle the press."" MICHAEL BRICK",2005-03-23T05:00:00+0000

After the attack, which occurred just before 8 p.m. near the intersection of Dunkirk Street and Elmira Avenue, the officer's partner shot the suspect, whom the police identified as Radcliffe A. Meeks, 33. He was struck in the right elbow and was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he was listed in stable condition. Charges against Mr. Meeks were pending last night, the authorities said. The suspect has two prior arrests for assaulting a police officer, a police official said, but the status of those cases could not be determined last night. In last night's attack, the police said, two plainclothes officers had identified themselves as officers and tried to stop Mr. Meeks, whom they suspected of threatening to shoot a man. The police said Mr. Meeks then attacked one officer, a five-year-veteran whom officials did not identify. The officer underwent surgery last night and was expected to make a full recovery.

The book, ""Le Chevalier de St.-Hermine"" (""The Knight of St.-Hermine""), set at the peak of the Napoleonic era with scenes of the battle of Trafalgar and the death of Horatio Nelson, was serialized in a newspaper in 1869 but never published as a book. The scholar, Claude Schopp, a French Dumas specialist, discovered the serialized work -- which completes the trilogy begun with ""The Companions of Jehu"" and ""The Whites and the Blues"" -- in 1988 on newspaper microfiche at the library. He has worked in secrecy since the discovery to edit the book and reconstruct the damaged clippings, and he added a brief conclusion.

The opera, ""Children of Rosental,"" has been picketed, right, by Moving Together, a youth group that supports President Vladimir V. Putin. The group called the opera pornography and criticized its librettist, the postmodernist writer Vladimir Sorokin, as unworthy of the Bolshoi stage. The controversy, which has dragged on for weeks, has been front-page news in Russia, leading to widespread speculation about what would happen at the premiere. But the only disruption last night was at the beginning of the opera, when several minutes passed without any music, just movement onstage, and one viewer shouted out, ""Will there be any music or what?"" Some members of Parliament had demanded that the director of the Bolshoi, Anatoly Iksanov, be removed for staging the opera, which depicts scientifically bred clones of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky and other composers living in squalor after the collapse of the Soviet Union; Mozart's girlfriend is a prostitute whose pimp poisons him. Mr. Sorokin appeared weary but pleased after the performance and was dismissive of the campaign against the opera. ""I don't think about them,"" he said of the protesters. ""They're petty.

Mr. Foxworthy's special bested another of his recent projects on Comedy Central, the premiere of ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again"" last month, which drew an audience of 6.1 million.

All the works reflect Mr. Petronio's interests in such concerns as pop culture and issues of sex and gender. His new piece is ""Bud,"" a male duet that will be the first part of ""Bloom,"" a production to music by the singer and songwriter Rufus Wainright to be completed next year. It shares the program with ""Prelude"" (2000), a study in gestural abandon to music by Placebo, and two creations from the 90's. ""MiddleSexGorge"" (with Mr. Petronio, above) hurtles along to music by the British post-punk band Wire in a manner that is visually enigmatic as well as choreographically exciting: whereas the women in the cast wear austere costumes, the men are clad in corsets.

us,MICHAEL FRIEDMAN,"If pastiche is the dominant musical style of today -- see ""Spamalot"" or, for that matter, listen to the hit song ""Rich Girl"" in which Gwen Stefani riffs on ""Fiddler on the Roof"" -- then Michael Friedman is in luck. One of the most nimble composers in New York, Mr. Friedman, 29, a member of the influential downtown troupe, the Civilians, can do a little bit of everything. In the last few years, he has written salsa, mod pop tunes and Andrew Lloyd Webber-style ballads. He has written musical interludes for some of this city's best genre plays -- whether it's for the moody neo-noir atmospherics of ""Splatter Pattern"" or the early 20th-century silent film-style piano in the superior ""All Wear Bowlers,"" which returns to the Here Arts Center on April 22. But what makes Mr. Friedman, above, such a rare commodity is that he writes for each of these forms with precision and absolute sincerity (even when the songs are not sincere). For his next trick, Mr. Friedman has written some Irish ditties to accompany Sean Cunningham's foul-mouthed and tasteless lyrics in the musical ""God Hates the Irish: The Ballad of Armless Johnny.""

They are prodigiously resourceful painters, sculptors, muralists, graffiti artists, graphic designers and photographers who have exhibited internationally, and they have created a sweet, faux-innocent magic theater of an installation for their first New York exhibition. It features a gargantuan, three-dimensional, barefoot puppet (above) in a stuffed blue and red suit who lies on his side with his knees up so as to fit into the gallery. This character's head is enclosed within a big box with lavishly decorated doors opened to reveal his impassive cartoon face. Walk around behind the box and you find inside an entirely mirrored room occupied by a child-size figure of a girl in a small wooden boat. Additionally, the artists have covered the gallery walls with a yellow sky punctuated by puffy white clouds. A big round fish decorated with sequins and trailing painted peacock feathers hovers on one wall above aqua blue ocean waves that encircle the gallery, and a girl in a tall conical dress anchored to another fish is painted on the opposite wall. A near life-size houseboat inhabited by all sorts of quirky characters and animals fills the long wall. What it all means is hard to say, but the experience is transporting.

us,STEVE REICH,"As part of its Composer Portraits series, the Miller Theater is devoting an evening to Steve Reich, with two of his major scores performed by the inventive So Percussion ensemble. For So Percussion (above), the timing is perfect: the group just released a fantastic recording of one of these works, ""Drumming,"" on the Canteloupe new-music label. ""Drumming,"" composed in 1971, is a pivotal work in Mr. Reich's catalog, and it has been getting lots of performances lately (the most recent by Tactus, a student ensemble at the Manhattan School of Music, just a couple of weeks ago). It draws on the techniques that Mr. Reich had explored in his early ""phase"" pieces -- works in which two lines that begin in unison move out of phase as beats are displaced, creating increasingly complicated webs of rhythm, timbre and psycho-acoustic effect. But it also looks back at his studies of African drum techniques. A performance can take on an almost ritualistic appearance; in fact, as the performers moved gradually from bongos to marimbas to xylophones and then to a combination of those instruments, plus voices and a piccolo, a listener can imagine an exotic hybrid of a gamelan orchestra and a factory production line. The other work on the program, Sextet, was composed in 1984, at a time when Mr. Reich was taking stock after the composition of ""The Desert Music,"" a substantial piece for orchestra and chorus. Sextet, for four percussionists and two keyboard players (who double on pianos and synthesizers), begins with a figure from ""The Desert Music"" but then moves in its own direction.

Games","So far, the ratings for the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament this year are higher than the 2004 numbers, and the totals for the first four days of games helped CBS win last week's Nielsen competition. But for the second Thursday in a row, an evening of basketball was not enough to pull CBS into first place on a night that its regular schedule usually dominates: NBC was No.1 in both total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. It was, however, an odd victory for the network, since ""Joey,"" ""The Apprentice"" and ""ER"" all delivered their lowest ratings ever for original episodes. The premiere of the NBC series ""The Office,"" starring Steve Carell, above, was sandwiched between an ""Apprentice"" -- in which Donald Trump nearly fired someone because he chews tobacco (and, worse, swallows the juice rather than using a spittoon) -- and ""ER."" ""The Office,"" the American version of the acclaimed British sitcom of the same title, brought in a modestly successful 11.3 million viewers. On Fox, the rescheduled ""American Idol"" results show drew an audience of 19.96 million, making it Thursday's most watched program, and helping Fox pull into second place for the night among 18-to-49 year-olds.

In the week ending March 20 , sales of ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" (Zondervan, 2002) jumped to more than 64,000 copies from about 12,000 the previous week, according to Nielsen BookScan. The actual numbers were probably far higher, because BookScan counts sales at outlets that make up about 70 percent of retail book purchases. ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" will be No.1 on the New York Times best-seller list of advice, how-to and miscellaneous books on April 3, reflecting sales for the week ended March 19, the book's 114th week on the best-seller list. (On Sunday, the book will be No. 3, reflecting sales for the week ended March 12, the week that the courthouse killings occurred.)

Its Sunday installment of the ""Explorer"" series -- a documentary on the ""Hogzilla"" story, about a giant pig in South Georgia that became famous when its photograph circulated via e-mail -- attracted 1.75 million viewers, the highest total for the show this year.

A movie like ""Live-In Maid"" humanizes an economic crisis in Argentina that for most people is just a bunch of facts and figures in a newspaper article or a one-minute clip on television. The scary documentary ""Darwin's Nightmare"" portrays a world teetering on the brink of catastrophe in which, like it or not, international trade and transportation connect everyone. ""Young Rebels,"" a modest documentary about the Cuban rap scene, shows the consequences of Communism and the longstanding United States trade embargo on this tiny island nation. An immersion in New Directors/New Films is one way to develop a perspective on the human experience that transcends international power politics and commerce. STEPHEN HOLDEN",2005-03-26T05:00:00+0000

This will be the first restoration of an artwork plundered during World War II that was held in a British national collection. A panel set up by the government in 2000 to determine whether artworks in its national collection were inappropriately acquired during the Nazi era ruled on Wednesday that an English army captain had looted the rare missal. The ruling, which ends Benevento's nearly 30-year campaign for the book's restoration, also called for a new law easing the return of looted treasures. The prayer book, containing 290 folios in a script identified with the Benevento region, was written in the scriptorium of a monastery there. This is the third ruling by the panel since British museums agreed in 1998 to publish a list of thousands of artworks with questionable origins acquired from 1933 to 1945. Italy's Culture Ministry has long complained that the country's unique richness in archaeological and artistic artifacts has made it a favorite target of looters.

He was predeceased by his wife of 54 years, Betty. He leaves his beloved fiance, Sherry Browne. He was the loving Father of Dorene and Bruce Burdick, and of daughter-inlaw Gwenellen; proud grandfather of Surya, Michelle, Orion, Douglass, and Melissa, and great-grandfather of Riley, Wolfie, Jake, and Amelie. He is also survived by his adored sister, Loyce and his close cousins, the Smiths: Penny, Ron, and Pat; and by the Coons cousins. Richard Burdick was born in Pittsfield, Mass. in 1916 among his treasured Berkshire Hills. A magician and writer even as a boy, he spent his stint in the Army as cowriter of This Is the Army with Irving Berlin. During that time he also wrote many stage musicals, radio dramas, and short stories. In the lifetime of a multifaceted career -writer, producer, actor, director, composer-lyricist, magician, and broadcasting executive -he enjoyed singular encounters with a mosaic of celebrated people: Ethel Barrymore, Mae West, Max Baer, Joe Louis, Tallulah Bankhead, Jimmy Durante, Gary Merrill, Helen Hayes, Kay Kyser, Dinah Shore, Duke Ellington, Dr. Dinton Cooley, Eleanor Roosevelt, President Truman, Reverend Billy Graham, and Dr. Timothy Johnson. Richard Burdick was a visionary pioneer in public broadcasting. He was a theatrical director and operations manager in early radio and he helped launch one of the first educational TV stations in the country -WUNC-TV in Chapel Hill, N.C. Following this, he was managing director at the public TV station WHYY in Philadelphia, always contributing original scripts. He was on the founding management team of WCVB , one of the top-rated TV stations in Boston which produced great quality, quantity, and diversity of local programming, and which the NY Times called the finest commercial TV station in America. He became a board member, contributing playwright ( of eleven plays), and supporter of Florida Studio Theater in Sarasota, Florida and also was cherished by other theatres including Shakespeare & Co. in Lenox, Mass. where he was a Founding Trustee member and where he contributed three plays. Richard had a talent for living, an unflagging and exceptional creative drive, and a generosity of spirit and mind that was highly motivating to his family, friends and associates. In his autobiography entitled: Next Time I Want To Come Back As a Yellow Bird, he opens with his usual flourish and excitement, asking ""Do you believe in magic?"" and he clearly did delight in Life's great mystery and drama; and always with his unique, Burdick wit. He closed the book with this comment: "" ...as the river of Life continues its eternal flow, my personal tributary will rejoin it on its way back to the source."" A memorial gathering will take place in May in his home town of Pittsfield, Mass., details to be finalized soon.

It seems that in many ways, as a society we are deciding that precious little is our own fault. Thus it makes a perverse kind of sense that it is up to me to persuade my patients to give up their unhealthy habits and to take the drugs that evidence-based medicine indicates are good for them, as well as to take the blame when a lifetime of poor choices (or simply bad genes) leads to a negative medical outcome.

At the rally's end, the protesters chanted new words to the music of the Egyptian national anthem.

The temptation is, however, tough to resist in the case of ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose,"" a movie about the almost unnaturally close relationship between an idealistic, sternly principled man and his teenage daughter, who live together on an island off the Atlantic coast of the United States, in a sort of pristine alternate universe constructed by him and inhabited (metaphorically) only by him and her. The film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller, daughter of the playwright and moralist Arthur Miller, who died last month. The role of the counterculture-Prospero dad is played by her husband of eight years, Daniel Day-Lewis, who is, as it happens, also the offspring of a rather imposing literary figure (C.

Opponents have argued that a finding for MGM could hamper further business and technological innovation on the Web. In order for the entertainment industry to prevail, it will have to persuade the Supreme Court to alter a standard set in 1984, when the court found that the Sony Betamax should not be outlawed because it had a number of legitimate uses apart from duplicating movies. In its filings, MGM has argued that file-sharing services should be held liable for any misuse because advances in computer technology now make it possible to distinguish between legal and illegal file copying.",2005-03-27T05:00:00+0000

For most people in Swift's day, the abstemiousness of Lent occurred at what was already one of the hardest times of year, the last harvest long forgotten and the next one merely a hope for the future. You could argue that Lent was a way for people living in those times -- so different, materially, from our own -- to turn deprivation into something spiritually resonant.

The law exempts contributions to federal candidates, because the United States Department of Transportation said such a ban might conflict with federal procedures and force the state to forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars in highway aid. Mr. Codey, who took office after Gov. James E.

us,Broke,"In the mid-1970's, around the time the parents of several school friends began going broke and losing their small farms because of high interest rates and falling crop prices, an envelope bearing an unfamiliar logo appeared in our mailbox. I carried it to the house and set it on the kitchen counter next to the radio my mother was listening to as she fried liver and onions on her old stove. She opened the envelope with a paring knife and drew out the thin, rectangular hard object I had been fingering through the paper. I remember the odd expression on her face -- a mixture of optimism and apprehension -- as she held the novelty out to me and said, ""It's a BankAmericard."" About a week later the kitchen radio was replaced by a portable TV set. By the next summer, when the banks started foreclosing on our neighbors' farms, my mother's old stove had been replaced as well, a microwave oven stood beside it and the BankAmericards in my parents' wallets had been joined by American Express cards.",2005-03-27T05:00:00+0000

In theory, the stuff was meant to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, but that hardly explained why it was doing so well at department-store beauty counters. So the firm did a study, based on its own polling, and found that about 75 percent of buyers were using it on their faces as a wrinkle fighter. StriVectin, Carlson says, ""appealed to a specific consumer who was savvy about this type of product."" It is not unheard of for consumers to invent new uses for a product, but the way that Klein-Becker, StriVectin's maker, has chosen to handle this instance is both unusual and, apparently, effective.

Mr. Teele was an active, compassionate humanitarian who was loved and will be missed by many throughout the world. Mr. Teele was born in New Rochelle, NY, and grew up in Needham, MA, where his father Stanley F. Teele was a faculty member and eventually dean of the Harvard Business School. Mr. Teele attended high school at Buckingham, Brown and Nichols in Cambridge, MA, where he excelled at varsity sports. At Amherst College, in Amherst, MA, he earned a B.A. in political science, while playing football and serving as editor of the school paper. He earned an M.A. in economics from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, Medford, MA, and completed the coursework for a Ph.D. (abd) in economics from Georgetown University, Washington, DC. Mr. Teele, a longtime DC resident, began his career as a foreign service officer, working as a political officer in Greece and as an analyst in the USAID executive secretariat. From there he focused his career on economic development, living and working in such countries as Afghanistan, Liberia, Nigeria, Thailand and Turkey, until he founded Chemonics. Mr. Teele served as Chemonics' president from its founding in 1975 until 2002 when he became chairman of the board. Originally a one-man business, the company today has over 2,000 employees in 95 countries and is a leader in sponsored economic development worldwide. Mr. Teele is widely considered a pioneer in global economic development. Mr. Teele was a strong proponent of a culturally appropriate, results-oriented approach to economic development. He worked to raise awareness of international development by serving as vice president and board member for the Campaign for U.S. Global Leadership, board member for the Society for International Development, and co-chair of the International Development Task Force of the Professional Services Council. As an associate professor, he taught a course on economic development at Georgetown University, and was frequently a guest lecturer on this topic at numerous institutions. A natural linguist, Mr. Teele spoke fluent French and was comfortable speaking Spanish, German, Thai, Turkish, Portuguese, Greek, and Farsi. With a lifelong love for business and personal travel, he visited more than 85 countries on 5 continents. In spite of his illness, he continued to travel on behalf of Chemonics, visiting countries such as Afghanistan, China, Mongolia, South Africa, Denmark, and France over the past two years. Mr. Teele's legacy is his respect for people, his passion for development, and the values he lived every day. He achieved his dream to make the world a better place. He is survived by his loving wife of 23 years Barbara C. Teele, formerly of Dothan, AL, and five children: Ted Teele of Pittsburgh, PA, Stacia Teele of New York City, NY, Mark Carmichael of Scottsdale, AZ, Kristy Teele of Ledbury, England, Allan Teele of San Francisco, CA, and nine grandchildren. Mr. Teele is also survived by his brother Perry Teele of Bradford, NH, and his sister Melissa Woodbury of St. Augustine, FL.

In October, a federal judge enjoined the police from sawing locks during that month's ride unless bicycles belonged to people being charged or were locked in places that obstructed traffic or people. The lawyer Norman Siegel, above, who has represented members of Critical Mass, said the seizures were ""without legal basis.""

While the surplus, which excludes interest payments on public-sector debt, was down 64 percent from January, it was still an improvement on the surplus of 3.3 billion reais that the government posted in February 2004. With the February fiscal data taken into account, the government has run up a primary surplus of 86.29 billion reais over the last 12 months, equivalent to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product, which is well ahead of its target for a year-end surplus of 4.25 percent of gross domestic product. The government uses the surplus to pay down its debt, which was equal to 51.3 percent of gross domestic product at the end of February. The data reflect the fiscal performance of federal and local governments and state-run companies. Todd Benson (NYT)",2005-03-29T05:00:00+0000

The tax break, a legacy of the former prime minister and self-proclaimed aesthete Charles J. Haughey, is widely seen as unnecessary aid to people who already have achieved success. The novelists Frederick Forsyth and Michel Houellebecq, the singer Lisa Stansfield and members of the band Def Leppard all moved to Ireland to take advantage of its provisions. But the Arts Council, a national financing body, said the exemptions are needed to support artists who make less than the minimum wage and whose income varies from one year to another. It said its research found that, in 2001, more than half of the tax-exempt artists earned less than 10,000 euros ($12,900) a year and that 87 percent earned less than 50,000 ($64,000).

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Flatbush: Woman Collapses and Dies During a Fight,"A customer in the Magic Touch beauty salon at 611 Flatbush Avenue collapsed and died yesterday during a scuffle with another woman in the salon, the police and a witness said. The police did not identify the dead woman, but said she was 47. A longtime friend, John Pekun, 57, of Brooklyn, said that her first name was Bidi and that she was the aunt of the salon's owner. Shortly before noon, Cory Brown, 25, said he was walking past the salon when a woman emerged and offered to braid his hair. When she went inside to get an advertising flier, he said, Bidi complained that the open door was letting in cold air. Bidi then grabbed the other woman by her hair, Mr. Brown said, and the women scratched and bit each other, he said. ""All of a sudden, it looked like she went into cardiac arrest,"" Mr. Brown said of Bidi. ""She fell back into a chair."" She was taken by ambulance to Kings County Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead at 12:15 p.m., the police said. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death.

The 80-page title, selling for $1, was produced by a who's who of talent, including the writers Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka and Judd Winick and the artists Rags Morales and Phil Jimenez.

""It's an exciting moment,"" he said. ""I feel like all the work that we've done is finally coming to fruition."" ""Countdown"" reveals a conspiracy that results in the murder of a superhero and sets the stage for several mini-series that will explore DC's criminal underground, mystical realms and more. Those stories will lead to ""Infinite Crisis,"" by Mr. Johns and Mr. Jimenez, a sequel to the 1985 blockbuster ""Crisis on Infinite Earths,"" which greatly revamped and redefined DC's superheroes.

The oral antiviral treatment, Baraclude, received the unanimous endorsement of an F.D.A. advisory panel on March 11. The panel found that a potential risk of tumors was not significant enough to outweigh the benefits of the drug, or even to warrant a ""black box"" warning. The review of Baraclude, also known as entecavir, was accelerated by the government after regulators said it addressed a serious unmet medical need. The drug's approval was viewed as a positive development for Bristol-Myers, which has lost patent protection on several of its drugs, including the breast cancer treatment Taxol and the antianxiety medication BuSpar.

The Canadian regulator asserted that ATI executives, including the founder and the former chief executive, Kwok Yuen Ho, were aware in late April 2000 that the company would not meet fiscal third-quarter profit forecasts. A news release saying ATI would have a loss was only issued on May 24, 2000, it said. ATI's payment ""constitutes a significant penalty for the acknowledged misconduct,"" the commission said. Officials of ATI, the world's second-largest maker of computer-graphics chips, provided ""untrue"" and ""misleading"" information to investigators, the regulator said in documents it released. During the inquiry, the company told investigators it had decided on May 16, 2000, to issue a news release, 10 days after senior managers made the decision, the commission said. By selling shares before the news was released, Mr. Ho and his wife avoided a loss of about 3.35 million Canadian dollars, according to the commission.",2005-03-30T05:00:00+0000

The woman, Lory Scott, a video store clerk who lived with relatives in an apartment in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, was charged with second-degree murder in the December 2003 death of Nubian Knight, 37, a security officer at Kings County Hospital Center. She married him several months before his death as part of a plot she had developed with another person, according to the investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Knight was found dead in his apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant. He had been beaten on the head and his throat had been slashed. The investigator said the police were not sure whether Ms. Scott committed the killing or was present when Mr. Knight was killed. Under state law, however, a person believed to have conspired in a killing can be charged with murder. Jennifer 8. Lee (NYT)",2005-03-31T05:00:00+0000

Scholastic Inc., its American publisher, plans a first printing of 10.8 million copies of this latest of the J.K. Rowling books, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"" right, USA Today reported yesterday. That figure represents four million copies more than were initially printed when the last Potter adventure was released, in 2003. The total might also be a record for first printings of a hardcover general-interest book, although there are few authoritative sources to confirm that. Publishers routinely overstate the number of copies in a first printing, and the rule of thumb is to divide an announced first printing by two to get the real number. But Scholastic's estimate is probably closer to reality. In 2003, it printed 6.8 million copies of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in the first run, and 5 million of those sold on the first day. That was because of the large volume of pre-orders, a phenomenon that is recurring this time. ""We are hearing from our accounts that the pre-orders are phenomenal,"" Barbara Marcus, the president of Scholastic, said in a statement. Scholastic, however, would not divulge how many books have been ordered so far. EDWARD WYATT",2005-03-31T05:00:00+0000
