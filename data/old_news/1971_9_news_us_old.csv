us,2 GERMAN MOVIES SHOWN AT VENICE:One Tells of Youths Living Supposedly Ideal Lives,"VENICE, Italy, Aug. 31Germany, once the generous provider of artistic and intellectual cinema, today manufactures only a few more exportable films than Zanzibar, Albania or Staten Island. Since World War II there have been several Teutonic movies above the general international average, but they have been exceptions.What has happened? What has happened is such movies as ""Liebe So Schoen Wie Liebe"" and ""Warnung Vor Einer Heiligen Nutte,"" both of which have been unveiled at the Venice Festival.The first concerns a band of self-admiring youths, who steal dogs, engage in petty fraud and otherwise endear themselves as they lead the theoretically ideal existence. One dislikes them all on sight; in the course of two hours one grows to loathe them.Second EntryThe second German entry, written and directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, is better. It involves a disorganized movie company on location at a Mediterranean resort.The film itself is so disorganized that it is uncertain whether or not it is intended as burlesque. As satire, however, it lacks sharpness and bite, though the hardships that the director in the movie faces stirred the audience to impolite laughter.The message appears to be that an artistic filmmaker should have complete control over his work and be entrusted with dictatorial powers.A Mexican Western, ""Arde,"" mingled sociological surrealism with the customary barroom brawls, escapes from rattlesnakes and gun battles on the desert. The story revolves about an itinerant undertaker and his adopted son, who discover a nest of black panthers on the frontier plains. Directed by Jos Bolanos and set at the time of the Civil War, it has been handsomely photographed, galvanizing its Zane Greyish plot with the unexpected and the unlikely.In addition, Ingmar Bergman's latest, ""Beoringen"" (""The Touch""), in color and in English, which has already been released in the United States, was shown tonight.",1971-09-01T05:00:00+0000

But that career happens to include Blake Edward's ""The Perfect Furlough,"" Douglas Sirk's ""Imitation of Life,"" Raoul Walsh's ""A Distant Trumpet,"" plus four films by the immensely enjoyable and generally underrated Delmer Daves. And though I haven't seen all his work, it seems to me just possible that Donahue's first absolutely awful movie is ""Sweet Saviour,"" produced and directed by Bob Roberts, which opened yesterday at the Forum and Trans-Lux East theaters.Donahue, his face half hidden now behind beard and long and slightly graying hair, plays Moon, an East Village hippie cult leader and drug dealer who identifies himself with the Second Coming and thinks he has a mission. One night, Moon and three of his disciples drive out to the suburbs, where, in some glamorous middle-class housing development, a pregnant movie actress (Renay Granville) and some of her jet-setting friends are preparing an orgy. Moon brings with him stuff to smoke, stuff to sniff, assorted pills and a certain sense of derring-do. The jet-setters provide a nice delicatessen platter, a cold roast turkey, and a plate full of Cheez Doodles for appetizers. After the orgy, when everybody is pretty tired, Moon has his disciples borrow knives and forks (from the kitchen, from the cold roast turkey), with which they murder the jet setters.Although the story is fiction, I cannot imagine that any accidental resemblance to persons both living and dead would be willingly rejected. In a work of this sort you must expect exploitation. But the exploitation in ""Sweet Saviour"" has almost nothing to do with the Sharon Tate murder case, the advance publicity notwithstanding, and has almost everything to do with the conventions of pornographic moviemaking.""Sweet Saviour"" is therefore an exploitation film of a fairly tame and boringly predictable sort. It has the obligatory group encounters, private encounters, lesbian encounters and transvestite encounters. Furthermore, it pretends to sex with drugs, without drugs and for drugs. It even offers a smoldering erotic dance, a set piece, that consists mostly of slow-motion head stands and is really pretty funny. Its murders are made up of timid screams and unhomogenized tomato juice, and at no point, either for love or death, does it achieve any hint of intensity. Although its ineptitude is such that you can't really hate it, there is simply nothing about it to like.It is quite without performances except for Troy Donahue, who is helplessly inauthentic. Its various exhibitions are graceless and phony, and I have no memory of anything real to ""Sweet Saviour"" beyond the sharp loud crunch of somebody's first bite into a Cheez Doodle.",1971-09-02T05:00:00+0000

She rattles around the dear old place in the gathering dusk plays something on the phonograph, and finally sinks into bed. The next morning she is up and not even after she has made her own breakfast and begun to draw her bath does she realize that she is not alone. Her uncle, her aunt and her lovely cousin are all around herthey never even kept last night's engagements  but Sarah does not notice them because she is blind, and they are very quiet, being dead.So long as this sequence lasts, perhaps 30 minutes out of a total hour and a half, ""See No Evil,"" has its share of thrills. Cheap thrills, to be sure, but thrills nonethelessand everything in the rest of Richard Fleischer's new movie, which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, encourages us to value small favors.Whoever shot her family has not yet finished, so long as Sarah lives. And the pursuit of the terrified Sarah (Mia Farrow), through the great house, over hill, over dale, and into a sodden clay pit, gives a shape to his taskin which the audience is always busier than the killer, mostly in following the false leads that the screenplay and the camera have set up for it. Of these, none is more insistent, nor ultimately more objectionable, than a kind of surly, decline-of-the-class-system sub-plot that is supposed to provide a motive and a murderer, but that actually provides little more than eyewash to confuse the customers.Attempting on the one hand to mean something and on the other hand trying to crank up the terror, Fleischer keeps suggesting confrontations between the rich and the poor, the old and the young, families with daughters to protect and men with warped desires. For all the potency of a camera movement, it can never have exactly the power of a conceptual image, and therefore ""See No Evil"" is better with its mindless terror than with its witless meaning. And although everything becomes far too much long before it is over, the movie is generally at it most ridiculous precisely where it hopes to make sense.Right at the start, during the main titles, Fleischer begins observing his killer's boots  so you can see the kind of guy he is, of course, and where he walks and what the world is like as he walks it by, but mostly so you can recognize him without knowing who he is. This begins a sustained concentration on boots and shoes, bare feet, bloody feet, muddy feetreally, above and beyond the call of plot and duty. Any cineaste will assume ""Buel."" But it is all as if Fleischer had taken on the mechanics of the great man's obsession without its passion, and ""See No Evil"" lacks even that small scandalous interest.What interest the film does have comes from the performance of Miss Farrow (I also liked Robin Bailey, Dorothy Alison and Diane Grayson as the uncle, aunt and cousin  before their untimely immobilization), who seems to the manor born and who plays her blind patrician with exactly the right small depth of pathos and vulnerable nobility. She has been a better actress in better movies (""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Secret Ceremony"") but she is more than good enough here, and I wish that she could lead a more normal life for once in somebody's film. Probably every man wishes it, with himself across the table, and that is why she is where she is, in perpetual peril and needing assistance.",1971-09-03T05:00:00+0000

us,'THE ARP STATUE' SHOWN AT VENICE:Movie by a Novice Consists of an Hour of Still Shots,"VENICE, Italy Sept. 3Today has brought a new stock of experiments to the Venice film festival.In ""The Arp Statue"" a novice director, Alan Sekers, presents an hour-long film composed entirely of ""stills"" with voices-over providing narration as well as recitation of dialogue. The device has been employed beforein Quinn's documentary on Picasso and in a French investigation of Castro's Cuba but is still a novelty. It has become a clich to end a film with a freezing of its final scene, a static image leaving a more lasting impression than an agitated one. Nevertheless, 60 minutes of ""stills"" is a strain.Even so, Mr. Sekers has accomplished two arresting bitsthe sequence in which the heroine is maimed by a tiger and the Belfast photographs, with their telling faces. The general story, however, suffers by the imposed restriction of movement.Marx and WellsBefore the showing of Alexander Kluge's film ""Der Grosse Verhau"" (""The Big Mess""), Mr. Kluge, the director, made a short address explaining that in it he was attempting a style alien to his other work.His lastest is actually in several styles. Technically it suggests Georges Melies, with the limited equipment of his day, remaking ""2001."" The scenario, also a mixture, hints that Kluge has mistaken himself sometimes for H. G. Wells and sometimes for Karl Marx and sometimes for the two of them simultaneously.The scene is in the next century when everyone is at war with everyone else and apparently anti-Americanism is at full tide. The flights through space are interrupted by subtitles conveying the left-wing slogans of 1970. The symbolism of ""the last representative of U.S. civilization"" being shot down is obvious, but otherwise the action of the motion picture is confused, and its ideas belong to the 19th, rather than the 21st, century.A Yugoslav SatireMore topical and vastly more entertaining is a movie by a Yugoslav, Bata Cengic, entitled. ""The Role of My Family, in the World Revolution,"" a wickedly witty comedy describing the adjustment of a middle-class Serb family to the new order when and after the Russian tanks roll into their land.Its Marxism is that of Groucho, not of Karl, but despite its broad burlesque, its satirical thrusts flash with an angry fire. Sad reflection underlies the loud laughter as the hyprocrisy and futility of the totalitarian state are observed with increasing disgust by a boy growing up under stern domination. A tragic slap-stick farce, it benefits enormously from its ingenious direction and expert performances, just this side and occasionally over the border of caricature.",1971-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 2 Men in Unusual Situations:Teacher Infatuated in 'Lust for a Vampire' 'Man Who Haunted Himself' Also Opens,"A somewhat esteemed colleague, a theater critic for this paper who knows me, has suggested that, considering the title, I might find much of what I generally want from a movie in ""Lust for a Vampire,"" which is now playing at the Penthouse Theater and which he has not seen.Much, but not all. The story of a beautiful vampire and the man who loves her, ""Lust for a Vampire"" is set in and around a rustic Austrian village nestled snugly in the shadow of its vampire castle. It is the 19th century, a point that the visiting advanced skeptic, Richard (Michael Johnson) never lets anyone forget.""Mircalla, this is the 19th, not the 18th century,"" he reminds his favorite student at the local girls' school where he has taken a job (because of the girls). But Mircalla (Yutte Stensgaard) continues to show a woeful ignorance of the last 100 years' literature, and the reason is not far to seek. However, she dresses with the timesEmpire, clinging, filmy, very low-cut, high-waisted, terrificand she is absolutely ravishing. Therefore it is not surprising that Richard falls at Mircalla's feet, where several have fallen before him, and wins the heart of an antique monster whose very life blood was just days before the sacrificial offering of an unwilling local virgin.It is love, not lust, that Richard makes to Mircalla outside the castle, and it is love that makes her hesitate long enough to take a burning stake in her bosom while she is being exorcised at the end. Richard then seeks rather too convenient refuge in the arms of the school's gym teacher (Suzanna Leigh, also a knockout) and what might have been the fatal passion of the century (19th, that is) settles down into another faculty romance.Despite many obvious lunacies, ""Lust for a Vampire,"" which was directed by Jimmy Sangster and written by one Tudor Gates, is not unaware of its conventional sources of vitality, the nice tension between desire and decomposition, the bracelet of bright flesh around the bone.Such kinds of awareness seem totally lacking in its co-feature, ""The Man Who Haunted Himself,"" a careful, potentially intelligent film by Basil Dearden and Michael Relph, that fails for lack of excitement in its own fiction. A split-identity story that falls somewhere between  and far below""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and ""William Wilson,"" the film deals with a London businessman (Roger Moore) who gradually comes to realize that somebody, apparently his exact double, is beginning to fill his place in his office, his club and his wife's bed  and is making rather a better job of it in the bargain.The manner of his realization depends largely upon the hero's personality, and since he is a man of regular, dull habits, the realization follows a regular, dull processwhich is finally the shape of the movie. Any number of directors might have found in this a logical development of terror, but Dearden has merely found in it a poorly developed logic, and nothing even partly interesting happens to enliven its progress.Roger Moore plays himself twice over with virtually no distinguishing characteristics. Olga Georges-Picot is attractive as the alter ego's mistress, and Hildegard Neil is lovely and even a bit distinguished as everybody's wife.",1971-09-04T05:00:00+0000

One must have a heart of stone not to laugh at her humiliations, all of them grotesquely pictured.Sold by her parentsas a mareto a miller to whom they are indebted, she finds true love when she runs away and meets an understanding poacher in the woods. Her later aspirations to win the affections of Count Olaudio result in her being incarcerated in a lunatic asylum and later being sent to work in a factory full of vibrating sewing machines. Events here run to a high sexual pitch.At this point a cry of ""Schifo""""Disgusting""  was heard in the auditorium. That set off a chorus of ""Basta""""Enough""and the rest of the film became inaudible, though it equaled its spectators in noisemaking. It concluded with most of the players being machine-gunned by the police.Not to be outdone, the movie's director, Tinto Brass, greeted the dissatified house with an obscene gesture when the house lights rose.""La Vacanza"" is probably the squawkiest of all talkies. Its dialogue in Venetian and Milanese dialects is accompanied by snare drums, bugle calls, nightwatchmen's whistles, agonized shouting and gunfire.The evening's second offering was the official showing of the Chinese film ""Red Detachment of Women,"" a ballet by the Peking Opera photographed in color. The dancers symbolized the militant spirit that prevailed among the women of the Red Army during the civil-war period (1927 to 1937). Maoist representatives, including Communist China's Ambassador to Italy, Shen Piuf, attended. The official showing passed without incident. It seemed anticlimactic after the clamor inspired by a native movie.",1971-09-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Swords of Death':Uchida Pits Samurai Against Able Foes,"""Swords of Death,"" which opened yesterday at the Bijou Cinema, is an incomplete film, its director, the veteran Tomu Uchida, having died before he finished shooting it. As it stands it is an interrupted anecdote, a private post-script to a part of the early career of one Musashi Miyamoto, the samurai hero of several Japanese movies. I don't know how ""Swords of Death"" might have ended, but I think it would have remained small-scale, a moral interlude in a life that is, like the lives of most epic heroes, commonly understood as historic necessity.In the film, Musashi (Kinnosuke Nakamura), hoping to extend his knowledge of the techniques of personal combat, visits the home of Baiken Shishido (Rentaro Mikuni), a bandit who has developed a highly unorthodox way of fighting with ball and chain in one hand and a small very sharp scythe in the other. Musashi first comes upon Baiken's wife (Hideko Okiyama), also adept in her husband's methods, training her baby not to fear the whirling iron ball or the cries of an advancing warrior.He spends a night with Baiken, and in the morning finds that his host is in fact an enemy, sworn to avenge a brother-in-law whom Musashi had killed in battle. So begins a fight involving Musashi and the warlike husband and wife, and even the little baby, that is long and intensely interesting, and unfinished when the movie ends.When the movie does end, it ends in a freeze frame, a device that it uses often before it ends, in order to stop the action and allow time for a brief monologue. The device may have been Uchida's, or it may have been added to the uncompleted footage, but in ""Swords of Death"" it seems a reasonable addition to an esthetic that uses the mist for magic, equates fire with rage, and literally transforms its bandit's face into a demonic mask when he decides to put a dead man's honor above his son's life.Such simple, almost crudely direct ways of making a point seem very much in keeping with the meaning of ""Swords of Death,"" which takes at times the imaginative license of folk tale or of the lesser adventures in Spenser's ""Faerie Queene."" Baiken might be some human relation to the iron man Talus, or a veritable allegory of anger, in Rentaro Mikuni's violent characterization. And as his wife, Hideko Okiyama projects fierce loyalty or love by turns, as if each emotion had for its time taken possession of her. These are fascinating performances not simply for themselves but because they help build another worldin which wishes are stronger, responses are simpler, dangers more immediate, and perception cleared for an education that proceeds not by subtle argument but by force of feeling.",1971-09-08T05:00:00+0000

Cheap thrills, to be sure, but thrills nonetheless and everything in the rest of the movie encourages us to value small favors. Attempting on the one hand to mean something and on the other hand trying to crank up the terror, Fleischer keeps suggesting confrontations between the rich and the poor, the old and the young, families with daughters to protect and men with warped desires. See No Evil is better with its mindless terror than with its witless meaning., And although everything becomes far too much long before it is over, the movie is generally at its most ridiculous precisely where it hopes to makes sense.

It also implied that Lime Rock is unique in running short races with an interesting variety of cars. All roadracing circuits (as opposed to oval tracks) book as many of this kind of event as they can to help fill out their calendars between professional races. Not only the Sports Car Club of America but also the Eastern Motor Racing Association put, on many such racing days every year. The E.M.R.A., in fact, has stopped using Lime Rock because of oppressive local ordinances requiring mufflers on racecars in most nonprofessional events there.

us,Jimi Plays Berkeley' At Garrick,"""Jimi Plays Berkeley,"" which opened at the Garrick Theater yesterday, is a 55-minute film record of portions of the late Jimi Hendrix's 1970 Memorial Day concert at Berkeley, Calif.According to these cameras, which may be lying in spite of themselves, the Berkeley performance never attained the freaky, controlled intoxication of those recorded in both ""Monterey Pop"" and ""Woodstock."" It's not that the star of ""Jimi Plays Berkeley"" is unnaturally subdued. He's all therealternately seducing his electric guitar, as if it were a thing to be persuaded, and then threatening forced entry, all the while belting out some of his best numbers, including his Day-Glo version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and the almost autumnal ""I Don't Live Today"" (Will I live tomorrow?/Well I just can't say. . . ."").It's not the star but the movie that looks somehow pale and small and mild, which is, I suspect, what happens when more or less conventional concert film techniques (quick zooms into and out of close-ups, lots of dim profile shots) are applied without particular thought to what is being done/said/sung by the subject being photographed. Also, the sound quality, at least at the Garrick yesterday, is not of the first order.Spliced into the concert material are snippets of interviews with not especially articulate Hendrix associates and fans (""He wants to communicate as a person, not as an idol""), as well as some Berkeley student-riot footage, which, I suppose, the filmmakers have used to establish the locale, as gondolas would, most likely, establish Venice.Also on the program is a terrible 25-minute short from the Netherlands, ""Rainbow,"" a sort of Contemporary Dutch Expressionist interpretation of the Rolling Stones' ""She's a Rainbow,"" which is heard on the soundtrack.

Valeria, as if in a dream, asks the waiter. Replies the waiter, with a straight face: ""Spaghetti with meat sauce, spaghetti with clam sauce, spaghetti with. . . .""

us,Been Down So Long' on Film,"Richard Faria's first and last novel, ""Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me,"" begins in the fall of 1958, the autumn of the Eisenhower years, a time of Vanguard rockets and Murray the K and Batista, of Dharma Bums who took to the road to learn about life and then celebrated what they found in literature that Truman Capote once classified as mere typewriting.""Been Down So Long,"" however, was written in the 1960's (it was published in 1966, shortly before its author was killed in a motorcycle accident), and although set in the time of the Beats, it has the sound and feel of the decade that was yet to come. This explains, I think, something of the schizoid nature of the film adaptation that opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie.Gnossos Pappadopoulis (Barry Primus) has, it's true, been on the road when he returns to college to resume his academic career, but from the length of his hair and the rhythm of his speech, he's been mushing through the America that the men in ""Easy Rider"" could not find, not through Kerouac country. As a matter of fact, the unnamed school that Gnossos attends could well be the locale of a number of other movies about the late 1960's, including Jack Nicholson's ""Drive, He Said.""All of this would be nitpicking if ""Been Down So Long"" had any particular identity of its own. It doesn't. Robert Schlitt, who wrote the screen adaptation, and Jeff Young, who directed it, have excised practically all of the novel's lunatic, literary exuberance. What remains is a rite-of-university-passage of sophomoric angst, of dumb melodrama, and of such depressing familiarity that I feel as if I'd been burdened with someone else's memory, while having been denied the pleasure of the original experience.The young performers are attractive and, when occasionally given the opportunity (especially for comedy), they do very well indeed. Primus has a short but marvelous sequence in which he disrupts a fraternity rush (one of the few sequences that really fix the film in its time) by accusing a shorthaired ""brother"" of homosexual tendencies.I also liked David Downing, as a black student who turns, rather gently, toward militancy, and Linda DeCoff, as the virginal co-ed whose farewell gift to Gnossos requires treatment with penicillin. ""Bringing this to Havana,"" says the Cuban doctor to Gnossos, ""is like bringing bread to a bakery."" He is, of course, talking about the Havana of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Pierre, not of Castro.",1971-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,A Brazilian Youth's Joys and Shocks:' Plantation Boy' Opens at 5th Ave. Cinema Benjamin Proves Deft Comic in 'The Steagle',"Cinema Novo, the Brazilian moviemaking movement dedicated to a re-examination of, if not an outright break with, their film Establishment, is generally complimented by ""The Plantation Boy,"" which began a two-day stand yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.As a remembrance of pleasant things past and auguries of a sadder future, it is a bittersweet blend of a somewhat disjointed memoir of a boy's joys and shocks and an oblique reflection on a benign, autocratic, landed society being pushed toward mechanization.Walter Lima Jr., who wrote the script and made his feature directorial debut with ""Plantation Boy"" in 1965, shot his film in Paraimba, in rural north Brazil, which, to all appearances, must look like the 1920 sugar plantation setting of the original.While he has not extracted towering performances from his principals, most of his cast, especially the titular hero, his grandfather and owner of the plantation, and the boy's aunt and uncle, are natural in their reactions to the serious and rare lighter episodes in the drama.Carlinho, the boy sent to the plantation after his mother has died, is exposed to a world he never knew including a variety of relatives, the mechanics of the plantation, a rural school, a young aunt he loves dearly whom he loses when she marries; a pet lamb he loses to the butcher; the death of a young cousin; a Negro farmhand literally put in stocks for refusing to marry a girl who says he violated her; his doting grandfather proud of his acres but aware that prompters for a refinery are closing in and the frolics at a sylvan pool with a visiting young girl.Savio Rollm, a dark-haired, introspective youngster who plays Carlinho with subdued sincerity, gives credibility to these varied vignettes, including a tearful farewell as he leaves the scenes of his childhood for school. Rodolfo Arena portrays his grandfather, an austere gentleman with cane and a straw sombrero, to the manner born. Anecy Rocha is properly affectionate as his aunt and Geraldo Del Rey, as his uncle, does well by a changing character as he is smitten by an unrequited love and the desire for industrialization.If ""Plantation Boy"" merely hints at outlaws who sometimes preyed on these tracts a half-century ago, ""Memories of the Cangaco,"" the documentary on the bill, also made in 1965, focuses on these bands, their leaders and pursuers. Authentic old and new footage underlines that they were either brigands or peasant Robin Hoods in rebellion against the army and the police in a strange record that is hardly the touching matter that ""Plantation Boy"" is. With literal English subtitles for the Portuguese dialogue, the tandem does, however, give us a sharp view of hitherto largely vague people and places.",1971-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Cassel, who has been an excellent comedian in the films of De Broca, is the mild-mannered cellist whose ancient Renault one day bump into her Rolls thereby prompting the kind of courtship that only the talent of the late Ernst Lubitsch might have elevated into fabulous farce.In effect, she chases him until he catches her, but the maneuverings are mostly the tactics of coy moviemaking here involving several awful child actors, windshield wipers that comment on the action, a huge but gentle dog, a Siamese cat named Prudhomme, and endless little rages between the lovers that define their real affection.Several years ago, Deville made ""Benjamin,"" in which his appreciation for the classic comedy of manners was charmingly apparent, Charm is the ingredient that is in singularly short supply in ""The Bear and the Doll,"" largely, I suspect, because Miss Bardot, once a sex kitten, now approaches middle age with all of the grace of a seasoned predator.The film, which is in French with English subtitles, opened yesterday at the Paris.",1971-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"'A Young Couple,' French Film, Opens at the Trans-Lux East","While it hardly arrives at startling or incisive answers, ""A Young Couple"" makes it abundantly clear that even in France love's young dream can eventually become a good deal less than idyllic.But it must be stressed that the ""couple"" are not caricatures and that they and their exploded dream have been exposed with compassion and tenderness even if Ren Gainville, the director, his screenwriter and his principals have not developed an especially trenchant drama in the French film that opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East.Gainsville has pointedly focused on nuances that are generally effective in clothing the bare bones of a basically simple plot. The ecstasy of the couple's Athenian honeymoon begins, almost imperceptibly, to diminish as they visit the young husband's folks in the Loire region. It fades further as Veronique, the pregnant bride, has to settle for an apartment a good deal simpler than the posh places she and her chic, gadabout friend, Ariane, would like.Their young daughter's upbringing adds to the miseries of Veronique and her adoring mate, Gilles, whose love of his family is not matched by his restless wife, who envies the rich, swinging life of Ariane and her husband, and pines for something more than wifely duties. Veronique, it evolves, is not out of love so much as she is terrified of not tasting life's joys as soon as possible.""We have only one life and it passes too quickly,"" she notes anxiously and adds, flatly, ""these days we can't live only for our children.""Gilles is no simpleton, but merely helpless as he continues to love his wife, now headed for an imminent divorce and a liaison with a rich playboy despite her obvious, deep affection for the man she is leaving.As Gilles, Alan Libolt, a dark-haired, willowy type facially reminiscent of Jean-Louis Barrault, is impressive in a subdued characterization that projects his confusion and anguish. Anna Gael, the curvaceous blonde beauty, who has literally been exposed in a variety of flesh epics, such as ""Thrse and Isabelle"" and ""Nana,"" is revealed here as a fairly sensitive type in the rose of Veronique. She is neither flighty nor lascivious but all too human and young in a predicament she simply cannot handle. And Anny Duperey and Jean-Franoise Calve, as her properly chic and one-dimensional rich friends, head an efficient supporting cast.Perhaps this ""Young Couple"" should never have married in the first place. But director Ren Gainville, a newcomer here if memory serves, makes them, their coterie and their simple, sad saga credible and occasionally touching.",1971-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Passionate Story of a Bandit:'Augusto Matraga' Is at 5th Avenue Cinema Movie From Brazil by Santos Arrives,"Roberto Santos's ""The Hour and Turn of Augusto Matraga"" (Hora E Vez De Augusto Matraga), which opened yesterday as part of the Fifth Avenue Cinema's retrospective devoted to Brazil's Cinema Novo, seems, on its surface, to be one of the least revolutionary films to come out of that revolutionary film movement.Only by its uncompromised passion and by its almost romantic appreciation for the landscapes and characters and attitudes that are unique to the bleak, rural regions of northern Brazil can it be identified as one of those socially concerned Brazilian films, made in the nineteen-sixties, in a wave of protest against the commercialized Brazilian cinema.""The Hour and Turn of Augusto Matraga,"" based on a popular Brazilian novel I haven't read, reflects a universe in which the rewards and punishments are doled out in a decidedly pre-Marxian manner. Augusto Matraga is a very bad man, a farmer who likes to terrorize the countryside just for the hell of it, who treats his wife like a servant, and who rapes a virgin and then murders three members of her family when they object.He is, in fact, so spectacularly evil that his sudden repentanceafter he has been beaten up and branded and left for dead by an outraged citizenry  can only be accepted as a poetic truth. Nursed back to health by an old black couple whose barren lives are devoted to Christ, Augusto vows to live in peace and poverty until, as he has been promised by a priest, his hour will come. The hour that comes (the priest has told him, with an absolutely straight face, that every dog has his day) permits Augusto to certify his conversion in a duel to the death with a bandit chief, who is, perhaps, the only man he has ever loved.Like some of the later later Cinema Novo films (I'm thinking of Glauber Rocha's ""Antonio Das Mortes""), ""The Hour and Turn of Augusto Matraga,"" which was made five years ago, has the narrative symmetry of a folk ballad, but it is told without the flamboyant fantasy, the self-conscious surrealism and what one critic has called the ""Third World humor"" of the more recent, so called ""tropicalist"" Cinema Novo films. (Third World humor, I've found, is more often firmly committed than funny.)Maybe because I saw it at the end of a week that has been notable for the unrelieved insipidity of the new films, I found myself responding to and being moved by ""The Hour and Turn of Augusto Matraga,"" by its humanistic concerns, by its order and by its conviction that the most squalid spirit  mean movie critics as well as mean farmers, I assumecan stand in hope of redemption.In view of all the passion expended, Santos has obtained some remarkably restrained and effective performances from his cast, particularly from Leonardo Vilar, as Augusto, and Jofre Soares, who looks enough like Nick Ray to be his brother, as the quite genial bandit chief. Aside from a fondness for skies photographed through filters that turn clouds into cotton balls, Santos never imposes on the production the sort of picturesque sensibility that, in some other Cinema Nova films, looks like condescension.""The Hour and Turn of Augusto Matraga"" belongs, in its style and spirit, anyway, to the early days of the Cinema Novo, which now, I'm told, has been effectively destroyed by the various Brazilian Government and film-industry elements. This film is decent evidence of the talent and the enthusiasm that, for a short time, made Brazil a very exciting place to make movies in.",1971-09-18T05:00:00+0000

The scrub writers of that moment could scarcely offer a fiction to the reader without a full complement of dwarfs and religious maniacs. The seats of Pullman cars itched cancerously; heroines had extraordinary moonlike faces; Arabs ran off with one's wife; and jockeys with small, vulpine heads and ancient racing silks scuttled through a landscape that was not quite of this world. It was an age of the grotesque when readers of Alfred Chester salivated for pus; when Norman Mailer was prominently between publishers; and when one read aloud from Djuna Barnes with a sense of historical mission. But there was a varsity too; and of that crew, John Hawkes wrote a fiction that was less doctrinaire dark than it was truly hallucinatory; and absolutely no one comes to mind who could so well arrest that perpetually terrified portion of the inner mind with unnerving images of things going to pieces.",1971-09-19T05:00:00+0000

However, I write not to complain about the innocent thoughtless but to suggest a modest proposal to the airlines. Since it appears impracticable to arrange isolated smoking areas in planes, why not schedule some proportion of flights for nonsmokers only? On New York to Chicago flights, for example, make onefifth or onequarter of them nonsmoking. I suspect that these flights would be mobbed. Where two airlines compete, the first to offer a respite from the equivalent of rotten eggs and sulphuric acid mist I believe, enjoy a profitenhancing boost in the percentage of occupied seats. In any event, why don't planes catch up with bases in the eighth decade of the 20th century? Hasn't the time come for a rigid ban on pipes and cigars on all aircraft?",1971-09-19T05:00:00+0000

It has none of the verbal gesticulation and manic inclusiveness that are so often used to express the style and panic of this generation instead of communicating its experience; nor does it try to deal directly with politics, drugs and the war (subjects which may require a War and Peace of their own), though these things are felt as potent, shadowy absences, the novel's barely spoken premise. Rather, it is about ordinary life lived in their shadow and lived much as usual, though somewhat at a loss, in the peculiar limbo of the late sixties.

us,"' You've Got to Walk It . . .,' Genial Put-Down of Establishment","As a genial put-down of the Establishment, ""You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat,"" which landed at the Cinema Malibu and the Cinema Village yesterday, is the latest example of youthful, charming iconoclasm that appears to be losing some of its charm. As the first feature of writer-director-producer Peter Locke, who shot it all here in fine color about two years ago at the age of 27, its heart is in the right place, but it does very little more than make charming jokes about the serious problems it zanily illustrates.Of course, Mr. Locke isn't trying to be a polemicist. It's obvious he's kidding, and it's equally clear that he and his associates were up to their ears in ideas that were tossed, seemingly willy-nilly, before the camera in gross lots. The results are sporadically comic and only rarely trenchant or meaningful.Meaningful is precisely the word Mr. Locke is stressing in spinning the wacky saga of Carter Fields, his young, confused middle-class hero, who's anxious to achieve a ""meaningful"" career but is judged a freaked-out flop by his girl and a succession of far-out characters he encounters in his quest.In tilting against the windmills of the Establishment he is exposed to a variety of traumas, among them, his doting mother, a fat, black girl, a crazy old lady, the Puerto Rican minority municipal madness in the form of a new job ferreting out ""revolutionaries"" supposedly out to bomb our highways; group therapy; Madison Avenue advertising; Women's Lib; abortion, and even unrewarding marriage and fatherhood.A lot, as noted, does happeneven if it is disjointedwith the aid of explicit and ""in"" dialogue, off-screen narration and subtitles. And, Mr. Locke is partial to more than a few gross sequences, some of which are funny, such as the one involving Richard Pryor, the TV and nightclub comic, who plays a gibbering lush in a men's room.Zalman King, who has been featured on TV's ""The Young Lawyers,"" makes a credible nebbish as the naive Carter Fields. Allen Garfield is crazily apoplectic as a group therapy fiend. Robert Downey, a director and writer who neatly dissected advertising tastemakers in ""Putney Swope,"" does a nutty bit as a doubletalking ad executive. Suzette Green, as the pretty heroine, and Paula Frankle, are among the lasses who add to his confusion and sex education. They all seem to be trying to be meaningful.But as a free-swinging lampoon, ""You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat"" projects lots of walking and talking but precious little heartfelt beat, despite its willing cast and a plethora of sight gags and surface philosophies.",1971-09-20T05:00:00+0000

From his two tones of tan, it looks very much as if he's recently been wearing jeans. This is not the major failure of ""Glen and Randa,"" or even a failure at all, only an indication of how one mind wandered during this week's end-of-the-world movie, which is as solemn and sincere and, I'm afraid, as unprovocative as most newspaper editorials calling for an end to the arms race.""Glen and Randa,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, is not actually about the arms race or even about the annihilation of civilization, which have provided lively material for everyone from George Pal and Stanley Kubrick to dozens of Japanese moviemakers.Jim McBride, the director and co-author of the screenplay, is, instead, concerned with the nature of man, his curiosity, his impulse towards knowledge and his compulsion to impose his own order on the universe, which, as far as I can make out from the film (as well as from some remarks made by McBride in an interview), otherwise exists in some sort of moral harmony.McBride, unfortunately, is a good deal more interesting as a moviemaker than as a philosopher, with the result that his movies have a tendency to look as if they mean a lot more than they really do. His first and, to my way of thinking, his best film, ""David Holzman's Diary,"" was a tough and amusing put-on of cinma vrit, about a man whose manic search for truth-on-film prompts him to photograph his own life, which ultimately leads to his complete alienation from it.In ""Glen and Randa,"" Glen's search for the mysterious city, which he has seen pictured in an old Wonder Woman comic book, is not unlike David Holzman's search for truth. It is, I suppose, both tragic and ironic, but it is dramatized in such simplistic terms that I, for one, noticed things like suntans and the fact that Glen can read well enough to pronounce ""Shazaam!"" correctly though he has seemingly never heard of gasoline.Glen also has a habit of philosophizing in a manner that might be called 20th-Century Cute. When he and Randa find themselves sitting in an ancient car high in a tree (which I assume was a mere sapling when The Bomb went off), he is likely to say: ""Maybe cars become trees the way leaves become butterflies."" And everything, I should add, eventually becomes dust.I rather like the way the film eschews dramatic climaxes, as if reflecting the barrenness of the emotional lives of Glen and Randa, but this leads to an awful monotony that neither the meaning of the film nor the performances can relieve.Shelley Plimpton (""Alice's Restaurant,"" ""Putney Swope"") is dear and sweet and pale as Randa, who would prefer to settle into a nice, floor-through cave, instead of lurching off to find Metropolis. Steven Curry's Glen looks like a former cast member of ""Hair"" (which Curry is). In his interpretation, however, innocence is pretty much equated with the mannerisms of an inexperienced actor.The cast also includes Woodrow Chamblis, as a gentle, fuzzy-headed old man, whom Glen and Randa find living with his wife's skeleton in a trailer near Boise, which now has a coastline like that formerly at Big Sur, and Garry Goodrow, as an aging medicine man who remembers enough of the old world still to be able to quote Keats and to swindle other survivors out of any gold, silver and jewels they might possess.""Glen and Randa"" is neither a successful nor an entertaining movie, but it is sober, and what mind it has is high. Thus I'm completely mystified by the X rating that has been attached to it, apparently because of its nudity and love-making. They might be thought obscene only by stretching a censor's imagination.",1971-09-20T05:00:00+0000

In ""The Deceased"" (""A Falecida""), which began a two-day run yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, the director, Leon Hirszman, is, on the surface, something of a neorealist.The landscapean impoverished suburb of Rio de Janeirois bleak, and the people are depressed, economically and psychologically. The director accentuates the somberness by placing scenes in dimly lit, dismally furnished kitchens and bedrooms, in funeral parlors and pool rooms. Almost everything in the film seems dark gray, sometimes so dark that faces are obscured.In keeping with the tonealthough this may be the fault of a poor printthe editing seems choppy, the sound occasionally muffled. The actors look like peopleunglamorous, seemingly plucked right off the street, in some cases filmed right on the street. The acting, with the exception of Fernanda Montenegro in the lead, is artless and in some instances awkward. Miss Montenegro is clearly an actress, though in a few places she overacts. In one scene she stands in the rain tearfully and joyfully embracing the raindrops as the director overdirects, spinning his camera around her like a top.But in side glimpses one gets a feeling of the threadbare life, the hopelessness of the day-to-day existence. The theme of the movie is death  one woman's obsession with death and how she self-wills herself toward it.The principals are an unemployed football fan (Ivan Candido) and his wife (Miss Montenegro) who is going crazyor who already may be crazy. She consults a fortune teller, who warns her to beware of a blond woman, whom she decides is her cousin, a neighbor. She becomes compulsively preoccupied with the cousin, whom we see only fleetingly.The wife behaves frigidly toward her husband, but at a revival meeting in a public park she ""receives"" Christ with a passion that is positively sensual and later she allows a fast-talking coffin salesman to flirt with her (she is convinced she is going to die and is making plans for her own very expensive funeral). At one point she demands that her husband have an affair with the cousin. Later she gleefully tells him the cousin has cancer. It is obvious, except to the other characters in the movie, that there is something seriously and sexually wrong with this lady.The root of her problem is an affair she had with a big bus and taxi tycoon. In a flashback we see their first meeting. While having ice cream with her husband in a tearoom, she goes to the ladies room, and upon exiting she meets the tycoon. Love suddenly blooms and in five minutes somewhere in the neighborhood of the ladies room, in partial view of the camera (the movie is very discreet), the passion is consummated, while the husband finishes his ice cream.This is all as ridiculous as it sounds. One might tend to shift some of the blame from the director to the screenwriter except that Hirszman is one of the three screenwriters. ""The Deceased"" was made in 1965 when Hirszman was 27. One hopes that since then his cinema has become more novo.",1971-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Bravo Guerreiro' Bows,"There is no doubt about where some of the directors of Brazil's revolutionary Cinema Novo stand. Gustavo Dahl's passionate manifesto, ""O Bravo Guerreiro,"" which opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema yesterday, shouts out bravely, if stridently, against the callousness of entrenched politicos, social and political inequities and the despair felt by the working class.While there are no viable arguments against his pleas for justice, Dahl, who is in his early thirties and made ""O Bravo Guerreiro"" as his first feature about two years ago, is more concerned with the imagery of words and speeches then in full character analysis or action. His courageous, tragic young hero, as well as his friends and enemies, turn out, unfortunately, to be figures of speech literally rather than of men under terrible stress.In essence, Dahl's ""Brave Warrior,"" played intensely, if glumly, by the dark-haired, lanky, mustachioed Paulo Cesar Pareio, is a radical lawyer-union official-Congressman torn between his ideals and the compromises of practical politics. A switch from his radical party to the all-powerful national party, following the advice of Mario Lago, an old, experienced legislator, does not, however, result in victory.His fellow-unionists relay word that his congressional colleagues have warped his enlightened bills against him and the unionists and his chances of helping the oppressed go glimmering. There is also a break with his wife who has discovered a moment of infidelity and, in a climactic, fiery union meeting, he both quiets and impresses the assemblage with his forthright credos and the fact that he has failed them.Dahl ends it all on a note of impending doom as his lost crusader holds a gun to his mouth. But Dahl's largely static scenes, including the last one, merely emphasize, despite the complex machinations, his social and political stands through torrents of words. His integrity and potential cannot be faulted. The ills he relates in Portuguese are stark and disturbing but they are rarely moving or tragic as illustrated by ""O Brave Guerreiro"" despite its English subtitles.",1971-09-22T05:00:00+0000

There is little that's magnificent in ""Adios Sabata"" other than the scenery, which obviously isn't man made.""There's too much violence in the world,"" a local priest remarks sadly at the opening of the explosive festivities in ""Adios Sabata."" So, immediately thereafter, it's mostly shooting and gore, as Brynner, the soldier of fortune on the side of the revolutionaries striving to free Mexico from the yoke of Emperor Maximilian in 1867, goes after Colonel Skimmel, the Austrian bad guy, and his assorted connivers.There's nothing really historic or notable here except for the fact that Colonel Skimmel, a vicious blond dastard with muttonchop whiskers favored by Maximilian, is ready to take off with a hogshead full of gold dust that our good hombres led by Brynner want for obvious reasons.On second thought, the reasons turn out to be somewhat less than obvious since Brynner and the revolutionaries are afflicted by avarice, which makes the going just that much dustier.In any event, Brynner, a cool operator, is unusual in that he works with a gold-plated, sawed-off, repeating rifle that contains several shells and a cigar that our hero calmly puffs after each murderous fusillade.His unusual sidekicks include Dean Reed, a young, handsome American artist who appears to be working both sides of the struggle; Sal Borgese, a mute who can dispatch an adversary by flipping balls at them with his feet, and Joseph Persuad, a gypsy who goes into a flamenco stomp before each kill. It should be mentioned that Brynner and Reed do a four-handed piano rendition of a Schubert piece too. Incidentally, no one gets the gold and despite these strange talents it's a pleasure to say ""Adios Sabata.""",1971-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Desperate Couple:MacLaine and Mars Star in Gilroy Work,"If there were such things as urban renewal projects for people, then Sophie and Otto Bentwood (Shirley MacLaine and Kenneth Mars), a couple approaching lovelessness and middle age on the outskirts of Brooklyn Heights, would be likely prospects for immediate aid.Otto is a well-to-do lawyer and Sophie is an occasional translator of books, but their emotional lives are run down and scarred as their renovated brownstone is handsome and spruce. They are childless, middle-class city dwellers, coming apart in a world whose problems have grown beyond the liberal's capacity to comprehend, much less solve.The time of ""Desperate Characters"" is now, and it could be taking place just a year or two before Jules Feiffer's ""Little Murders."" In the vision of Frank D. Gilroy, who produced and directed the film, as well as adapted Paula Fox's novel, New York is still functioning, but all of the omens are bad.When Sophie feeds a stray cat, it bites her and for several days she's threatened with a series of rabies shots. Otto, contemptuous of his law partner, who specializes in needy cases, is, nevertheless, a guiltily easy mark for a fast-talking, black chizzler, who insinuates himself into the house to use the telephone and then walks out with a nonrepayable $10 loan.The subways they ride are inhabited by two kinds of people, those who talk to themselves and those who pretend not to notice. The streets are boobytrapped with garbage and dog excrement and drunks who might be stiffs. There's an obscene phone call, a rock tossed through a window and a depressing visit with Leon, an English professor who won't eat in the cafeteria because he's afraid someone will slip a little acid into his soup.I describe all of this at some length because it reflects the quality of the film itself, which is full of the details of urban desperation, painfully and accurately observed at eyelevel, without exploitation or condescension. Yet I must confess that ""Desperate Characters"" left me, if not unmoved, then unenriched. It's as if its cheerlessness had been bottled straight, without the additive that transforms recognizable experience into art.I've not read Miss Fox's novel, but I've been told that Gilroy's adaptation is a model of fidelity, even to careful inconclusiveness with which it treats the future of the Bentwood mariage. In every respect, the screenplay is a vast improvement over Gilroy's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""The Subject Was Roses."" Its literary style, however, is similar, and it's a style to which I, for one reason or another, find it difficult to respond.His characters talk in great chunks of theatrical exchanges, and monologues, which not only deny the splendid accuracy of the situations and the settings, but also somehow make me suspicious of the integrity of the characters. This is especially true of the supporting characters, who are always telling us too much, remembering too many details out of the past, nudging us for sympathy and never letting us discover them at our own speed.In drama, as in real life, people have to earn the right to bestow confidences, as well as to receive them. There is a dramatic license for just about everything, including Gilroy's style of theater, a style that I associate with the more serious television writing of the 1950's. It is not, however, for me.Perhaps because they have more time on screen, and are less pressed to make their points quickly, the stars of the film come off best, which is not always the case in movies with lots of little character-specialty numbers. I have nothing but admiration for both Miss MacLaine, who seems to be as sweet and appealing as a woman at the end of her rope can be, and Mars, whose denseness and cruelty are obviously the eroded remains of decency.""Desperate Characters,"" which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, marks Gilroy's debut as a film director, and I have a feeling that the director has perfectly served the writer. That is to say that Gilroy has realized the movie he intended to make. I wish I liked it more.",1971-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Mailer's 'Maidstone' Opens Whitney Series,"In a foreword to the Signet paperback version of ""Maidstone,"" which is actually a transcription of the screenplay as improvised by the actors, Norman Mailer sounds very much as if he's become a prisoner of the sort of fantasies that keep alive the hopes of all conventional, money-grubbing movie producers.He reports that audiences for the film, which is his third, said either ""Sensational"" or ""It stinks."" Every showman, no matter what the height of his brow, fears general apathy more than critical assassination.The truth of the matter is that ""Maidstone"" is a very mixed bag, and were it not the work of one of our most brilliant writers, and had it not prompted Mailer to write an intense essay (""A Course in Film-making""), it would be very easy to be apathetic about it.Judged simply as a movie, ""Maidstone"" marks an abrupt decline from ""Beyond the Law,"" Mailer's highly entertaining second film, as well as from ""Ocean's II,"" ""Sergeants Three"" and all those that Frank Sinatra made with his rat pack in the early 1960's.However, seen as part of the Mailer continuum, ""Maidstone"" is a sometimes hilarious, often boring but always adventurous ego trip, a very expensive, 110-minute home movie that has been edited, rather fancily, out of something like 45 hours of original footage. That, in turn, prompts the thought that almost anybody should be able to get 110 minutes of something out of 45 hours of anything, even if it's simply the filmed record of a chic, chaotic, seven-day brawl in East Hampton, which is the raw, not-so-base material of ""Maidstone.""Mailer conceived the film as a giant, multileveled improvisation, involving 100 or so friends and professionals, which would try to capture a new kind of cinematic truth and purity by letting his actors go where they would once the original premise had been presented to them. The premise, in fact, is just nutty enough to be brilliant:Norman T. Kingsley (Mailer), a notorious film director (modestly compared to Bufiuel, Fellini, Dreyer and Antonioni) who is making a spoof of ""Belle de Jour"" on eastern Long Island, is being considered as a Presidential candidate. In the course of his production, he is visited by various delegations, interviewed by television, profiled by associates and the object of an assassination attempt that may or may not be the work of his brother, played by Rip Torn, who has been given the name of Raoul, apparently to add still another association between Norman T. Kingsley and various authority figures.That's the way the movie began, but, sadly, Mailer's huge cast didn't seem to improvise as well on-camera as they reportedly did off. The whole thing was becoming a disaster of the order of a rained-out Boy Scout picnic until, on the last day of shooting, Rip Torn improvised an attack on Mailer-Kingsley with a toy hammer that turned into a real fight. As the two men fought (Mailer's choppers neatly clamped on Torn's ear, drawing blood), Beverly Bentley (Mrs. Mailer) and the Mailer children screamed hysterically, and the cameras continued to roll.The result is a very mysterious scene that is more than just a close-up of the author-at-play. At one moment Mailer is shouting about trust betrayed, which is one of his most seductive themes, and in the next he is saying that he'll never forgive Torn for having, in effect, made a fool of him in front of his children. It's complex and dense and very much in keeping with what a major author is required to give his public in this era of Total Revelation.Nothing else in ""Maidstone"" is as interesting, not the satire of the news media, not the soft-core sex scenes, not Mailer's put-downs of actresses auditioning for Norman T. Kingsley (""You may be extraordinarily talented, for all I know, but I think you're a dumbo""), not even Mailer's flights of fancy about politics, Presidents, blacks and whatnots.The movie, which is pretty to look at, doesn't make a great deal of sense, just because Mailer, during production, refused to exercise the discipline that he more or less ridicules in his search for higher truth. ""Beyond the Law,"" made on the same principle, worked quite happily, but the scope was smaller and its confrontations (between cops and crooks) were clearly defined from the beginning.The screenplay for ""Maidstone"" is worth reading, however, not only because Mailer can be an incomparable word man, but also because his stage directions amount to criticisms of everything the film doesn't succeed in doing, as when Mailer tells us or, rather, he orders us: ""The mind of the audience must now work to establish some separate levels of reality. But the levels seem to insist on coalescing with one another . . ."" Truer words were never written after a fact.Only because ""Maidstone"" is Mailer, I wouldn't have missed it. The film opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum to start the new fall series devoted to American moviemakers. It will be shown for the next two weeks, every day except Thursday, at 12, 2 and 4 P.M., and Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 6 and 8.",1971-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Three Friends and a Girl in Rio:'The Big City' Opens at 5th Avenue Cinema Plot, a Simple One, Is More Like a Fable","Carlos Diegues's ""The Big City"" (""A Grande Cidade"") opens with a travel-poster view of the harbor of Rio de Janeiro. A vibrant young black man named Calunga (Antonio Pilanga) bounds into the picture. He addresses the camera and extols his city, calling it among other encomiums an ""earthly paradise."" Since Calunga is bubbling with the enthusiasm of a clever confidence man, one senses immediately that in this example of Brazil's Cinema Novo we are in for an ironic tour of Rio.Calunga is a rogue who works if he has to, borrows when he wants to, and never pays back. He is soon bearding passersby and badgering them with questions, mostly about their waste of time. He smiles broadly, sings, dances and is thoroughly winning. He is all charm  and no villany.Calunga holds the movie together. He is the framework and ""The Big City"" is the tale he is telling. I wish he were the tale. The movie, according to a subtitle, is about ""the adventure and misadventures of Luzia and three friends""with Calunga only one of the three friends.Luzia (Anecy Rocha) is a country girl with a cardboard suitcase. She is freshly arrived in the city and looking for her lover, Jaso, who has left their hometown to make his living in Rio. Calunga flirts with her, teases her, takes her into protective custody. Where will she sleep? He welcomes her to a public park and with a grin declares, ""It's all yours.""As we soon discover, Jaso, a ""cowman"" (which I assume is the equivalent of cowboy), is a thief and a murderer, protecting himself  Hollywood-western stylewith two pistols. In spite of his villainy and her religiosity, Luzia is still drawn to him.When Jaso goes into hiding, Calunga is called upon to act as go-between, which he does with outward heartiness but an inward embarrassment. He is also attracted to the girl, as is his friend, Ignacio, a quiet construction worker (the third ""friend"").The plot is simple, like a fable. But underneath, the movie is complex, a philosophical morality play. Calunga is the poet and philosopher. ""The more you wait, the more you lose,"" he says  and live life to the fullest. To him, Rio is hell on earth  but who cares? He is scornful of heaven: too many people are waiting to get in.His great expansiveness and appetite for experience is reflected even in his walk. He strides through the pictureuntil the end when the walk suddenly becomes mechanical. He has been touched by the inevitable tragedy of the lovers.Jaso, on the other hand, by his own judgment has absolutely no control over his fate. He is destined to be a bad guy, and does nothing to gain himself a reprieve. Ignacio, the least developed of the characters, is merely wistful. He might have a life if only he could get out of the city and return to his roots.The contrast in characters and attitudes is interesting, but the basic storyline is banal and with its sometimes inflated dialogue the screenplay by Mr. Diegues and Leopoldo Serran does not measure up to the direction or the performances (the four leads are excellent). Even so, the movie is appealing and when Calunga dominates the screen, which he does whenever he is on screenit is quite pleasurable.The film began a two-day run yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.",1971-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen,"Felix Greene, the British cameraman-journalist-author, who gave us feature-length color close-ups of ""China!"" in 1965 and ""North Vietnam"" two years later, continues his role as a movie Marco Polo for the embattled Left in ""Cuba Va!"", his latest color documentary on a nation largely concealed by a ""curtain."" As in the previous cases, he illustrates a contented people, who admittedly haven't yet achieved their revolutionary goals but are, as the title translates, moving forward.Using some old black-and-white footage to stress the enrichment of the few wealthy, both local and foreign, and the deprivation of the masses of the poor and ignorant Latin Americans, Greene, who shot his color film over the last year or so, makes visual comparisons in generally calm and effective style.With Premier Fidel Castro appearing on a few occasions to explain that Cuban freedom could be achieved only by revolution after 400 years of foreign domination, the film's natural bias is apparent but not overpowering. It opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.The ""85 per cent"" illiteracy that existed 12 years ago when Castro ousted the former dictator, Fulgencio Batista, is given cheerful counterpoint by happy youngsters and adults receiving free education and instruction in trades in various immaculate up-to-date urban and rural schools. The admitted fact that did not meet its 10-million-ton sugar cane goal last year is offset by various scenes showing the harvesting of eight and a half million tons, a record crop.A viewer is fascinated by workers from other areas chipping in voluntarily to help with the cane, tobacco and other harvests; by a fine teachers college, medical school with many distaff students, and an especially modern psychiatric hospital near Havana; by an orchestra devoted to Western classics that is viewed, somewhat less favorably, than an excellent modern dance team working with native rhythms as another sign of Cuba's socialistic approach to the arts.One is impressed by younger composer-guitarists such as Silvio Rodriguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanes, whose fine voices extol their brave new world. And one assumes that Mr. Greene knows what he is talking about in noting that ""the cinemas are filled and a nightclub has to be booked weeks in advance.""One also get glimpses of modern highways being built and slums being razed and a climactic scene showing Cubans reacting forcefully in Havana demonstrations when their captive fishermen were freed by Americans last year. The over-all impression sought by Mr. Greene is a bright present and a brighter future. But despite his largely happy vistas, his ""Cuba Va!"" leaves a nagging feeling that it is only a partial view of current history that still desperately needs fuller explanations.Also on the bill is ""Reggae,"" a 60-minute documentary on Jamaican music filmed at a concert in London last year and intercut with observations on its origins and purposes. As an outgrowth of traditional African, calypso, rock, soul and blues, its beat is infectious.And, even though Mike Raven, a British disk jockey, explains that ""Reggae"" was the name of the first record label to feature that genre and that it is also a form of protest, it is basically an item for the buffs, who should appreciate it most.",1971-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Cometogether':Serene Tale of Actor and Tourists Bows,"""Cometogether,"" which opened yesterday at a theater near you if you live in a culturally depressed neighborhood, is an empty-headed, romantic movie about a young American actor in Rome who finds himself in a not unpleasant (quite serene, in fact) mnage  trois with two extremely pretty American tourists.Saul Swimmer, the director and co-author of the screenplay, seems to acknowledge that all of the possibilities of the situation (poetic, comic, psychological and pornographic) are simply beyond him, and so he spends most of his time photographing his three principals against travelogue scenery that has been wired with something like rock Muzak.He also, periodically, invokes images of death (a slow-motion automobile accident, a body being fished out of a Venetian canal, a Vietcong massacre of American P. O. W. 's), but they are as wan as the efforts of a small child who makes rude noises to give himself importance.Luciana Paluzzi, who is Italian, and Rosemary Dexter, who is British, play the two American tourists, speaking their lines with tiny, disembodied American voices that may not be entirely their own. They look so much alike, that I never did figure out which actress was playing which role. Such interchangeability in, say, a Truffaut film, would have to be interpreted as a psychic mystery. Here it's a casting goof.Tony Anthony, an American actor who has made a number of Westerns in Italy, plays the American actor, and he must be the least magnetic movie personality to come along since Frankie Vaughn, whom all of you lucky ones won't remember as Marilyn Monroe's secondary love interest in ""Let's Make Love.""",1971-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Black God, White Devil,' From Brazil","""Black God, White Devil,"" which opens a two-day stand today at the Fifth Avenue Cinema as the final offering in the retrospective of Brazil's revolutionary Cinema Novo, is, at once, one of the most visually effective and artistic examples of the work of Glauber Rocha, a leading light among Cinema Novo's young directors. But as a contemporary allegory fulminating darkly against miseries inflicted on the poor by landowners and the Government, it is more mystically stylized than moving.Rocha's dedication to a barbaric theme is obvious but his religious symbolism and floklore make for stark, strictly native drama to which it is hard to re-relate despite literal English subtitles for the Portuguese dialogue.The essentials of his plot are simple. Basically, he is relating, with the aid of off-screen troubadours (cantadores) the dual struggle of Manoel, an oppressed cowhand who seeks salvation as a devoted follower of Sebastian, a black, religious mystic, and then with Corisco, one of the last, fierce outlaws battling the landowners.His tragedy is, of course, unavoidable after he murders a rancher who has tried to rob him. Sebastian (personifying spiritual help) is killed by Manoel's patiently suffering wife, Rosa, and Corisco (the temporal savior) is ultimately dispatched by Antonio Das Mortes, the killer hired by the church and landowners.Rocha, it should be noted, made this, his second feature, in 1963 when he was 25 and his black-cloaked, dour executioner became the hero of the sequel, ""Antonio Das Mortes"" shown here last year.As Manoel, Gerardo Del Ray, is an authentically driven, illiterate and confused peasant for whom there is no salvation. Lydio Sylva and Othon Bastos, to whom he turns, emerge as strange, larger-than-life figures on a strange landscape, as does Mauririo Do Valle as Das Mortes.Rocha, it is apparent, is more concerned with his symbolism, injustices and the arid, sombre ""sertao"" of provincial Bahia in which he filmed, than in compelling characterization. His symbols are broodingly obvious parallels to Biblical events and his outlaws are theatrically savage.""The Earth belongs to man, not God or the Devil,"" Rocha proclaims climactically. And his film, like his credo, is simple, black-and-white, more arresting as a shocking polemic than as memorable drama.",1971-09-25T05:00:00+0000

A Iarge group of Puerto Ricans in gay holiday dress milled about the gloomy dance hall as loudspeakers wafted Latinrock rhythms into the neighboring apple orchards. An argument broke out among two athleticlooking men in starspangled Tshirts, a dark, pinstripesuited man with a straw hat, and a large, boisterous woman in a lowcut red dress. The two starspangled athletes began tugging at the woman's fleshy left arm, bickering in colorful Spanish, as the strawhatted man pulled energetically at her right arm. The woman, the hefty bone of their Solomonic contention, laughed up roariously, even as the top of her dress ripped at both ends. Suddenly four pa trol cars swooped down with lights flashing and sirens wailing. A tall, husky Puerto Rican policeman was the first to get out and step between the hostile parties. There was some fast Spanish banter back and forth, an ex change of backslaps, a few earthy cracks from the officer, more loud, gravelly laughter from the woman, and the three men settled their differences with a handshake and a Latin embrace. The officer led the woman away, his hand on her shoulder, as she laughed huskily and pinched his cheeks.",1971-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Even the Turks themselves awaited their coup de grce with a certain fatalistic immobilism; dismem berment at the hands of the Great Powers was neither unex pected nor shameful, after all. As it happened, Lloyd George, Clemenceau and Wilson con ceived the notion of blocking an unwarranted Italian intru sion into southwestern Turkey by landing a division of Greeks at Smyrna as a preemptive force.

us,The home american lifestyles,"America is undergoing its own brand of cultural revolution. A look at the American way of life points up a diversity of lifestyles that will become more and more pronounced, cautions Alvin Toffler in his current bestseller, Future Shock. And the home has displaced fashion and auto mobiles as the nation's status symbol. Some people search for excitement in architecture and furnishings, intent on making a 20thcentury statement for living. Others resist the frantic march of time, finding ideal surroundings in a nostalgic throwback to lessdisquieting times, as in the graciousness that still pervades the South (top right). But everywhere there is a greater appreciation of nature. Solariums and outdoor living areas like the one on the cover are a vital part of life in warm climates. Even indoors, an airy dining space like the one at right (second from top) indicates that the outdoors is not far away. Although the urban experience takes us headlong into futuristic interiors (second from bottom) that are well established in Europe and attempted with a degree of caution on our shores, the concept of delight in nature is equally strong in the cities. Urban folk find nature by fleeing the noise and pollution for a threeday respite in the country; thus vacation housing has given rise to new and exciting forms of architecture (bottom right). Houses forgo walls for screens of glass, catching the precious sun through adven turously placed skylights. Weekenders enjoy inhabiting a sculpture that not only shelters and protects, but also allows a communion with nature not permitted by other kinds of architectural design. Despite the tremors of future shock, the home is already displaying its adaptability to all of the diverse styles of the American of life.",1971-09-26T05:00:00+0000

They were built in the 13th century as a deliberate lure to draw pilgrims away from Jerusalem, which was then held by the Moslems. Probably bands of Christian refugees from Syria and Egypt, hearing word of King Lalibela's mountain hideout and sanctuary, worked their way south into his fold. Some among them would have been experienced stonecutters, willing to help with his grandiose building proj ect, working with crude iron picks, not with the assistance of angels as the legends say. King Lalibela was a great dreamer in other ways too: he supposed ly had the idea of diverting the Blue Nile to empty into the Indian Ocean and thus starve out the infidel in Egypt.

us,Trojan Women':Cacoyannis Presents a Star-Filled Drama,"""The Trojan Women,"" Michael Cacoyannis's not quite all-star film version of the Euripides lamentation on war specifically the Achaean's destruction of Troy after Helen took off with Paris, is the kind of movie that a lot of good people will feel called upon to praise for the fact of its having been made at all. The argument is that there simply aren't that many people around who won't rest until they put Euripides on film, and, after all, any Euripides-on-film is better than none.I'm not too sure, at least, as long as there are printed texts available and those occasional theatrical productions, such as the one Cacoyannis himself staged successfully at the Circle in the Square in 1963, that, without being terribly adventurous, still capture the power of what is essentially more of a ritual than a narrative drama.The film that Cacoyannis has made is not bad, but something that is somehow more offensive to anyone interested in the possibilities of movies to enrich and excite the mind. This ""Trojan Women"" is high-class mediocre. Cacoyannis has slightly trimmed the Edith Hamilton translation (the gods have been excised from the text), and added at least one hilarious exchange of dialogue for continuity's purposes (Herald: ""Tell Menelaus to come at once to the women's camp."" Soldier: ""What's up?"" Herald: ""They're after Helen's blood."")What's most disheartening, however, is that he has chosen a banal style that falls midway between the literal realism of the film's exterior landscapes and the poetic realism of the play's language. This is a confusion, I might add, that is further compounded by a series of casting coups that look like the remains of 30 years of Miss Universe contests.All of these women are good actresses, but their manners and methods are so different from one another that the effect of the drama, which should be that of one long, carefully orchestrated moan, is squeaky and Babel-like, as fragmented as the close-ups (mid-forehead to bridge-of-nose) with which Cacoyannis periodically studies the faces of his Spanish-looking chorus. (The movie was shot in Spain.)Katharine Hepburn, flinty New Englander that she is, plays old, gray-headed Hecuba, not so much like the defeated Queen of Troy she is supposed to be, but more like an apple grower's widow who weeps a lot.Hecuba is the center and the power of ""The Trojan Woman."" She is the mistress of the awful ceremonies that make up the drama, presiding helplessly but with almost pre-moral strength, over the horrors the Greeks have committed on her family, Troy and the human race.Miss Hepburn speaks most of her lines with small, elegant accents that have very little to do with epic grief, and only in her final confrontation with Helen, the one who has brought the ruin down upon them all, does her Hecuba suggest real depth and passion. Genevieve Bujold, the French-Canadian actress, is a more or less elfin Cassandra, which is not, however, the way I imagine her.In their own, very different ways, Vanessa Redgrave, as Andromache, and Irene Papas, as Helen, are quite interesting. Miss Redgrave is very English, but she is also an actress of such classic beauty, and classical authority, that she commands attention. So does Miss Papas, an actress I haven't always admired, but here her dark, ageless, almost masculine beauty gives real dimension to the role of the woman who was once the most beautiful in the world, and may still be.I suspect that Cacoyannis needs the limitations of the stage to give his work automatic discipline, to fix the focal point, which the movie never finds.On the stage, ""The Trojan Women"" takes place outside the Greek camp, with Troy in the background, but it is probably played most effectively against a minimum of scenery and props. In Cacoyannis's film, I never was sure where we were supposed to be, and since the film opens in such dense clouds of smoke, I was genuinely surprised when, at the end, Troy is finally set afire. I'd assumed it'd already burnt down.In spite of the fact that ""The Trojan Women"" is a kind of moving fresco, or frieze, which should be kept at a certain distance, Cacoyannis often uses his camera subjectively (most atrociously when it spirals to earth, as if it were in the body of the boy, Astyanax, being hurled to his death from a cliff.) The director, however, doesn't pursue any style long enough for it to become dominant. The result, like the accents of its leading ladies, is a confusion of compromises that tell you the plot, which is not important, but communicate hardly any of the exaltation, which is.""The Trojan Women"" opened last night at the Fine Arts Theater.",1971-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Satiric Documentary on Nixon:De Antonio's 'Millhouse' Is at the New Yorker,"The easiest way to describe Emile de Antonio's ""Millhouse"" is as a satiric documentary, but that's a bland, weasel-like definition for the exuberantly opinionated film form that de Antonio first used in ""Point of Order"" and then pursued, with somewhat less dramatic results, in ""Rush to Judgment"" and ""In the Year of the Pig.""De Antonio has no special interest in balanced reportage, which is as antithetical to his concerns as it is to those of superior fiction, and ""Millhouse,"" a study of the political career of Richard Milhous Nixon (as well as of his career's various lives and times), is superior fiction, as implacable as ""An American Tragedy,"" as mysterious as ""You Can't Go Home Again,"" as funny as ""Why Are We in Viet Nam?"" and as banal as ""Main Street.""By this I don't mean to say that it's not true, but rather that it shares with fiction the kind of truth that is greater than the sum of its factual parts. In this case, those parts are mostly newsreel footage, television kinescopes and some out-takes from political spots that Mr. Nixon made as a Presidential candidate in 1968.There also are interviews with such professional Nixon watchers as James A. Wechsler, Joe McGuinniss (""The Selling of the President"") and Jules Witcover (""The Resurrection of Richard Nixon""), and with old opponents and former friends. When Mrs. Marjorie Hildreth Knighton, who dated Mr. Nixon at Whittier College, reports cheerfully that she can't think of any Nixon anecdotes, the effect is Transylvanian, as if the man had passed in front of the mirror and not created a reflection.The only ambiguity in de Antonio's new work is the second ""l"" and the ""e"" he has injected into the title, which, if it is supposed to be a pun, leaves me mystified.""Millhouse"" is otherwise a Dos Passos-like collage of the American scene as represented by the man who, in de Antonio's portrait, seems always to win when he loses and lose when he wins, whose speeches are as barren as the California desert, whose rhetoric consists mainly in answering questions no one has asked (and avoiding those that someone might ask), and who can't even tell a funny story, or a reminiscence, without somehow sandbagging himself into exposing a lot more of his fantasy life than any man need decently do.The film concludes with the jolly gaffe, made at the Inauguration Ball, when the new President recalled having saved his money so that he and his wife could celebrate V-J Day with Guy Lombardo at the Roosevelt Hotel and hoped that the orchestra leader would be around to play at the end of the next war.""Millhouse"" is anything but subtle, which is not De Antonio's style, and some of the ironic juxtapositions of sounds to images are less than inspired (such as the ""Chiquita Banana"" jingle that is lapped over shots of Mr. Nixon's South American tour).Others, however, are brilliant and, in Norman Mailer's phrase, very spooky. I think especially of Mr. Nixon's campaign oration that actually parodies the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, with which it is intercut on the soundtrack, as well as the magical moment when Mr. Nixon accepts the 1968 nomination saying, ""Let's win this one for Ike."" The movie cuts to the Gipper scene from ""Knute Rockne"" (Win this one for the Gipper""), and then to the Gipper himself, who turns out to be the present Governor of California at what looks to be the age of 13.De Antonio is obviously both astonished and outraged by what he sees in the Nixon career, but no more by what he sees as the conscious deception of others during the campaigns than by the self-deception that allows Mr. Nixon to call himself an egghead and to express the wish to teach at some place like Oxford and write two or three books a year.In one key area, in expressing horror at Mr. Nixon's tremendous ambition, de Antonio is being a little naive. Ambition in itself is no more immoral or moral than the drive to eat, and can be judged only by the channels through which it is directed. I would agree, however, with what I feel to be one of the filmmaker's most important points: that we have notsadlyreached that point of social perfection when we can enjoy, as an especially fascinating display, the exercise of power for its own sake.""Millhouse,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, is a fascinating 'work, but not quite ""the white comedy"" in the Marx Brothers tradition that its producer claims. Also on the bill, however, is something that really is funny, ""Thank You, Mask Man,"" the hilarious cartoon version of the late Lenny Bruce just-so story on how and why the Lone Ranger formed his attachment to Tonto. Bruce does the various voices, and they are all great.",1971-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Last Movie':Hopper Cast as a Mythic Film Cowboy in Work He Directed in Peru,"Dennis Hopper's independently made first film, ""Easy Rider,"" was the definitive road picture of the 1960'sbeautiful, cool and numbingly inarticulate, a myth on a motorcycle looking for an American that was not there. It also was so financially successful that its director won what is often (though loosely) called the artistic freedom with which to make his second, ""The Last Movie,"" with the backing of a major studio.The new film, which opened yesterday at the R.K.O. 59th Street Twin Theater, was judged the best feature at the 1971 Venice Film Festival by the International Committee for the Diffusion of the Arts and Letters of Cinema  and I can only think that someone must be kidding. I know nothing about the committee, or its perhaps awesome mission, but its name is certainly as ornate, and as immediately meaningful as the movie on which it bestowed its prize.""The Last Movie"" is an extravagant mess, described by its publicity material as ""an allegory concerning the destruction of innocence,"" in which ""the naive dreams involved are the agents of death, when sophisticated games become more absurd than the mind can tolerate . . ."" I don't know about anyone else, but my mind had a good deal of trouble tolerating the inflated pretensions of Hopper, who, it's now apparent, is gifted with all of the insights of a weekend mystic who drives to and from his retreat in a Jaguar.Specifically, ""The Last Movie"" has to do with the effect that a Hollywood movie company has on the Indian inhabitants of a small Peruvian village, high in the Andes, during and after the production of a potboiler about Billy the Kid. It's also about a mythic movie cowboy named Kansas (Hopper), who stays on after the filming and, like the Indians, so loses sight of reality that he finds himself believing the situation as the Indians set about pretending to film a sort of Western movie Passion Play, with Hopper as you-know-who.The film jumps forwards and backwards, and in and out of fantasies, as well as the surface movie, the movie-within-the-movie and the pretend movie, with such nervous desperation that it makes Norman Mailer's ""Maidstone,"" which also has a reality hang-up, look as classically structured as Buuel's ""Tristana.""Unlike Mailer, who does have a way with words (which are, after all, the things out of which ideas are constructed), Hopper has a very small vocabulary as a filmmaker, and his thoughts here have all of the impact of revelations written down during an acid trip.When, occasionally, coherence threatens, ""The Last Movie"" becomes bearable. There are some funny scenes of the Billy the Kid production, with Sam Fuller, the legendary but real movie director, playing the director within the film. There is also, somewhere around the middle of ""The Last Movie,"" a beautifully satiric and sad sequence involving Kansas with an American businessman, who manufactures brooms in Peru, and the American's nasty wife (very nicely played by Julie Adams, who is, in real life, an artifact of the old Hollywood to which Hopper keeps referring).To make his ""Last Movie,"" Hopper seems to have had the resources necessary to transport to Peru a huge Hollywood company that included, in unrecognizable bit roles, people like Peter Fonda, John Phillip Law, Severn Darden, Jim Mitchum and Dean Stockwell. They must have had a ball, photographing each other and the local color, and I have no doubt that fantasy and reality did become confused, at least to the extent that ""The Last Movie"" itself comes to look every bit as indulgent, cruel and thoughtless as the dream factory films it makes such ponderous fun of.Hopper's movie troupe also included the talented Laszlo Kovacs, whose camerawork was one of the best things about ""Easy Rider."" As a result, ""The Last Movie"" has enough visual style to suggest that it really does have something on its mind. That, however, turns out to be just another fantasy.",1971-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Real Love Story,"That formidable chasm between sodden bathos and genuine pathos is adroitly leaped by the writer-director Bryan Forbes and a professional cast in ""Long Ago Tomorrow,"" the British romantic drama that opened at the Beekman Theater yesterday. While they haven't created a landmark film by any means, Mr. Forbes and company have fashioned an understated but passionate portrait of young people under tragic stress that evokes real compassion, an honest tear or two and, believe it or not, a chuckle here and there.While neither the title of Peter Marshall's 1966 novel, ""The Raging Moon"" (under which the film was released in England), or ""Long Ago Tomorrow"" makes more than a poetic point, it is clear almost from the start that the film is not involved with the treacly banalities of soap opera as is, say, the movies' classic example of the genre, ""Love Story.""This is, simply, a love story involving two paraplegics: Bruce, a working-class, brash, womanizing type felled by a football injury, and Jill, an upper-middle-class doctor's daughter. The two, imprisoned in wheelchairs in an institution, face a forbidding future with consummate bravery.As noted, Mr. Forbes and his principals have not come up with stereotypes. As portrayed by Nanette Newman (Mrs. Forbes in private life), Jill, struggling to free her reluctant but dutiful fianc from his obligation to her, is vibrantly touching as a woman experiencing love for the first time.Her courtship with Malcolm McDowell as the brusque, iconoclastic Bruce, who has begun to express himself in poetry and letters, is a touching (and funny) affair, approached with seeming casualness. In the process, the two enliven the drab existence of the other incapacitated residents.Mr. McDowell is both defiantly belligerent and gentle, a believable, once-rugged male suddenly and helplessly involved with love he desperately wants to fulfill but can't. Miss Newman is tender, adult and feminine as the ill-fated Jill, who briefly finds joy in his poignant affection. They are abetted by some solid vignettes from Georgia Brown, the song belter of ""Oliver!"", as an understanding staff member, and Geoffrey Whitehead as Mr. McDowell's square but loving brother.Touching on one small aspect of the human condition, ""Long Ago Tomorrow"" is a subdued but authentically moving view of unusual but real people and a real love story.",1971-09-30T05:00:00+0000
