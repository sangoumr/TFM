She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia July 24, 1906. Her father was the well-known Russian artist, Boris Anisfeld, who designed sets and costumes for the Russian theater and opera before the 1917 Russia revolution and later for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Ms. Chatfield-Taylor emigrated to the United States with her father and mother at the height of the Russian revolution. She arrived in New York in 1918, when her father's paintings, transported from Russia, were exhibited in a major show at the Brooklyn Museum. Later, her father was employed by the Metropolitan Opera Company from 1918-1927. She was educated at the Ethical Culture Society School in Manhattan. The family moved to Chicago in 1929, where her father became professor of advanced painting at the Chicago Art Institute. While attending the Art Institute as a student, Ms. Anisfeld produced exhibitions of her own work of drawings and paintings. She also created murals for cafes and bars in Chicago and designed high-fashion clothing. In 1936, she married journalist Otis Chatfield-Taylor, from a prominent Chicago family. The ceremony was conducted in her father's art studio in Chicago. They lived in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. Mr. Chatfield-Taylor owned and edited the local newspaper. Following his death in 1948, Ms. Chatfield-Taylor moved to Manhattan and created a company called Maggie Taylor gowns, which produced her own original clothing designs. In 1954, Ms. Chatfield-Taylor moved to Washington, D.C., where she worked for many years as a real estate agent and antique dealer. In 1970 she moved to Stonington, CT. Following her father's death in 1973, she devoted her energies to promoting her father's reputation in the world of Russian and American art. She is survived by one son, Charles Chatfield-Taylor of San Francisco, CA and Stonington, CT and by two granddaughters, Jessica Chatfield-Taylor of San Francisco, and Mercedes Flett of Lotus, CA.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; An Exhibition of Women,"The photographer Annie Leibovitz combines portraits of both famous and unknown subjects in WOMEN (Random House, $75). She evidently means to celebrate changes that have been wrought by the feminist movement. Turn the page with a photograph of Madeleine K. Albright and discover two bull riders from an ''all-girl rodeo.'' On the flip side of a photo of three female soldiers is a picture of Louise Bourgeois. With her always penetrating and frequently ironic eye, Leibovitz has taken a haunting image of Joni Mitchell beside a fountain in an eerie garden setting and a shot of a haunted Nicole Kidman who looks like she has just seen Stanley Kubrick's ghost. There is a shot of Hillary Rodham Clinton so fastidiously posed she could be a waxwork. A tribute to Cindy Sherman -- herself a photographer and famous for creating different characters from her own image -- becomes a delicious joke when it unfurls six Sherman look-alikes as so many cutout paper dolls. Although Susan Sontag gave Leibovitz the idea for this exquisite collection, her introductory essay amounts to a feminist diatribe that offers none of the insights she brought to ''On Photography'' 22 years ago. Her outmoded polemic perpetrates some of the very offenses it rails against, as when Sontag writes, ''It's still common to begrudge a woman who has both beauty and intellectual brilliance.''

Doctors were recently reported to have inadvertently sent a woman into deep (but, thankfully, temporary) depression by applying an electrode to a specific area of the brain previously thought unconnected with emotion. Just as in the 1950's and 1960's, when humankind came face to face with the prospect that the species could self-destruct in a nuclear instant, today we confront intimations of some sort of reductive physical absolute.

But I'm locked out of my friend's Montmartre apartment, and this is one place I can await her return in air-conditioned comfort. Besides, entering Proust's world jibes perfectly with my own voyeuristic purposes. To research a novel, I've come to peer through the keyhole of the present-day and discover the past of the Belle Epoque. I want to experience Paris as my fictional characters might have experienced it in 1910.

In a typical poem, the poet discovers that a waitress has written ''I love you'' on his check, though when he discloses a stanza later that she loves everybody, one takes from the page a pleasure more lasting than the momentary reward of the merely sexual. Throughout GREETINGS TO OUR FRIENDS IN BRAZIL: One Hundred Poems (Harvill, $23), there is a mateyness in Durcan's work that is never presumptuous; his speakers come across as gentle and intelligent, from a garbage collector describing pridefully his own body (''my nipples could jump over a government minister'') to a musician meditating on his strangely happy isolation as he drives home at night, ''my audience all couples canoodling behind in the village.'' Durcan, who has written for (and performed with) Van Morrison, includes many autobiographical poems here, and eventually a portrait emerges of someone who sees himself as, paradoxically, both central and marginal to his culture: following a reading in Ireland's National Gallery, a shy middle-aged couple give him a tea cozy with the words ''crazy about Paul'' stitched into it, yet earlier a man had interrupted the performance to ask, ''Where is the toilet?'' Mainly, though, this is a book of sly pleasures -- of, for example, Durcan and a friend reading lazily in a Dublin bookstore: ''Oh yes!

I suppose that many of us may have contemplated this dumbing-down of our culture. It is revealing that the level of fame of a giant figure like Byron is now enjoyed by comparative nobodies like O.J. and Monica. The temptation is great to blame a dysfunctional society, yet the Regency of Byron's time was probably as trivial and decadent as our own. The only difference may be that our age readily trades the notion of community and group for individual recognition, however specious. We know more, and sadly, seem to care more about the lives of Diana and John Kennedy Jr. than about our neighbor next door who has cancer or a family member who has lost his job.",1999-11-07T05:00:00+0000

Participants in the New York City Marathon today, more than 30,000 of them, will be wearing ChampionChips, tiny computer chips that keep track of their times. Issued by the New York Road Runners Club, the bright yellow plastic chips, which are the size of a quarter, attach to a sneaker's laces. As runners pass over rubber mats laid at five points in the race (the starting line, the 10-kilometer mark, the halfway point, the 20-mile mark and the finish line), antennas in the mats will pick up the signals from the chips, and the times will be computed instantly, in much the way E-ZPass works. ChampionChips have been used in marathons in Berlin, Boston and Los Angeles. In today's race, the times of the runners will be posted every 20 minutes on the World Wide Web at nycmarathon.msn.com. Race organizers predict that someday Internet users will be able to track the progress of each runner moment by moment. At the race's end, runners may either return the chips or buy them for $30 (for use in other races). And after running 26.2 miles, what's better than a good impulse buy?",1999-11-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Scarves Dipped In Nature's Paints,"When Akihiko Izukura, a textile designer in Kyoto, Japan, chooses colors for his gossamer silk scarves and other accessories, he leaves no root or leaf unturned. He extracts an orange yellow from onions and a maroon from chestnuts; uses lac, a deep red insect secretion; and fixes the colors with alum or iron compounds. His palette also includes a soft beige from mugwort, a reddish brown from betel palm and a rose red from madder. These are the dyes that Hinaya, Mr. Izukura's family's company, has used since the early 1800's, when it wove silk for kimonos and obis. ''It was traditional to make kimonos and obis, and sell them to the royal family in Japan,'' said Kae Yoshino, Hinaya's American representative. Since the 1970's, Mr. Izukura, 56, has designed modern products from naturally dyed silk. Last month, he introduced scarves ($225 to $300), gloves ($20), rugs ($3,200 to $4,200) and obis ($980 to $2,800) at Dimson Homma, 20 East 67th Street; (212) 439-7950.

Beneath the malls, the lawns, the garages lay this subterranean realm of bombers, explosives and tanks.

''Hiring a waiter means that I can come home, spend time with my baby and not rush around in a panic. These days, it's fairly standard to see waiters at small gatherings. It's not pretentious, just practical.'' Aaron Armijo, owner of Waiters on the Run, a company that provides household workers, says customers are often surprised by how affordable a waiter can be. (He charges $21.50 an hour for each waiter for cocktail parties, and $25 for sit-down dinners.) And they are willing to spend money if it buys them time. ''It used to be that mom cooked all day for dad's clients or friends,'' said Mr. Armijo, whose waiters have served working women like Katie Ford, chief executive of Ford Models, and Yue-Sai Kan, who has a line of cosmetics in China.

The arts don't evolve in temporal lock step, and it wasn't until the mid-80's, largely because of advances in technology, that pop music began to explore the territory Warhol had opened up long before. Today, the connections between Warhol's ideas and pop music -- especially electronica and hip-hop -- have only deepened, offering one more strand of evidence that Warhol, far from being the poseur and opportunist many still consider him, was an artist and thinker of uncanny prescience.",1999-11-07T05:00:00+0000

Now, two new French imports are selling hope to the hair-impaired with products that claim to enhance eyelash, eyebrow and hair growth. Talika, the French cosmetics line, has arrived at Saks Fifth Avenue stores with Eyebrow Lipocils ($30 for seven milliliters) and Eyelash Lipocils ($35 for 10 milliliters). They are ''conditioning gels'' made of plant extracts that the company says were originally used to treat burn victims and found to stimulate hair growth. Talika says the products will make eyelashes and eyebrows grow 0.5 to 2.5 millimeters longer, or 0.002 to 0.01 of an inch, within a month. Also new to the American market is Viviscal, a French ''hair pill'' popular with European models and fashion editors. Made of fish protein and vitamin C, the pills are supposed to make hair longer and smoother in six months. A one-month supply of 60 tablets is $79 at Clyde Chemists, at Madison Avenue and 74th Street, or from (800) 318-3934. ''Nothing's been scientifically proven to make hair grow longer,'' said Dr. Fred Brandt, a dermatologist in Manhattan and Coral Gables, Fla.

It was both a physical and psychic barrier, for 28 years the most powerful symbol of the cold war, dividing not just Berlin and Germany and Europe but East from West. Then, 10 years ago, on the evening of Nov. 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, its collapse a dramatic expression of the larger failure of a Soviet empire brought down by economic decay, the cynicism of its citizens and the historic decision of its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, not to use the force needed to hold it together. In fact, by allowing the wall to be breached without military response, Mr. Gorbachev did exactly what President Reagan, on a visit to Berlin two years before, had demanded: ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!''",1999-11-09T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Moore began his profession in the practice of pediatric medicine and later held the position of Medical Director of the McGregor Clinics. His personal life included extensive travel throughout the world and devoted service to Trinity Episcopal Church in Houston. While family and friends knew of his dedicated service to others, most were unaware of the extent to which he lived this vocation-the establishment of charitable organizations, actual service within those organizations, and most profoundly in the way he quietly touched the lives of those he knew. ''Gordon Moore was the most selfless person I have ever known. He was a warm, caring individual and I have lost a great friend,'' said a friend and colleague. Dr. Moore was a Founding Director of the Episcopal Medical Missions Board and served on a mission to the Dominican Republic, providing medical services to the poor. He was also a founder of the Emergency Aid Coalition and volunteered many hours of service in inner city clinics. Ever faithful to the church's life and mission, Dr. Moore served on the Vestry of Trinity Episcopal Church, where he shared his vision of the church as an open, diverse community for all people. An outstanding teacher and scholar, he was noted for his Bethel Bible instruction at both Trinity and Palmer Episcopal churches. ''He found great joy in sharing. He saw Christ in all people,'' remarked a student and fellow parishioner. Dr. Moore is survived by his partner of 20 years, Kevin Stevens; his parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Moore; his brothers, Scott Moore and Jerry Moore, and their families.

For the magazine, she assembled one of her performances in a private studio by asking 21 women, from professional models to women she met on the street, to expose the naked truth beneath their clothes -- or not, for those who declined to disrobe. The models, she explains, ''provide a kind of backdrop,'' establishing the standard of beauty by which women are often judged. But in the foreground, the individuality of everyday people emerges.

Somehow, year after year, designer clothes have to go from being a dream on a drawing board to fitting into a real life. No designer goes to greater lengths to research the back story of her collections than Anna Sui, who creates elaborate bulletin boards illustrating her influences as she goes along. But whatever the inspirations, the real work, she says, is making her customers feel that somehow those elements say something about them when they wear the clothes. ''Fashion always has to reflect what's going on,'' Sui said. ''You can't just pull a concept out of nowhere and say this is the look of today, because it doesn't happen that way. Fashion is a reflection. That's always the challenge. You have to bring it back so that a person can walk down the street and not look like she walked out of a costume epic or a time machine. It's got to fit into how people are dressing today.'' Here, Sui walks us through the process of putting together her triumphant fall '99 collection.",1999-11-14T05:00:00+0000

Nevertheless, this collection offers 1,000 reviews -- talkies only -- just as they were written, beginning Oct. 7, 1927 (Mordaunt Hall on ''The Jazz Singer''). Each review is accompanied by a credit box, updated to current style.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Scary on the Outside,"Wendell Mayo's beguiling B. HORROR: And Other Stories (Livingston, paper, $11) contains, as the title suggests, narratives that are often loosely based on the plots and themes of cheap horror films. ''Mary Magdalena Versus Godzilla'' tracks a man's lifelong attempts to entertain (and later, in a way, to save) his sister through his obsession with Godzilla; ''B. Horror'' contrasts the terror a young actor tries to evoke in his stage performances, in which he re-enacts scenes from B movies, with the terror he sees in reality; and ''Robert's Bride'' is ''Bride of Frankenstein'' retold with depth and sophistication, cataloging a man's confused attraction to his friend's inscrutable fiancee. But Mayo, in his third book, demonstrates that ''horror'' can mean something as simple as fear and apprehension, and in patient, sharp prose, he pushes his characters into small psychic duels, where people come close to understanding each other but can't -- or won't -- get there. The results can be as funny as ''Going Long,'' where a man's obsession with football makes him blind to his estrangement from his wife, or in ''Who Made You,'' where a couple's arguments over a refrigerator, Greenpeace and the Baltimore Catechism make the distance between them all too clear. Mayo can also be a surprisingly poignant writer; ''Woman Without Arms'' is a painterly meditation on a lover's body, prosthetic limbs and all, that raises questions about the nature of physical attraction. There's no need for standard B movie tropes -- Roger Corman's buckets of blood, Ed Wood's bad lighting -- to shock the reader here. In Mayo's world, each character already wears a cheap, unconvincing mask; that these disguises hew so close to reality is terrifying enough. Mark Athitakis",1999-11-14T05:00:00+0000

The point of stylish outfits, Veblen maintained, was not simply to show the world that you were rich but to prove, in the most envy-making sense, that you had little to do but get dressed. A neat, expensive garment carries with it ''an exemption from personal contact with industrial processes of any kind,'' he wrote.

Shopping at fleas and vintage stores is, for me, a sort of mental panacea -- simultaneously distracting, calming and engaging. The flea is never predictable in the way a store usually is, and after years of training, I've become expert at sensing, often from a great distance, a promising collection.

To accommodate the momentous events and social changes of these past 50 years, Ambrose and Brinkley begin with the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution, eliminating entirely European settlement and colonial life. Gone are the Puritans of Salem, the Byrds of Virginia, Montcalm and Wolfe on the Plains of Abraham. Probably nobody will miss ''A Yankee Approves of Slavery.'' But it is a little startling to see the Progressive era reduced to two articles, World War I to three. Even World War II, in 1949 the longest section with 16 articles, is now down to six; longest in this edition, not surprisingly, is ''The Individual Rights Revolution,'' with 13 selections ranging from ''The March on Washington'' to ''A Chippewa Remembers the Birth of A.I.M.'' Will all these names be as important 50 years from now, for the next edition? Will the cold war still merit as many selections as the Blue and the Gray?

He continued to be active in many community organizations up until his death. All of his life he was an eloquent and passionate champion of community service. Saint Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers recently honored Mr. Gaffigan for his outstanding support of the Healing Ministry of the Sisters of St. Francis. Mr. Gaffigan gave of his time and resources to support organizations including Hospice of the Calumet Area, Northwest Indiana Forum as well as Purdue University Calumet Chancellors Advisory Council. As past Chairman of all of these organizations, his commitment was evident in the progress made in their respective missions. In addition, in 1989 he received the Shamrock Award from the Friendly Sons of Erin for his commitment to family and faith. Mr. Gaffigan's professional career began in 1957 at Chase Manhattan Bank where he rose to Assistant Treasurer. He returned to the Midwest in 1965 to assume a position with Central National Bank of Chicago (now La Salle National Bank) and was eventually promoted to Executive Vice President. In 1976 he was appointed President and then Chief Executive Officer of Mercantile National Bank of Indiana. Under his management, Mercantile always earned more than 1% on assets and was subsequently honored by Money Magazine as one of the 100 safest banks in the United States (one of only two Indiana banks so honored). As a banker, Mr. Gaffigan was a master at balancing criticism and encouragement. ''Mike was always fair in the way he treated us and I think that is what made him the respected President he was. He really did care about the employees as much as he did the bank's clients,'' said Jeanne Cleaveringa, a former Mercantile employee. Mr. Gaffigan was born in Springfield, Illinois and matriculated at Georgetown University earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. He earned his Masters of Business Administration from New York University. His wife Marcia preceded Michael Gaffigan in death in 1990. He is survived by his loving wife Kathleen (Nau), his six children, three step children and six grandchildren. Mr. Gaffigan has three brothers that also survive; Jacques (Mary Ann), Joseph (Joan), and Terrence.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of its beloved friend and devoted Steinway Artist Gaby Casadesus, on November 12, 1999 in Paris at the age of 98. A native of Marseille, Mme. Casadesus was first taught by her mother and continued her studies at the Paris Conservatory under Marguerite Long and Louis Diemer. After a brilliant solo career in which she championed the music of such composers as Faure, Moszkowski, and Ravel, she married the renowned pianist and composer Robert Casadesus in 1921. Their collaboration resulted in one of the most celebrated piano duos in history. An acclaimed teacher, Mme. Casadesus' master classes at the Ravel Academy in St-Jean-de-Luz, the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and the Fontainebleau School were legendary. She was a co-founder of the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition in 1975. Mme. Casadesus' discography, including a recent reissue of live performances from 1942 to 1948 by Dante Productions, will keep her legacy alive for future generations.

Decades later, she still speaks fondly of the meandering walks she would take around the affluent Philadelphia suburb of Bryn Mawr, dreaming of the sacrifices the Frenchman made to advance his ideals. ''I was fascinated by his dilemma of wanting liberty for everyone, but having to figure out what to do with individuals who won't go along with your plan,'' she recalled recently. ''I still think about it all the time.'' Nussbaum also remembered the fun she had playing Joan of Arc, entranced as she was by the question of ''how far to sacrifice friendship and personal loyalty to an abstract cause.'' Although Nussbaum eventually traded the stage for the academy, she still takes these early inspirations to heart. Synthesizing the passion of the revolutionary with the zeal of the self-sacrificing saint, she has become, at 52, the most prominent female philosopher in America.",1999-11-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Yo Ho Ho and a Case of Dynamite,"Carl Schenck, a 1930's industrialist and a self-made millionaire, has an audacious plan: to cruise to the Arctic on a luxury yacht and bag the most exotic big game imaginable. For this fool's errand he's acquired the Lodestar, a 225-foot vessel of delicate construction, and laid in an arsenal that includes an elephant gun, a cannon-fired harpoon, 5,000 rounds of ammunition and a case of dynamite sticks. Among his crew is Will Boden, a former captain haunted by the loss of his own ship several years earlier. Boden, an Arctic veteran, knows Schenck's plan is daft but can't resist the adventure. When he warns Schenck that the Lodestar isn't designed for ice, Schenck reveals the purpose of the dynamite and the depth of his navete: ''We get caught in any ice,'' he proclaims, ''we'll blow our way out.'' Schenck's unflagging brio, modeled on his hero Teddy Roosevelt, carries him surprisingly far north and lands his passengers and crew in all sorts of trouble. In VOYAGE TO THE NORTH STAR (Carroll & Graf, $24), his first novel, Peter Nichols, who wrote about his own voyage across the Atlantic in a wooden boat in the memoir ''Sea Change,'' tells an engaging story in unadorned language about the nature of folly and the folly of challenging nature. Nichols allows his readers to see the passage up the East Coast, from New York Harbor to Baffin Island, through the eyes of a seasoned mariner, and takes particular delight in recording the details of the seagoing world in the days before global positioning satellites.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of its beloved friend and devoted Steinway Artist Gaby Casadesus, on November 12, 1999 in Paris at the age of 98. A native of Marseille, Mme. Casadesus was first taught by her mother and continued her studies at the Paris Conservatory under Marguerite Long and Louis Diemer. After a brilliant solo career in which she championed the music of such composers as Faure, Moszkowski, and Ravel, she married the renowned pianist and composer Robert Casadesus in 1921. Their collaboration resulted in one of the most celebrated piano duos in history. An acclaimed teacher, Mme. Casadesus' master classes at the Ravel Academy in St-Jean-de-Luz, the Mozarteum in Salzburg, and the Fontainebleau School were legendary. She was a co-founder of the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition in 1975. Mme. Casadesus' discography, including a recent reissue of live performances from 1942 to 1948 by Dante Productions, will keep her legacy alive for future generations.

us,CHILDREN'S BOOKS: Books in Brief; Heads of Joy,"It's almost exactly a year since controversy about a white teacher's classroom use of a book called ''Nappy Hair'' in a public elementary school in Brooklyn forced her transfer. Now the esteemed and prolific African-American feminist writer Bell Hooks has upped the ante, so to speak, with her first children's book, HAPPY TO BE NAPPY (Jump at the Sun/Hyperion, $14.99; ages 4 to 8), a glorious praise-song for nappy hair, marvelously illustrated by Chris Raschka. Hooks has always been concerned with what she calls ''the politics of representation that systematically devalues blackness.'' From its opening line, ''Girlpie hair smells clean and sweet,'' to its very last image, ''Happy to Be Nappy'' is a richly colorful and jazzy debunking of such devaluation. The opening line is potent politically, because ''Girlpie hair'' scans both as an adjective and the noun it modifies and as what it's meant to be: ''the hair of Girlpie.'' There was an ancillary outcry against Carolivia Herron's ''Nappy Hair'' -- that her text was laced with ''ebonics.'' Perhaps ''Happy to Be Nappy'' is a kind of call and response to the call and response of ''Nappy Hair.'' The text appears in a childlike kind of curling cursive script. Raschka's colorful rectangular shapes form the myriad portraits of African-American girls and at times frame their heads with wondrous halos. An illustrator whose bold watercolor-and-charcoal illustrations brought such energy to his own books -- including ''Charlie Parker Played Be Bop'' and ''Yo! Yes?,'' a Caldecott Honor Book -- Raschka playfully twists and turns Girlpie's black hair everywhere: on her head, into her eyes and out in space.The girl's hair moves and swirls and flares. It's ''soft like cotton, flower petal billowy soft, full of frizz and fuzz.'' And Girlpie herself is all manner of African-American girl, from deep brown to orange-pink, shy, sophisticated, sassy and cool in both her look and her stance. When her patient, loving mother combs and brushes, twists and plaits Girlpie's hair, the girl is ready to fly. ''All kinks gone! All heads of joy!'' The term ''nappy,'' of course, can be a strong pejorative among African-Americans. But Hooks clearly relishes challenging that perception. It's wonderfully liberating to see a little girl take pride in her natural self. Kermit Frazier",1999-11-21T05:00:00+0000

He was a staunch Communist and president of the Workers and Farmers Bloc in Mexico, but he never hesitated to accept commissions from wealthy capitalists. And like his former mentor and sometime rival, Pablo Picasso, Rivera was both a lover and destroyer of the women in his life. He callously abandoned Angeline Beloff, his Russian common-law wife, along with his son Diego Jr., and was frequently unfaithful to his second wife, Lupe Marin. And, of course, there was his tempestuous relationship with Frida Kahlo, an artist whose own fame at times threatened to overshadow his. They married in 1929, and as Hamill points out, ''they would remain together -- in spite of sorrows, abortions, a miscarriage, mutual infidelities, treacheries, a divorce followed by remarriage -- until Frida's death in 1954.'' It seems that Rivera could be loyal only to his painting, and the work he produced, especially the during the 1920's and 30's, cemented his reputation as one of the great muralists of the 20th century. Hamill, who studied art in Mexico when he was a young man, writes authoritatively about Rivera's work and diverse styles. He also describes the pivotal role Rivera's art played in Mexico's development: ''In his art, he unified a people long fractured by history, language, racism, religious and political schism. He said in his art: you are all Mexico.'' Carolyn T. Hughes",1999-11-21T05:00:00+0000

Because that's what you are implying if you deem giving birth without drugs a singular moment. The challenge of being a mother is not enduring hardship at birth but enduring the hardship -- and joy -- that comes from being a parent.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Ralph Walks, Theory Talks","The academic novel has achieved a certain cachet in recent years, and if trying to outdo last year's offerings has become something of a contest, Percival Everett's GLYPH (Graywolf, $22.95) is a likely winner. Told from the viewpoint of a hypercritical infant named Ralph, the child of a hostile literary theorist whom he nicknames Inflato and a vaguely maternal painter he calls Mo, the novel is both a treatise and a romp. His genius evident only through his scribbled notes (he is mute by choice), Ralph is kidnapped, first by a grim psychiatrist, then re-kidnapped by a host of others, including the United States Army and a Mexican prison guard in what Roland Barthes, who also appears here, might call the abduction of the text. Along the way there are sendups of everything from semiotics to military intelligence, deconstruction and cognitive psychology. Everett, whose previous work includes novels, short stories and children's literature, has always gone in unexpected directions, and here his omnivorous intelligence and wordplay match Ralph's imperiled intellect perfectly. To quote Ralph: ''Choosing not to engage in speech had its drawbacks, among them an inability to summon help from the next room.'' If the novel has a shortcoming, it's not the glorious excess (there are footnotes on almost every page), but that you probably had to have been in the academy in the 1970's and '80s to appreciate the infatuation with literary ''big theory.'' Still, it's hard to fault a novel that features a mock dialogue between Socrates and James Baldwin. Exegesis, anyone? David Galef",1999-11-28T05:00:00+0000

Government and private economists agree that the bottom 40 percent of United States households are worse off now than they were 20 years ago. This is not an invention of the political left, and it should be discussed and debated in the coming presidential election campaign -- Sullivan's swipes at Bill Bradley notwithstanding.",1999-11-28T05:00:00+0000

We can think we know him -- there are so many facts. But do they bring him closer? Hardly a season passes without a new book about Lincoln the man. This autumn has seen the publication of two: ''Lincoln on Lincoln,'' selected and edited by Paul M. Zall (University Press of Kentucky), an anthology mainly culled from speeches and letters, and ''Lincoln as I Knew Him: Gossip, Tributes, and Revelations From His Best Friends and Worst Enemies,'' edited by Harold Holzer (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill). The winter will bring an agreeable study in a newer genre, ''Lincoln: A Foreigner's Quest'' (Simon & Schuster), a snapshot biography and amateur tour of Lincoln's career by the English travel writer Jan Morris. Together these books might be supposed to convey the inner and the outer Lincoln. Perhaps the best compliment one can pay to their truthfulness is to say that they leave the mystery untouched.

He didn't push his luck, but he seemed sure that as long as he played well, it would never really run out. Gambling was something he took seriously.

But a lot of its readers may not have known that Mr. Perle is himself a fine composer, or that paradoxically, his creative work stands distinctly aside from many of the practices detailed in his book. From a study of Berg's work, in particular, he developed a system within which a sense similar to that of key is maintained even though all 12 notes are in play, a system he called ''12-tone tonality.''",1999-11-28T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; In Nobody's Shadow,"What would Lee Krasner -- a famously blunt, plain-spoken woman impatient with all forms of pretension -- have made of the trendy critical jargon that Robert Hobbs, an art history professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, employs in his book on her work? Krasner, a respected Abstract Expressionist painter as well as a formidable ''art widow'' (she survived her husband, Jackson Pollock, by almost 30 years and dedicated much of her energy to championing his work), might have snorted to read that her approach has ''affinities with . . . structuralist and poststructuralist linguistic theory,'' that her ''ostensible subjects are predicated on contingency'' and that her ''artistically constructed self remains provisional'' -- the last sounding suspiciously like a fancy way of saying that she never really developed a style of her own. This question of originality (or lack thereof), frequently raised in discussions of her career, is one she herself once addressed by insisting that the paintings she produced right after Pollock's death were not mere imitations of his, as some critics claimed, but deliberate acts of homage. Though she may not have been a major innovator, and one can wish her work did not so often evoke that of other artists, the paintings reproduced in LEE KRASNER (Independent Curators International/Abrams, $49.50) are testimony to a long, fiercely intelligent engagement with many of the great art-historical figures, problems and issues of her time. And even in the paintings clearly influenced by Pollock, her colors are both lusher and more rhapsodic than his ever were; perhaps nobody ever made such brilliant use of deep pink. Without recourse to labored intellectualizing, B. S. Friedman, a friend and early biographer of Pollock, simply portrays Krasner in all her prickly glory in his introduction to this book.
