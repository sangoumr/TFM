Malcolm grew up in a home that celebrated black pride, boldly proclaimed black dignity, and brandished political activism as practically a familial birthright. The members of the Little family were pioneer black nationalists who endeavored to follow Garveys dictum of establishing black political power across urban and rural American landscapes. Garvey tapped into deep currents of black political radicalism swirling in a newly reconfigured urban American landscape, one populated by black southern migrants and Caribbean immigrants. The Great Migration, which started between the world wars and crested in the immediate years after blacks won the right to vote, dispersed millions of southern migrants across the nations vast expanse, in the process creating archipelagoes of black cultural and political power in small and large cities. Inspired by the bootstrap racial uplift politics of Booker T.

When she moved into her two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a handsome Victorian terrace house in Earls Court in 2011, she discovered two unappealing brushed-metal table lamps that had been wired into the fitted alcove cabinets of her living room by a previous owner. Rather than reaching for a screwdriver, she set about reinventing them with a cache of plaster strips left over from an art project shed completed during her time at the London College of Communication. Inspired first by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacomettis 1930s Tte de Femme lamps, shaped like semi-abstracted female figures, and later by the idea of a fragile flower, she began layering the nondescript bases with the soft, water-soaked gauze. The resulting sculptures are nave and enchanting: One depicts a womans face, its features smoothed and barely discernible, like those of a timeworn marble sculpture; the other evokes a bloom with delicately layered petals, their alabaster white surface mottled by the marks of the artists hand.",2020-04-09T20:46:11+0000

The shows Kenya is a successful, cynical screenwriter living an extravagant Los Angeles life and raising children with his wife, played by Rashida Jones. The show explores issues of race, class and wealth  with family dynamics that should resonate well beyond the storys rarefied setting. Most families are functionally dysfunctional, Barris said in a recent interview about the show with The New York Times. You want the house to be a little bit messy, he added. You want the mom to be a little bit frayed. The dad to be a bit out of touch. Some of those things are just part of what family is.

What Ill probably do instead: Take a long walk before dawn, stare out the window, stare at the news on my phone, stare out the window again, have a grilled cheese sandwich, contemplate dinner.",2020-04-17T14:30:01+0000

One of the things she regretted was that she could never have a family, Dr. Gook said. At the time, there was only one fertility-preservation possibility for women who faced sterility from damaging treatments like chemotherapy and radiology: to freeze embryos beforehand. For single women, that meant a flurry of rushed decision-making. Theyd have to choose donor sperm in the short window they had leading up to cancer treatment. Men, on the other hand, could freeze their sperm easily, an option widely available since the 1970s. Why is it that she couldnt have this when it was available to men? Dr. Gook recalled thinking.",2020-04-17T14:38:13+0000

Only in our letters are we able to frame our cleverest selves, to pose both the questions and answers, to make ourselves known as we wish to be known. Those of us experiencing a serious uptick in our email correspondence right now  it seems all it took for us to re-embrace the epistolary form was a global pandemic  are freshly acquainted with the clever breeziness, the missives framed as just checking in, from people we once knew far better than we do now.",2020-04-17T15:13:13+0000

us,"Man of My Time, by Dalia Sofer: An Excerpt","By the time of my arrival, in the summer of 1960, my father had been at work on his encyclopedia for nearly a decade. If I had to associate a smell with childhood, it would be the scent of buckram and papernot the innocuous kind found in stationers, but from moldy manuscripts piled up in every corner of his office, the largest room in our small apartment on Pahlavi Street. My mother, who still only half-jokingly called herself Monir Farahani Ed Dowlehthis last obsolete suffix a reference to her supposed aristocratic heritageendured his mania with the pragmatism of a jockey putting up with her thoroughbreds quirks. Though she claimed she was from old money, she had reconciled herself to the fact that having married an academic, the best she could now hope for was not wealth, but recognition from the band of university highbrows she couldnt tolerate. Her father, Ardeshir Khan Farahani, a man with a Shah Abbasstyle mustache who was our familys supplier of French porcelain, had cut off all financial support, as he had never cared much for his impractical son-in-law likening him to Don Quixote and calling him Don Mozaffarian, man of Shatt al-Arab. This moniker, a reference to the circumstances of my fathers birth, was an unconcealed attempt to estrange him: my father had been born two weeks early on a ferry crossing the contested river named Shatt al-Arab by our Arab neighbors and Arvand Roud by us. The exact spot of the birth, as the ferryman later described it, was past the juncture with the Karun but before the fork of the Tigris and the Euphrates, leaving my grandparents, who in those days lived in my grandmothers province of Khuzestan, with a harrowing story and a stateless baby. And even though the matter was eventually resolved and a birth certificate was issued, my father, throughout his life, was branded with a fishy provenance teetering on the border of an Arab land.",2020-04-17T21:05:14+0000

The Tower was just a room over the garage in the eighteenth-century New England farmhouse where she and my grandfather had lived and raised three children during the 1950s and where they still spent weekends, holidays, and long stretches of summer. Im not sure who christened it the Tower, but the name was used ironically by both her and the rest of the family, an acknowledgment of the privilege of solitude and time. The manuscripts I was poking about in were housed in repurposed ream boxes with words like Eaton and Corrasable Bond on the sides, and in black three-ring binders whose leather casings were beginning to crack. There were dozens of boxes and binders, including ones with A Wrinkle in Time, The Arm of the Starfish, and A Wind in the Door written on them, but I wasnt interested in the manuscripts of stories that could be read as real books: I was more curious about the scraps and stories and studies in the other boxes. I came across Gilberte Must Play Bach in one of those. Im not sure why I stopped to read this particular one, but I liked the French name in the title, and the imperative. The story was strange to me, and sad, and although the girl in the story was named Claudine, I understood it to be autobiographical.

Its estimated that 20 million victory gardens flourished in the United States that year, and New York City alone produced 200 million pounds of tomatoes, beans, beets, carrots and lettuce. Seventy-seven years later, as millions of Americans are self-quarantined, and many worry about trips to the grocery store and the strength of the food-supply chain, the coronavirus pandemic has revived the victory-garden movement. There is a simple, beautiful logic to having food security within your own home, says David Godshall, the principal of the Los Angeles- and San Francisco-based landscape architecture studio Terremoto. In my lifetime, I dont think theres ever been a more pertinent moment to start gardening. For those wondering what will thrive in a limited outdoor space, the short answer is lots. A small garden on a rooftop or balcony can produce abundant harvests. Even inside, a sunny windowsill can yield fragrant clouds of herbs such as mint, lemon verbena, thyme, rosemary and Thai basil.

Condo, 62, first emerged in the early 1980s as a figurative painter whose portraits walked a line between realism and sardonic conceptualism. His new show, Drawings for Distanced Figures, explores how changes in perspective distort his subjects. Johnson, 42, first gained attention in the early 2000s for photographs, sculptures and paintings that explored identity in 21st-century America. His show, Untitled Anxious Red Drawings, revisits his Anxious Men figures  square-jawed faces with wide eyes and chattering teeth  which have become a staple of his work. (A portion of proceeds from both shows will benefit the World Health Organizations Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund.) Like everyone, both artists have had to adapt to a new set of circumstances in the last few months that has made them see their art  not to mention their respective creative processes  differently. This interview, which has been condensed and edited for clarity, took place via Google Hangouts (Condo and Johnson were both at undisclosed locations on Long Island, as Condo put it).

On my way to the checkout, I passed a tiered display of flowers and plants  funnel-shaped bouquets of carnations; potted pastel tulips; lone orchids, their delicate flamingo-neck stems held gracefully aloft  and was snagged by a flash of waxy green leaves and umbels of tiny magenta flowers. The plant was a Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, a blooming succulent that flowers in the winter months. But I am here to buy coffee and Clorox wipes, I told myself, as My Misspent Youth (1999), that Meghan Daum essay about going broke while buying fresh-cut flowers every week, flashed in my mind. And yet, at this sad moment, these bright cheerful blossoms hit me in the gut, stirring up a tangle of emotions: joy, hope, yearning for a time when I would have bought them without worrying they were frivolous, sadness for all the florists and vendors whose businesses are now shuttered. Suddenly I had to have them. The plant felt like a signifier of my past self, and a talisman against palpable, creeping despair. The purchase seemed almost utilitarian.",2020-04-24T17:54:51+0000

John Logan, the creator behind the fantasy horror series Penny Dreadful, which ended in 2016, follows it up with this spinoff. Set in 1938 Los Angeles, City of Angels delivers a packed narrative: A Mexican-American detective, Tiago Vega (Daniel Zovatto), and his partner, Lewis Michener (Nathan Lane), investigate the grisly murder of a prominent Beverly Hills family. Their search plays out while the city is building its freeway system and displacing Chicano families in the process. A shape-shifting demon inspired by Mexican folklore (played by Natalie Dormer of Game of Thrones) somehow ties into all of this, while subplots involving Nazi insurgents and police brutality bring the series, or at least its themes, to the present. Even though our show is set in 1938, it has to be about 2020 or it has no reason to exist, Logan said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
