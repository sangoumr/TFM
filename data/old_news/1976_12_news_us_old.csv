us,"'Bim,' a Film About Life in Colonial Trinidad","By no conventional standards is ""Bim"" very good, but it's still vastly more interesting than lots of other movies you're likely to stumble on.The film, which opened yesterday at the Quad Cinema, is an ambitious attempt by its director-producer, Hugh A. Robertson, to dramatize some aspects of life in Trinidad shortly before the island gained independence.Mr. Robertson, an American director (""Melinda""), worked with a largely Trinidadian crew and an entirely Trinidadian cast to shape a film that is intended primarily to speak to Trinidadians and to other Caribbean people, and only incidentally to others, who, when they watch it, are in the position of eavesdroppers.The film spins a long, rambling tale that is almost Dickensian in its dependence on coincidences and in its habit of jumping from one narrative climax to the next without fooling around with structural niceties. It's the story of Bim (Ralph Maharaj), a young Triradadian of East Indian descent whose father was the autocratic leader of the sugar workers union.After his father is murdered by rivals. Bim is sent off to live in Port of Spain, where he experiences the prejudice of black Trinidadians for the first time and turns to a life of petty crime. Eventually, in about five minutes of film time, Bim succeeds his father as a union power. It becomes something of an anti-climax after all this, then, when Bim's undoing results not from crime, politics, ambition, black rivalries or independence. Once he gets to the top, Bim starts to drink, neither well nor wisely.Too much technology goes into the production of a film for it ever to qualify as truly primitive. There is no movie equivalent to finger-painting, but ""Bim"" comes close.Its power is not the result of sophisticated choice, but in the accumulation of the raw, accurate details of the Trinidadian experience. The actors are overwrought, the continuity is dim and a lot of the dialogue unintelligible to an car not accustomed to West Indian speech rhythms. Yet it's not dull, and it regards Trinidad's racial problems and political aspirations in a way that is unsentimental to the point of being merciless.",1976-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Yet I would suspect that Mr. Schaaf, by updating it, may have disconnected the logic that compelled Kubin to create his fantasy about a dream city, an allegorical place that probably owes more to conditions in the middle Europe that Kubin shared with Kafka than it does to those in today's world.Mr. Schaaf's movie is an interior decorator's dream, full of bizarre sets, costumes and make-up, about a Munich artist (Per Oscarsson) and his wife (Rosemarie Fendel) who, for reasons they never know, are invited to take up residence in a mysterious city where everything is allowed as long as other individuals are respected. Actually this is a rather large, dampening qualification for life in any real dream city, but the movie is so profoundly fuzzy that it doesn't make too much difference.The film is a vaguely Kafkaesque nightmare that can't make up its mind whether its interests are psychological or political, though it seems to be certain that utopia would drive most people mad. Much of the film was photographed in the old Czechoslovak town of Krumlov, which is very picturesque, maybe just a bit too much so.The only other detail about the film that remains clear is that to get to the dream city of the title, one goes to Munich and books a flight to the Near East on Lufthansa. At least that's how the people in the movie do it.",1976-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Throughout the National Football League in recent weeks, cynics. including some employed by the Pittsburgh Steelers. had wondered about the Raiders propriety. The theory was that the Raiders, perhaps subconsciously, would surrender to the temptation of eliminating the Steelers, their recent postseason executioners, from the American Conference playoffs by losing to the Cincinnati Bengals last night. Not even the District Attorney would have been alarmed, because the Raiders have a history of losing enough big games on merit to be above suspicion. Only once have the Raiders qualified for the Super Bowl game, and they lost. Since then they also have lost the A.F.C. championship game six times, twice the Steelers in the last two years.

us,'Silver Streak' Tarnishes on a Tiring Film Trip,"""Silver Streak"" is the sort of comedy that leaves you exhausted, though not from laughing.The film, which is set mostly aboard a Los Angeles-to-Chicago train and has to do with art forgers, cops and innocent bystanders, works its cast so relentessly, with so little real good humor and at such apparent expense and trouble, that it wears you out with the tension that comes from watching good people make idiots of themselves.Among these are a skinny-looking Gene Wilder, who plays a more or less straight romantic role that suits him not at all, and Jill Clayburgh, an actress of too much intelligence to be able to fake identification with a role that is essentially that of a liberated ingenue.Richard Pryor, a very funny man, who turns up in the last third of the film, has some genial moments that are immediately undercut by what appears to be either thoughtless editing or direction. I don't think I've ever before seen an actor at the end of a movie scene adopt that slightly desperate look we have come to associate with television performers when the camera stays on them too long after they've finished their schtiks.This sort of sloppiness is a measure of ""Silver Streak,"" which appears to be looking for a dominant style as it lumbers along over mountains, deserts and prairies. Colin Higgins's screenplay is not witty or rambunctious or mysterious, nor does it have the courage to parody a disaster film like ""Airport 1975,"" an idea that seems to pass through its mind from time to time, though it's never acted upon. Bring back ""The Big Bus.""""Silver Streak"" was directed by Arthur Hiller, a man whose work defies generalization. He's made good films (""The Hospital""), dreadful ones (""Plaza Suite"") and one gold mine (""Love Story""). ""Silver Streak"" is one he may want to forget as quickly as possible.""Silver Streak,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly racy dialogue and one love scene that is made vulgar more as a result of the leering behavior of the actors than because of anything that's shown on the screen.",1976-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Having as your lawyer in a capital case the writer who is wheeling and dealing your life story is about the same as hiring the Boston Strangler as a masseur, but Gary Gilmore's employment of Dennis Boaz as his lawyerbiographer was just one of many bizarre aspects of the case. Well, the rule these days is where there is notoriety the book and movie money moves in, so it's no surprise that the Dennis Boazes are not far behind. People's lives (or deaths) or other people's confidences become properties; notoriety pays and increasing competition for celebrity turns the ordinarily grave events of life into a carnival of commerce. Since it appears that capital punishment will become commonplace, however, future deathrow inmates won't be such hot properties. Still out of fairness, we think a rider should be added to the Miranda Rule lest criminals be deprived of their literary rights.

The brothers then compelled one of the other slaves to complete the dismemberment of George's body, and as the pieces were whacked off, they tossed them onto the roaring fire so as to destroy all evidence of the crime.

In return, the prosecutors maintain, the friends gave Mr. Mandel expensive gifts and a valuable interest in other ventures. at almost no cost to him. A crucial point in the prosecution case is its allegation, supported by witnesses at the trial, that Mr. Mandel vetoed a bill to increase the number of racing days at the track but then arranged for an override by the State Senate when his friends, a short time after the veto, obtained their interest in the track. Other witnesses testified that Mr. Mandel had been financially rewarded for his efforts. The mistrial was declared because the judge believed that the jurors may have been influenced by news reports of alleged attempts to bribe one of them to vote for acquittal. No evidence linking the alleged bribery attempts to Mr. Mandel or his codefendants has been found, Federal authorities said.

Children do it sometimes: perching a teddy bear near the bed, or focusing on the notion of ice cream or a picnic, in the hope that it will be dreamed. Often it is, but not necessarily as hoped. The teddy bear attacks, the ice cream becomes icebergs, the picnic turns into a wake.""The Apparition,"" by the experimental film maker Larry Jordan, is something of a rigged dream. It is erratic, sometimes haunting, sometimes comic, and a lot of it dull; dull in the way somebody else's dreamreal or riggedis dull.In ""The Apparition,"" which is being shown at the Whitney Museum's New American Filmmakers series, Mr. Jordan sets up a central figure to whom the dream belongs, and the figure simultaneously constructs it and dreams it. The figure is Paul, a maker of experimental films and commercials, and seemingly Mr. Jordan's alter ego.Paul lives with Sue, a free spirit just beginning to age. The relationship is uncertain, but deepening, a mixture of hope, guilt and rebellion. He has a casual affair with a younger woman, after their filmed roles as orgiasts in a grape commercial turn real. He visits a California hill family in one of those houses where everything, even the haircuts and eyeglass frames, is handicraft.Paul films everything, obsessively. He films his two women, a young son of the family, the son's drawing of a sacrifice in a Greek temple, a stuffed owl on a bureau. Gradually, jogged by Paul's tensions and depressions, these real things begin to move in and out of a dream state.An outdoor festival held by the family and friends begins with singing, wine drinking and a beautiful moment in which the children ride up on horses and lead the participants in a circle dance. Paul is in the middle of the circle, shooting frenziedly; and drifting away. He sees a figure in a toga and follows her into the woods.At another point he is driving alone in his car when a hand reaches from the back seat and touches him on the neck. The figure in the toga reappears, dies, comes to life, tries to talk, dies again. There are columns, the owl, sacrifices.Hallucination and reality shift back and forth. We see Paul experiencing his visions, telling about them afterward, andhe is a film maker, after allsetting them up.There is a charming openness in the way Mr. Jordan blurs the lines between fantasy and reality, and between fantasy and fraud. This openness, however, doesn't do much to relieve the ponderousness of some of the visions. In a way, it undercuts the visions.Along with ""Apparition"" the museum is showing an earlier, more abstract short work by Mr. Jordan, ""Triptych in Four Parts."" It is pretty much a film about Mr. Jordan's desire to express something by making a film.",1976-12-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Pink Panther Team Unflappable In Fourth High-Spirited Caper,"Though ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" is the fourth Inspector Clouseau comedy to come from the collaboration of Peter Sellers, the star, and Blake Edwards, the director-producer and co-author, there are no signs that anyone's spirits are flagging or that sanity is in any way imminent.Ineptitude again triumphsgloriously. Bungling is rewarded, and Clouseau goes blithely on demonstrating that what he doesn't know, which is everything, can't possibly do him permanent damage.To be near Clouseau is to be at the edge of the hurricane's eye, to risk annihilation, which is pretty much what actually happens to Clouseau's former superior in the French Sret, the once-sane Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom), in ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" which opened at Broadway and neighborhood theaters yesterday.The new film, written by Mr. Edwards and Frank Waldman, picks up Clouseau and Dreyfus several years after we left them in ""The Return of the Pink Panther,"" with Dreyfus, apparently cured after a nervous breakdown brought on by Clouseau, preparing to leave his psychiatric clinic near Paris. One get-well-visit by Clouseau, though, and Dreyfus is pushed over the brink forever, turning into a mad, Goldfinger-like supercrook whose gift for ultimate failure is as certain a law of metaphysics as Clouseau's for success.They were made for each other, Clouseau and Dreyfus, and I can't believe that a little matter like Dreyfus's having been rendered forever invisible at the end of the new film will prevent Mr. Edwards from reuniting the two sometime in the future.I'm not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptableinstead of alarmingand finally so funny.There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masqueradesfor reasons never gone intoas Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium.Both Mr. Sellers and Mr. Edwards delight in old gags, and part of the joy of ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" is watching the way they spin out what is essentially a single routine, such as one fellow's trying, unsuccessfully, to help another fellow out of a lake. And how long has it been since you've seen a crazy dentist routine involving laughing gas and the wrong tooth? For me, too long.I'm also partial to the Sellers-Clouseau French accent that is always discovering new words, such as ""bimp"" (as in ""You have a nasty bimp on your head""), ""rust"" (as in ""You can rust assured"") and ""rheuem"" (as in ""I would like to have a rheuem for the night"").""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" which is more or less about Clouseau's seach for archfiend Dreyfus, moves all over the map, from Paris to London and Bavariawhere Dreyfus lives in a neo-Dracula castle  and back again, with a couple of detours to Washington, and a White House inhabited by a President who stumbles on rugs' edges.It's not, I suspect, a movie to attend looking for reason. It has arid patches, but I couldn't care less. The film is free-form comedy that goes where its gags lead it. That's not to say that it's formless, only that its structure has less to do with narrative than with the comic exuberance of the collaborators, which, after four films, is undiminished.""The Pink Panther Strikes Again,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a couple of bedroom scenes that have less to do with sex than with the confusion that can be caused by unexpected visitors.",1976-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"'King Kong' Bigger, Not Better, In a Return to Screen of Crime","When it is played as a straight adventure-fantasy, Dino De Laurentiis's $25-million remake of ""King Kong"" is inoffensive, uncomplicated fun, as well as a dazzling display of what the special-effects people can do when commissioned to construct a 40-foot-tall ape who can walk, make fondling gestures, is slightly cross-eyed, and smiles a lot.It's something to make you cringe with embarrassment, though, when it attempts to disarm all criticism by kidding itself (proclaim the ads, ""the most exciting original motion picture event of all time"") in lines of dialogue that are intended as instant camp (""You goddamned male chauvinist ape!""). I suppose that when you spend as much as Mr. De Laurentiis did on this, you've got to have something for everybody, including the witless.The nicest thing about the 1933 ""King Kong,"" made by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, was that it was no big deal. One could marvel at the wizardly special effects created by Willis O'Brien and not be overwhelmed by an awareness of the terrific time and expense that went into them. Its heart was genuinely light. Not this time.Why, I think we have a right to ask, would anyone want to remake it? ""King Kong"" is a classic, but it's not ""Hamlet."" There's only one way to do it, and that's been done. Having acknowledged these biases, one might as well relax and let it happen.John Guillermin, the director, and Lorenzo Semple Jr., the writer, display real affection for old-time movie magic and nonsense that come through in spite of a physical production only slightly less elaborate than that of Elizabeth Taylor's ""Cleopatra.""Especially effective are the opening sections of the film that lay outwith a respectful gravity that is truly comicthe scientific mumbo jumbo that softens us for the make-believe to come: a team of oil experts from a cartel named Petrox sets out to find a mysterious uncharted South Pacific island that is perpetually enclosed in a cloud of carbon dioxide, indicating that the earth beneath is a virtually bottomless reservoir of petroleum.There's talk about the worldwide energy crisis, and we are shown satellite photographs meant to allay suspicions that even if such an island could have remained undiscovered throughout all of World War II, our spy-in-the-sky system, which can apparently read the fine print on Kremlin documents, would certainly have chanced upon it long before this.It may well be that we don't need such explanations. Part of the appeal of ""King Kong"" today, as it was in 1933, is based on the wish to believe that there may still be places in this world unpenetrated by Petrox, Pepsico, General Motors, Sony and the Clubs Mediterranee.The film builds well to Kong's initial appearance, after we are almost an hour into the story, when he comes clomping out of the jungle to claim his monthly sacrifice, who is not, of course, Fay Wray, but Jessica Lange, a beautiful New York model who plays a would-be actress named Dwan. Though Dwan sets Kong's heart aflame, she's more likely to set everyone else's teeth on edge.This is no reflection on Miss Lange. It's the script. In their attempt to update a fairy tale, the film makers have turned a conventional heroine into a pseudo-Marilyn Monroe character who seems less dizzy than certifiably daft, aggressively unpleasant and out of place in this sort of movie.What sort, exactly, is this movie? It's a series of big, foolish but entertaining spectacle scenes, such as the natives of that uncharted Pacific island prancing around, doing pagan fertility dances that suggest 1950's Broadway musicals. It's the sight of the mighty Kong picking up Dwan in the palm of his hand and washing her off under a jungle waterfall, then fiddling curiously with her bra. It's Kong going amok in New York City, looking for Dwan, grabbing up a subway car and rattling it like a gourd, then trudging south to the World Trade Center, where he ultimately meets his fate.One of my objections to the film is the substitution of the twin towers of the Trade Center for the Empire State Building, used in the original film. The World Trade Center is a very boring piece of architecture. The Empire State Building is not. Though Kong's last fight with Army helicopters is beautifully (and bloodily) done, the setting trivializes it.There are other actors in the film beside Miss Lange. They include very good actors such as Jeff Bridges (as a professor of primate paleontology from Princeton) and Charles Grodin (as a vicious, ambitious Petrox executive), but they are supporting characters to the various pieces of machinery (and one man in an ape suit) that portray Kong in his changing moods.The real auteurs of this ""King Kong"" are not the producers, the director or the writer, but Carlo Rambaldi, Glen Robinson and Rick Baker, who are credited with having been responsible for designing, constructing and engineering the mechanisms.""King Kong,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested""), includes some vulgar language, some partial nudity, some violence at the end, and some intimations of unrealizable bestiality that small children everywhere will recognize as simple friendliness.",1976-12-18T05:00:00+0000

Baryshnikov's Nutcracker, with sets by Boris Aronson and 131 costumes created by Frank Thompson, will be radically different in concept from more familiar versions, including George Balanchine's hugely popular production given annually by The New York City Ballet. Although New Yorkers will not see this new version of the Tchaikovsky classic until American Ballet Theater's spring when the work will receive its New York premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, watching Baryshnikov rehearsing his very first choreographic effort provided an unusual and fascinating glimpse into the dancer's working methods.",1976-12-19T05:00:00+0000

On its face a romance of the Japanese Heian court, Genji's central theme is the love of the shining Prince Genji for his favorite con sort; its sideromances, subplots (or halfplots), seductions, assignations and dawn getaways proliferate, but never quite get out of control. The author's second sight into her people's moods and motivations have led modern critics to label her work the first psychological novel. It is more than that. It is deeply religious, rooted in the Buddhist sense of the tragic impermanence of thingsalthough in later centuries Japanese Buddhist commentators confidently announced that Murasaki had gone to hell for writing such a dirty book. Murasaki's 54 chapters rival Proust in length, as well as in their wondrous subtlety of mood. Yet this sophisticated and extraordinarily modern book was finished before A.D. 1020, only a century after Beowulf and almost two centuries before the Chanson de Roland and the Nibelungenlied, at a time when the ancestors of the Prousts, Tolstoys, Melvilles and Cervantes were running around the forests of Europe in crude chain mail, clouting each other with battleaxes.",1976-12-19T05:00:00+0000

For years Lawson's art was consigned, permanently it seemed, to the socalled Ash Can School that caused such a disturbance among the genteel minds responsible for determining the official taste of the American art world at the turn of the century. That Lawson was never drawn to Ash Can subjects, that the colorful realism of city life was never of much interest to him, somehow was overlooked. He had exhibited his pictures with The Eight? Some members of this group, John Sloan especially, were indeed drawn to such ugly subjects, and that was enough. Through a kind of guilt by association, the Ash Can label was attached to Lawson, and it stuck. No one seemed to notice that the man was obsessed, even when he painted the city, with a quite different imagerywith the light and space and loneliness of the pastoral landscape.",1976-12-19T05:00:00+0000

Dubs, the producer of last year's Christmas bauble, ""Adventures of the Wilderness Family,"" are not the ones to let a simple, profitable formula lie.Like kids ever ready to have a go at a second candy cane, they've tackled another innocents-versus-the-wilds confection in ""Across the Great Divide,"" which arrived yesterday at the Guild and Embassy Theaters. And it's safe to say that their new holiday treat is as harmless, say, as that second candy cane, and it should charm the youngsters and even some indulgent grown-ups.If moviegoers with retentive memories detect similarities between ""Wilderness Family"" and ""Great Divide"" it is hardly important. Only an urban misogynist would sneer at the idea that once again the focus is on nave pioneers, the wilderness and such predators as a grizzly and cougars. But the Pacific Northwest and its fauna are still eye-fillingly photogenic and the principals are cheerful and endearing, if amazingly indomitable.A cynic might question this fiction about a youthful, self-reliant, orphaned sister and brother adrift in the forested high country in 1876, who, with the aid of a resourceful young con-man gambler, finally make it to the lush Oregon acres they've inherited.But action, a touch of humor and nonmarauding Indians give the proceedings a fair portion of realism. Our handsome gambler and our wandering pre-teen-agers are always on the run. If the youngsters are slow to accept his blarney, they grudgingly do come to trust him. But there's always that grizzly and the cougars who deprive them of their horses, as well as a snarling wolf pack to threaten them, and a band of dissolute, if comic, frontiersmen to keep them and the film moving at a fast clip.The Indians, led by George (Buck) Flower, are decent, family types who appreciate their help in driving off that man-eating grizzly. If some oddly Dickensian dialogue by a pair of newcomers. Heather Rattray and Mark Hall, can be overlooked, they emerge as natural and attractive kids. Robert Logan (one of the leads in ""Wilderness Family"") is properly stalwart as their knowledgeable protector. And they all blend well with the spectacular Utah and British Columbia landscapes in which ""Great Divide"" was shot.",1976-12-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Mikey and Nicky,' Film on Amity","Elaine May's first two films, ""A New Leaf"" and ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" were comedies of sometimes inspired and often touching lunacy, mostly about the uncertain progress of romantic love between men and women. Her third film, ""Mikey and Nicky,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, is something else entirely.It's a melodrama about male friendship told in such insistently claustrophobic detail that to watch it is to risk an artificially induced anxiety attack. It's nearly two hours of being locked in a telephone booth with a couple of method actors who won't stop talking, though they have nothing of interest to say, and who won't stop jiggling around, though they plainly aren't going anywhere.""Mikey and Nicky,"" which Miss May wrote as well as directed, takes place in one approximately 12-hour period. It involves a lot of self-conscious exposition that never quite succeeds in telling us all we have a decent right to know.It's about a couple of small-time Los Angeles hoods who've grown up together, joined the same mob and now, on this particular night, find their lifelong relationship passing in front of our eyes in aggressive close-up.Nicky (John Cassavetes), convinced that his bosses have put out a contract on his life, summons Mikey (Peter Falk) to his hideout in a fleabag hotel. Nicky needs help. He's scared out of his wits. He's coming apart at the seams. He's afraid of being murdered but his ulcer is killing him anyway. He isn't sure he can trust Mikey, but if he can't trust Mikey, he can't trust anybody.When Mikey arrives at the hotel, Nicky at first refuses to let him in, but then he relents. The two men embrace. They are in tears. They clutch each other. They laugh. They cry. They argue. They reconcile. Mikey tries to be reasonable with his distraught friend.Mikey: ""Who told you [there was a contract out on you]?""Nicky: ""Someone I know told me.""Mikey: ""How do you know it's true?""Nicky: ""How do you know it's not true?""Later in the evening, Mikey angrily accuses Nicky of having nicknamed him ""the echo"" for always saying everything twice. But so do Nicky and everyone else in the film. Miss May used to write that kind of dialogue to be funny. This time she means to be serious but the method isn't good enough.""Mikey and Nicky"" follows the friends as they wander in aimless desperation around a neon-lit city, and as we learn eventually that Mikey is, in fact, the finger man.By this time, though, it's too late to retrieve the film from the kind of busy banality that Mr. Cassavetes' own films, including his recent ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie,"" fall into when actors take over from the director, apparently with the director's full approval.Though we are told more than once that the Cassavetes character is a charmer and that he has always treated his friends rottenly, including Mikey, there's no evidence in the performance that Nicky is charming in any way. Nor do we believe that Mikey is a jerk, as he's supposed to be. Both actors are, in fact, as interchangeable in their characters as are their character names. It's significant, I think, that as I write this review I have to keep referring to my notes to remember which actor plays which part.Short portions of the film come to vivid life, especially toward the end. There's a very funny, typically urban confrontation between Mr. Cassavetes and an officious lady on a bus who doesn't want to start up with his ""element,"" and a fine sequence in an all-black bar whose patrons take Mikey and Nicky for white cops. Not so good is a sequence in a neighborhood bar where Miss May's camera keeps panning across the great faces of the real-life (I'm sure) customers as if she were showing us Hindu tempe carvings.Several supporting actors have some good moments, including Ned Beatty, who plays the hired murderer who worries about the cost of the gasoline he's using up, and Carol Grace, who is superb as a slightly dimwitted girlfriend of Mr. Cassavetes. What Mr. Cassavetes and Mr. Falk do, though, exists beyond the fringe of film criticism. They just seem to be carrying onmaking elaborate actorish fussesin front of the camera.Miss May is a witty, gifted, very intelligent director. It took guts for her to attempt a film like this, but she failed.",1976-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'Nickelodeon': Not Much Movie for the Money,"Peter Bogdanovich knows a great deal about movies, including how they are made. Perhaps he doesn't know why they are made. In any case, knowing how something is made isn't the same as making it. ""Nickelodeon"" is two hours and two minutes of impersonations.Some of them are very good impersonationsdeft and funnybut they lack a life to string them together. The effect is like a vaudevillian imitating a Frenchman making a speech. The imitation is fine but there is no speech.Despite its length, which is one of its problems, there isn't much movie in ""Nickelodeon,"" which opened yesterday at the Columbia I and II Theaters.Its subject has been pretty heavily treated of late. It is about the early days of movie-making. Slapstick in style and picaresque in form, it is closer to such spoofs as ""Hearts of the West"" and ""Won Ton Ton the Dog Who Saved Hollywood"" than to ""Day of the Locust"" or ""The Last Tycoon.""It is not really a spoof though. At the end Mr. Bogdanovich has his raggle-taggle band of movie makers, given a contract after many reverses, pass a lighted sound-stage. ""They're making a movie,"" says Ryan O'Neal, as their director, in a near-choked voice.Mr. Bogdanovich mistreats his love for the vitality of American movie-making by proclaiming it so breathily. He mistreats his love for the tricks of the trade, especially the slapstick comic trade, by virtually italicizing each trick as he trots it out.HarriganMr. O'Nealis an incompetent lawyer who meets up with Cobb, a manic film producer who is battling the big companies. Some meaningless remark leads Cobb first to hire him as a writer, then to send him out West to take over a band of actors and technicians whose director has decamped. Harrigan gets entangled with an unskilled hooferplayed by Jane Hitchcockand an unskilled rodeo riderBurt Reynoldsadds them to the company, and begins to make movies.It's easy, the cameraman tells him ""These are the actors. This is the camera. You tell me where to place it, and when you have enough you tell me 'cut.' ""It is a nice rendering of the casual improvisation of early movie-makingparodied, but only marginally. Mr. Bogdanovich arranges for some good things to happen. There is a fine trolley-car scene where Cobb's film company rides to the set inventing the script along the way. Not only is the idea-man subject to fits, he also produces ideas only when he has them.There are any number of sight gags. Somenotably one involving two monocled Germans who make movies clandestinely at the back of a pastry shopare very funny. Too many, though, are obvious quotes from old slapstick routines. The shock of recognition, such as it is, quite overpowers the impulse to laugh.Mr. Bogdanovich lets his routines run on too long. There is an endless fight between Mr. O'Neal and Mr. Reynolds. It is choreographed as a comic ballet: It is infinitely familiar, infinitely slick and not at all funny. Rather than giving us a sense that the movie is going somewhere, the routines succeed one another endlessly. They are a parade that totally interrupts any traffic that might be around.Mr. Reynolds is appealing, and sometimes quite funny as the cowhand who becomes a reluctant star. Miss Hitchcock, with wide cheeks and a pointed chin, seems to have comic potential but the point is never really proved. Tatum O'Neal plays a sarcastic but useful brat as if she'd been there before and too often.Mr. O'Neal is a major mistake. He has very little talent for comedy. The way to be funny is not to try intensely to be funny. It is to be yourself so single-mindedly as to be funny. If Mr. O'Neal has a self he has left it at home.On opening day ""Nickelodeon"" was charging a nickel admission. That's underpricing it; 75 cents would be about right.The film has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It's hard to see why any such caution is put in. There is nothing that could conceivably be objectionable in it.",1976-12-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Crime Film 'Enforcer' Lacking Ideas,"There's a basic weakness in the movie business' assumption that if you have a big suspense or action picture with lots of movement and thrills, you don't need writing or acting or character in it.Because what happens? The climax comes. Good and bad are stalking each other around some monstrous hangar, Zoroastrian rest-home or abandoned maple-sugar factory. Music. Suspenseful lighting. Tension. And a face peers around the corner. But by this time, who cares about the face? It might as well be Donald Duck's.Money, the big name of Clint Eastwood, a lot of gore and howling sirens and the urge to rail at various liberal notions are not enough to make even a passable movie out of ""The Enforcer.""The movie, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, is the third in the series""Dirty Harry"" and ""Magnum Force"" were the first twoabout a mean though righteous San Francisco cop. It has been billed as ""the dirtiest Harry of them all,"" but it is simply the surliest. It is the same barroom drunk railing at weirdos and pinkos, and four or five glasses farther into his theme.The movie begins with the killing of two gas-company drivers by the Revolutionary Strike Force. The half-dozen young people in the force need the gas truck to break into an arms depot guarded by one (1) old watchman. They kill him and use the arms and detonators to kidnap the mayor, whom they hold for ransom. The killings are unnecessary, but this is explained by the fact that the leaderwho is really in it for the moneyis a homicidal madman. We know this because his jaws quiver when he stabs people.Out comes Harry Callahan (Mr. Eastwood) of the homicide division. That is, he's sometimes of the homicide division. He starts out by driving his car through the window of a liquor store to break up a stickup and kills the three gunmen. He is busted to personnel for roughness, reinstated when the Revolutionary Strike Force begins work, is busted again when he goes after them too vigorously, but manages to get them all anyway when they hole up in what used to be Alcatraz prison.The action is reasonably fast and competently photographed. The picture doesn't exactly drag. But it is maggoty with non-ideas. These non-ideas come in the form of a whole gallery of corrupt or foolish liberal types who interfere with Harry's mission.There is a progressive priest who shelters the assault gang until one of them, dressed as a nun, tries to shoot Harry. There is a weaselly police captain who says Harry's shooting the liquor-store holdup men was offensive to the city's minorities. ""The hoods, you mean,"" Harry says brightly. ""They're Americans, too,"" the captain answers.Thatthe movie tells usis how knee-jerk liberals think. The politicians are corrupt and pathetically eager to appease the thugs/radicals/ pornographers.Feminism is also some kind of conspiracy. Harry is reluctantly saddled with a woman police officer as his partner. Played by Tyne Daly, who is good-hearted and plucky, but she is also a whole shopping list of alleged feminine incompetences.She runs with her arms flapping all anyhow, holds a pistol as if it were a chamberpot, asks stupid questions, goes around with her mouth gaping, and talks in a high-pitched quack. That is Miss Daly peering around a corner in the climactic scene, not Donald Duck. But, as stated earlier, it might as well be.",1976-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Voyage of the Damned',"In May 1939 the Hamburg-America liner St. Louis sailed from Hamburg headed for Havana, carrying 937 Jews who had paid Hitler's government dearly in the hope of finding refuge from the Nazis in Cuba. Hitler's strategy was simple: if, indeed, the Cuban Government accepted the refugees (and there was doubt about that, even when they sailed), then Germany was well rid of them and a little bit richer, too.If Cuba did not accept them, and if the United States and other countries followed suit, then Hitler would have proven his point that Jews were unwanted by the very countries that were so loudly criticizing his anti-Semitic policies while proclaiming their own humanitarian principles.The story of that voyage is a harrowing footnote to the history of World War II. As carefully researched by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts in their book ""The Voyage of the Damned,"" it is, further, a revealing commentary on how opportunism could dictate policies of friendly governments, including that of the United States.It also seems to be excellent source material for a film, though you'd never know it from the alternately sluggish and hysterical movie that opened at three New York theaters yesterday. Stuart Rosenberg, the director, and Steven Shagan and David Butler, who wrote the screenplay, appear to have been attracted to the project because of the almost limitless ways in which they could make history look like a bad, all-star movie, to start with, they use a dozen or so too many stories even to fit conveniently into a running time inflated to 158 minutes.Their touch is so surely banal that they turn potentially moving episodes into second-rate melodrama, while adding some third-rate melodramatics of their own, including a Romeo-and-Juliet suicide pact. It's the kind of movie in which someone says, quite seriously, ""Vee Chermans har hallvays hon time"" (We Germans are always on time).The cast includes good actors and bad, but even the good actors are inclined to be awful. Faye Dunaway and Oskar Werner are all right as a rather posh Berlin doctor and his wife who are carrying their marital problems into exile intact. They travel first-class. Malcolm McDowell plays the role of a cabin boy who appears to be old enough to qualify for Social Security. When we weren't looking, his youth fled. Max von Sydow survives with his reputation undamaged as the liner's humane skipper, but Katharine Ross, who looks like a Rose Bowl parade queen, is a joke as a humane Havana whore.Orson Welles, James Mason, Denholm Elliott and Jose Ferrer are on and off faster than it takes to type this sentence, while Lee Grant, Julie Harris, Wendy Hiller and Luther Adler might wish they had been so lucky.Movies as clumsy, tasteless and self-righteous as this are worse than merely boring. By exploiting the tragedies of real people, some wildly fictionalized, ""The Voyage of the Damned"" attempts to turn them to profit without giving them any measure of the respect that is due.""Voyage of The Damned,"" which has been rated PG (""parental guidance suggested"", contains nothing of an even mildly suggestive nature except the title, which might mislead children to think they are about to see a disaster filmand a child who wants to see a disaster film and sees this, instead, will be an angry child.",1976-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Gladys Knight And Alaska Pipeline,"GLADYS KNIGHT, the recording star, makes a nice, low-keyed movie debut in ""Pipe Dreams,"" the first film I've seen that uses the building of the Alaskan pipeline as an essential part of its action. The film, which also stars Miss Knight's real-life husband, Barry Hankerson, as her husband, within-the-film, is set in Valdez, Alaska, effectively portrayed as a frozen frontier community of well-heeled, lonely construction workers and the whores and confidence artists who are after their loot.Stephen Verona, the writer and director of the film, displays little apparent talent in either capacity, but at least he doesn't dwell too long on the foolishness of a plot that includes one plane crash of absolutely no surprise and the inept attempts of a crooked entrepreneur to delay the pipeline's completion. The movie pays no attenkerson, as her husband within-the-fraud involving the pipeline.Mostly it's about Miss Knight's attempts to win back her husband who had earlier left her in Atlanta to make his fortune as an Alaskan bush pilot. Miss Knight and Mr. Hankerson are not great actors by any means, but they play well together, creating some genuinely moving and comic moments of a sort one didn't often see in old-fashioned ""B"" pictures about lumber camps and gold-strike towns, which ""Pipe Dreams"" faintly resembles.Miss Knight doesn't sing on screen but, with the Pips, she's never long off the soundtrack. A lot of the movie is used up sightseeing by air, accompanied by Miss Knight and the Pips singing a batch of songs, some of which have more plot relevance than others. The film opened yesterday at four theaters.""Pipe Dreams,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), makes no attempt to disguise the fact that all the women in the film, except its star, are whores, though nothing in the way of explicit sex is shown.",1976-12-24T05:00:00+0000

It is soft at the center and musty on the surface.""Telephone,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts theater, is about a provincial factory owner who sells his factory to a big, American-controlled enterprise. The owner, who plays rugby with his workers on weekends and personifies the old humanity of France, comes up to Paris to discuss the sale.The purchasers, sleek to a fault and inhabiting a faceless glass building, sweeten the talks by providing a call girl who pretends to be somebody's niece and falls in love with the factory-owner. After their night together, he is smitten, and dreams of a new life, of leaving his wife and setting up with the young woman.He finds out the truth, is disillusioned, the factory sale is put in doubt, the workers protest, he leaves his wife. Meanwhile, he conducts a running argument with the young woman. She asserts the economic advantages of being a call girl. He argues for love. Finally she gets on a plane to meet a client in Italy and then, at the very end, turns back. Presumably they will live somewhere in the country and grow tomatoes.The wildly romantic, implausible ending is reminiscent of ""Cousin, Cousine,"" but nothing else in the film is. Pierre Mondy tries to play the factory owner with the warm impassiveness of the late Jean Gabin; he simply looks sorry for himself. Mireille Darc as the call girl is cool, blonde andjudging by the amount of life she contributeson strike. Michel Lonsdale is sometimes amusing as the American capitalist.",1976-12-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Streisand Soups Up a Classic,"SHE'S A LIKABLE KID, loaded with talent, and still unknown at the start of her career. He's a star, not just any star, but a superstar, at the end of his. They meet and ignite. For an all-too-brief instant as time is computed in the galaxies, their love flareshow should I put itincandescently. Then the momentum of their lives separates them as she goes on to become the brightest new star in the firmament while he, has-been that he's about to become, slides back down fame's ladder into oblivion soup. He implodes.When this was made as ""What Price Hollywood?"" in 1932, it was based on a story credited to Adela Rogers St. John, directed by George Cukor, and starred Constance Bennett as the ingenue. What with one thing and another, it inspired The New York Time's film critic to write, ""Once you have been divorced by a polo player and have had your director commit suicide in your home, there is nothing left but rural France.""Things improved with the 1937 remake (as ""A Star Is Born"") that starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March and was directed by William Wellman, by which time the original story was being credited to Mr. Wellman and Robert Carson. Things peaked, though, in the 1954 remake, again directed by Mr. Cukor, which had a screenplay by Moss Hart and starred James Mason and Judy Garland in what was probably the greatest performance of her career.The latest version, which opened Saturday at the Ziefgield and Baronet Theaters, is a transistorized remake, louder than ever, but very small in terms of its being about anything whatsoever. The setting is no longer Hollywood and movie-making, but the contemporary rock scene. Its stars are Barbra Streisand, who plays an unknown singer as if she were the wolf disguised as Red Riding Hood's grandmother, and Kris Kristofferson, who plays the fading rock star whose last decent act, you might say, is passing on the torch of fame to Barbra, who, of course, looks perfectly capable of knocking him down and taking it away from him anyway.According to the credits, the film was directed by Frank Pierson, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" and it was written by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, who worked on it as a team, and by Mr. Pierson. The dominant personality of the production, however, is Miss Streisand's. In addition to being the film's star, she is its executive producer, takes credit for its ""musical concepts,"" contributed her own wardrobe and collaborated on two of its best songs, ""Evergreen"" and ""Lost Inside of You.""As long as this ""A Star Is Born"" attends to music, it is not at all bad. There is souped-up excitement when it is recording the stars' recording sessions, their giant rock concerts and their benefit performances, and when it is getting them into and out of hysterical crowds via limousine, ambulance and sometimes helicopter. The excitement is suddenly genuine when Miss Streisand sings, but the drama that contains it is as bogus as the star's performance when she pretends to be Esther Hoffman, unknown singer.There's also something completely bogus in the pairing of Miss Streisand and Mr. Kristofferson, who, as lovers, are less exciting than King Kong and Jessica Lange. It would be easy to say that it's not Mr. Kristofferson's fault, but I'm not sure it isn't. He walks through the film looking very bored.Miss Streisand, at least, attempts to act, delivering with much simulated passion a line such as, ""You can trash your life, but you aren't going to trash mine!"" Or, when Mr. Kristofferson discovers her at the piano and asks what she's playing, ""Just a little something I wrote, hoping it will be a sonata when it grows up."" Now that she's her own executive producer she can't blame lines like that on Ray Stark.What Miss Streisand does is not acting. She's a queen condescending to her own court cameraman, which explains, I suspect, why even a couple of semi-nude love scenes have the effect of being anti-erotic. One suspects she, not the director, is the one who yelled ""cut"" just before the camera would have glimpsed a bare Streisand breast.She never plays to or with the other actors. She does ""A Star Is Born"" as a solo turn. Everybody else is a back-up musician, which is okay when she's belting out a lyric, but distinctly odd when other actors come into the same frame.",1976-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:'Search for Ark',"""In Search of Noah's Ark,"" now docked at about 100 theaters in the metropolitan area, is, like some quests, ideally motivated but frustrating.Since the account in Genesis is somewhat minimal, this documentation and re-enactment serves as a fairly reasonable attempt to explain questions that have plagued biblical and scientific scholars for thousands of years. But this delving into records and places in proof of the reality of Noah and his epic Ark adventure is largely a leisurely, pedantic but picturesque journey that lacks the conviction of incontrovertible proof.That ""search"" starts, of course, with a dramatization of Noahhere a benign, white-bearded patriarchhis family and that Ark of ""gopher"" (oak?) wood, a 450-foot leviathan, the largest wooden ship ever built by man, it says here.While researchers present facts substantiating the possibility of such an accomplishment, that feat done by so few still troubles a viewer.Before the film wends its way to the 17,000-foot, glacier-crowned, storm and suspicion-ridden Mount Ararat on the Turkish-Soviet border where the Ark landed, we encounter a succession of scholars and varied places such as Turkish villages and the American Earth Resources Satellite Center.Bits of timber found by Sir James Bryce and those discovered by the French explorer Fernand Navarra on Ararat, as well as some controversial tests on the antiquity of the semi-petrified wood, are presented as evidence of the existence of the Ark. And various expeditions, as well as photographs of their findings by U-2 planes, among others, are presented to indicate the presence of part of the Ark, a black hull stuck in a 15,000-foot glacier.Unfortunately, the creation of such an immense vessel, its seaworthiness, the ability of Noah to gather thousands of animals and feed them over many months, the possibility of such a flood's occurring some 5,000 years ago, may be presented with seemingly scientific sincerity.But these data, along with the final statement that the hulk on Ararat cannot be extricated entire because it would cause political havoc between Turkey and the Soviet Union, remain, despite the apparent seriousness of this ""Search,"" arguable points.",1976-12-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Just Another Shaggy Dog,"Now is the time, of course, for all good men to be kind to man and dumb animals. But ""The Shaggy D.A.,"" which bounded into local theaters on Christmas Day, puts that wonderful concept to a severe test. As the sequel to ""The Shaggy Dog,"" Walt Disney's 1959 moneymaker, ""The Shaggy D.A."" is a farce with all the witless energy of an unrestrained Great Dane puppy and, thankfully, a cast and director who generally avoid taking themselves or the free-wheeling plot seriously.You may recall that ""Shaggy Dog"" involved a teen-ager who was turned into a sheepdog fairly regularly because of the magical power of a ""Borgia"" scarab ring. This time, as a married man, father and lawyer in the person of Dean Jones, he again is being transformed into that woolly canine while campaigning for the district attorney's office against that dastard, Keenan Wynn.Naturally, the story line is incredible and convoluted enough to give an uninhibited cast plenty of opportunities to clown for, unfortunately, a minimum of real laughs. However, between continuous chases, pie-throwing binges and dogs that talk like James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and Mae West, Dean Jones manages to make the dog-harried D.A. candidate a mildly comic, if improbable, gent. Suzanne Pleshette, in her first film role in five years, plays his wife in amiably tongue-in-cheek style and Shane Sinutko is impish as their pre-teen son.Keenan Wynn is, let's say, an outrageously broad villain who gets his just deserts, animal style. And, among many others, Tim Conway does his shtick as a fairly droll, dead-panned ice-cream vendor who navely thinks his pet has suddenly become a talking sheepdog.""You can't go through life not knowing when you'll turn into a dog,"" an exasperated Miss Pleshette exclaims at one point.

us,"Of War, Reel and Unreal:War Amalgam","""All This and World War II,"" which arrived at the Trans-Lux East yesterday, is, like war, eye-and ear-filling, but confusing. As an amalgam of newsreel and fictional film footage from 20th Century-Fox vaults and a background score of John Lennon and Paul McCartney rock hits, neither the war nor the songs emerge victorious or especially memorable.Call it a tribute to a well-meant concept and the editing of a vast store of material. But this kaleidoscopic succession of vignettes from the appeasement era to V-J Day are reminders of history that momentarily meld and then just as quickly fade away. A shot of Nazi phalanxes goose-stepping before the hostilities that is coupled with a funny clip about Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" from the unnamed Hitchcock classic, ""The Lady Vanishes,"" may be vaguely related, but do not stick in memory.One is reminded of the slightly glamorous aspects of war with scenes of the actual inductions into the armed forces of James Stewart, Clark Gable and Tyrone Power. And views of Hitler, President Roosevelt, Churchill, Field Marshal Montgomery and General Eisenhower, Bob Hope, De Gaulle (entering Paris), bombings, evacuated children, the Battle of Midway and scrap drives, among many others, indicate the reality and some of the concomitant levity of the period.The bombing of Pearl Harbor to the accompaniment of ""I Am the Walrus"" seems a dubious sort of irony. But G.I.'s reading letters from home to the background singing of ""Yesterday"" is genuinely effective and poignant. One can't fault the artistry of the composers of ""Yesterday"" or ""Fool on the Hill"" or such artists as Helen Reddy or Elton John or the London Symphony and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestras. But their identities here, like the film's fictional movie excerpts, remain fairly mysterious to the untutored.The producers' intentions, as noted, appear to be good. But their collage of conflict and music evolves as an unresolved tussle between realism, seemingly weak satire and the tunes so dear to the Woodstock generation.This film has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), probably because of World War II bombings and the like, none of which, in all likelihood, have not been seen before by the small fry on their television screens.",1976-12-27T05:00:00+0000
