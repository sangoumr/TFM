us,Screen:Life of Wolf Pack Seen in 'Cry of the Wild',"So few animal documentaries for family viewing are filmed these days that one called ""Cry of the Wild"" is doubly welcome. Even so, don't be misled by those television trailers, heralding a close-up study of snarling wolves in the wild.While the footage has an atmospheric opening and closing in the Canadian Arctic, the wolf pack we see here in fascinating and remarkably intimate detail is roaming a carefully surveyed forest enclosure near Quebec. This middle portion of the picture, which was produced by the National Board of Canada and had a multitheater opening yesterday in the metropolitan area, is superb. At one Manhattan theater yesterday, the uptown Olympia, a capacity audience of children and parents drank it in raptly. No wonder.The picture has a curious history. Made in 1972, running only 50 minutes and titled ""Death of a Legend,"" it was widely shown nontheatrically (schools, clubs, etc.). This release is its first theattrical exposure, through an American company, with a new title and 40 more minutes of the original footage restored.This footage is undoubtedly the prelude, which zeroes in scenically but rather meanderingly on the Canadian wilds, as the director-photographer, Bill Mason, and a narrator, generalize factually about the wolves, who snarl away in the distance.It's another matter entirely back at the Mason enclosure, with the charming Mason family overseeing their semi-tame pack. The camera records the animals' life cycle, including tribal hierarchy, feeding rituals, courtship and birth. A candid, tastefully shown birth sequence of a litter, with the wolf as tenderly solicitous as a doe, is a touching, even beautiful sight.",1974-01-03T05:00:00+0000

The Netherlands, for example, is hardest hit because it will not benefit directly from the recent Arab decision to increase the flow of oil to friendly nations by 10 per cent starting this month. Even so, spokesmen for other countries ranging from President Pompidou of France to , the Minister of Trade of Denmark have warned their countrymen that the recent Arab decision should not inspire .undue optimism. It will take a while for increased shipments to arrive, and the effects of an enormous jump in the price of fuel will be feltperhaps indefinitely. Some countries that depend heavily on tourism have announced policies of priority allocation of fuel for tourist travel and for resort industries, but, at the same time, the traveler will find Sunday driving bans not uncommon, some trains crowded and some flights curtailed. One American overseas, however, saw a bright side to the fuel shortage.

us,Less is more is practical,"I t's like a great dress that doesn't wrinkle, says fashion designer Chester Weinberg about his new city apartment. He wanted a place to live in that embodied the same elegance, absence of fussy detail and practicality that he has achieved in the design of his clothes. That meant replacing fragile antiques and delicate fabrics with well designed, functional furnishings. The hanging lamps used throughout, for instance, are the porcelainfinished, white. metal fixtures that were originally designed for use in factories. Tables are made from standard, restaurantstyle, black metal pedestals with black Formica tops. Scaleddown versions of the classic drafting chair are used as occasional chairs. Commercial  grade wool carpeting in a warm beige covers the floors and the seating platform in the living room. The only furniture specifically designed for use in homes is the two lounge chairs with bleachedwood frames which were created in the nineteenthirties by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. The beiges and taupes of the carpeting and and natural woods dominate the apartment's three rooms  a 20by20foot living room, a 12by16foot bedroom and the breakfast nook in the small kitchen. This unified color scheme and the repetition of the basic elements of furnituretables, lamps and chairsgive the place the illusion of being much larger than it is. Joseph D'Urso, who designed the apartment, shares Mr. Weinberg's views on what constitutes elegance today, and that doesn't mean expensive furniture. They believe that machinemade objects can be well constructed and beautiful and that dull, highrise spaces can be personalized without major architectural changes. Mr. Weinberg hates to treat furniture and art as investments. I'd rather make the investment in terms of daily living, he says. A bachelor working in a frenetic business, he especially appreciates the ease with which the apartment can be kept tidy. Even when it looks like a cyclone hit it, he says, I can pull it together in half an hour. Getting ready for guests means grabbing a few spectacular flowers as I get off the subway and putting them in the glass vases makes the look festive.",1974-01-06T05:00:00+0000

They dip into one vegetable or meat or fish dish, then another, but skimp on the rice because they think it is fattening. In fact, generous portion of rice represents no more than 125 to 150 calories and makes all the difference between feeling satisfied or ravenous a few hours later. The dieter who passes up the rice may find himself gorging later on a piece of layer cake, which represents more calories (perhaps 800) than his dinner.

The implication of this finding according to the pair, the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley and William C. McCready, is that Catholic schools, may have worked better than most peopie thought in their goal of equipping students with Christian values. They warned, however, that such news may have come too late to help in the revival of the parochial school system in this country. The deterioration of selfconfidence is such now that it is improbable that any good news can reverse the process, they stated. It is almost as though no one wishes to believe in the possibility of good news about Catholic schools. Father Greeley and Mr. McCready, both members of the staff of the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago, based their findings and conclusions on research conducted for the Henry Luce Foundation that is scheduled to be published soon under the title The Ultimate Values of Americans. Preliminary Report A preliminary report on aspects of the study, based on a subsample of 356 American Catholics, appears under the authors names in the current issue of The National Catholic Reporter, a layedited Catholic weekly newspaper. In the survey, the two scholars asked respondents to indicate how they would react to six.""critical life situations. The situations included being told that one's child would be mentally retarded and interpreting the meaning of natural disasters. Men and Women of Hope The respondents were then classified into five groups on a scale ranging from religious optimists who [slide] rather easily over evil, suffering and tragedy to pessimists who are angry at the folly and absurdity of the human condition. Another category is the hopefuls, who take the problem of evil seriously but believe good to be stronger than evil. In their article, the two sociologists, who recently released another study reporting a sharp decline in churchgoing among adult Catholics, found that respondents who had gone to Catholic schools seem to be those who have not to be men and women of hope.",1974-01-08T05:00:00+0000

As with the first assembly held here in 1972, the public is invited to the four-day conclave of distributors and makers of animated movies. In addition to special and retrospective screenings, the program will include a competition among 200 animated short-subjects from 20 countries.The nonprofit festival is funded in part by a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, with additional support from N.Y.U. It is one of three international events devoted exclusively to animation, with the other festivals being held in Annecy, France, and Zagreb, Yugoslavia.At a press preview of the program, Fred Mintz, the festival's organizer, said that the program would stress the burgeoning activities and new trends of animation here and abroad.""Animation is a thriving business both here and in Europe,"" said Mr. Mintz, who heads the Cinephile Company, a distribution agency in New York. ""The main outlets now in the United States are, of course, television and the 16-mm., non-theatrical circuit of schools, clubs and libraries, which are buying more and more animated shorts as audio-visual aids in the graphic arts.""Mr. Mintz estimated that there was a total of 100 animation studios in Europe, most with government subsidies. There are, he said, about 200 studios here. Current trends are toward the mixing of computerization and animation and the production of more theatrical features, such as the French-Czechoslovak ""Fantastic Planet"" and Ralph Bakshi's ""Fritz the Cat"" and ""Heavy Traffic."" (The Bakshi films will be given a double-feature screening at the festival.)Other special events at the festival are screenings of animated works by Bruno Bozzetto (Italy), Yoji Kuri (Japan) and the late Jiri Trnka (Czechoslovakia), a showing of the United Nations Children's Fund movie, ""The Selfless Giant,"" and a computer-animation conference.""The wonderful thing about animation as a field,"" Mr. Mintz said, ""is its built-in international language. With minimal, practical adjustments, animated pictures have an audience anywhere. Whereas the two European festivals stress the artistio products, we are also emphasizing new techniques in drawing and showing educational and industrial films and even the longer, made-for-TV specials, unlike Annecy and Zagreb.""A two-hour sampling of festival shorts, entered in competition, attested to the program's variety and quality.The National Film Board of Canada's ""The Family That Dwelt Apart"" is a sprightly fable narrated by the author, E. B. White. ""The Maggot"" is a striking anti-drug cartoon set in Harlem but made in Britain by George Dunning (of ""Yellow Submarine""). Francis Masse's ""Evasion Express,"" from France, is a strong, brooding parable of train passengers, in contrast with a frisky college, ""Mini-Mini,"" from Japan. The Italian-made ""Opera"" hilariously satirizes operatic performances in terms of social fantasy.Other samplings were Wolfgang Urchs's ""Neighbors,"" a sharp satire within a simple animated frame, and a radiant television commercial linking Eastern Airlines and the Walt Disney World. Two somber, artistic imports from Poland and Belgium, Richard Czekala's ""The Son"" and Raoul Servais's ""Pagasus,"" were remarkably effective.Festival tickets, excluding some special events, are $2 each, and $1 tickets, for students. They are available at the Loeb Center box office.",1974-01-09T05:00:00+0000

Sunday afternoon is time enough for the blitz and the bomb and the other subtleties of strategy. Until then the subtleties of people are more prevalent. And more fun. Such as the evening when Joe Namath, his right hand holding glass of scotch instead of a football or even a blonde, proclaimed, We're gonna win, I guarantee you. Or When George Allen glared at a multitude of newsmen and sneered, You're making me be late Tor a meeting for the first time in my coaching career.

Among the Miami Dolphins the bachelors complained why, if the married players wives had been transported and lodged as guests of the front office, their mothers shouldn't deserve similar invitations. As it developed, the sparrows won't have to pay for a Super Bowl ticket, but the mothers will. And Bud Grant may have to pay something else.",1974-01-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Sticky My Fingers' and 4 Other Early Works:The Program,"Graceful as grizzlies, supple as mastodons, the middle-aged men who cherish their games of touch football in Central Park bruise their egos as well as their limbs in John Hancock's delightful short feature, ""Sticky My Fingers Fleet My Feet,"" which is included in ""Hollywood's New Directors: Early Works."" The program opened Sunday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and will run through Jan. 23. The films are linked by the fact that these young directors developed out of film schools or with grants from the American Film Institute, rather than through years of work in Hollywood.Mr. Hancock's film, with a script by himself and John Lahr, was adapted from a New Yorker short story by Gene Williams, who also plays the lead. It now appears as a dexterous warm-up for Mr. Hancock's ""Bang the Drum Slowly."" There's the same sensitivity to individuals and their obsessionsas revealed in the context of sports.The happy amateur players of ""Sticky My Fingers"" are as vulnerable to aging as the doomed professional ball-player of ""Bang the Drum"" is to death. Although ""When the goin"" ""gets rough, the rough get goin"" is gleefully repeated, the amateurs are threatened from the start: They can't even protect their ball from a tiny child whose mother scornfully tells her to return their ""toy."" Then a teen-age boy joins their game and runs away with it. Stocky and pudgy bodies lurch and surge about, panting and stumbling and collapsing, but they can't catch the adolescent who politely calls them ""sir."" Equally funny and touching, this small film deserves a long life.Martin Scorsese's ""It's Not Just You Murray"" focuses on the development of hoods, as does his ""Mean Streets."" But his early picture is a spoof, centered on an amiable fellow who begins by making gin and ends up as a successful racketeer. What's pleasing throughout is the way that the narration contradicts what's taking place on the screen: A calm, cheerful voice accompanies the beatings and jailings and betrayals that appear as unavoidable hazards of the profession.All of these early works partake of parody, with one exception: George Lucas's ""Electronic Labyrinth."" Unfortunately, it also seems like a parodyof many other films about the dehumanized future. Actually, it served as a dry run for Mr. Lucas's ""THX1138,"" which concerned programed people with numbers stamped on their foreheads who were forbidden to love their ""mates."" Here, most of the film shows the man who rebelled against the system running through endless corridorsas though trying to flee from both the future and the past. A sense of panic is conveyed by the numbing whiteness of that labyrinth, but the actor's face can't manage to look frightened, and much of the film is just too clumsy to be chilling.Terrence Malick, who later made ""Badlands,"" is represented by ""Lanton Mills."" It's intended as a take-off on Westerns, but the acting is languid and stilted, and what comes through is a study in fatigue. Still, there are a couple of nice moments, as when two incompetent stick-up men warn a bankful of people not to ""get upset""and the unimpressed crowd isn't even ruffledor when a dying robber chats casually with the repentant cop who shot him. But the movie makes one doubt if there's a market for slow satire.Brian De Palma, whose films include ""Greetings"" and ""Sisters,"" reveals a rather gentle affection for old-fashioned horror in ""Woton's Wake,"" which parodies the styles of silent films. Woton grins and nods and squints like a number of your favorite monsters, as he chases his victims and sets them afire with a torch, or tries on wigs and fangs and noses with all the concentration of a beauty queen before the mirror. We could do without the shot of a mushroom cloud at the end, but otherwise this little pantomine of destruction works deftly and daftly.",1974-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Matsumoto's 'Demons' Is a Melodrama of Revenge,"Because humor is in such short supply at the movies these days, one must be forgiven searching for it in the wrong places, as in a long, seriously intended Japanese samurai film.Toshio Matsumoto's ""Demons,"" based on a Kabuki play, is not, strictly speaking, a samurai film. It is violent but not especially robust. The film is about the revenge wreaked by a shabby, down-at-the-heels samurai warrior on a faithless courtesan and her husband after the couple swindle the warrior out of the 100 ryo with which he was planning to buy back his good name.What makes it rather appealingly comic is not the English translation provided by vapid subtitles, though they are pretty funny, but the borrowed solemnity the director uses to decorate his movie, which looks like an expensive film-school exercise. It wears the furrowed brow of a 10-year-old boy struggling to recite ""Thanatopsis"" without having the vaguest idea what he's saying.Everything takes place at night, which permits a lot of fancy lighting effects: stark contrasts between light and shadowthat sort of thing. There are occasional confusions between the real and the imagined. Actions are repeated, as if time had gotten stuck in the groove of a record. If a scene doesn't look interesting enough photographed head-on, the director shoots it in slow motion or from above, using the old fly-on-the-ceiling shot.Nothing, however, succeeds in communicating the intensity of the passions of its poor hero. Told in this uninspired fashion, the tale of rage transformed to madness seems closer to farce than tragedy. Not helping much is a heavy emphasis on mistaken identities and curious coincidence. The style is soft, bogus, essentially frivolous, so that by the time a dying husband clasps the severed head of his wife to him for one last kiss, I was ready to say ""rats.""The film, which was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room Sunday, will be repeated there at noon and midnight today and tomorrow. Mr. Matsumoto, one of Japan's new young directors, was represented here last year by ""Funeral Parade of Roses,"" an equally solemn though even sillier melodrama about Tokyo drug pushers and male prostitutes and their lives of noisy desperation.",1974-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen:Shorts by Vlatko Gilic, Yugoslav, at Forum","Moisture makes dried blood flow again: there's a shock in that discovery as a hand scrubs the stained walls of a slaughterhouse, where men in white aprons prepare for the day's killing. ""In Continuo"" is one of four recent documentaries by the Yugoslav film maker Vlatko Gilic, who has won five prizes in his own country, several in Germany and deserves many more. His work can be seen at the Film Forum, at 256 West 88th Street, through Sunday and Jan. 24-27. Don't miss it.Within the slaughterhouse, the preparations are quite ritualistic, as the men carefully wash the floor and sharpen knives that aren't intended for carving cooked meatbut for cutting into live flesh. Suspense builds up to the carnage that we know will come. The animals' slaughter isn't shown; instead, thick blood oozes and swirls toward the gutters, and the evocation is more powerful than seeing the act itself. The men's serious, intent faces imply that there are no jokes on this job. At first, they seem like soldiers getting ready for battle  later, as though they're in the middle of a war.""One Day More"" centers on a murky stream outside a small Yugoslav town, where the mudbaths are said to cure even deadly diseases. Old and young sink to their chins in the dark liquid, some rub parts of their bodies with jetty slime. Heads seem to float on the water, while mist rises in a shot that Fellini might envy. The atmosphere is dense with concentration and bleak hope. You feel that these people are terribly worried and fearful about their bodies. They wait as though for a miracle. Finally, they shower, cheer up and chat noisilyin contrast to the anguished hush that held while they were in the stream.Deep concentration and preparation  while waiting for something to happen  are themes that recur in Mr. Gilic's work, whether his subjects are profoundly absorbed in butchery or in trying to regain lost health oras in ""'To Love""in one another. This film begins with a piece of machinery slowly moving in space: You can't tell what it is, but it's fascinating to watch it reach its destination. Again, there's suspense, which mounts to the satisfaction of seeing something accomplished. Eventually, we learn that two sides of a bridge are meeting in mid-air, and that we've been watching the key piece going into place. The mystery is solved in one shot, which also suggests the peril of working at great heights.One of the construction workers climbs to the ground, where his wife waits with a picnic. All their feelings are conveyed through their expressions; there are almost no words. While waiting, she looks both eager and apprehensive: Clearly, she's anxious about his safety. She spreads a white cloth in the wilderness and sets forth a feast with as much care and deliberation as the men give to working on the bridge. Affection surges through brief gestures: She pats his knee, he pushes a strand of hair out of her eyes while she beams at him. Mainly, they gaze at each other and eat, and that simple act reveals an extraordinary sense of intimacy.""Power"" shows a hypnotist giving his disciples  six young men with ultra-white skin and dead black hair  a lesson in dominating the will of others. They follow the master's wordless instructions like zombies, repeating many of his actions. They also direct one another's behavior. He slides a giant black needle through both his cheeks without apparent pain; they do the same, but some can't help wincing. A hand moves in front of eyes that look momentarily terrified  as though watching something hideous that we can't see. There's some groveling and hand-kissing and also some ecstasy afoot. The portrayal of the master's control of his followers is repellent  as it's obviously meant to be. But ""Power"" hasn't the same brilliance as the first three films, partly because the subjects seem self-conscious.Mr. Gilic's films are called documentaries. But he's superb at finding the astonishing images that lurk in the ordinary world. It's as if he'd nabbed some magic from the air and wedded it to facts. And it's a privilege to see through his eyes: Whatever interests him assumes a contagious excitement for us. It's evident that a major talent is already well developed, and since Mr. Gilic is in his mid-30's, we have a lot to look forward to.",1974-01-18T05:00:00+0000

The masque in Stuart England was a strange mixture of mythological poetry, political theory and polemic, opera, aweprovoking spectacle, amateur ballet, fancydress ball and formal party. Members of a tiny but centrally important audience would themselves participate, as allegorical and symbolic personages, acting out in formal patterned dances, done in spectacular but iconographic settings, a moral emblem whose meaning was revealed to, and whose results devolved upon, them all as princes and nobles of a great culture. A satiric anti(or antic) masque might also occur, but its disorder would usually be resolved in the central fable of fiction, at the end of which masquers and audience would join in the dances of the closing revels. The masque is lost to us not only in the way that Ben Jonson himself despaired of recovery by imagination, much less by description, a part of that spirit it had in the gliding by. For although taste and scholarship may allow us to simulate for ourselves the learning of James I, or the artistic connoisseurship of his son Charles, we can never be kings or princes, strongly affirming our role as moral and even metaphysical center or soul of the body politic, even at the moment as that body was beginning to declare the independence of its members, and",1974-01-20T05:00:00+0000

Fascinating because FlorenCe and Venice are among the great cities of the world, not merely physically, beautiful as they both are, but because for century after century their contribution to the arts and sciences of life has been quite remarkable. They were also creative cities in politics. Florence was far more experimental than Venice, forced as she was to adapt to those powerful external political forcesempire and papacy  which Venice managed to keep just at arm's length and so preserve for century after century a most remarkable oligarchy: remarkable because of the intricate checks and balances which preserved some liberty, allowed considerable participation in politics, kept corrupton within tolerable limits and created stability.Fascinating and spectacular as the story of Venice is, it has not been well served by its historians. Certainly aspects of Venetian historyits economic growth, its diplomatic skill, its involvement in the Crusades, its wars against the Turks, its treatment of poverty and certainly its architecture and artistic contribution have fascinated great scholars and produced exciting monographs, but there are scarcely any good onevolume histories of Venice. Frederic Lane's book will help to fill that gap.Prof. Lane is a careful scholar, deeply versed in Venetian history. He covers most comprehensively the story of Venice's rise from the mud flats and timber bUildings in the Lagoon to imperial greatness. He mentions Bellini, Carpaccio, Giorgione, Titian, Aretino. Guardi, Canaletto and the rest in a brief informative sentence or two.

us,Film: Absurdity of Ionesco's 'Rhinoceros' Is Reduced in Transition to Screen,"""People who try to hang onto their individuality always come to a bad end,"" says Stanley (Gene Wilder) in the last act of ""Rhinoceros,"" the American Film Theater's screen version of the Eugene Ionesco play that opened at selected theaters here yesterday.But do they always come to a bad end? Stanley, the hero of ""Rhinoceros,"" is an unreliable mouthpiece in an unreliable metaphor so grossly overdirected by Tom O'Horgan that you might get the idea Mr. O'Horgan thought he was making a movie for an audience made up entirely of rhinoceroses instead of people.Stanley, the mild-mannered, virtually identity-less office clerk, has admittedly had a terrifying time. He finds himself the only human being in a world where everyone else, for various reasons, is electing to turn into a rhinoceros.His best friend John (Zero Mostel), a fastidious, prissy man who always carries a pocket mirror and an extra necktie, has transformed himself right in front of Stanley's eyes. At first it seemed only that John had a pesky virus. His voice sounded hoarse and he was irritable. Later there was no doubt what was happening when, between whimpers, John began to paw the floor, snort angrily and exclaim that he really didn't hate people, he was simply indifferent to them.Daisy (Karen Black), Stanley's girl, tries to hold out but she too eventually gives in to the call of the wild: she can't resist the tremendous energy emanating from all the rhinoceroses now charging through the streets of the town that, in Julian Barry's adaptation of Ionesco, is situated not in France but in ""Anywhere, U.S.A."" ""Rhinoceros,"" which had a middling run on Broadway in 1961, is not ideal film material, being an example of the kind of theater of the absurd that should be played like old-time farce within a stylized, three-sided set or, perhaps, within no set at all. Even though the film never shows us any real rhinoceroses, the realism of the movie camera is undeniable. It reduces things absurd to the status of the merely silly.Mr. O'Horgan's direction has the effect of exposing all of the play's weaknesses and none of its merits. It is clumsily inventive and obtrusive. The same was true of his only other film, ""Futz,"" though it was probably responsible for his huge stage successes, ""Hair"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""Mr. Ionesco apparently wants us to see ""Rhinoceros"" as a parable about conformity and the contagion that could convert supposedly moral, rational people into the ecstatically mindless mobs that idolized Hitler as the last word in authority figures.The lesson is both very small and very fuzzy. It is so determinedly out of focus that one begins to wonder whether the playwright had any ideas in mind at all and, if he did, whether they work out the way he intended. Stanley talks in clichs about ""humanity"" and ""standards"" and is, at heart, quite as ignorant as the rhinoceros he disdains. He also has a lot less fun than they do. All of which adds up to a philosophical so-what.Mr. O'Horgan attempts to jazz up the film with music by Galt MacDermot (""Hair""), which is nice but superfluous, and with low comedy routines that he photographs in ways guaranteed to make them unfunny. The grace and continuity of a series of pratfalls are broken up into a lot of different, isolated shots. His feel for slapstick is as solemn as that of an archeologist photographing the individual bones of a dinosaur. For reasons best kept to himself the director also introduces into Ionesco a comparatively lyric dream sequence.Considering the material, and considering the obstacles they had to act around, through and over, the performers come off very well. Mr. Mostel, comparatively subdued, is extremely funny, whether he is outlining the regime Stanley is to follow to become a cultivated man, or whether he is slipping unaware into the early stages of rhinoceritis, munching the leaves of a potted plant.Mr. Wilder has an innate sweetness that neutralizes a lot of the dumbness of Stanley, a character called Berenger in the play but renamed in the movie, I suspect, to evoke unfairly the shade of the late great Stan Laurel. Miss Black, like Mr. Mostel, succesfully created a cartoon character out of pure flesh and blood, hers being a variation on Little Orphan Annie, though not so articulate.""Rhinoceros"" is the fourth in the American Film Theater's series of eight films based on stage plays. It may well be the least interesting.",1974-01-22T05:00:00+0000

Many of them migrate to this area from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and are a hardy breed. So are most of the birds that live here the year around. They are well feathered, with as much as a third again as many feathers in winter as in summer. They can live well on a wild diet.

us,Film: Wildlife in Peril,"Welcomeeven thanksto ""Vanishing Wilderness,"" a fine new film for the entire family that opened here yesterday in a mass showcase booking. This nature documentary reportedly has been mopping up financially in previous showings across the country and Canada, and no wonder.The feature is a documentary of wildlife, primarily in Alaska, the American North-west and the Florida Everglades. Photographed in beautiful color, with a splendid sweep of seasonal settings, it closes in marvelously on a richly varied assortment of beasts and birds, many of them threatened with extinction.The narration is easy, comfortable and interesting, rarely folksy, and, wonder of wonders, the plea for wildlife protection is made pointedly but casually. The camera, manned by a German photographer, Heinz Seilmann, says it all, hovering intimately over an extraordinary, untamed cavalcade, large to tiny.The picture swarms with wildlifeantelopes, mustangs, buffalo (""whose sad eyes tell their story""), geese, whooping cranes, pelicans, herons, alligators, caribou, big horn sheep, bears, water moose and many other species. The most beguiling scenes were those of a frisky little sea otter, beaver dam-builders and a spectacle of swarming fur-seals on the Pribilof Islands off Alaska, magnificently presented.A charmingly informal prelude shows the family of Arthur Dubs, who co-produced with Mr. Seilmann, riding the rapids in a boat on the Rogue River in Oregon.",1974-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Willie Dynamite' Tells Story of a Pimp,"""Willie Dynamite,"" which opened yesterday at the Demille, is another rip-off on the black exploitation film for which, I suppose, all sorts of sociological rationales are possible, though, in this case, I don't feel like making them.The movie, about the decline and fall of a black New York superpimp nicknamed Willie Dynamite, has a promising beginning. The costumes, language, melodrama, performances and even the soundtrack music are so outrageously broad it seems as if the film were putting itself on, parodying such earlier live-action black cartoons as ""The Mack"" and ""Cleopatra Jones,"" Not at all. It wants a piece of the same action.Willie Dynamite (Roscoe Orman), who dresses every morning as if he were going to a Mardi Gras ball before lunch, may not have happiness but he has everything else: a lavender-and-gold, supercharged Lincoln, a magnificent pad that looks like the Castro showroom on Duffy Square, a nice middle-class mother who lives in New Jersey and thinks he is some sort of artists' agent, and a stable of six super-women who have free run of what could be the New York Hilton.When the cops put the heat on whoring, Willie, idealistic loner that he is, refuses to join the city's other major pimps in a mutual-protection agency.The proud Willie is punished not by the gods but by the Internal Revenue Service, by the other pimps, by the cops and mostly by a former prostitute, played wanly by the late Diana Sands in her last film appearance, a character who, having gone straight, describes herself as ""a sort of Ralph Nader for hookers."" The film is under the peculiar impression that Mr. Nader operates on behalf of the retailer rather than the consumer.Before Willie meets his comeuppance, the movie indulges itself and us in a lot of dumb fantasies about how great it would be to be at the top of pimpdom, even if only for a little while. It talks pseudo hip, and it introduces (but never develops) an interesting character in the person of a black cop (played by Al Hall), who wears button-down shirts and Brooks Brothers suits and is, apparently, a Black Muslim.The film spends a good deal of its time ogling Willie's women, who are black, white, oriental and beautiful, but its menage is stupifying sentimental. The thing that convinces Willie to go straight is the death of his mink-stole-wearing mom, who has a heart attack when she learns where Willie's money really comes from. Says Willie through his tears: ""I did it all for her,"" or some such baloney.The movie was directed by Gilbert Moses, who has some good stage credits, including Melvin Van Peebles's ""Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death.""

But in comparison with the atmosphere that surrounded The Fight I, it's almost as if Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali were about to appear in an OldTimers Night production. In assessing them, now, the extent of deterioration is as important as the qualities they have retained. Neither has been the same since their classic confronCation nearly three years ago. The suspicion is that they destroyed each other that night. Frazier has been dethroned as the world heavyweight champion by George Foreman, who clubbed him down six times in less than two rounds. Ali has been outpointed by Ken Norton, who broke his jaw, and he has been bloodied by Bob Foster, the lightheavyweight titleholder. But heavyweights of the stature of Frazier, and Ali are almost an eodangered species. What they once were is enough to create another multimilliondollar promotion. But the rematch will diminish a memory that deserved to remain untarnished. The exceptional situation of 1971 produced a $20million extravaganza. Each gladiator was unbeaten. Each was considered the championFrazier by the boxing politicians, Ali by much of the boxing public. Each was at a comparable age. Frazier settled the controversy by earning a unanimous 15round decision that even Ali acknowledged at first. The next day, wincing with soreness, he",1974-01-27T05:00:00+0000

With the two-day run here earlier this week of Tom O'Horgan's film version of Ionesco's ""Rhinoceros,"" the American Film Theater has reached the halfway mark in its first subscription season designed to bring culture to the otherwise depressed, that is, the American moviegoer.That isn't exactly the way the AFT is described by Henry T. Weinstein, the organization's vice president in charge of creative affairs. He says its aim is to bring ""to audiences everywhere great works of the theater, performed by consummate artists, under the guidance of major directors, on film.""That definition is at my elbow in a press release I might not have read if, while scanning it, I hadn't gotten the impression it said that Mr. Weinstein, now planning the AFT's second season, was negotiating with Pirandello and Brecht. I'm aware that both playwrights have long since left us but I'm also aware that the AFT often thinks that it is thinking big. Actually the press release said that negotiations were going on with the estates of Pirandello and Brecht.Because the AFT is apparently a financial success, despite early ticket problems when a computer system broke down, and because it is apparently going into a second season in the fall, it is fair, I think, to assess what has been accomplished so far. Unlike a couple of my more enthusiastic colleagues, I didn't review the entire first season series last September on the basis of several reels of excerpts from the eight productions.Seen in New York so far have been O'Neill's ""The Iceman Cometh,"" directed by John Frankenheimer, Pinter's ""The Homecoming,"" directed by Peter Hall, Albee's ""A Delicate Balance,"" directed by Tony Richardson and, most recently, ""Rhinoceros."" Upcoming are ""Luther,"" ""Butley,"" ""Lost in the Stars"" and ""The Three Sisters.""With the exception of Peter Hall's fine production of ""The Homecoming,"" which works so well as a film that you don't pay any attention to its theatrical seams, the AFT looks to be producing a new type of filmone that may not ultimately be in the greatest demand. The AFT is manufacturing the Coffee Table Movie, something that is supposed to establish one's intellectual credentials by physical association. Purchase tickets but give them to your friends.I don't mean to sound furious about what the AFT is up to. These films won't harm anyone. They'll bore quite a few and perhaps make a lot of other people feel as if they've taken their culture vitamins for the year. The disappointing thing about the project to date is the smallness of the thinking, which, I'm afraid, accurately represents the extent of the so-called arts explosion in the United States.""The Iceman Cometh"" is a tremendous, primal theatrical experience, but was it really necessary to film it again just so we could have the dubious pleasure of witnessing Lee Marvin fail in the key role as Hickey? It was nice seeing Robert Ryan and Fredric March in this version, but nothing can convince me that it was worth doing if, in the archives somewhere, then exists a print of that extraordinary TV tape version directed by Sidney Lumet, produced by Worthington Miner and starring Jason Robards.Why can't the AFT be truly adventuresome? If they insist on raiding O'Neill, why not do something tough and probably recalcitrant like ""Strange Interlude"" or ""The Great God Brown""?For that matter, why did they choose Edward Albee's ""A Delicate Balance"" if they wanted to give audiences everywhere great works of the theater performed by consummate artists under the guidance of major directors on film?""A Delicate Balance"" is an interesting idea for a play, but it is not a great work of theater. It starts off as a satire of the type of comedy on which Broadway thrived for decades: people meeting politely in three-sided drawing rooms, talking a great deal more than necessary about how they like their martinis mixed (in an era in which people swig vodka on the rocks, the comic shock of the five-to-one martini has been lost), but instead of worrying about who isn't sleeping with whom, the crisis with which they're faced is their own emptiness. It sounds like a good idea for a play, but Albee's grasp of satire is ambiguous. You can't be sure what he's up to. The play becomes as vacuous as the form it is satirizing, and boredom sets in with the limp epigrams.Albee is a first-rate American dramatist, but why did the AFT elect to do his least interesting failure instead ofsaya double bill of ""The Death of Bessie Smith"" and ""The American Dream""? The answer probably is that a double bill of short films wouldn't be as good box-office as somethingin this case, anything  starring Katharine Hepburn, Paul Scofield, Lee Remick and Joseph Cotten. Those names, and the drawing room setting, I suspect, still mean something to those citizens of middle America for which the AFT was designed. It's all so highly cultivatedand so dead.With the exception of ""The Homecoming,"" none of the AFT productions has been quite the play it was written to be, or the film it is presented as being. None of the plays has been grossly ""opened up,"" except for ""Rhinoceros."" They've pretty much stuck to their original theatrical locales, but they've been photographed in that dumb tennis-match stylethe back-and-forth cutting from one medium close-up to anotherthat has about as much to do with the original theatrical experience as the intermissions with which the films are presented.Intermissions are a theatrical heritage. They're also a necessity. They give live actors a chance to catch their breath, but they have the effect of anesthetizing any movie worth its salt, especially any movie less than two or three hours long.The worst of the AFT ventures so far has been the O'Horgan version of ""Rhinoceros,"" which is not great Ionesco, and not great Theater of The Absurd, to begin with. O'Horgan, perhaps in desperation, has taken this slight and fuzzy parable, about a civilization where people break their necks to turn into rhinoceroses, and has tried to straighten out the defects of the stage version, in which Zero Mostel was the riveting object of all attention even though he played a secondary role.In spite of a lot of clumsy, badly choreographed slapstick, in spite of some nice music by Galt MacDermot and an extremely attractive performance by Gene Wilder, who plays the leading role, Zero Mostel still is the riveting object of attention in the film. The reasons are that Mostel is an audaciously surprising actor, even when you think you know his style, and that ""Rhinoceros"" is a far from interesting play. How much more provocative would have been screen versions (if possible) of Ionesco's ""The Bald Soprano"" and ""The Chairs""?Plays aren't films and films aren't plays, and three of the four AFT productions to date have landed in a no man's land between theater and film. With the exception of ""The Homecoming,"" they do not record for posterity great theatrical performances, and they do not add anything to one's cinematic experience. Almost any five-minute segment of Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" is a greater artistic experience (pardon my language) than any 60-minute segment of the AFT's ""Iceman,"" ""A Delicate Balance"" or ""Rhinoceros.""For years I've wished that there were some organization that would have as its function the presevation on film of great theatrical occasions. I think of Laurette Taylor in ""The Glass Menagerie,"" Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March end Florence Eldridge in ""The Skin of Our Teeth,"" Tallulah again in ""The Little Foxes,"" Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh doing their back-to-back ""Cleopatras,"" Ethel Merman shooting that stuffed seagull in ""Annie Get Your Gun."" I mean the simplest kind of preservation: the performance photographed, preferably from a fixed position, with no close-ups, no alternating two-shots, no cinematic junk.Today, of course, there are fewer and fewer theatrical occasions worth saving. Those that are worth saving will probably be bought by Hollywood anyway.The AFT seems bent on preserving, not really accurately, plays that either have already been better preserved by others, or plays that reflect not the vitality of the living theater but the poverty that is contributing to its decline. With its intermissions, its Playbill-like programs, its piety about great works of theater and consummate artists, the AFT is simply pumping stale air into the lungs of an audience that would be better revived by going out occasionally to see one of the works of a truly living cinema, be it ""Memories of Underdevelopment,"" ""Day for Night,"" ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Sleeper,"" ""Mean Streets,"" or ""Heavy Traffic.""",1974-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Coping,"When the Frank Skeffingtons were defeated, some of the heart went out of American politics. But the Irishand the unmeltable Americans generallyare not easily defeated, and John Kennedy led them to new heights of political power. For millions, Kennedy was their President in a way no other will ever be. But for those who were Kennedy's immediate lieutenants, the death of the captain brought more than grief. The cause had justified and even hallowed their compromises, those adaptations to secular, liberal, industrial society which also served their personal ambitions. Kennedy's death made it all seem a cheat; the alternative was to see the process as a selfdeception. No wonder that Daniel P. Moynihan felt the time had come to attack the selfserving shams of liberal orthodoxy. And how right it was for him to speak of that American tragedy in the language of an older wisdom: I don't suppose there is any point in being Irish if you don't know the world is going to break your heart eventually. None, indeed. But it is also in character for Moynihan today to describe that comment, with modern reticence, as somewhat maudlin. When Kennedy died, the old metal had been already melted; the compromises had gone too far; there was no Way home from Mera",1974-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Tucker of Princeton University published the first installment of a projected threevolume biography of the Soviet leader, tracing his career up to the consolidation of his dictatorship in 1929. And now we have a full onevolume biography by Adam B. Ulam of Harvard, which is likely to remain the most detailed and comprehensive study of Stalin until Hacker's ambitious trilogy is completed. Not surprisingly, both new books devote considerable space to Stalin's meteoric rise to power. The son of a Georgian cobbler, Stalin was unimpressive both in physicalappearance and in intellectUal attainments, cutting an undistinguished figure in comparison with his fellow Bolshevik leaders. He could boast neither Lenin's immense prestige nor Bukharin's personal charm nor Trotsky's literary and oratorical gifts. To Sukhanov, the perceptive chronicler of the Russian Revolution, he was a grey blur, which flickered obscurely and left no trace. Yet after Lenin's death in 1924 Stalin quickly rose to the summit of power and became one of the greatest tyrants in history, faired and worshiped both in his own country and around the globe. No other man has wielded such unlimited authority over so manypeople during so long and critical a period. In the course of his 25year reign, Russia underwent one of the most sweeping social and economic transformations in modern times, becoming the second greatest industrial, scientific and military power in the world. For this achievement, however, the Russian people paid, a price in suffering and loss of freedom far greater than that paid by any other nation for its",1974-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Possibly the hobby's major organizations are studying the provisions of the law to determine how it can best be implemented; hopefully, one or more groups are even now making quiet, behindthescenes preparations for an allout drive to get rid of replicas that are not so marked and to force manufacturers to observe the law by placing the word copy in an ineradicable way (preferably incused) in a prominent area on the obverse or reverse of all replicas produced from now on. But while the big boys are checking out the situation, one individual collector has decided that the mere existence of the law is. a base strong enough to support an attack. Last month Andrew Reiz of Kansas City, Mo., read a report that the Israel government was planning to reproduce quantities of rare ancient Jewish coins for sale to tourists. The report did not say whether or not part of the reproductions, so he reasoned that a friendly word of warning might nip this problem in the bud.

But, as the casino operators well know, the odds are that you will leave some of your money at the tables. In fact, gamblinggaming, as it is officially called hereis so inevitable that, for those who need guidance on the various ways one can be separated from his money, I herewith offer a brief rundown on the types of games and give you my own trusty system for meeting the challenge. Your resistance will be tested immediately at McCarran International Airport. A young lady in the baggage claim area will provide change to feed the battery of onearmed bandits along the wall. Thereafter you will see slot machines virtually everywhere you go. The casinos offer craps, blackjack roulette, baccarat and slots. Stakes range from a penny to $25 a shot with most casino games having a minimum of $1 or $2 roll. Keno something like bingo can be played from comfortable chairs on most casino levels. It takes as little as 60 cents a game and the top prize is $25,000. There is poker. There are gaming parlors where you can bet on any horse or dog race in the country. Most of the large hotels provide guests with brochures explaining the casino games. A more thorough basic grounding can be obtained from a series of six booklets published. by the Gambler's Book Club, 8 East Charleston Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nev. 89104. The Facts of Craps sells for $1 as does each of the rest of the series, covering blackjack, roulette, baccarat, keno and slots. The books can be purchased at newsstands in Las Vegas as well as at Newark and La Guardia airports in the New York area and by mail. Most dealers, if they are not especially busy, will give beginners a helping hand.
