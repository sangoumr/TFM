This young Indian musician, making his first New York appearance, plays the sitar in a style that has little to do with the bravura pyrotechnics of Ravi Shankar. All Indian instrumental music is rooted in the ancient traditions of Indian vocal music, but the school of players to which Mr. Parvez belongs particularly emphasizes voice-like phrasing and lyricism. He will be accompanied by Vijay Ghate, a tabla drummer. The concert begins tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $10 at the door. Wayne Shorter Quintet and Jack DeJohnette's Special Edition with Lester Bowie, Beacon Theater, 74th and Broadway (496-7070). Some people like Wayne Shorter's recent recorded music, a commingling of computer-assisted synthesizer systems with the saxophonist-composer's characteristically oblique lyricism. Some people don't. But on his recent visits to New York, Mr. Shorter was playing with such inventive intensity that listeners forgot all about those recent records. The drummer Jack DeJohnette's band, with the ferocious Greg Osby on alto saxophone and Lester Bowie's thrust-and-jab trumpet, should get things off to a rousing start tomorrow night at 8. Reserved seat tickets are $18.50 at the Beacon Theater box office, at all Ticketron outlets (399-4444), and through Teletron (947-5850).",1987-05-01T05:00:00+0000

When Jacques le Balleur, the Calvinist monk at the center of this bizarre short novel, is captured by Tupinili cannibals in the Brazilian jungle in 1560, his primary concern is that he will become the pagan tribe's next meal. In his pocket, however, the Tupinili find 10 pages from the complete works of Rabelais, and they mistakenly identify that ribald 16th-century French text as the Bible they were promised by a previous missionary. To their great delight, they discover that the much-anticipated Good Book is remarkably in tune with their own customs and inclinations, which (as Jacques himself soon learns) are not exactly of a character that Maitre Calvin would approve of. To reward the bringer of such an agreeable ''holy'' text, therefore, the grateful natives decide that Jacques, rather than becoming their dinner, should become their king. He naturally accepts the position, and with it the responsibilities (which include keeping a harem and engaging in all sorts of libidinous rituals), but this conscientious man of God is careful at the same time to instruct his new subjects in true Christian principle. ''Thus are we slowly becoming a Christian community,'' Jacques writes in his monthly reports to the outside world, ''though a visitor newly arrived from Geneva might detect unorthodoxy.''

us,NO LONGER IN HIDING,"THESE DAYS, IF A WOMAN LEANS FORWARD and a bit of an essential underpinning shows, it is not considered a fashion faux pas. Quite the opposite. Today's teddies, brassieres, bustiers, camisoles and corselettes are designed to be seen, and not just in the boudoir. The best do the things they have always been intended to do - help support or shape up a comely figure. But they can also serve as an integral part of a fashion statement. Such underpinnings are as stylishly designed nowadays as what is intended to go over them. Very often, necklines are cut to deliberately reveal a hint of what used to be hidden. And even working women who dress in a rather tailored manner on the outside will confess to the pleasure of knowing they have on something redolent of femininity on the inside. Young women, emulating the attire of pop stars, have inspired the return of the boned corselette. They wear this strapless contraption as the top of their get-up - or over their T-shirts. Older fashionable women, however, have taken up the corselette as the right thing to wear under low-fastening or clinging evening wear. Many name designers, including Italy's Valentino, are now producing feminine underthings. Some, like Parisian Jean-Paul Gaultier, are even designing cocktail dresses of old-time corset materials styled to spoof the original item. But these are advanced - a fashion advisable only for the very special woman and, then, for a very special occasion. -",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

(Rowan Tree Press, 124 Chestnut Street, Boston, Mass. 02108, $13.95.) ''This is living,'' wrote Wilhelm Dinesen in 1886, summing up a description of long days of hunting (''you hunt alone'') and nights of dining (''white tie and tails) on fresh game. ''Boganis: Letters From the Hunt'' details the joys and demands of a way of life that Dinesen's daughter Karen would celebrate 50 years later in ''Out of Africa.'' Born in 1845 into the Danish nobility, Dinesen spent a restless youth wandering and soldiering, and lived for two contented years in Wisconsin, hunting and trapping with the Indians whose ways he assumed. The Chippewas gave him the name he would latter use as a pseudonym, Boganis, meaning hazelnut. He returned to Denmark, married and fathered five children, the second of whom, Karen, was to inherit his passion for nature; he committed suicide when she was 10 years old. Written during hunting expeditions in Scandinavia and appearing now for the first time in English, ''Letters From the Hunt'' displays heightened powers of observation and insight into the complex systems of seasons, climates and migrations. Despite his enthusiasm for hunting, Dinesen believed that man has a responsibility to manage and preserve wildlife, and repeatedly urged the restriction of ''hunting to some extent through protective wildlife legislation.'' The hunter and his prose aspire to the same virtues: restraint, discipline, precision. (Ocassional lapses into verse disavow this ideal.) Dispersed throughout the letters are bits of homely wisdom and advice on topics both practical and genteel: fishing lures, dogs, menu planning, love, duck farming, haberdashery, taxidermy, conoe making and woman's place in the hunt (at home). The letters conjure the image of an independent, well-fed, expert sportsman of a particular time and place - a Natty Bumppo in spats.",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

Carrying 119 pounds, including Randy Romero, the 5-year-old daughter of Apalachee posted sizzling quarter-mile fractions of 0:21 3/5 and 0:44 on her way to a time of 1:21 1/5 for seven furlongs. The time was only fourth-fifths of a second slower than the stakes record set by King's Bishop in 1973. The track record is 1:20 1/5 by Dr. Fager in 1968. Pine Tree Lane earned $170,400 for her owner, Leonard D. Mathis, and paid $4.20 for $2 to win as the favorite. King's Swan was runner-up in the field of six, 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Zany Tactics. Love That Mac, Cutlass Reality and Purple Mountain completed the order of finish. Pine Tree Lane survived two claims of foul. Chris Antley, the rider of King's Swan, and Eddie Maple, on Love That Mac, said they had been interfered with by the mare on leaving the starting gate. But the stewards disagreed. Pine Tree Lane scored her fifth victory in six starts this year. Don't Forget Me Newmarket Winner: Don't Forget Me upset the favored Ajdal to win the 2,000 Guineas yesterday at Newmarket, England. The 3-year-old colt, ridden by Willie Carson, never trailed in winning at odds of 9-1. Bellotto, ridden by Pat Eddery, was second at 7-1. Most Welcome crossed the finish line in third place, but after a steward's inquiry the horse was disqualified for interfering with Ajdal two furlongs from home. Midyan, ridden by Steve Cauthen, was moved up from fourth to third. Ajdal was fifth. (AP) HOCKEY U.S. Finishes in Seventh Place: The United States wound up seventh in the World Hockey Championships yesterday with a 7-4 victory over Switzerland, which did not have a victory, while West Germany played a 2-2 tie with Finland in the final game of the relegation pool. The Americans finished with four victories and six losses. But the point West Germany gained from its tie with Finland meant the West Germans finished with 9 points compared to the Americans' 8. As a result, the West Germans wound up sixth and the United States seventh. Bob Brooke of the Minnesota North Stars and Ed Olzcyk of the Chicago Blackhawks scored two goals each.(AP) GOLF Baldwin Captures Richardson Title: John Baldwin, the current amateur stroke-play champion of the Metropolitan Golf Association, captured the William D.

In the competition, named after the late golf writer of The New York Times, Baldwin, who plays out of Meadow Brook, ran up a four-hole lead in the first five holes and never was caught. In the morning semifinals Baldwin eliminated Howard Aal of Middle Bay, 3 and 2, and Keller eliminated Ed Sallie of I.B.M., 2 and 1. TENNIS Lendl Holds Off Carlsson: Ivan Lendl came within 2 points of a shocking defeat by Kent Carlsson of Sweden in the German Open yesterday at Hamburg, West Germany, but came back in devastating style to earn a place in the final against Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia. Carlsson was serving for the match at 6-3, 5-4 and led by 30-15 before Lendl won the next 3 points and squared the set at 5-5. The top-seeded Lendl then overpowered the third-seeded Swede and won the next eight games to wrap up the semifinal match, 3-6, 7-5, 6-0.

Lavern Linton and Keisha Demas earned watches as prizes on all three winning Tilden teams. Loughlin won the boys' distance medley and 3,200-meter relays.

This collection of interviews, government statements, opposition leaflets and posters and photographs is as vivid a slice of life as can be found since the South African Government clamped down on press coverage, especially photographic, of this tormented country. Julie Frederikse, a National Public Radio correspondent, has written a text weaving together this reporter's scrapbook of the years 1980-84, during which the antiapartheid movement gathered steam and declared what amounts to war on the Government and its supporters. ''South Africa: A Different Kind of War'' does not pretend to be analysis; it simply puts before the reader the stark images of apartheid and protest. In doing so, it becomes a valuable primary resource. The author could have been more helpful in guiding the reader through the chronicle and its accompanying images (there are no captions; all materials are identified at the back of the book). Yet the voices are authentic, the story unrelievedly grim. When we reach the conclusion, it seems self-evident: ''If the government and its opponents agree on nothing else, it is that South Africa's future will be resolved through war.''",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"STORIES. By Cesare Pavese. Translated by A. E. Murch. (Ecco, $12.95.) In 1950 the Italian novelist and poet Cesare Pavese committed suicide at the age of 41, just three months after receiving his country's highest literary prize, the Premio Strega, for his novel ''Among Women Only.'' Numerous short works of fiction were found among his papers; the present collection includes 22 examples, of varying length and quality, rather ploddingly translated by A. E. Murch. Pavese, like certain hostile and forbidding landscapes, inspires a kind of unwilling fascination. His outlook on the human condition is unremittingly bleak; man is lonely, alienated and unable to communicate with his fellow creatures. Character never changes, it merely reveals itself, generally in unhappy love affairs that underscore the impossibility of understanding between men and women. The ruling emotion for Pavese is a deep longing for solitude, which he sees alternately as delicious freedom or incarceration. Not surprisingly, the figure of the prisoner looms large in these stories (Pavese himself was jailed and sentenced to internal exile under the Fascists). In ''The Intruder,'' a young man shares a cell with an old jailbird. There he learns two lessons: that life teaches one to be alone, and that every man has a congenital fault line along which he breaks, given enough pressure. Poised midway between fable and naturalistic slice of life, Pavese's tales intertwine the day-to-day routine of ordinary folk with the mythic power of rivers and fields - which often engage his characters' emotions more profoundly than any human being. Pavese's stories rely on a limited number of humble props: sometimes no more than a table, a cigarette and a glass of wine. At his best, the author masterfully blends character and setting, unabashedly placing the pathetic fallacy at the service of high art.",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

A professional team has to balance the need to increase revenues with cable television and the need to encourage fan loyalty. With that in mind I have a proposal. Negotiate a contract with the cable outlet and the broadcast company so that the previous year's attendance dictates the present year's quantity of games on free television. An example would be: Attendance of 3 million gives 120 free games, 2.5 million gives 100 free games, 2 million gives 90 free games, and 1.5 million gives 70 free games.

Shapiro has served as president of the University of Michigan, one of the country's best public research universities. Now the 51-year-old economist will be switching to the private sector. On Tuesday the trustees of Princeton University announced that by January he will succeed William G. Bowen, becoming the 18th president of the country's fourth oldest university. Mr. Shapiro, a native of Montreal who received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1964, spoke to Edward B. Fiske of The New York Times. Excerpts of the interview follow: Question. Do you expect it to be difficult moving from a large public university to a small private one? Answer. I don't think so. My style of management has always been fairly personal, and I'm very much attracted by the chance to focus on undergraduate education at a place that maintains a commitment to high-level scholarship. Princeton has three times as many undergraduates as graduates. Q. Do you have any mandates from the trustees? A. It's always a struggle to sustain high quality, but no, I don't have any special mandates. I see my job at the beginning as one of listening, not making announcements about what Princeton needs. Q. A lot of people are concerned about soaring tuitions. Is there anything colleges can do about it? A. We have two responsibilities. The first is to be efficient. Even though we have no ''bottom line'' in a traditional sense, we have to have internal discipline. At Michigan I required every vice-president to send me a memo every six months with some sort of proposal for eliminating a procedure or cutting the flow of paper. Sometimes I accepted the recommendation, sometimes I didn't. Q. And what is the second responsibility? A. We have to care about quality. Q. That's fine, but a lot of people are concerned about the amount of debt that students are having to accumulate in order to get high-quality education. A. In relation to total household debt in this country, you'd hardly notice if all the higher education debt went away. Every society has to decide how much quality education it wants and for how much. It's really not a matter for universities to decide. It's a much broader question. I, of course, have my own answer. Q. What is that? A. The answer that I hear is that people want quality education. When people choose where to go to college, they always choose quality irrespective of cost. People were always willing to pay more for the University of Michigan if that was the best quality option they had. Q. Are you concerned about the declining presence of blacks and some other minorities on campuses? A. It is an extraordinarily dangerous situation. . . . If the trend continues, it will undermine public support for colleges and universities among minorities, who constitute an important segment of the population. Moreover, the country's future depends on educating all parts of American society. Q. At Michigan you've recently dealt with racial incidents. What did you learn? A. I came away from the situation with a greater sense of urgency and a recognition that the simple solutions of the 60's are no longer adequate. In the past, many minority students were coming from high schools where the student population was mixed. Now they are coming from schools that are mainly black.",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

Eric Burdon's autobiography should dispel any illusions readers may have about the romance of being a rock star in the 1960's. Mr. Burdon, leader of the now-defunct band the Animals, begins this cautionary tale with upbeat memories of his working-class roots in Newcastle, England, and his first exposure to American blues at the Newcastle College of Art and the Liverpool and London club scenes. But his story is mostly one of disappointments. While the success of the band's first big single, ''House of the Rising Sun,'' secured the Animals an American tour, they had not bargained for the hordes of intrusive fans and the disorientation of living on the road. Mr. Burdon reminisces about his first visits to the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where he saw his heroes James Brown and B. B. King; the Animals' tour through the American South in the summer of 1965; and his encounters with Ronald Kirk, Chuck Berry and Otis Redding. However, he spends as much time describing nights of anonymous sex, confused acid trips and the tax dodge his manager set up that cost the band their millions. By 1966, when Mr. Burdon left the Animals and moved to California, he recalls not the peace and love of Haight-Ashbury, but Hell's Angels beating up people at the Fillmore and the death of his friend Jimi Hendrix in London. Though one can't help feeling that much of Mr. Burdon's insight into the era is unconscious, it hardly matters. Taken as social history, his autobiography stands as a vivid record of what has now become pop mythology.",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

Kim is Ms. Gordimer's witty reference to Kipling's famous tale of colonial life. Her family has also called the child Hillela, a name she has never used, a name meant to honor her great grandfather, a Zionist, who came steerage to Cape Town fleeing the Cossacks in a forgotten pogrom, but the girl Hillela, with no mind for history, simply wants to be different.

Susanna Kaysen's first novel is a fascinating story of the powers of invention: how most lovers half create the object of their affections, and how artists elevate ordinary persons, objects and events to a kind of mythology. The book begins with the romantic species of invention, as Dinah Sachs, a 30-year-old copy editor at a semi-scholarly magazine in Cambridge, Mass., falls madly in love with Asa Thayer, a married editor of old New England stock, some dozen years her senior. But midway into the history of their doomed affair, Dinah points out that such a story is ''old and boring,'' and the novel changes its course. It becomes Dinah's semi-fictional rendering of Asa's adolescent admiration for and quasi-sexual attraction toward Reuben Sola, a charismatic Jewish youth who is the son of a Harvard professor and art collector. Ms. Kaysen vividly describes Asa's Cambridge boyhood, and especially the emotional tenor of his love for Reuben -whose passion for adventure leads ultimately to tragedy. Art, in the form of a painting evocative of Reuben, acts as a minor solace for Asa. In the same way, the creative process comforts the disillusioned Dinah when she begins writing her story of Asa. Occasionally, this multilayered narrative wobbles on vague sociological underpinnings - the ''soulless'' WASP Asa loving Jews for their ''access to passion'' smacks of stereotyping. But it is a tribute to Ms. Kaysen's considerable talent that when she leaves ethnic generalities for the particularities of character, we easily believe in all her inventions.",1987-05-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"QUESTION: When Roger Clemens set the major league record for strikeouts in a game last season against the Seattle Mariners, were his current teammates, Spike Owen and Dave Henderson, among the 20 batters he struck out? Certainly, and they accounted for 25 percent of Clemens's strikeout total on April 29, 1986. Henderson, the center fielder, went down all three times he batted - in the third, sixth and eighth innings - and Owen, the shortstop and leadoff batter, struck out in the first and last innings. Owen's strikeout leading off the ninth inning gave Clemens 19, tying the major league mark. But the fly to center Owen hit his previous time up in the sixth inning ended a string of eight straight batters struck out by Clemens, and prevented Clemens from breaking an American League mark. In a six-player deal nearly four months after the 3-1 Boston victory, Henderson and Owen were sent to the Red Sox, where Henderson struck out 15 more times and Owen 9 more while playing the last six weeks of the season on Clemens's side. QUESTION: How successful was Don Mattingly, runner-up in the American League most valuable player voting, when he batted last year against Roger Clemens, winner of the award? Just a bit less successful than he was against the other pitchers in the league. The Yankee first baseman batted .352 in 1986 and hit .333 against Clemens in their 12 confrontations, getting four of his league-leading total of 238 hits against the Boston right-hander. Clemens got one of his league-leading total of 238 strikeouts against Mattingly. All the hits were singles and none drove in any runs. QUESTION: Why is Roy Campanella, who never hit more than 41 homers in a season, listed in the record books as the catcher with the most home runs in a season? Didn't Johnny Bench hit 45 one year? Bench's home run total for Cincinnati in 1970 does indeed exceed the amount hit by Campanella with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1953, but not all the homers by Bench came when his position was catcher during that season, nor did all of Campanella's. There were 38 homers in Bench's 140 games behind the plate in 1970, 6 in his 23 appearances as an outfielder and 1 in the 12 games he performed at first base (some of the positions overlapped in games). Campanella's total is not pure because he hit 40 homers in his 140 games as catcher in 1953 and hit another homer as a pinch-hitter.",1987-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q.Why do birds molt? A.Molting is determined by a combination of physiological and environmental changes, such as breeding, light and temperature. Most birds shed their feathers once a year just after breeding, but some species molt while breeding, and still others molt after breeding and before migration. Some birds even molt while on their winter grounds. Birds that have a very bright plumage during breeding and dull feathers in the off season molt twice a year. In the molting process, old feathers are replaced by new ones that grow in the same follicle. Q.How is prestressed concrete made? A.Most concrete that is used in the construction of buildings, highways and bridges contains steel reinforcing to increase its strength. Concrete is about 10 times as strong in compression as it is in tension, so steel rods or cables are placed within to carry the tensile stresses, according to Dalton Hamilton, vice president of the Trinity Engineering Testing Corporation. The steel reinforcement has defaced edges that allow it to bond to the concrete as it dries. Tensile loads placed on the structure are then transferred through the concrete to the reinforcing bars, Mr. Hamilton said. In prestressed concrete, the steel reinforcement is stretched between abutments and concrete is poured on top and allowed to harden. This is called pretensioning because the steel is stretched before the concrete matures.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: TUESDAY, MAY 5, 1987","THE ECONOMY American business productivity rose at a 1.8 percent rate in the first three months of the year. The increase, which followed two quarterly declines, was accompanied by a sizable reduction in labor costs as hourly compensation rose by the smallest amount in more than 25 years. Experts noted that productivity figures were volatile, and they warned against drawing premature conclusions, as the debate intensifies about whether the U.S. can increase its productivity to meet world competition. [ Page A1. ] The Supreme Court said Rotary Clubs could not exclude women if the states in which they were based outlawed such discrimination. The unanimous ruling reinforced arguments that the Constitution does not protect sex discrimination by most all-male private clubs, especially those often used for business purposes. [ A1. ] Farmers are openly optimistic about their prospects, as are their suppliers and agricultural economists. Profits are up, debts and costs are down, and the outlook is for more of the same, at least through 1987, they agree. [ A16. ] MARKETS Prices of Government bonds fell sharply on the eve of three days of Treasury note and bond auctions, as dealers cut prices to attract foreign and domestic investors. But trading remained light, and potential buyers were generally silent about their intentions. Information from the financial centers in London and Tokyo was scanty because of holidays. [ D1. ] The Commodity Exchange shortened hours and lifted limits on some price swings as it tried to resolve problems left over from last week's unusually active and volatile trading in precious metals, especially silver. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was monitoring the exchange's emergency actions. [ D1. ] Silver again led the advance in precious metals futures, with spot silver up 51.8 cents, to $8.685, its highest level since June 1984. [ D20. ] Stocks had another seesaw session, ending slightly higher on sharply lower volume. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.82 points, to 2,286.22, after losing ground much of the day. [ D10. ] The dollar fell to new lows in light trading reduced by holidays in Tokyo and London. In New York, gold rose $5.50, to $462.50. [ D1. ] COMPANIES Church's Fried Chicken received a $469 million takeover offer from an investor group led by two former executives. Church's, the nation's second-largest fast-food chicken operation, said its board would consider the offer, which is valued at $12.25 a share. [ D1. ] First Boston and Allegheny International ended their merger, a $500 million deal, saying they had been unable to obtain two-thirds of Allegheny's preferred stock. [ D5. ] Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's had 20 percent gains in operating income last year over 1985, and sales rose about 15 percent, according to their parent company, Batus Inc. [ D4. ] The former president of a defunct brokerage was convicted of tax fraud in Federal court in Newark. The jury reached no verdict on securities fraud charges against Gilbert C. Schulman, who headed Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc. until its collapse. [ D17. ] The William Esty agency resigned the Mastercard account, after losing Nissan's $140 million account late last week. The Mastercard assignment, worth about $40 million annually, had been Esty's for 10 years but was under review. [ D25. ] Zapata will give its creditor banks a 30 percent stake to pay off a portion of its debt. [ D4. ] INTERNATIONAL World Bank lending to developing nations could be imperiled if the dollar continues to fall, according to the president of the huge lending institution, Barber B. Conable Jr. He also announced changes intended to raise efficiency by slashing up to 10 percent from the staff of 6,000 and restructuring top management. [ D1. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Taxpayers face a mismatch in disputes with the I.R.S. And some lawmakers are questioning whether the agency has too much power and taxpayers too few protections. Tax Watch.

Page A1 The testimony of Richard V. Secord at the Congressional hearings should give the first detailed public accounting of both the secret arms sales to Iran and the covert operation to supply the Nicaraguan rebels, investigators said. A12 South African riot police arrested 120 students and fired tear gas at about 50 faculty members at the University of the Witwatersrand as they protested the whites-only election scheduled for Wednesday. A3 U.S. envoys may have broken rules against unauthorized socializing with foreigners in sensitive posts overseas, a State Department official said. The Department is investigating several cases. A13 A draft arms reduction treaty by the United States will be given to Soviet negotiators. The draft treaty on reducing long-range nuclear weapons ignores the issue of space-based defenses and other unresolved differences. A14 Lebanon's Prime Minister resigned after three years in office. Rashid Karami said his 10-member half Moslem, half Christian Cabinet had failed to resolve any of the country's political and economic problems. A10 Yiddish is flourishing in Moscow, according to the principal spokesman for official Soviet Jewish culture. ''The obstacles that hampered our forward movement have been removed,'' Aron Vergelis said. A15 A musical old-timer at age 10, Stefan Milenkovic gave his 424th violin recital last week in Paris.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, MAY 6, 1987","MARKETS Interest rates fell modestly as the Treasury sold $10 billion of three-year notes, the first of three auctions this week. After the sale, prices of notes and bonds rose modestly. Experts said that trading was affected by attractive yields and rumors of heavy Japanese participation. The firming of the market and the decline in rates prodded stock prices upward. [ Page D1. ] Fears of revived inflation led the Fed to raise rates, the central bank's vice chairman said. The official, Manuel Johnson, said that higher rates posed some risks but that the increases need not last for long. [ D6. ] The Dow Jones industrial average surged 51.85 points, its fourth-best point gain ever, to 2,338.07. Volume was up sharply to 192.3 million shares, with blue chips and technology and pharmaceutical stocks leading the way. [ D1. ] The dollar was slightly higher in world markets, but dealers did not attach much significance to the move because trading activity was extremely light. Gold fell $4.25 an ounce, to $458.25. [ D17. ] Silver futures were volatile again, climbing more than 30 cents an ounce, then falling almost 70 cents before steadying to close down 32 to 38 cents. Gold futures also fell. [ D17. ] THE ECONOMY The House passed a $5 billion F.S.L.I.C. rescue package, after rejecting a $15 billion package backed by the Democratic leadership. The defeat of the larger package was a major lobbying victory for the industry's biggest trade group. [ D1. ] Mortgage rates continued to climb, reaching double-digits last month for the first time since last summer. Some analysts said rates would ease; others said they could move higher. [ D1. ] Auto sales grew stronger in the final 10 days of April, finishing 0.3 percent below an unusually strong 1986 period. Analysts said the effects were fading of the new tax law, which cut deeply into sales early in the year by creating a buying surge late last year. [ D5. ] Senate Democrats agreed on a 1988 budget that would force the President to support tax increases in exchange for more military spending. The White House said it opposed the plan. [ A33. ] COMPANIES Burlington said it might seek control of Dominion Textile, Canada's largest textile producer and a partner with the investor Asher B. Edelman in a takeover offer for Burlington. Burlington, the nation's largest textile manufacturer disclosed its plans in a suit filed in Montreal. [ D1. ] The foreclosure of the Herald Center is sought in a suit filed by a mortgage company, raising the possibility that the lender might seek to acquire the troubled Manhattan shopping mall. [ D2. ] The chairman of E. F. Hutton Group will resign today, officials at the firm said. Robert Fomon has held the post for 16 years. [ D2. ] Citicorp is buying the other half of its Australian brokerage subsidiary, Clarke Vickers. [ D4. ] Marvin Davis, the oilman, wants to buy Spectradyne, the leading supplier of pay-per-view movie systems to hotels and motels. The deal would be worth $353 million at current market value. [ D4. ] Black-owned businesses had strong gains in sales last year, led by auto dealerships. But a number of companies faced greater competition or reduced their work forces. [ D5. ] Morgan Stanley plans mandatory drug tests for all employees, officials at the investment bank said. Current and new employees worldwide would be affected. [ D19. ] TECHNOLOGY A pall is hanging over the robotics industry, and a trade show in Chicago did little to dispel it, as Cincinnati Milacron, Westinghouse, I.B.M. and General Electric stayed away. [ D8. ] Auto makers are turning their attention to four-wheel steering, which would be a boon to parallel parkers. Mazda will offer a model this fall with rear wheels that turn side-to-side.

us,PIANO: 5-HOUR WORK,"WHEN music became restless some three centuries ago, purity of tuning was its principal victim. A new method evolved that ''dirtied'' pure ratios of sound held inviolable since codification by the ancient Greeks. Created in its place was a kind of compositional rapid transit system, a network of roads to adventure whereby composers could spring unencumbered from tonality to tonality. D flat and C sharp, for example, are by nature slightly different sounds, yet ''equal temperament,'' as it is called, squeezed them into the same space on the keyboard. Thus a single black key serves both as terminus for one sound world and a launching place into another. Almost all the music we hear today is calibrated in this way.",1987-05-07T05:00:00+0000

The rule specifically includes agreements that do not take effect until after the athlete's last game. The report from a three-member committee appointed by the university president, James O. Freedman, identified the players only as ''Student A'' and ''Student B.'' But at a news conference to release the report, committee member David Vernon identified ''Student A'' was Ronnie Harmon, the former running back. Freedman organized the committee after published reports said Harmon, a first-round draft choice now with the National Football League's Buffalo Bills, received up to $54,000 from Walters in 1984 and 1985. The committee report said it uncovered money orders from Walters to the two players, with Harmon getting a total of $1,000 in four payments and the other player $575.",1987-05-07T05:00:00+0000

The play postulates a New York whose daily plagues range from noise and air pollution, power blackouts and obscene phone calls to violent struggles between random snipers and proto-fascist cops. Unfortunately for the prophetic Mr. Feiffer, this work had its Broadway premiere in 1967, a year too early. ''Little Murders'' expired after a single week, only to be ''rediscovered'' two years later by theatergoers (and Hollywood) in a hit Off Broadway revival. While the second staging was superior to the first, the improvement wasn't that marked. What really made the difference between 1967 and 1969 was 1968's new round of nationally televised murders, little and otherwise: assassinations, ghetto conflagrations, the Chicago police in blazing riot.",1987-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"ON SECORD'S SECOND DAY: MORE ABOUT NORTH, THE CONTRAS AND THE PRESIDENT","In his second day of testimony yesterday as the opening witness at the Congressional hearings in Washington, Richard V. Secord continued his account of how the Iran-contra affair unfolded. Here, as recorded by The New York Times, are excerpts from his testimony. A MILLION-DOLLAR FUND Q. You testified that you got in November a million dollars, the purpose of which was transportation costs. That I take it would have covered the five shipments which were contemplated at that time and only occurred. Does that mean that you spent substantially less than the full million dollars on transportation? A. Yes. We spent, I think it was $130,000 to the 707 operator and another sum of money for a leased Lear jet. So all together, less than $200,000 was expended in support of that project. Q. So more than $800,000, which had been put in by the Israelis remained in Lake Resources? A. That's correct. Q. What happened to that money? A. Well, I assumed that they would ask for their money back, but they didn't. And I discussed this with North, also. And later, I believe late December, he told me that they were not going to ask for it back and we could use it for whatever purpose we wanted. We actually expended it on the contra project. Q. Did you and North discuss the fact that you had spent it on the contra project? A. Yes. Q. Did he indicate where the idea came from to use it for the contra project? A. I think it was his idea. Q. Did he give any indication that he'd discussed this with the Israelis? A. No. He told me he discussed it with the Israelis, but not as to destination of the funds. So Mr. Schwimmer made a contra-bution. TALKING ABOUT IRAN Q. We'll let that one sink in for a minute. Mr. Secord, I think you said that there came a time in January when you did have some further discussions on the subject of Iran? A. Yes. COVERT ACTION PLAN Q. What was the subject of the meeting? A. I thought the meeting was peculiar because I didn't really know why I was there because they were discussing the finding. I had been told earlier by Admiral Poindexter there was going to be a finding. Of course there would have to be if there was going to be a covert operation. And the finding, the Presidential finding, the order initiating this covert action was the main subject at this meeting. Q. Why were you, a private citizen, invited to a meeting with apparently a number of lawyers who were putting together a Presidential finding? A. They had already put the finding together and they were discussing it. And I thought that they were discussing certain language and later reports indicate that that finding may have already been typed and final at that point. I don't recall because it was kind of an academic discussion as far as I was concerned. MR. GOOD, COL. NORTH Q. By the way, what name were you using and what name was Mr. North using? A. North used the name of Mr. Good and at this meeting I used the name of General Adams. Now the reason why that was necessary was that they wanted me to present - that is North and the agency - wanted me to present part of the intelligence briefing which was to be given at this meeting. It had been agreed that some representative sample of tactical intelligence information would be briefed to the Iranian delegation, and since it involved a lot of military symbology and order of battle jargon, and since I'm pretty familiar with the Iranians, they asked me if I would fill that role. So I did. Q. Who was there from the Iranian side? A. An official from the office of the Prime Minister of Iran and he had with him an aide and two colonels that he introduced as being from their military intelligence organization. We believed, however, that one of the colonels actually was from the office of the Prime Minister. Q. Can you just very briefly describe the meeting? A. Yes, the main meeting, which took place, I was not present. It was a meeting among the representatives from Iran along with Ghorbanifar, Oliver North, the C.I.A. official and, of course, Hakim acting as translator. These meetings were taped surreptitiously. I was briefed later as to what had transpired and my understanding was that North went through his talking points which he had - an officially blessed set of talking points -and they went through the U.S. strategic objectives, the U.S. concerns about the Soviet threat in the region, the U.S.'s concern about the continuing Iran-Iraq war and our desire to see an honorable ending to that. Q. Do you feel certain of that, that there were no hostages expected to be released? A. I didn't expect any to be released. I was not informed that there was any plan for any to be released as a result of this initial deal. Q. In any event, you were not told that any were to be released and none were? A. And none were, and we didn't plan for any to be released. FACE TO FACE IN IRAN Q. What was - if anything, what was agreed on for the future? A. The U.S. delegation was pleased with the meeting. It was agreed in this meeting that there would be a future high-level meeting between the - and in the near future - between high-level officials of the United States and high-ranking members of the Iranian Government. And they were talking in terms of Foreign Minister and State Department high officials. Q. Would it be fair to say, Mr. Secord, that a lot was made at this meeting out of the fact that officials of the two Governments were meeting face to face for the first time in a long time? A. Yes. That was also a big point when the meeting was summed up at the end, that this was the first time that there had been face to face discussions between Iranian and U.S. officials since 1981. It was agreed that this future meeting would take place on Kaish Island, which is a small island south - on the south coast of Iran. MEESE AND NOVEMBER Q. In your opening statement you made a reference to Attorney General Meese's statement on the 25th of November 1986. A. Yes. Right. Q. And I think you had some uncomplimentary things to say about the statement. What was it that you objected to in it? A. When I learned that an internal inquiry was going on, I was fearful that there would be a rush to judgment and I asked my attorney, Mr. Green, to go and lay out the outlines of this operation to the Justice Department, to the No. 2 man in that investigation, Bradford Reynolds.",1987-05-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1987","MARKETS A surge of Japanese orders lifted bond prices and created hopes that the trend toward higher interest rates had been thwarted for now. The buying of 30-year Treasury bonds by Japanese securities firms soothed fears that turmoil in the foreign exchange market and trade disputes between Tokyo and Washington would interrupt the flow of Japanese capital into the American bond market. The fears had been heightened by weak Japanese participation in Wednesday's auction of 10-year notes. The dollar's stability in recent days was credited with paving the way for the increased level of Japanese participation. [ Page D1. ] The dollar rose against most currencies as traders kept a close watch on the Treasury auction. Gold fell to $457.25 an ounce in New York, down $1.50. [ D11. ] Stocks were active but a rally was thwarted, for the second day in a row, by distractions from the credit market. The Dow had another seesaw day before closing at 2,334.66, off 7.53 points. [ D4. ] Wheat futures climbed to their highest levels in a year and soybeans were up more than 10 cents a bushel. [ D11. ] THE ECONOMY The savings and loan industry may need as much as $45 billion in a Federal bailout, some experts maintain, complaining that Congressional rescue plans are inadequate. These experts worry that the F.S.L.I.C. will require enormous Federal assistance to shut or sell the ailing savings and loans. [ A1. ] A ''summit meeting'' on the budget was sought by Bob Dole, the Senate's ranking Republican, who said it was time for President Reagan to begin negotiating with the Congress on the 1988 budget. The White House said it was not interested in such a meeting. [ A22. ] Insurance against catastrophic medical expenses for 31 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee. Passage by the full House seems certain. [ A21. ] The Senate Finance Committee approved its trade bill, which mandates much less retaliation than the House's bill. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in June. [ D1. ] Consumer debt dropped $63 million in March in the first monthly decline since July 1982. Americans paid off a half-billion dollars in revolving debt and homeowners continued shifting credit into equity loans. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Western Union will merge with ITT World Communications to create a leading international telex message service in a $370 million venture. Drexel Burnham Lambert said it was confident it could raise $450 million to finance the deal. [ D1. ] Texas Air reported a loss of $100.7 million for the first quarter, compared with a loss of $11.2 million a year ago. But Eastern, its subsidiary, showed marked improvement. NWA, the parent of Northwest, lost $35 million in the first quarter, more than twice what it lost in the first quarter of 1986. [ D3. ] The nation's largest general retailers reported strong sales in April after a mixed performance in March. Sears, the biggest retailer, had the smallest gain last month - 2 percent. [ D3. ] Another executive at J. Walter Thompson has been dismissed. W. Lee Preschel, president for Latin America and the Central Pacific, was rumored to be a supporter of Joseph W. O'Donnell, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive in January. [ D13. ] Resorts International rejected a $220 million takeover offer from a group led by Marvin Davis.

(Neither of New York's major companies has staged any of Dvorak's 10 operas.) What proponents of such neglected operas always hope for is the one brilliant, revelatory performance that will propel the favored work into public attention and into major opera houses.

us,McKey in N.B.A. Draft,"In a reversal caused by his suspension for his senior season, Derrick McKey of Alabama, the Southeastern Conference player of the year last season, decided yesterday to apply for the National Basketball Association draft. The 6-foot-9-inch junior center joined Norris Coleman, a junior at Kansas State, and Vincent Askew, a junior at Memphis State, as the only three players to declare for the June 22 draft. Danny Manning, a junior at Kansas, announced hours before the midnight deadline that he would bypass the draft and remain in school. ''My family wants me to stay and get my degree, and that's important,'' said Manning, whose coach, Larry Brown signed a four-year contract to remain at Kansas. McKey, who averaged 18.6 points and 7.5 rebounds a game last season, had planned to stay at Alabama for his senior season. But he changed his mind after being declared ineligible by the school for purportedly signing a contract with an agent. Steve Sloan, the athletic director at Alabama, would not disclose the agent's name. . . . An attorney for Reggie Rogers, a University of Washington defensive end, filed a lawsuit Thursday in Sacramento, Calif., charging two sports agents - Norby Walters of New York City and G. Patrick Healy of Tacoma, Wash. - with using fraud and duress as means of obtaining contracts with Rogers. The lawsuit seeks to nullify the separate contracts and seeks a total of $2.7 million in damages. Rogers, who is from Sacramento, was chosen seventh in the first round of the draft by the Detroit Lions. A lawyer for Walters, who filed suit against Rogers and his current agent, Stephen W. Zucker, in March for breach of contract, said he was not aware of the lawsuit and would not comment. Healy denied the charges.",1987-05-09T05:00:00+0000

They nodded yesterday when he said: ''I gave serious thought to not running for President. In many ways, I didn't want to.''

In the 1930's, Irving Berlin, now 99 years old, managed an unusual (and, his friends believed at the time, foolhardy) feat that has made him, by all accounts, a millionaire many times over. But time has begun to run out. What feat was it and what happened recently? 5. While offering mass in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, a center of Reformation history, Pope John Paul II made an unusual ecumenical statement. What did he say? 6. With the withrawal of Gary Hart from the Democratic Presidential contest, only one active contender in the race enjoys the support of 10 percent of Democrats, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. Who is he? 7. In a case involving the Starrett City housing complex, a Federal district judge in Brooklyn drew a distinction between the rental policies permissible for private and public landlords. What was the ruling? 8. Newly disclosed correspondence between Albert Einstein and the woman who would later become his first wife revealed a surprise and a mystery. What was involved? 9. According to White House officials, President Reagan has adopted a new strategy to gain Congressional support for United States military aid to the contras. What is it? 10. Representatives of some private clubs said a Supreme Court decision that Rotary Clubs must admit women as members did not apply to their organizations because the ruling focused on the particular characteristics of Rotary Clubs. To what were they referring? 11. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said that the future of the coalition Government would be riding on a vote the Cabinet will take on Monday. What vote is it? 12. Governor Cuomo tried to explain why he signed legislation for the largest tax cut in New York State history only five days before he proposed a $1 billion-a-year increase in taxes and fees. What did he say? 13. Tim Raines's batting feat for the Montreal Expos in a game against the Mets - a grand slam home run, a triple and two singles -was extraordinary. Why? 14. The Senate and the House have passed differing versions of a $1 trillion 1988 budget, but both call for about $18.3 billion in tax increases. What kinds of taxes do members of Congress have in mind, and why? 15. The refusal of James Ramseur, one of four youths shot by Bernard H. Goetz on a subway train two years ago, to be sworn in as a witness against Mr. Goetz may be as damaging to the defense as to the prosecution. Why? 16.

She was the first liner longer than 1,000 feet, one of the only three ever to gross more than 80,000 tons, the first of the mammoth breed to sport a clipper-type bow and a rakish hull that encased the apogee of Gallic luxury. The Normandie was not a money maker in her short life, and she came to a sad end. The enemy didn't sink her at sea; she burned and went down ignominiously at her West 48th Street pier in Manhattan in 1942, while incompetents were transforming her into a troop ship. Navy salvage experts learned their trade by raising her, but she was a dowdy hulk, useless for war or peace, and was hauled off to a knacker's yard in New Jersey to be demolished. Mr. Braynard captures the spirit that people invested in this queen of the seas. The Normandie was a nova that brightened the firmament of ships for a moment, only to fade a few years before her proud contemporaries, the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth, also were lost in a storm of travel innovation.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE SEVENTH SANCTUARY. By Daniel Easterman. (Doubleday, $17.95.) Daniel Easterman, the pseudonym for an English professor of Islamic studies, has crammed this thriller with enough murky mayhem to see Robert Ludlum through his next six epics. ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' seems like ''Radio Days'' in comparison. When he is describing the desert, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, forgotten monasteries in Sinai defiles, Mr. Easterman writes well. But his dialogue is studded with lines like: ''There isn't time!'' and ''We've got to get out of here.'' Characters invariably feel fear like a lump of ice in the throat or lead in the stomach. Most of them don't stay around to feel anything for very long. Astonishing numbers of people are killed with revolting brutality within a page or two of their appearance. Only David Rosen, an American-born Jewish archeologist, and his Palestinian girlfriend, Leyla, escape swift extinction. It seems that in defeat the Nazis retreated to a buried city in the Arabian desert, where, in the 1980's, they are schooling a new generation for a comeback. A veritable corps of them has infiltrated the Israeli Army and intelligence service as well as the American military and political establishment (which Mr. Easterman trashes in an offhand way). Only David and Leyla are smart enough to connect the multiple murders to the Nazis' plan to destroy the state of Israel and create an Arab Reich. Archeology buffs and thriller aficionados with strong stomachs will stay with it even when they don't believe a word.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000

I agree. Mr. Brzezinski concludes that, therefore, the abolition of nuclear weapons is a pipe dream.

us,The Air Force's SR-71 shows an eye for detail,"MOST OF THE TIME IT IS INVISIBLE from earth, hurtling along at speeds over 2,000 miles an hour at altitudes up to 100,000 feet. The United States Air Force SR-71 is the world's fastest, technically most advanced spy plane, capable of seeing more from a greater distance than any other aircraft. And recent developments - the escalation of espionage between East and West, the curtailment of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the loss of several spy satellites through technical failures - have made this extraordinary plane more vital than ever. From its home at Beale Air Force Base in northern California, the SR-71 serves as America's eye on the globe. THE AIR FORCE, WHICH HAS BEEN using the SR-71 since 1966, has nicknamed the plane Blackbird, although viewed in flight it more resembles a spacecraft from ''Star Wars.'' According to the author and aviation expert William E. Burrows, 15 to 19 Blackbirds exist; the exact number is classified. Operated by a two-man crew, a pilot and a reconnaissance systems officer (R.S.O.), the craft's espionage capabilities are unparalleled: an SR-71 can survey 100,000 square miles from 15 miles up in only one hour. Difficult to detect by radar, it can also track SAM missiles at a distance of up to 100 miles. The Blackbird can reach speeds of up to Mach 4, or 2,600 miles per hour; no country has ever succeeded in shooting one down. EACH PLANE IS FITTED WITH A PAIR of cameras that automatically produce 1,800 overlapping photos of up to 1,600 miles of terrain; and a camera that can produce pictures with a ground resolution of 12 inches. The Blackbird's view of San Francisco from 80,000 feet (below), showing the pyramid-shaped Transamerica building in the upper left and the Oakland Bay Bridge, has the clarity of a photo shot at 1,000 feet. The picture's quality may have to do with the emulsion on the extremely fine-grain film used - about which the Air Force will say nothing.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000

The speech was the first in a series outlining Mr. Bush's policy positions. 23 Mario Cuomo still will not run for President, he says. At the same time, strategists say they believe the Governor is strengthening his position as a candidate. ''Why won't people simply believe me?,'' he said. 22 The funeral of William J. Casey on Long Island was marked by the controversy surrounding President Reagan's policy of aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, a policy that Mr. Casey, former Director of Central Intelligence, espoused. 1 The President threatened to veto legislation that restricts flexibility in arms control talks or provides what he considers to be inadequate levels of military spending. He made the comments in his weekly radio broadcast. 18 In the U.S. Army, young generals are taking command in perhaps the most sweeping change since World War II, causing concern throughout the officer corps.

us,New & Noteworthy,"EDITOR TO AUTHOR: The Letters of Maxwell E. Perkins, edited by John Hall Wheelock. (Scribners, $10.95.) At Charles Scribner's Sons, the editor Maxwell E. Perkins shepherded into print the works of Wolfe, Fitzgerald, Hemingway and others. In reviewing this selection from his letters, Alfred A. Knopf said in The Book Review in 1950 that all the authors ''were devoted to Perkins and none ever wandered from his or her allegiance. The letters over and over again tell why. . . . [ They ] will be of enormous and enduring interest to writers, editors and publishers everywhere.'' KATE VAIDEN, by Reynolds Price. (Ballantine, $4.95.) Kate Vaiden tells her life story in retrospect as she sets out, at the age of 57, to find the baby son she abandoned 40 years earlier. Most of the novel is set in the early-1940's North Carolina of her youth, and it is ''a forgiving, immensely readable story . . . almost light in feeling,'' Rosellen Brown said in these pages last year. ''The voice of Mr. Price's heroine blows like fresh air across the page. . . . [ He ] has found a narrator of great charm whose sad story, from which she sets herself free, sounds (as Kate might say) new as morning.'' EIGHT MEN OUT: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series, by Eliot Asinof. (Owl/Holt, $8.95.) Eliot Asinof reconstructs the blackest event in baseball history - the Chicago Black Sox scandal of 1919, when eight players were accused of throwing the World Series. In 1963 one reviewer called the book ''comprehensive'' and ''superb'' and said the author ''thoroughly airs the conditions that made the players' venality possible.'' GIRLS FOREVER BRAVE AND TRUE, by Caryl Rivers. (Pocket, $3.95.) A decade after high school, two best friends reunite in the Washington of the 1960's, where one becomes a Capitol Hill gossip columnist and the other is a prize-winning journalist. In The Book Review in 1986, Kiki Olson said, ''In the seemingly endless parade of best-selling heroines who are unrealistically beautiful, wealthy and humorless about having it all -what a pleasure to run into funny, warm, often confused Peg Morrison and Constance Masters.'' A PIECE OF MY HEART: The Stories of 26 American Women Who Served in Vietnam, by Keith Walker. (Ballantine, $4.95.) This oral history records the experiences of 26 American women - Red Cross workers, U.S.O. entertainers, Army nurses - in Vietnam. ''The stories of memories and conflicts tend to run together,'' Marcia Froelke Coburn said here last year, ''but the emotional current never falters.'' BORDERLINE, by Janette Turner Hospital. (Bantam, $4.50.) The narrator of this suspense novel is a piano tuner whose stepmother has disappeared after trying to aid an injured South American alien at a United States-Canada border crossing. The tale is ''complex and disturbing,'' Cheri Fein said here in 1985, ''a compelling attempt to go beyond the safe borderlines within which much current fiction resides.'' PORTRAIT OF AN ARTIST: A Biography of Georgia O'Keeffe, by Laurie Lisle. (Washington Square/Pocket, $5.95.) This life of Georgia O'Keeffe has been revised and updated with new material since her death in 1986. In these pages in 1980, Janet Hobhouse described O'Keeffe as ''the matron saint variously of modernism, regionalism, abstract art and realism, of ecology, women's liberation, old-fashioned virtue and free love. . . . Invited to do what she could without her subject's cooperation, Laurie Lisle has amassed the clues to convey a semblance of the life, curiously unconnected with anything we know of the artist from her work.'' HARD LAUGHTER, by Anne Lamott. (North Point, $8.95.) Anne Lamott's first novel is about a Northern California family's struggle to cope when the father is stricken with a brain tumor. The book's appeal, Anne Tyler said here in 1980, is ''that it has much to say about how a good family works - any good family - in times both hard and easy. . . . It's a moving and strangely joyful book, a kind of celebration.'' ON PERSEPHONE'S ISLAND: A Sicilian Journal, by Mary Taylor Simeti. (North Point, $11.95.) Mary Taylor Simeti, who visited Sicily in the 1960's and ended up marrying a Sicilian agronomist, offers a month-by-month journal of her 21st year (1982-83) as an American living there. ''She has constructed an intricate mosaic of Sicily past and present, historical and personal,'' Ann Cornelisen said here in 1986, and by year's end ''has told us so much that is fascinating.'' BHOWANI JUNCTION, by John Masters. (Carroll & Graf, $4.50.) John Masters' tale of India in the late 1940's, on the verge of emancipation and partition, is set in a railway outpost and centers on a woman who is half-English and the three men who love her - a railway official who is also half-English, a British officer and an Indian political leader. In 1954 our reviewer, John Barkham, praised the book's ''magic of atmosphere, subtlety of character, vigor of narrative and overtones of meaning.'' KEROUAC: A Biography, by Ann Charters. (St. Martin's, $10.95.) This life of Jack Kerouac (1922-69) by Ann Charters, who was a friend of the Beat Generation writer, evokes a lively period in American letters and ''is a pleasure,'' John Deck said here in 1973. ''It is about men and ideas that changed everything.'' PICTURE PALACE, by Paul Theroux. (Washington Square/Pocket, $4.95.) At 70, Maude Coffin Pratt, a famous photographer, relives her life and work as she prepares for a retrospective.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"DESERT FABULOSO. By Lisa Lovenheim. (Plume/ NAL, Paper, $7.95.) ''Desert Fabuloso'' would be a typical coming-of-age novel about the early development and spiritual education of Bradley Roberson 3d, but for the fact that the poor little rich boy is already a man. The task before Bradley is remedial: mastering and changing the unhappy, often nasty child that dominates him from within. Petulant, narcissistic and homosexual, Bradley - in his late 20's - blithely caroms through people's lives until he is rejected by a lover who won't tolerate his immaturity. Realizing he is destructive and childish, Bradley withdraws into introspective self-isolation behind the adobe walls of his new Santa Fe, N.M., home for some major self-reconstruction. This arid but beautiful man - this desert fabuloso -sets out to restore a neglected house, and there is no way to miss that the house, especially its interiors, represents his own condition: the walls of the building were cracked because it was abandoned and unloved. Not without its complexities and subtleties, this first novel unfortunately hardly becomes more than an exotic and exaggerated case history. With characters acting like straw figures in the predictable symmetries of a plot outline, the psychodrama has little credible drama. The awkward symbolism, plot manipulation and relentless stereotyping vitiates almost all characters, events and places. Bradley wears white safari shorts, Paco Rabanne pour homme, a pale yellow Calvin Klein undershirt, and drives a BMW with a sunroof. Santa Fe itself hardly escapes Lisa Lovenheim's uncharitable gaze. There is, in her view, no human condition in the Santa Fe condition, only gentrification, chic and a croissant culture.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Prices of Treasury securities plummeted as Japanese investors stayed out of the auction of 10-year notes, apparently fearful that the fall of the dollar against the yen would make the investments less attractive. But prices recovered some as the Japanese participated in an auction of 30-year bonds. Investors had feared a slowdown in Japanese investment in American securities, which would have forced interest rates higher.

Next year will mark the 250th anniversary of the inauguration, at Herculaneum, of systematic excavation of those Vesuvian cities - a development of immense consequence not only for our knowledge of the ancient world but for the influence exerted over archeology, art and science, and over civilized consciousness, by the Vesuvian revelations.

The six people on board say they didn't see a thing, that Loewenstein must have mistakenly walked out of the plane through the exit door in the lavatory.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000
us,A Martyr Of Auschwitz,"All the current hullabaloo about whether Edith Stein was killed because she was a Jew or because she was a Roman Catholic is irreligious and irrelevant (''A Martyr of Auschwitz,'' by Susanne M. Batzdorff, April 12). Of course, she died because of the Nazis' odium fidei! Jewish faith and Catholic faith are at their esoteric core the same faith: the faith of our common father, Abraham. To turn Edith Stein's death into a turf battle is the kind of arrant perversion of faith upon which the Nazis of every generation have fed. Banality breeds tyranny.

With this juxtaposition, - perhaps the most provocative and appropriate in the entire exhibition - the biennial's curators signal that the artists have a lot in common, and to some extent they are right. First of all, in both cases the art is made not by an individual but by two artists working together, and as such is part of a growing phenomenon of collaborations in the art world today. Second, both these teams are very much involved with bygone eras, styles and attitudes. In ways that are quite different and may be diametrically opposed, their work deliberately embraces a period look that often seems Victorian or Edwardian in flavor.",1987-05-10T05:00:00+0000

She is a rich girl distinguished by her ability to talk and smile at the same time and her tendency to practice cheerleader splits at any moment. Unexpectedly, the chemistry teacher shows up in Dan's room and lets the lovelorn A student out of the makeup test so he can go on the trip; the teacher has a 16-year-old daughter of his own and, he says, pretty girls don't like to be let down. (These adults aren't understanding about their kids' love lives; they're saintly.) As Dan scrambles to catch up with Lori's family, he is always a step behind in a series of shamefully predictable near misses: after flying to the Caribbean, he is waylaid by drugged-out islanders, done in by a bottle of rum and caught in a suspenseless storm at sea.

us,Q&Q,"Q. What are vitamins and how are they made? A. Vitamins are complex organic compounds that regulate the metabolism and functions of the body. They are found in minute quantities in food or synthesized in the body. Vitamins function as catalysts in many of the body's chemical reactions producing energy, hormones or chemical regulators. They are also needed to remove toxic substances, synthesize tissue and break down waste products and toxins. Scientists have divided vitamins into a fat-soluble group consisting of vitamins A, D, E and K, and a water soluble group with the various B vitamins, including thiamine and riboflavin. Most vitamins can be extracted from plants and animals, where they are concentrated in tissues that are most active metabolically. For example, vitamin A is heavily concentrated in the liver and viscera of most animals or is derived from carotene, a yellow plant pigment. A lack of this vitamin can result in night blindness, susceptibility to infections and degeneration of tissue. Scientists have learned to synthesize vitamins in the laboratory. Several microorganisms including yeasts can synthesize vitamins, especially those of the B complex. Commercial vitamin tablets contain small amounts of vitamins that have been added to a base.",1987-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Some opposition leaders charged that irregularities took place, but most people called the election the calmest and most honest in years. Page A1 The President denied seeking money for the contras in meetings with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in 1985. White House officials denied any link between the aid and an accord to sell weapons to the Saudis. A1 A $10 million mistake resulted in that amount being sent to a Swiss shipping magnate's bank account instead of to a fund to help the contras. The recipient withdrew the money and bought a certificate of deposit in another bank, investigators said. A1 Tempers flared in Israel as Yitzhak Shamir attacked Shimon Peres's proposed international Middle East peace conference. Mr. Shamir called it ''perverse and criminal.'' A1 More forces were sent to the Punjab as Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi took command of a campaign to curb terrorist attacks by Sikh extremists in the northern Indian state. A1 The Afghan Government is torn by internal divisions that diplomats say have been worsened by the stalemate in the war between the Soviet-backed regime, now nine years old, and insurgents. A8 News analysis: Margaret Thatcher, in seeking re-election next month, is really running for a place on the short list of Prime Ministers who have sig-nificantly altered change-resistant Britain. A3 Klaus Barbie denied responsiblity for atrocities that took place in Lyons during the German occupation. It was his first statement at the trial. A5 A record auction price for sculpture was paid for Alberto Giacometti's ''Large Female Standing II'' at Christie's in New York. A buyer said to be an American paid $3.63 million for the work.

The measure would reverse past rapid growth of spending for the space-based missile defense program. A1 Budget conferees voiced optimism about early agreement on a compromise plan for 1988 that would provide for $18 billion in tax increases. The House and Senate negotiators began negotiations. B14 A man's heart was transplanted into another man from a live donor, doctors said. The surgery was part of a complex series of operations involving three people at two hospitals in Baltimore. A1 United Airlines, seeking protection from a possible hostile takeover, announced a $2.1 billion deal with the Boeing Company. The move puts a considerable ''chunk of stock in friendly hands,'' one analyst said. D1 News analysis: Commodity prices are expected to be volatile but big rises are called unlikely by experts despite this week's sharp jump and higher inflation. D1 Laws barring husbands from trial for sexually assaulting their wives or setting severe limits for pursuit of such prosecution are opposed by women's organizations who say they subject some wives to humiliation, pain and injury. A16 Opposition to oil exploration proposed by the Federal Government on 750 million acres in the Pacific is almost uniform among state officials, environmentalists and private citizens. A25 Bringing back the trumpeter swan to Michigan, a biologist flew in three swan eggs swathed in styrofoam, kept warm with a hot-water bottle and ventilated with a tiny, battery-operated fan.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, MAY 14, 1987","MARKETS Prosecutors asked for dismissal of insider-trading charges against three Wall Street professionals but are expected to seek a new, broader indictment. The move by the U.S. Attorney is likely to lead to an increasingly complex series of legal maneuvers. But it also creates substantial risks for the prosecution because it opens up possible challenges of any future indictment. A ruling on the dismissal motion could be made today. [ Page A1. ] The move to drop the indictments was regarded by many lawyers as a major embarrassment to Rudolph W. Giulani, the U.S. Attorney. [ D4. ] Stock prices again ended mixed, as rises by blue-chip issues were offset by declines in the broader market. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.08 points, to close at 2,329.68, but declines on the New York Stock Exchange led advances. [ D8. ] Interest rates on notes and bonds were little changed as many participants continued to wait for fresh economic statistics. [ D19. ] Yields continued to climb on bank money-market accounts, certificates of deposit and money-market mutual funds as competition for the saver's dollar intensified among banks. [ D13. ] The dollar moved slightly higher against most currencies except the British pound in quiet trading. Gold fell $1.50 an ounce, to $458, in late trading in New York. [ D20. ] Modest gains in precious metals futures became losses after a late burst of selling. [ D20. ] INTERNATIONAL O.E.C.D. ministers called for reduced farm support. Their communique represented the first time there had been a consensus among the U.S., Europe and Japan that farm subsidies need to be reduced. The ministers also disclosed a new willingness by West Germany to stimulate its economy. [ D1. ] Norway is taking steps to reorganize Kongsberg Vapenfabrik and tighten export controls after the company illegally sold sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, which has enabled the Russians to make their submarines more difficult to detect. [ D1. ] Japanese officials asked currency traders to refrain from speculation in a move aimed at halting the yen's rise. Compliance is voluntary, but such ''administrative guidance'' has worked in the past. [ D21. ] Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. leaped to a record $5.15 billion in April, but analysts said the volume of Japanese exports actually began shrinking. [ D21. ] THE ECONOMY Mail-order retailers would be required to collect sales taxes on out-of-state purchases under legislation before a Congressional panel. The bill would also require national magazines and newspapers to collect sales taxes on subscriptions and remit the revenue to the tax authority of the subscriber's home state. [ D1. ] Retail sales in April were up a mere 0.1 percent, to $125.38 billion. Analysts said that declines in real income and record levels of debt had caused consumers to cut spending for big-ticket items and that they expected the pattern to continue. [ D1. ] COMPANIES A.T.&T. provided details of a reduction in long-distance rates, saying it would lower basic domestic rates by an average of 4.8 percent on July 1. The reduction for residential and business service would save consumers more than $590 million a year. [ D1. ] Sales of new U.S.-made cars dropped 28.5 percent in early May from last year, and light trucks dropped 12.4 percent, their first decline in three months. The seasonally adjusted annual rate fell to 6.5 million units, compared with 8.7 million a year ago. [ D6. ] Tiffany reported net income in the first quarter of more than $1 million, in contrast to a loss in the 1986 period. [ D2. ] A Federal judge tentatively approved paying up to $35 million to about 16,000 retirees to settle a class-action suit against the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. [ D4. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS Amoco's offer for Dome Petroleum may be in doubt. It seems likely to get the approval of shareholders but the endorsement by creditors is less certain. Talking Deals. [ D2. ] Allegis's stock action was ''really weird,'' first diving and then climbing, as traders and analysts tried to assess its deal with Boeing, which provides $700 million in financing.

us,Dining Out Guide: Upper West Side,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Stars are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. AMSTERDAM'S BAR AND ROTISSERIE, 428 Amsterdam Avenue, near 80th Street (874-1377) - **(Aug. 24, 1984) This casual cafe has white-painted plaster and brick walls, black tin ceiling and red-and-white and blue-and-white homespun tablecloths. The food is as simple and appealing as the decor, and most of it is cooked on the gas-fire rotisserie in the open kitchen. Starters are duck-liver mousse, gravlax with dill-mustard sauce, and smoked trout. Recommended main dishes include the roasted half chicken, shell steak and Norwegian salmon. Dinner entrees $8.50 to $15.25. Fridays through Sundays, noon to 1 A.M. CAFE 79, #206 West 79th Street (769-3377) - *(March 27, 1987) A warm and congenial setting, an inviting bar and a menu of French classics are a few of the pluses going for this Upper West Side bistro. The decor consists of beige walls, mustard banquettes, beveled mirrors and wooden crossbeams overhead. The best appetizers are scallops in cream sauce; warm saucisson with cubes of sauteed potatoes; leeks in vinaigrette, and the onion soup. For a main dish, you might try rack of lamb with baby vegetables; tournedos of beef with truffle sauce; roast duck with fig sauce or the classic sauce of cherries and port, or trout a la meuniere. Entrees $14.50 to $21.50. Fridays and Saturdays, 5 to midnight; Sundays, 5 to 11 P.M. DOCKS OYSTER BAR AND SEAFOOD GRILL, #2427 Broadway, near 90th Street (724-5588) - *(Feb. 6, 1987) A changing assortment of seafood is the attraction at this sparkling black-and-white tiled restaurant on upper Broadway. The long tile bar has a glass-enclosed shellfish display, and you may choose from Belons, Wellfleets, Apalachicolas and bluepoints or clams on the half shell while waiting for a table. Frying is one of the kitchen's strong points, and fried clams and oysters are recommended. Other good options are calamari rings with a cumin-laced hot sauce; steamed giant New Zealand mussels in a saffron cream broth; Norwegian salmon; kingfish over sauteed onions and peppers, and steamed lobster, two pounds and up.

FANDANGO, #305 West End Avenue, at 75th Street (877-1500) - *(Nov. 14, 1986) The multilevel dining room of this capacious California-style grill restaurant has great potential that is largely untapped. The allure here is the food. You might start with wok-charred spicy filet of beef with Napa cabbage and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette, or Belon oyster pancakes with smoked salmon, with a light sesame and sea urchin butter sauce. Pasta options include oversized ravioli filled with sea scallops and julienned artichokes, mache, tomato and jicama with lemongrass and chive butter sauce. Main-course selections are tournedos of Norwegian salmon with steamed ribbon vegetables and mache; whole pan-roasted Maine lobster with a dark oyster sauce and sweet-potato chips; roast sliced boneless rack of lamb wrapped in spinach and herbs with a celery root gratin.

Appetizer options include coquilles St. Jacques; sauteed chicken livers with bacon and raspberry vinegar, or soupe au pistou, a melange of fresh spring vegetables. The regular entrees are supplemented by two or three daily specials and you might choose duckling with plums; entrecote with green peppercorn sauce; rack of lamb with garlic-tinged pan juices, or monkfish with tomato, wine and herbs.

us,WEEKENDER GUIDE,"FRIDAY POLYRHYTHMIC SYMPHONY The music of the American composer Charles Ives (1874-1954) has always been controversial. An amateur musician, Ives wrote complex works using polytonality, polyrhythm and other devices considered radical at the time. Tonight at 8, the Cleveland Orchestra will perform the composer's rarely heard Fourth Symphony at Carnegie Hall. The piece, which was written in 1915 and first performed in 1965, is one of Ives's most difficult works: the score calls for two conductors to help keep the music from running rhythmically amok. Carrying out that task in tonight's concert are Christoph von Dohnanyi, the orchestra's music director, and Jahja Ling, its resident conductor. Joining the musical forces for this performance of the 30-minute symphony is the Cleveland Orchestra Chamber Chorus. For those with more traditional tastes, Brahms's Fourth Symphony will round out the program. Tickets, at the box office, are $14 to $25. Information: 247-7800. ANIMATION FESTIVAL Mention animated film and Walt Disney usually comes to mind. But animation comprises a wide variety of styles and techniques, many of which can be seen tonight at New York University's seventh annual Animation Festival. Fifteen films by students and alumni of the university's Tisch School of the Arts department of film and television will be shown in a 90-minute program beginning at 8 P.M. Among them are two Claymation films, which use hand-crafted clay sculptures, meticulously positioned and shot at 24 frames per second. There is also a political collage-montage; a children's movie titled ''Traveling,'' which illustrates the alphabet, and ''Peer Pier,'' a line drawing depicting a journey through a magical underwater world. Several of the films have won awards at international film festivals. The screenings are at the Eisner Lubin Auditorium of the Loeb Student Center, 566 La Guardia Place, off Washington Square. Tickets are $3 (free for N.Y.U. students). The proceeds will go to the school's Leo Dratfield Animation Scholarship. Information: 598-3757. COLLECTORS' NICHE Rare 17th-century Chinese chairs, 18th-century Queen Anne and Chippendale sofas and 20th-century Art Deco tables are a few of the items on view this weekend at the New York Armory Antiques Show. One hundred and twenty exhibitors from the United States, Canada, Austria, Britain and France will fill the vast space of the Seventh Regiment Armory at Park Avenue and 67th Street in Manhattan. Now in its 11th year at the armory, the show has grown into one of the largest furniture and antiques exhibits. Along with the many pieces of top-quality furniture will be rugs, folk art, jewelry, toys, paintings, rare books and many other decorative items. A special booth to benefit the Save the Children Federation will feature crafts from 40 of the countries served by the relief organization. The show will be open from 11 A.M. to 9 P.M. today and tomorrow, and 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Sunday. Admission is $6. Information: 772-2240 or 772-2327. SATURDAY PUCCINI GEM One of the most beloved ballets in the dance repertory is ''Giselle,'' but few people have ever heard ''Le Villi,'' Giacomo Puccini's first opera, which is based on the ballet. Il Piccolo Teatro dell'Opera, a Brooklyn-based group, will present a concert version of the hourlong opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Saturday at 8 P.M. Barbara Elliott, the founder and director of the small three-year-old group, said its purpose was to offer shorter operas, the ''gem masterpieces'' that are rarely heard. Singers for this performance are Eva Baraian, a soprano; Jia Nyi Zhang, a tenor, and Mark Rucker, a baritone. The opera will be sung in Italian with English supertitles, and the actor Tony Randall will narrate. Giampaolo Bracali will conduct the Brooklyn Philharmonic. Tickets, at the box office, are $5 to $20. Information and reservations: (718) 855-4751; or Teletron: 947-5850. HISPANIC THEATER Pregones, the New York-based Touring Puerto Rican Theater group, will end its spring season on Saturday with a performance of the musical ''Migrants! Cantata a los Emigrantes.'' This bilingual play was written by the troupe's director, Rosalba Rolon, who used historical texts, oral history, interviews and poetry to tell the story of Puerto Ricans who migrated to the United States. The performance, which begins at 2 P.M., is at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts, at Lehman College, Bedford Park Boulevard West near Jerome Avenue, in the Bronx. Tickets are $10. Information: 585-1202. SUNDAY QUIVAR IN RECITAL Opera audiences are well acquainted with the mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar, who, in her ninth consecutive season at the Metropolitan Opera, recently appeared in that company's production of Poulenc's ''Dialogues of the Carmelites.'' On Sunday at 7:30 P.M., Ms. Quivar will make her New York recital debut at Alice Tully Hall as part of the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center. A native of Philadelphia, Ms. Quivar has appeared throughout the United States and Europe with some of the world's leading orchestras, opera companies and music festivals, including the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, the Boston Symphony with Seiji Ozawa and the Cleveland Orchestra under Lorin Maazel. For Sunday's program, Ms. Quivar, with Mikael Eliasen at the piano, will offer songs by Brahms and Mahler, a Mozart concert aria and a selection of spirituals. Tickets are $15, at the Tully Hall box office, 362-1911; or through Centercharge: 874-6770. YIDDISH TALES Isaac Bashevis Singer has been captivating readers with tales of demons, goblins and spirits for a good part of this century. On Sunday at 2 P.M., the 83-year-old Nobel laureate will be honored at the 16th annual Sholem Aleichem Festival, which celebrates Yiddish music, theater and culture. Among those who are to be on hand for the festivities are Tovah Feldshuh, an actress; Zwi Kanar, a mime; Norman Kruger, a Yiddish actor, and Emmanuel Almossino, a klezmer musician. Excerpts from Amram Nowak's 1986 Oscar-nominated documentary, ''Isaac in America,'' will be shown. Mr. Singer and his wife, Alma, will read selections from his stories. The festival, sponsored by Queens College and its English-language journal, Yiddish, is at the college's Colden Center, off the Kissena Boulevard exit of the Long Island Expressway, in Flushing.

''It was my idea to begin with,'' he said. Page 1 A marine facing spying charges will not face the death penalty, the Marine Corps said. But Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree will be court-martialed on other charges stemming from a spy scandal at the United States Embassy in Moscow. 1 New arms pacts should eliminate all Soviet and American medium-range missiles and not allow each side to retain 100 warheads outside Europe, Western defense ministers said. 1 Broadening of agreements to limit nuclear arms was urged by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. A superpower agreement limited to short-range weapons ''would ignore precisely those weapons that threaten above all our country,'' he said. 4 Agents arrested a Sikh suspected of masterminding the assassination of an Indian general. Sukhminder Singh, described as one of India's most wanted men, was captured at a New Jersey gas station. 7 A railroad construction scandal in Brazil threatens what Brazil's President Jose Sarney had planned as the main public-works effort of his administration. 3 A Japanese drive to buy American is succeeding only in part. Despite a drop in the dollar of more than 40 percent against the yen, imports from Europe and Taiwan have recorded far more substantial percentage gains. 37 Most Israelis favor participation in an international conference on the Middle East but are not willing to bring down the Government to pursue the idea, according to a newspaper survey. 3 Sakharov in doubt on releases 3 Fiji troops shut 2 newspapers 4 Segregation in South Pacific 4 Kenya upholds tribal burial 7 Turks frame vote on democracy 32 NATIONAL 8-9, 54 Producer prices rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Government reported. It was the biggest increase in 18 months and was seen as more evidence of stepped-up inflation. The news caused turbulence in the financial markets. 1 $92 million in PTL funds is missing, along with a 1939 Rolls Royce, and the ministry is seeking emergency donations to help pay a $66.7 million debt. ''I know Satan's against us,'' the Rev. Jerry Falwell told followers of the ministry. 1 Jim and Tammy Bakker are exiles. The couple climbed beyond their working-class circumstances to dizzying heights of fame and wealth only to be brought down, in the end, by their own excesses. 8 A statement critical of a court ruling was rejected by the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The statement criticized the Supreme Court's decision upholding job preferences for women and minorities. 1 A board for teacher certification tests was announced by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy. The voluntary tests would be developed by the teacher-dominated board. 9 AIDS testing for all immigrants seeking permanent resident status was recommended by the Public Health Service. Aliens found to be infected with the virus would be prevented from gaining permanent status. 1 A hunting and fishing rights dispute between residents of a small Wisconsin town and Indians from a nearby reservation has caused frictions even in the local softball league. 8 An investigation of corruption among Miami police officers is being aided by disclosures from two former officers who pleaded guilty to charges this week. 54 Sale of painkiller suspended 8 Man executed in Georgia 9 Senate filibuster continues 54 REGIONAL 33-36 High revenue may defer tax rises, the Cuomo administration said. More transactions made by taxpayers in 1986 to benefit from tax breaks being phased out under the new Federal tax code created an unexpected revenue increase. 1 Bernhard H. Goetz's lawyer is in the midst of what may be his most difficult legal test. But Barry I. Slotnick is an unabashed self-promoter who views himself as the best criminal lawyer in America. 33 A youth shot by Bernhard Goetz reversed an earlier decision not to testify in Mr. Goetz's trial, rather than face penalties for contempt. The witness, James Ramseur, was one of four teen-agers shot on a Manhattan subway train. 36 A teachers' manual was denounced by the chairman of a legislative panel on human rights because it contains passages that characterize all whites as racist. 33 Bus company records subpoenaed for an inquiry into an automobile purchase by Morris Tarshis, the former New York City franchise director. The Queens Transit Corporation, regulated by Mr. Tarshis's office, had owned the car. 35 Bridgemarket construction begins May 31, after delays from community opposition and financing problems, its promoters say. The food and restaurant center is to be built beneath the Queensboro Bridge. 35 Bicyclists still draw complaints in midtown, although the police say they are issuing more summonses for traffic violations by cyclists and accidents have declined. Critics say existing laws and their enforcement are not strict enough. 33 Smokers would be segregated in Westport, Conn., restaurants under terms of a proposed ordinance.

Higher prices for meat, energy and motor vehicles led the advance, but a wide array of other goods also posted gains. The Producer Price Index measures changes at the wholesale level and is considered a harbinger of inflation at the retail level. The index has averaged a gain of 0.4 percent a month so far this year. On an annual basis, April's rise would produce an annual inflation rate of 5.1 percent.

Ms. Hall said he told her he bought the violin from a friend for $100 shortly after it was stolen from a Carnegie Hall dressing room. After his death, she sought out the violin's rightful owner. That turned out to be Lloyds of London, which paid off on a $30,000 policy after the instrument, now valued at about $1 million, was stolen.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SNYDER'S WALK. By Thomas B. Morgan. (Dolphin/ Doubleday, $17.95.) Ezra Pound described literature as news that stays news. Thomas B. Morgan's second novel is literature about how hard it is for news to stay news. Jacob C. Snyder, a magazine writer, sees reporting as an almost Arthurian quest for the truth. He has a code of conduct as elaborate as that of any knight out of Chretien de Troyes, with canons against such evils as getting too involved personally or being manipulated. But at the age of 42, when only the ''irrational, incompetent, or unlucky'' are still in journalism, Snyder is faced with a story he can't keep at arm's length - a trek across America in 1966 by a ragtag group of antiwar protesters. He starts out with every intention of maintaining a reporter's distance from the news. Though the walkers see him as a superman who can ennoble their cause by writing favorably about them, he jokes that ''Clark Kent without a phone booth is only Clark Kent.'' But as the weeks pass he sympathizes with them and finds it hard to ignore their complaints that he won't let them ''get closer than your notebook.'' When the walkers dwindle to 11, he sees them as Apostles and himself as a Judas for remaining neutral. In the end, he emerges from his ''journalist's cocoon'' to help, but his betrayal of his own code has unexpectedly tragic consequences. Mr. Morgan, a former editor of The Village Voice, writes adeptly, though he gets carried away at times with awkward similes. And he lets the book's pace, like that of the walk, drag now and then. Nevertheless, he shows us that fiction can provide a surprisingly good medium for raising important questions about the search for facts.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE HUMAN SEASON. By Sarah Rossiter. (Little, Brown, $16.95.) Prep school novels about a boy's coming of age are familiar and usually written by men, but this first novel by Sarah Rossiter updates the genre while retaining the stock characters. Dunster, a New England boys' boarding school, seems to be a place time forgot, replete with tie-and-jacket code, compulsory chapel and bully-boy students who sir and madam everyone. Whether such a school can or ever could teach morality is the theme underlying this novel of duplicity, adultery and homosexuality. Peter Spaulding, its introspective 18-year-old hero, is the connecting link in an intricate love chain: Peter loves Cate, the waiflike 20-year-old wife of his English teacher, Manning, a bisexual who loves mostly himself but who once loved Peter. Manning also had an affair and fathered a child with Melissa, who is married to the school coach. Melissa and Cate love each other. This dizzying round of sexual variations is given an added spin by Cate's suicide (or was it murder?): she was pregnant with Peter's child. Elements of Gothic mystery are added by an almost mute, mentally incompetent kichen worker who sits in the dark school basement, rocking; an incriminating letter intercepted by the wrong person; and Cate's frenzied jottings (in an examination blue book), which Peter casts into the stream where Cate drowned. (Lest we miss the point, Peter's senior thesis is on Shakespearean tragedy.) The staggering weight of this involuted, somewhat teasing plot would sink most novels, but Ms. Rossiter's restrained, tightly controlled writing keeps it afloat. She writes in a clean, staccato style and has captured preppy male speech quite nicely. But do prep schools still put saltpeter in the mashed potatoes?",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Q and A,"Passports Question:Is there any way you can obtain a passport without spending time at a passport office? - R. S., Hicksville, L.I. Answer:There are agencies that specialize in obtaining United States passports, visas and other documents. They use messengers to stand on line at passport offices and consulates and their fees depend on how quick a service is needed. Usually an applicant needs to make a brief visit to the agency's office, taking birth certificate and oher documents, but for renewing a passport it is sometimes not even necessary to do that. If certain criteria can be met, applicants just have to deliver documents to the office. (The agencies can also supply birth certificates for people who have lost them.) Among services in New York is Passport Plus (677 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10022; 212-759-5540 and, from out of state, 800-367-1818). A citizen obtaining a passport for the first time pays Passport Plus $50 for one-week service, $65 to get a passport in 48 hours. The office will make the required photographs for another $5.95. For passport renewal, fees are: one week, $35; 48 hours, $50.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

The strange twist in the insider trading scandals came when a Federal judge denied a request by the Government for a two-month delay in the trial of Timothy L. Tabor, Robert M. Freeman and Richard B. Wigton. The Government said it needed more time to develop its case, and, when it could not get the delay, asked for a dismissal of the indictments so it could seek new, broader indictments. The defense lawyers are expected to ask the judge to either order an immediate trial or dismiss the indictments ''with prejudice,'' preventing the Government from bringing the same charges again. The development was seen as the first major setback in the Wall Street investigation for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan. For its part, the Government claims that it has so much information that it needs time to develop a wider and more comprehensive case against the three men. * * *",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

The argument originally was joined over the narrow musicological question of whether ''The Rite of Spring'' is essentially a tonal or a nontonal work, but has taken on the fervor of a dialectical struggle between Greek philosophers over the nature of the Sublime.

In the first half of ''Most Likely to Succeed'' Fran, the smart and sassy narrator, tries to re-create the turmoil, frustrations and fierce expectations that she and five other 'Cliffies endured in the early 1970's at Harvard University, in a male-dominated environment that simply intensified their ambivalence about their desires and goals; later in the book we find out what happened to them. As Fran sails through her classes, she grapples with a severe eating disorder, falls in and out of love with David and primes her journalistic skills on the Harvard Crimson. Through her we learn about Daisy, an insecure but compulsive student from the Midwest who becomes a successful photographer, disillusioned by her failures with men; Paige, an aloof and unhappy attorney who never finds what she wants or finishes what she starts; Eleanor, a brilliant physician who turns down a Harvard-affiliated hospital for a practice in Kansas; Tess, a successful doctor in conflict about her roles as professional, wife and mother; and Felicity, a tennis star and superwoman who is finally done in by her own aspirations. The material and the premise are ripe for provocative commentary, but the book has limited sociological value because the characters are composites and there is little documentation. More important, the writing is often heavy-handed - Ms. Schumer, the co-author with Mary Cunningham of the best-selling ''Powerplay,'' says that at Harvard she was a better reporter than a writer.

But the reality is that most of us look on a summer party as a chore - the beach beckons, the hammock lures, the dolce far niente of warm months takes over and sociability goes on hold until fall. Nevertheless, with good planning and the spice of invention, summer get-togethers can be all that the word easy implies. Takeout foods make a fast and elegant meal after a busy workday. Giving your dinner party in a restaurant may cost a touch more - but it's a lot less work. Inviting your guests to show off their culinary talents in your kitchen is another idea (remember, however, that guests seldom do the cleanup). Or you can take a group off for a day's outing and a classic picnic. This issue is packed with ideas for summer gatherings. Choose one that suits you, do it well and you'll have a festive and successful party. Do it very well and you'll find there's even time for a good read in the hammock.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

McFarlane, the former national security adviser, dominated not only last week's Congressional hearings on the Iran-contra affair, but also the attention of White House strategists. Highlights of the week's developments follow. * Mr. McFarlane said he had briefed the President ''dozens'' of times on the Administration's secret efforts to funnel private aid to Nicaraguan rebels. Mr. Reagan, who had previously implied lack of knowledge about details of the program, acknowledged that he was ''very definitely involved'' in it. But he insisted he did not know that profits from the sale of arms to Iran had been diverted to the contras. * Mr. McFarlane said Mr. Reagan personally approved a secret plan, ultimately unsuccessful, to pay $2 million in ransom for American hostages in Lebanon. Mr. Reagan said he did not recall any ransom plan but might have approved hiring rescuers. * Mr. McFarlane said he believed William J. Casey, the late Director of Central Intelligence, regularly gave instructions to Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. And he conceded that he had not given a ''full account'' of the affair to Congress last year. * The President acknowledged that he and King Fahd discussed Saudi Arabia's secret aid to the contras when the King visited Washington in 1985. But Mr. Reagan said that it was the King who brought up the subject. * The White House said Mr. Reagan had a Constitutional right to conduct the nation's foreign policy, including provision of aid to the contras, despite the laws in place from 1983 to 1985 that restricted such aid. * Robert Owen said that, as a courier between Colonel North and contra leaders, he carried envelopes full of cash from a White House safe, C.I.A. maps and Colonel North's tactical advice about military strikes. * An hour after Mr. Owen asserted that Johnathan S. Miller, a mid-level White House aide, had helped him make payments to contra leaders, Mr. Miller resigned from his job. * Senate investigators said they had located $10 million that was donated to the contras by the Sultan of Brunei and was reported to have been mislaid. Colonel North had transposed two numbers in making the electronic transfer of funds, and a Swiss businessman had found an unexpected $10 million in his account. He returned the money.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THAT EYE, THE SKY. By Tim Winton. (Atheneum, $14.95.) If you don't know Australian slang you might stop reading this novel after coming upon words like ''ute'' (pickup truck or van), ''crook'' (sick or broken), ''bowser'' (gasoline pump), ''plonk'' (red wine) and ''dag'' (sloppy or slovenly person). That would be a shame because ''That Eye, the Sky'' is a thoroughly engaging story of childhood, tragedy and faith. The narrator, 12-year-old Morton Flack (''Ort for short''), lives in an isolated community of western Australia with his father, Sam; his mother, Alice; Sam's senile mother, Grammar; and his moody 16-year-old sister, Tegwyn. One summer morning, Sam Flack is nearly killed in an automobile accident. When he comes home brain-damaged and paralyzed, Ort and his mother must care for him without help from anyone. A sensitive boy, Ort becomes a beguiling figure as he attempts to make sense of the tragedy and of the unexpected appearance of a stranger, Henry Warburton. This onetime poet and drifter helps to nurse Sam and shares his version of the story of Jesus, which Ort recounts as follows: ''He can do crazy things like walk on water and then make it into plonk, make crook people better and dead people alive. People didn't like him because he was so good to them. They killed him by sticking him on a tree. They put him in a hole but he got up afterwards and went up into the sky with God.'' Tim Winton, a young Australian novelist whose previous work has won acclaim in his country, depicts without condescension the emotional crosscurrents of the Flack household. Toward the end of the novel Ort prays for a miracle: ''Funny when you talk to God. He's like the sky. . . . Never says anything. But you know he listens.'' Though God hasn't answered Ort yet, Mr. Winton convinces us he might.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

Of course, not every bassist wants to drive or is capable of handling a careering vehicle. Not every band wants to be driven, by the bassist or by anyone else. But the bass has special capabilities, and its role in the jazz ensemble has developed in a special manner. Bass provides the bottom, and the pulse. In freer musical situations, the bass probes and prods, working in tandem with the drummer's rhythmic embroidery while feeding harmonic and melodic material to the players of chordal and melody instruments. Only the bass fulfills this triple-threat, rhythmic-melodic-harmonic function. A bassist, especially one who is a composer and bandleader as well, can simultaneously ground and guide a performance of improvisational music as it unfolds.",1987-05-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"QUESTION: In their long, hostile and transcontinental rivalry, which team holds the edge, the Giants or the Dodgers? It's still the Giants, by a 30-game margin, even though the Dodgers have lowered the difference by 14 games since both clubs abandoned New York for California 30 years ago. Counting the 4-3 edge in victories for Los Angeles this season, the teams have played nearly 1,800 games to a decision since 1900, and the scoreboard reads: Giants 914, Dodgers 884. On the East Coast, New York was the leader over Brooklyn, 650 to 606. On the West Coast, Los Angeles leads San Francisco, 278 to 264. On both coasts, the Dodgers have won 17 pennants, the Giants 15, and each team has been a World Series winner five times. In this century, no team has beaten the Giants more than the Dodgers have, and no team has beaten the Dodgers more than the Giants have. QUESTION: Why do coaches in the National Basketball Association wear jackets and ties during games? It's a league rule, part of the N.B.A. dress code, for all head coaches and their assistants to wear sport coats or suit coats. Ties are not required, though, and this no-tie loophole not only spares open-collared coaches such as Doug Moe of the Denver Nuggets from being penalized, but also symbolizes the league's policy to play every game to a decision. That's right, no ties. QUESTION: A held ball is called in a basketball game between the Pistons and the Lakers after Isiah Thomas of Detroit ties up Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Lakers near midcourt in the closing seconds of a tie game. The resulting jump-ball situation is a mismatch, with Abdul-Jabbar more than a foot taller than Thomas. If Thomas is certain that the Laker center will win the tap and try to direct the ball to a teammate for a possible fast-break game-winning basket, can the Piston guard concede the tap to Abdul-Jabbar, fake it as if he were going to jump against him, and instead slip toward one of the Lakers' intended receivers in an attempt to intercept the anticipated tapped ball and prevent a fast break? He'd probably have nothing to lose doing it, since the mismatch is so pronounced, but he'd wind up losing anyway, since the rules on jump balls restrict the two jumpers from leaving the jumping circle before the ball is tapped. Once the violation is called, the Lakers would get the ball out of bounds at midcourt, and that might not be as much of a disadvantage for the Pistons. Now they could guard the Lakers man to man on the throw-in pass as well as have a player guarding the passer on the sideline without a height mismatch. QUESTION: Has an N.B.A. player ever made the all-league team every season he has played? Only Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics has ever achieved this, although Bob Pettit, the former St. Louis Hawks' star, came mighty close. In his rookie season of 1979-80, Bird was selected at forward to the five-man first team in the voting of basketball writers and broadcasters in league cities, and he has not missed since. If he's chosen again, as expected, when the team is announced next week, that will make it a string of eight straight seasons for Bird.",1987-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Q&A,"Q. Why does February have only 28 days? Why wasn't a day taken from January and another from March to even all three months out to 30 days? A. The calender that we use is arbitrary, according to Dr. J. T. Fraser, president of the International Society for the Study of Time. Dr. Fraser said that our calender is based on the Julian year, 365.25 days long. Initially, the 12 months of the Julian year each contained either 31 or 30 days, alternating one after the other, and adding up to a 366 day year. The month of February was reduced from 30 to 29 days three out of every four years. July, which was named after Julius Caesar, had 31 days but August, named after Augustus Caesar, had only 30 days. Dr. Fraser said it is believed that Augustus did not like having fewer days in his month and prevailed upon the calendar makers to give August another day. The day was taken from February. Q. What does ''water softening'' mean? A. Water softening is a treatment process that removes the calcium and magnesium salts that make water ''hard.'' Hard water makes washing difficult and causes unpleasant scums and stains in households and laundries. The salts in hard water are also harmful to food processing and chemical processing because they produce unwanted byproducts and can damage boilers. Municipalities that have natural water with a hardness of more than 150 parts per million soften the water by treating it with lime and soda ash that turn the salts into precipitates that can be filtered out. The water is then passed through an exchanger that substitutes sodium ions for calcium and magnesium in the water.",1987-05-19T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 Ships may be highly vulnerable to unexpected attacks similar to the Iraqi missile assault on an American frigate in the Persian Gulf on Sunday, according to details provided by Navy experts. A10 News analysis: Doubts that policy makers properly analyze American commitments to trouble spots around the globe were revived by the Iraqi missile attack on the frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf. A10 An Israeli has been subpoenaed by the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra affair to testify before a grand jury, officials said. He is David Kimche, a former director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. A1 3 wealthy conservatives testified that Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North had influenced them to make large contributions to the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress cut off official United States assistance. A1 Doubts about peace in Afghanistan have settled over negotiators in Geneva, Western diplomats and analysts say. A1 Optimism at the nuclear arms talks is evident in Geneva. After two years, dealings between the American and Soviet negotiators have become frequent, nonpolemical and faintly friendly. A11 A witness at the Klaus Barbie trial testified he had seen the defendant direct a roundup of Jews in Lyons in 1943. A second witness described how he had survived the roundup, while his brother did not. A11 Charles A. Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris was recreated with a copy of his Spirit of St. Louis. Onlookers recalled the delirious throng that greeted Lucky Lindy after his 33 1/2-hour trans-Atlantic flight. A11 Gorillas appear secure in East Africa, where they had been protected by Dian Fossey, the zoologist who was murdered 18 months ago.

A1 Alzheimer's disease is hereditary, a new report by scientists suggested. It said the risk of developing Alzheimer's was four to five times as great among close relatives of patients as it was in the general population. A14 National concern about AIDS has prompted a flurry of action in Washington. Bills in Congress would allocate nearly $1 billion to research and education on the lethal disease. A20 The White House should educate the world on the danger of AIDS, Vice President Bush said. The Reagan Administration has been accused of not providing enough funds for research on the disease.

A grand jury cited insufficient evidence against the driver, Dominick Blum, 25. A1 Traffic will increase by 10 percent in New York City this summer, officials predict. The warm weather surge could lead to some of the worst jams in history, especially along the many roads under repair.

us,WEEKENDER GUIDE,"FRIDAY A TOUCH OF THURBER James Thurber once said that ''a touch of eccentricity ran deep in my family,'' and the characters he created in his essays, stories and cartoons certainly reflect that family trait. Some of them will come to life in ''James Thurber Kintypes,'' the latest in the ''Laugh at Lunch'' presentations of the American Humorists' Series. In this one-man show, John Valentine, an actor whose stage and television credits include ''Deathtrap,'' ''The Rivals'' and ''Cagney and Lacey,'' will step into Thurber's shoes, bringing to life Rex the Dog, Great Uncle Zenus and several other of the author's whimsical creations. The 50-minute production can be seen at the American Place Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 1 P.M., and Wednesdays at noon. Tickets are $5. Bring your own lunch. (Fruit and beverages are available.) Information: 247-0393. JITTERBUGGING CINDERELLA Since the Brothers Grimm first committed it to print in the early 1800's, the fairy tale ''Cinderella'' has appeared in many guises, including movies, plays, operas and ballets. Its latest incarnation is the dance-theater piece ''Cendrillon,'' by the French choreographer Maguy Marin. In this version, which can be seen tonight at 8 in a performance by the Lyons Opera Ballet, Ms. Marin has given the classic a modern look: the fairy godmother has a neon magic wand, and, after arriving at the ball in a pink convertible, Cinderella jumps rope and dances the jitterbug. The dancers, their faces hidden by doll-like masks, move about in a spectacular three-story doll house, and injected into Prokofiev's score are taped sounds of baby talk and gurgles. The production, which critics lauded after its American premiere in January, will be at the City Center, 131 West 55th Street, now through May 31. In addition to tonight's performance, ''Cendrillon'' will be presented tomorrow at 2 and 8 P.M. and Sunday at 3 P.M. Tickets are $17 to $37. Information: 246-8989, or call Teletron: 947-5850. A MABOU MINES WORLD Mabou Mines, the 17-year-old experimental-theater group, is known for its innovative and often provocative works. Its latest production, ''It's a Man's World,'' is no exception. The play, written by and starring Greg Mehrten, a Mabou Mines member since 1981, is a multimedia work using live performance and video to tell the story of Joey Fontina, a former matinee idol whose admitted homosexuality has jeopardized his career. The play moves backward and forward in time, creating a sense of fantasy and memory, while three onstage monitors display fragmented images of the characters. David Schweizer, whose credits include the New York Shakespeare Festival, Playwrights Horizons and the Yale Repertory Theater, directs the seven-member cast. ''It's a Man's World'' will run through June 28. The performance tonight, at 8, is at the Apple Corps Theater, 336 West 20th Street. The work will also be performed Sunday at 3 and 8 P.M. Tickets are $15; $13 for students and the elderly. Information: 869-3981. SATURDAY THE SOUND OF A STRAD No name symbolizes perfection in stringed instruments more than Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737). The Cremona violin maker, who lived during the height of the Baroque era, built hundreds of illustrious instruments of the highest quality, some 650 of which survive today. One of them, a violin made in 1701 for King Philip V of Spain, grandson of the French monarch Louis XIV, can be heard Saturday at 8:30 P.M. in a recital at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall. The concert, sponsored by the International Festival Series, features Thruston Johnson, a violinist formerly with the Chicago Symphony and a founder of the festival series, accompanied by David Garvey, pianist, and Lisa Ghersi, cellist. The program, representing three centuries of Spanish music, includes works of Luigi Boccherini, who, despite his Italian origins, spent most of his adult life working in Spain; Manuel de Falla, and Joaquin Nin, a Cuban composer. This concert is the eighth in the series' Hispanic Festival. Tickets are $15 at the Carnegie Hall box office, 749-7839. AFRICAN DIASPORA WOMEN May marks the first Tribute to African Diaspora Women at the Caribbean Cultural Center, focusing on the the worldwide political, educational and cultural contributions by women of African descent. As part of the monthlong series of lectures, exhibitions and other events, a special concert, ''The Rhythm of Women,'' will take place at Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Saturday night at 8. The program features the renowned vocal ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock, a five-voice unaccompanied group founded in 1973 by one of its current members, Bernice Johnson Reagon. The group will present songs of struggle and protest, as well as spirituals, gospel and other music rooted in the black American tradition. Opening the concert will be 12 women playing percussion - 2 drummers and 10 chekere players, an ethnic instrument made from a dried-out gourd - and a women's chorus performing traditional African chants. Tickets are $20, $25 and $30 ($15 for students and the elderly) and are available at the Caribbean Cultural Center, 408 West 58th Street (307-7420), or at the Town Hall box office, 840-2824. A RARE BRITTEN OPERA Benjamin Britten's rarely staged opera, ''The Rape of Lucretia,'' can be heard this weekend in a production by the Conservatory of Music at Brooklyn College. The dramatic, two-act chamber opera, written in 1946, recounts the story of the Roman Prince Tarquinius, who, when told that Lucretia, the wife of General Collatinus, is the only officer's wife beyond suspicion of infidelity, decides to put her to the test. Although the setting is Rome in the sixth century B.C., a male and female chorus find a Christian moral in the pagan story. Singers in this performance, all students at the Brooklyn College Opera Theater, include Amy Gluck, contralto, in the title role; Robert Termine, bass-baritone, as Collatinus, and Scott Wilde, baritone, as Tarquinius. Edward Berkeley, whose stage credits include Broadway productions of ''Macbeth,'' ''The Tempest'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' is the director, and the Conservatory Opera Orchestra will be conducted by Richard Barrett, artistic director of the Opera Theater. The performance, in English, is Saturday at 2 P.M. at the Gershwin Theater, Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues. Tickets are $5 ($3 for students and the elderly). Information: (718) 434-1900. SUNDAY COPLAND IN THE BRONX Aaron Copland's life has spanned much of the 20th century, during which time the composer, perhaps America's best known, has written numerous works already considered classics. Several of them can be heard Sunday at 2 P.M. when the Bronx Arts Ensemble salutes Copland with a free concert devoted entirely to his music. The program will include two favorites, ''Appalachian Spring'' and ''A Lincoln Portrait.'' Jonathan Tunick, composer and arranger, will conduct, and William Warfield, the baritone whose rendition of ''Old Man River'' in the film version of ''Showboat'' immortalized the song, will be the narrator for ''A Lincoln Portrait.'' The outdoor concert, sponsored by the Bronx Council on the Arts, will be at the Jerome Avenue entrance to the Woodlawn Cemetery, at the intersection of Jerome and Bainbridge Avenues in the Bronx. Seating is limited, and the audience is urged to bring blankets or folding chairs. Information: 931-9500 or 920-0500. MONDAY FOR HOMELESS VETERANS Memorial Day is a time to remember those who have died in war, but a rock concert on Monday will also call attention to our living veterans who are homeless. Dan Snyder, a guitarist with the band Range War and an organizer of the benefit, said that since, in the city, ''as many as one-third of the homeless are vets, I knew it was a situation that would inspire the concern of the New York music community.'' Lined up for the 12-hour marathon, which begins at 3 P.M., are Black Rock Coalition, the Surreal McCoys, Bobby Radcliff, Range War, Beat Brigade and many other local rock groups. The concert will be at CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street. Tickets are $8, with proceeds going to BRC Human Services, a nonsectarian agency that provides shelter, counseling and other social services to homeless men and women.

The 14-part series reopens with a special two-hour episode Sunday at 9 on Channels 13 and 49. Based on the Paul Scott novels known collectively as ''The Raj Quartet,'' this British mini-series, made for Granada TV, has been justifiably showered with international awards. Mr. Scott set out to tell the story ''of a rape, of the events that led up to it and followed it and of the place in which it happened.'' That place, of course, is India, still part of the dwindling British Empire. Here are two nations locked in an imperial embrace that transcends the normal boundaries of love and hate. The TV dramatization - written by Ken Taylor and directed by Christopher Morahan and Jim O'Brien - offers an unflinching portrait of the arrogance and inevitable corruption of imperialism, exposing its underbelly of vicious social snobbery and racism. The story begins in 1942 with the first stirrings of a doomed love affair between awkward, galumphing Daphne Manners (Susan Wooldridge) and brooding Hari Kumar (Art Malik). When Daphne is raped, her would-be suitor, the police officer Ronald Merrick (Tim Pigott-Smith) embarks on a campaign of hateful revenge that will reverberate until the very eve of Indian independence in 1947. The superb cast also includes Peggy Ashcroft, Judy Parfitt and Eric Porter. This is landmark television, not to be missed.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

It is now possible to have a power lunch alone.

How's this: ''In a contest for power, physical strength still plays a major role; there are no neurasthenic titans.'' (Uh, waiter, another helping of steak tartare.) Or this: ''The powerful man kept his options open. He had no use for philosophers, who are immobilized by truth.'' Earl Shorris, author of ''The Oppressed Middle: Scenes From Corporate Life'' and other books, is a man who has viewed power up close and hasn't found it a pretty sight. In this book he has collected 192 of his observations - no need to count them, they're numbered - on the uses and abuses of the big P. Among those that made this reader sit up straight in his chair were No. 12, ''A Mexican proverb: The rich leave the poor like dishes at an inn, scraped clean and face down''; No. 118, ''When a powerful man yawns, he expresses boredom; weariness is for the weak''; and No. 169, ''A metaphor: To maintain power one will eventually be required to kill a friend.''

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AN AMERICAN WOMAN. By Kati Marton. (Norton, $15.95.) Anna Bator was born in Hungary. When she was 6 years old, her parents were arrested as spies. They were allowed to emigrate after their release, and Anna was raised in America. She grew into a cosmopolitan woman, became a successful television correspondent, married and had a child, but was not happy. Her parents had withheld from her any connection to her past - including the fact that her father was Jewish - and she determined to return to Hungary to search for her roots. She found more than she bargained for, her American-bred innocence no match for the complicated labyrinth of Eastern European politics and hostilities. ''An American Woman,'' a first novel by Kati Marton, is at least partly autobiographical. Ms. Marton, who was born in Hungary, was a correspondent in Eastern and Western Europe for ABC News. This book does not leave the reader with a searing insight into the human condition. It does not startle by the beauty of its prose - the style is straightforward. But it is a lively cold war story, told with sensitivity and intelligence. It is enlightening about life in Eastern Europe, rich with the detail that only a keen memory and a sharp eye can garner, and it offers some interesting musings on the differences between East and West that go beyond the trappings of materialism. One of the virtues of this novel is that it probes beneath the surface, insisting on the importance of history. Anna Bator is an otherwise perfectly assimilated American - part of a culture unique in its belief that history can be ignored or overcome. But she must have been less Americanized than she thought, because the central tenet of the book is deeply Eastern European: without a strong sense of history, without a national and cultural past, any present, no matter how glittering, is unsatisfying.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

Abramson's unauthorized history exposes the not so very dark side of a venerable institution and its phenomenally successful publishing arm. Among those aspects of the National Geographic Society we may not read about in the authorized version - due out next year, to coincide with the society's centennial - are the magazine's relentlessly sunny attitude, which gave rise to such travesties as a glowing report on Nazi Germany published in 1937, and a 1962 article about South Africa featuring ''happy blacks doing their tribal dances''; past sexist and racist employment practices, including segregated dining rooms for black and white and male and female employees; and a tax-exempt status that continues to encourage the funneling of profits back into luxurious perks, though the magazine no longer maintains a fleet of chauffeured cars for its editors. Otherwise, this isn't a very interesting book. Mr. Abramson, a financial editor for The Washington Post, got his information mostly secondhand, from a 1943 New Yorker series by Geoffrey T. Hellman and a 1970 New York Times Magazine piece by Tom Buckley, and from The Washington Post. The Post is the source of many anecdotes, like the one about the archeologist George Stuart, who, in search of a Mayan tomb, charged on his Visa card the cost of clearing an emergency landing site in an apparently guerrilla-ridden area of Guatemala. Except for a preoccupation with ''all those memorable brown breasts,'' Mr. Abramson's ''National Geographic'' reads like a term paper - earnest, informative and rife with footnotes and cliches.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,LIGHTS UP! LIBRETTOS OPEN! ENJOY!,"TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, say the French, is to forgive everything. Perhaps that even applies to opera singing. Unfortunately, audiences at staged productions all too rarely have the opportunity to test the validity of that maxim. For good theatrical reasons, they must be kept literally in the dark. Opera in concert form, on the other hand, while it has serious drawbacks, holds one clear advantage over the usual staged kind: everyone in attendance can understand in detail what is going on. Perhaps that is why the unstaged repertory is so much more venturesome than what regularly turns up in our leading houses. People who are only intermittently aware of what is going on may be forgiven for cleaving to a few standard works that they have come to know, more or less. They may also, out of frustration with unintelligible singing, choose to be connoisseurs of scenery and costumes.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

This is a lucid, appealingly human account of the life of the French feminist and lover of Jean-Paul Sartre. The authors, Claude Francis and Fernande Gontier, who have written critical works on Simone de Beauvoir, Proust and others, found their point of departure in the more than 1,400 pages of love letters from de Beauvoir to the Chicago writer Nelson Algren. The romance of this mismatched pair is one of the narrative highlights of the volume -the usually somber de Beauvoir calls her American friend ''blond husband,'' ''dear Crocodile'' and ''Brute from nowhere.'' Indeed, there is a joie de vivre about this book, fluently translated by Lisa Nesselson, that explains why it might have been a lot of fun to be an existentialist. Even political disputes have a racy air here: when de Beauvoir published Volume One of ''The Second Sex'' in 1949, Francois Mauriac wrote to a staffer at the review Les Temps Modernes, founded by Sartre and de Beauvoir four years earlier, ''I've learned all there is to know about your boss's vagina.'' Everything about de Beauvoir's life was vehement, beginning with an early infatuation with religion that led her to lock herself ''in the bathroom, where she mortified her flesh by . . . whipping herself with a gold necklace until she drew blood.'' Later on, she had to win Sartre's attentions from Simone Jollivet, an aspiring actress who ''liked to receive her admirers in the nude, standing before the fireplace, her long blonde hair cascading onto her shoulders, reading Michelet's 'History of the French Revolution.' '' The present book vividly captures some of the intellectual and emotional hyperactivity of Sartre and de Beauvoir.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE PERFECT WAR: Technowar in Vietnam. By James William Gibson. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.95.) Early in this argumentative book, the author writes: ''If you are setting up an ambush, you must first pick a place where men are likely to walk. . . . You then position your mines and grenades and automatic weapons to achieve overlapping or intersecting 'fields of fire.' '' In a literary sense, that is what James William Gibson, a sociologist at Southern Methodist University, has done. Then he shoots with abandon at liberals and conservatives, hawks and doves, soldiers and scholars alike for their analyses of how America got into Vietnam, the way the war was fought and why the United States lost. Few escape his criticism for practicing ''mechanistic anticommunism'' and ''Technowar,'' which he calls the ''production model of war,'' in that combat is managed like an automobile assembly line. Moreover, Mr. Gibson fears that the ''Vietnam syndrome,'' which curtailed the application of American military power after Vietnam, has really evaporated; thus, he says, the United States is preparing for a war in Central America in which the ''redeployment of Technowar can only result in another massive defeat.'' With all that, the book leaves one unsatisfied. The reader knows what the author is against but not much about what he advocates, beyond a plea that Americans understand how they became ''entrapped'' in Vietnam. ''And with such understanding,'' he concludes, ''changing the war system and mythology, and creating a more complex, humane, vision of the world, become compelling obligations.''",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

A scheming, kvetching twit with an opinion about everything, Lark longs for life away from her native Sydney and gets her wish. After her boyfriend immigrates to the United States, she makes two friends at the university: the wealthy Donna Bird, daughter of a Columbia University art professor, and Tom Brown, a political activist. When Tom returns to Columbia, Lark and Donna (rivals for his affection) hop a United States-bound freighter loaded with the professor's secret booty: smuggled art. En route, Lark abandons Donna on a remote Pacific island, thus clearing the way for her romance with Tom. But Lark's plans are sabotaged by two unforeseen factors: Tom's devotion to the 60's intellectual radical movement around Columbia and Donna's sudden, melodramatic return. Lark maneuvers her way out of the second obstacle but faces a more difficult challenge in accepting Tom's life. In her first novel to be published in this country, the Australian novelist Glenda Adams attempts to impose a satire of 1960's political cliches on the story of Lark's coming of age - and meets with little success. The two simply do not mix, and despite her lampoon of public ''happenings'' and open marriage, ''Dancing on Coral'' seems more like a novel of the 50's than the 60's. It fares best in its Australian setting, where the author demonstrates a firm grasp of provincial life, nicely evoking her homeland and even showing a gift for nuance. But Lark's shrillness is unremitting and builds to a high pitch whenever the United States meets with her disapproval. When she herself has so little regard for the new life she has created, it is hard to expect readers to care.",1987-05-24T05:00:00+0000

Weinberger said. Page 1 Kuwait wants U.S.-Soviet protection for its oil fleet, the Emir of Kuwait said. The growing gulf war ''has come out of its local framework to become an international concern,'' he said. 3 Moscow woos developing nations in an effort to increase the Soviet Union's leverage in those areas. ''It is a pragmatic rather than a dogmatic approach,'' one Asian diplomat said of the effort. 1 News analysis: President Reagan contradicted previous Administration statements by asserting that a ban on aid to the rebels in Nicaragua in 1985 did not apply to his National Security Council or national security adviser. 1 In South Africa, official repression and torture has been reported in the trouble-torn ''homeland'' of KwaNdebele. Recent accounts have come from a journalist from the top circulation Johannesburg daily. 5 Fear of the spread of AIDS in Greece has prompted changes on the resort island of Mykonos, long viewed as the Aegean's prime gathering place for homosexual men and as a place where a mood of hedonism prevailed. 24 The reaction to Klaus Barbie's trial, while mixed, has been been above all quiet in Lyons, producing few if any signs of a reliving of a traumatic past. For some, the trial is all too much of a bother. 2 In Britain, the 'caring vote' is being pursued by each party for the coming general election. The battle parallels the struggle over ''compassion'' and ''fairness'' in the 1984 Presidential election in the United States. 2 In China, the culture of the Miao, a small ethnic nationality unrelated to China's Han majority, is vanishing under the weight of an unstated but clear policy of national homogenization. 4 Iraqis uncomfortable over U.S. reaction 3 Athens to call vote on the future of U.S. bases 4 NATIONAL$ 6-8, 37 Poor supervision of election finances by the Federal Election Commission has been charged by critics who say the agency is sluggish, partly because of the process established by Congress. 1 In Georgia, a high school's honesty about its use of an ineligible player cost its basketball team the state championship. But the town of Conyers has rallied behind its school and the team's coach. 1 Demand for home loans has slowed following the recent spurt in mortgage rates. Industry officials are worried that many potential buyers will be squeezed out of the market if rates continue to rise. 33 A governors' meeting in Philadelphia was part of the celebration of the Constitution's bicentennial. But only five governors of the 13 original states showed up for the conference on the state of the states. 8 Behind the scenes in 1787 8 Pierre du Pont 4th is the wealthiest of the Presidential contenders, according to financial disclosure documents.

The success of the Reagan Administration's trade sanctions against Japan and a sudden surge in purchases of personal computers have spurred demand and driven up profit margins.

us,Q&A,"Q.Before scientists learned to make synthetic growth hormone, where was it obtained? A. Growth hormone was painstakingly removed in small amounts from the pituitary glands of human corpses. The hormone was in short supply, and there was a long waiting list. Growth hormone was also obtained from monkeys, the only animals whose protein is active in humans. Today, the nation's supply of growth hormone is produced almost exclusvely through genetic engineering techniques. Q.Which are better for reading, halogen bulbs or standard incandescent bulbs? A.Experts disagree about whether standard incandescent lightbulbs with tungsten filaments or bulbs with halogen filaments are best. But most say the best reading conditions are in a well-lit area with a generous focused pool of light. Under standard conditions, a soft white incandescent bulb provides superb lighting for reading, according to experts, because it is covered with a coating of finely powered silicas that diffuses the light, making the filament almost invisible. Soft-white bulbs also produce the softest shadows. Halogen incandescent bulbs work in a similar way but their filaments produce greater heat and whiter light, even though halogen bulbs are about one-tenth the size of standard bulbs. Many experts suggest that halogen bulbs be used in lamps with large shades and a dimmer switches. If not, the tiny bulbs can produce small pools of light and crisp shadows, which are not good for reading.",1987-05-26T05:00:00+0000

Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr., Sandra Day O'Conner and Antonin Scalia. Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented, joined by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent. FROM THE OPINION By Chief Justice Rehnquist The Bail Reform Act of 1984 allows a Federal court to detain an arrestee pending trial if the Government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence after an adversary hearing that no release conditions ''will reasonably assure . . . the safety of any other person and the community.'' The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit struck down this provision of the Act as facially unconstitutional, because, in that court's words, this type of pretrial detention violates ''substantive due process.'' We granted certiorari because of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals regarding the validity of the Act.

Her eerie buzzing alto still flays into songs that discuss the plight of American Indians while evoking Indian cowboy ritualism. Ms. Sainte-Marie's finely chiseled protest lyrics have held up beautifully. So have her love lyrics, especially those of her standard, ''Until It's Time for You to Go.'' The deceptively light folk whimsy of Livingston Taylor, who shares the bill, offers an appealing contrast to Ms. Sainte-Marie's directness. Shows are tonight at 8 and 11; seats are $12.",1987-05-29T05:00:00+0000

If the tulips have not bloomed well in recent years, dig up bulbs and discard; order new ones for planting in fall; finish pruning spring-flowering shrubs; cold soil has persisted and given tardy gardeners time to sow grass seed or set in sod; continue asparagus harvests from three-year-old plants or older; snap off spears at ground level just before cooking.

One of the more remarkable incidents in the history of perambulation occurred in September 1940, when a very young garage hand from the village of Montignac in southwestern France went out in the country to take the air. Hearing his dog barking from inside a hole in the ground, he went in to see what had happened and thereby stumbled - almost literally - upon the 17,000-year-old cave paintings of Lascaux. Within three days, the local tourist bureau had put up a sign that read ''Lascaux Caves, 3 kilometers,'' and anyone who wanted to do so, and could overcome the difficulties of a France in catastrophic defeat by the Germans, was free to go down and look around.",1987-05-31T05:00:00+0000

Florence Bellis's place in the international world of horticulture is assured, thanks to her achievement in originating - over many decades of careful and imaginative hybridization - the many strains of primroses collectively named after her Oregon home, Barnhaven. These remarkable and extremely hardy plants come in a palette of wonderful colors: glowing scarlets and crimsons, golds and yellows, pristine whites, deep blues, as well as blends and combinations of several colors. Her main subject in ''Gardening and Beyond'' (the first volume in the series ''Nature and Artifice: Two Sides of the Gardening Coin'' edited by Richard L. Critz) is her breeding of primroses, but to tell this story she ranges very far indeed, touching on soil chemistry, the long evolution of plants and animals, agriculture and the Industrial Revolution, exploration for plants in the 19th century, and the joys and frustrations that alternate in every true gardener's life. Mrs. Bellis moves so effortlessly from one topic to another and writes with such personal authority that both novice gardeners and longtime practitioners of the art will learn many surprising things from her, including a technique for driving moles away by putting spoiled liver in their tunnels. The Barnhaven primroses enrich our springtime gardens; ''Gardening and Beyond'' enriches the gardener's library. * * * LANDSCAPING WITH PERENNIALS. By Emily Brown. Illustrated by Leslie J. Haning and Rachel Gage. 304 pp. (Timber Press, $34.95.) The foremost trend in gardening in the United States in the last decade has been an increasing interest in ornamental perennials. This interest has raised the profits of American garden centers and mail-order nurseries. It has also attracted the attention of a great many of our major publishing houses, which have imported books on the subject from Great Britain despite the fact that plants readily available there may be almost impossible to find here - and the further fact that practical advice suitable for the climates and soils of England may be recipes for failure on our own side of the Atlantic. Two years ago, HP Books published Pamela Harper and Frederick McGourty's handsomely illustrated paperback, ''Perennials: How to Select, Grow & Enjoy.'' Widely sold in garden centers as well as bookstores, it remains the best introduction yet to the culture of perennials. Now comes Emily Brown's far more complete and exhaustive ''Landscaping With Perennials,'' a reference book that can lay claim to being the standard work on its topic for years to come. Generously illustrated with line drawings and color photographs, it is one of the truly indispensable books for the serious gardener, since it draws together an enormous amount of practical and scientific material on perennials. It is flawed, however, by a poorly executed index that sometimes will send readers scurrying to the wrong page. * * * A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO EDIBLE & USEFUL PLANTS: Including Recipes, Harmful Plants, Natural Dyes & Textile Fibers. By Delena Tull. Illustrated. 518 pp. (Texas Monthly Press, $23.95.) In the tradition established By Euell Gibbons's ''Stalking the Wild Asparagus,'' this fascinating handbook explores such miscellaneous matters as recipes for prickly pear gumbo and farkleberry jelly, the high vitamin C content of rose hips and the use of nasturtium leaves as a yellow dye for fabric. It covers not only ''edible and useful plants,'' but also some very nasty ones that may make us itch, sneeze, contract violent gastrointestinal pains and even drop dead if we confuse an innocent plant with a noxious look-alike. This guide restricts itself to the flora of Texas, both native and introduced, but because many plants that grow in Texas also grow elsewhere, including the Northeast, it should be widely appreciated outside the Lone Star State. Its combination of chatty prose and precise botanical information makes it highly readable, especially for browsers, but it may also prove to be a lifesaver for someone whose child has just nibbled on chinaberries or seeds of the common wild sweet pea, both potentially lethal without swift medical attention. * * * A BOUQUET OF GARDEN WRITING: Selected From Five Grand Masters. Edited by Ursula Buchan. Illustrated. 191 pp. (Godine, $25.) This British import is a curious one, for Ursula Buchan refers to it in her introduction as an anthology and claims on the title page only an editor's role, not a writer's. Indeed, a good bit of the text is quoted from works by her ''grand masters,'' a quintet of influential British horticultural writers composed of William Robinson, Gertrude Jekyll, Vita Sackville-West, E. A. Bowles and Reginald Farrer, all of whom have been much in vogue in recent years on both sides of the Atlantic. But this bouquet was picked by Ms. Buchan herself, with notable taste and intelligence. Much of the text is hers, including biographical chapters on all five grand masters. Her undeniable admiration for them is by no means slavish. She knows that most gardeners don't live at Sissinghurst Castle and cannot thus garden on the same scale as Vita Sackville-West, even if they may learn many a thing from her. Of the flood of British books on horticulture to American shores over the last decade, I would place Ursula Buchan's at the top of my list of favorites. * * * LEAVES FROM THE GARDEN: Two Centuries of Garden Writing. Edited by Clare Best and Caroline Boisset. Illustrated. 415 pp. (Norton, $22.50.) Unlike ''A Bouquet of Garden Writing,'' ''Leaves From the Garden'' is an unalloyed anthology of British garden writers from Humphry Repton in the 18th century to the present. Much of the material is of scant interest or relevance for contemporary American readers, unless they have a special interest in horticultural history. * * * GARDENS BY DESIGN: Step-by-Step Plans for 12 Imaginative Gardens. By Peter Loewer. Illustrated by the author. 224 pp. (Rodale Press, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $12.95.) Readers of Peter Loewer's eight previous books know what to expect of him: graceful, lapidary prose; an affection for miscellaneous horticultural information; charm and a touch of whimsy; and his own illustrations, which always combine botanical accuracy with a highly personal eye and style. ''Gardens by Design'' is a welcome addition to the now-substantial Loewer canon. * * * GARDENING WITH THE NEW SMALL PLANTS: The Complete Guide to Growing Dwarf and Miniature Shrubs, Flowers, Trees and Vegetables. By Oliver E. Allen. Illustrated. 196 pp. (Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) There's a fine irony in a book advising gardeners to think small when its subtitle is such a mouthful, reminiscent of 19th-century horticultural tomes. But the subtitle is an accurate description of this practical guide to diminutive plants for gardens where a grand scale is impossible to achieve. A valuable appendix lists nurseries offering the plants Mr. Allen discusses. * * * LANNING ROPER: And His Gardens. By Jane Brown. Illustrated. 224 pages. (Rizzoli, $35.) Lanning Roper managed a feat that few observers of the world of horticulture in Great Britain could have predicted or even thought possible. An American, born in New Jersey in 1912, he came to England as a naval officer during World War II, remained there at the war's end, and eventually became noted both as a garden writer for such periodicals as The Sunday Times of London and Country Life and as a garden designer for such prominent clients as Lord Snowdon and the Aga Khan. In this handsome and winning biography, Jane Brown reveals Lanning Roper, who died in 1983, as a knowing and tasteful gardener, an engaging human being and a graceful writer.",1987-05-31T05:00:00+0000

us,BUILDERS GET LUXURY BONUS IN RETURN FOR LOW-INCOME UNITS: CITY PLAN DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH,"THErr concept of ''inclusionary zoning,'' which is aimed at enabling low-income families to live in high-income neighborhoods, was recently incorporated into New York City's zoning regulations. In certain areas, developers will be allowed to build luxury apartment towers as much as 20 percent higher than would otherwise be allowed. In return, they must build or renovate low-income housing - generally nearby the higher-income project. Like most such plans, the inclusionary zoning measure approved by the Board of Estimate represented a compromise and completely satisfied no one. It did not, as some such measures do in other cities, make it mandatory for builders of luxury housing to construct some lower-income housing. Nor did it give builders the option, as some wanted, of constructing the bonus low-income housing anywhere in the city. Alan Finder, a New York Times reporter assigned to City Hall, interviewed representatives of three points of view on the issue - City Councilwoman Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan; Sylvia Deutsch, Chairwoman of the City Planning Commission; and Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. Excerpts follow.",1987-05-31T05:00:00+0000

For as long as I have lived in the building - more than 30 years - garbage has been collected dailyfrom the stairwells on each floor. Recently, both tenants and shareholders were advised that the porters would no longer be picking up garbage and that occupants would be responsible for taking their own to the basement. I feel this represents a reduction in service. Am I entitled to a reduction in my rent to compensate for this lost service? . . . V. C., Mount Vernon, N.Y. Answer: Rent reductions for significant reductions in services may be ordered by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency that supervises rent-regulated units. Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the agency, said that, lacking details, he cannot tell if your case merits such a reduction. To apply for a rent reduction, complete a Reduction in Service Complaint form and return it to the division at 92-31 Unon Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens 11433. The forms are available at the district rent offices in each borough. ADDING A SKYLIGHT Question: I live on the top floor of a co-op apartment building that has an unused dumbwaiter shaft.
