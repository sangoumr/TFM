us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TAVCAR, LAWRENCE R.","TAVCAR-Lawrence R., 64. A longtime senior public relations executive who was an expert in preparing corporate annual reports, died on August 24 at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital, near his home in Stamford. He managed or was involved in the production of 80 annual reports, sometimes drafting the messages of chief executive officers. Mr. Tavcar was a consultant working from an office in his home since 1990. As a consultant and, earlier, as an account executive, he served such clients as AT&T, Automatic Data Processing, Coca-Cola Bottling, Engelhard, Firestone, H.J. Heinz, McGrawHill, Reader's Digest, Scott Paper, C.I.T. Financial Corporation, and Unilever. In the late 1980's, he was senior director for corporate communications for Paramount Communications, formerly Gulf+Western. From 1978 to 1984, he was a senior vice president of the Carl Byoir & Associates, then the third largest public relations firm in the country. An annual report that he prepared as a consultant to Engelhard received an award from the National Association of Investors Corporation as one of the best from an investor's perspective. ''A masterful job,'' said the judges. Another citation for his work on annual reports, hailed his performance with the comment: ''Of all the talents in the field, none do we respect more than Lawrence R. Tavcar...Not only does he produce good work...but he's one of the industry's true thinkers.''At Paramount, his last corporate position before becoming a consultant, Mr. Tavcar produced six annual reports and was responsible for analyst and annual meeting presentations. The company's reports received awards from ''Institutional Investor'' magazine. He also directed the creation and publication of ONE, the company's quarterly magazine. ''Using spectacular graphics and sheer showmanship,'' the ''Public Relations Handbook'' said, the magazine ''achieves a dazzling impact...as attractive in content as in style.'' He played an instrumental communications role during the company's restructuring from a quintessential conglomerate with farranging operations into an international leader in entertainment (Paramount Pictures) and publishing (Simon & Schuster). Paramount was acquired by Viacom in 1994. As an account executive at Carl Byoir, Mr. Tavcar handled the public relations involved in the recall of the Firestone 500 tire, then the largest product recall in history, an incident that has reverberations in another Firestone recall that is taking place today. Also, early in his career, he conducted some of the research that demonstrated the increasing importance of institutional investors. Thus, when the New York Stock Exchange established its Institutional Investors Department, he was appointed assistant manager. In addition to his specialization in annual reports, Mr. Tavcar during his career managed projects involving corporate magazines, employee information programs, speech writing, and marketing. He won more than 20 awards from professional associations for his work. Mr. Tavcar frequently retained responsibility for the writing end of public relations projects, an activiity often delegated to writing specialists. His writing extended over a broad array of business products, testament to his undergraduate education in journalism and his lifelong appreciation of stellar articles that appeared in newspapers and magazines. Mr. Tavcar was a member of the Public Relations Society of America and served on its honors and awards committee for four years. He also was a member of the National Investor Relations Institute, the International Association of Business Communicators, the Society of Professional Journalists, and the Fairfield County (Conn.) Public Relations Association. He was a former contributing editor of the Corporate Communications Report and the Corporate Annual Report Newsletter and a contributor to many newsletters in the public relations and communications fields. Mr. Tavcar, who was born and raised in Cleveland, maintained a devotion to the Cleveland Browns football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team through a lifetime spent mostly in the Northeast. He was a graduate of Ohio Universtiy and retained a lifelong loyalty to his alma mater. He served on the board of directors of its national alumni association, as a member of the advisory board to the university's E.W. Scripps School of Journalism, and as president of Ohio University's Greater New York Alumni Chapter. He received two service awards from the university. Mr. Tavcar leaves his wife, Denise, and two sons, Bret of Stamford, and Erik of Arlington, Va. He also leaves four sisters, Francis Tavcar, Dorothy Tavcar, Marge Conetsco, and Pauline Debevec, all of Cleveland, and a brother, Thomas, of Birmingham, Ala.

To everyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, Alice personified the qualities of extraordinary dignity, elegance and grace. Throughout both her professional as well as her personal life, she exemplified the values of integrity and kindness. Ever faithful to Am Yisrael, Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael, her heart pulsed to the beat of Jerusalem, a city she deeply loved and cared for. Together with her husband Harold, a cherished member of our National Board, the Turobiner's leadership and outstretched hand of friendship benefited so many worthy institutions both in their own community as well as in Israel. The Medical Center had the good fortune to be the beneficiary of their largesse. We will fondly remember Alice's leadership as Vice President of our National Women's Division as well as the ''tight ship'' which she chaired at its Annual Luncheons. Her intelligence, wit and insight greatly benefited the hospital's international Board of Governors on which she served. Through their patronage of the Jesselson Heart Center and the Harry, Judith and Leonard Wilf Woman and Infant Center on ''Charlie's Floor'', the Turobiners have helped to place Shaare Zedek in the forefront of Israel's premier medical centers. Her legacy of charitable endeavors stands as testimony of her commitment to the highest values and ethics of traditional Judaism.

Since the club opened last June, the owners, David Rabin and Will Regan (of Rex club), along with Jeffrey Jah and Mark Baker (of Buddha Bar), have assiduously escorted various luminaries back to the kitchen, where Mr. Farnabe asks them to autograph a white tile wall with a permanent black Magic Marker. Mr. Farnabe got the idea when working at Daniel, where celebrity autographs are collected in a gold book. ''So, when we opened Lotus, I decided to invite celebrities to sign my wall,'' he said. ''I wanted to create a memory, for not just the crew and the restaurant staff, but for the kitchen itself.'' So far, the list includes Elle MacPherson, Mick Jagger, Serena Williams and Giorgio Armani. Mr. Farnabe says he can fit about a hundred more names on the wall, then he plans to preserve it with a large sheet of glass. Mr. Farnabe's own signature?

Salvation, at least in Tenafly, lies in a closet-sized shop next door to Clearview Cinemas. At Cactus Sushi and Fresh Juice, the interior is spotless, spare, inviting. My first time here, I ordered an eight-piece sushi box with a California and Tekka maki roll ($8.50), and braced myself. How good can fast-food sushi be? At Cactus, it's delicious. The food is fresh, the chef engaging, the wait, well, typical. Everything is made to order, as it should be, and you should build time into your foray if you plan to eat first (bistro tables await you on the sidewalk) and catch a movie. There are sushi rolls, veggie rolls, and dozen or so specialty rolls. Cactus also sells about 20 fresh-squeezed juices, fruit shakes and smoothies.

The housing is to be built as part of the longstanding federal desegregation order. Gudrun Lelash, the group's executive director, said Yonkers had violated the agreement it reached on May 25 with the county, which owns the park. Under the agreement, the city could use 4.25 acres of the 38-acre park for housing on the condition that the city dedicate another 25 acres to its park system within 60 days. But William M. Mooney, Yonkers corporation counsel, said the city had already dedicated 26 acres of parkland in 1998 that satisfy the terms of the agreement. ''The claims by F.C.W.C. are false.

But what is most shocking is the crowds of perpetrators and witnesses -- many of them children -- posing casually without masks or shame, even smiling, next to the victims. ''Between 1882 and 1968, an estimated 4,742 blacks met their deaths at the hands of lynch mobs,'' the historian Leon F. Litwack writes in WITHOUT SANCTUARY: Lynching Photography in America (Twin Palms, $60), a harrowing record of racism and savagery drawn from the Allen-Littlefield Collection at the Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory University. The photographs were taken between 1883 and 1960, and nearly all originally appeared on postcards, some with handwritten messages like, ''This is the barbecue we had last night,'' which was scrawled on the back of a card showing a burned torso dangling from a pole. Not blacks alone were killed: one postcard showing two Italian immigrants hanged in 1910 carries the inscription, ''Labor agitators lynched during the cigar makers' strike, Tampa Fla.'' Mob justice was carried out against men, women and entire families, in a kind of participatory public theater that featured picnicking, trophy collecting and ''excursion'' trains that brought in spectators. Litwack makes the troubling suggestion that the culprits and observers were not monstrous aberrations but more or less common people united in their fear and hatred of blacks and determined to protect their way of life against an outside threat. ''The photographs stretch our credulity, even numb our minds and senses to the full extent of the horror,'' Litwack writes, ''but they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and women could live with, participate in and defend such atrocities, even reinterpret them so they would not see themselves or be perceived as less than civilized.''

Central are two teenagers, Anthony Rubin and his moody next-door neighbor, Juliette Dimiglio. The novel starts as the families share a house at the Jersey Shore in 1979 against a background of a tide of syringes that closes the beach. But that is historical realism, after all. Still Gary Krist, reviewing the novel in The Times, says that Mr. Reiken ''captures the poetry of the New Jersey condition.'' Poetry and New Jersey, in the same sentence, without irony. Imagine that.

In her new novel, A PURE CLEAR LIGHT (Carroll & Graf, $22), St. John -- whose novel ''The Essence of the Thing'' was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1997 -- casts a wry yet unwary eye on faith and fidelity, two cornerstones of existence that are, her characters discover, as transient and conditional as they had suspected. Not long after Simon Beaufort, a television director who is married with three children, takes up with a single and sophisticated accountant named Gillian Selkirk, Simon's generous and frazzled wife, Flora, takes up with the Anglican Church. For each, a new flirtation injects some needed vitality and uncertainty into an unbalanced life. Simon's affair is grounded in the physical; Flora's in the intellectual and spiritual. His growing fear of being discovered with his lover runs in tandem with Flora's determination to uncover something meaningful from her once-lapsed faith. As the vicar at Flora's church preaches, living is not simple and exact, like arithmetic. It's more like algebra, ''with all its x's and y's and z's: with all its unknowns.'' Simon and Flora have sophisticated and funky friends, interesting children and the ability to articulate dissatisfaction and disaffectedness without sounding droll or whiny. St. John's knack for smart dialogue speeds this story effortlessly along. Maggie Galehouse",2000-09-03T05:00:00+0000

It might also be called the Seattle of Asia, since it is a rainy city. Thus there are underground pedestrian tunnels connecting stores to hotels, and office buildings to train stations. But tunnels don't have to be gloomy. In 1997, the Iwataya department store chain hired the Walker Group/CNI, an architectural firm in Manhattan, to design a new store in Fukuoka. The Iwataya Passage, connecting the store to a train station, was a bonus: a passageway suffused with light. ''We came up with a metaphor of bridges and evoking the character of water,'' said Jay Valgora, a designer at Walker Group/CNI. The 400-foot-long passage, 10 1/2 feet high and 16 feet wide, shimmers. The center part, top left, has glass panels coated with fine metal particles, which act like prisms. Panels are tilted at angles and suspended on stainless steel cables. ''The colors change, and the reflections of the people change,'' Mr. Valgora said. The ceiling, left, has glass pieces suspended from steel cables. As people walk through, they hear music, Haiku poetry whispered in three languages and the sounds of water. Motion detectors also trigger sounds. The tunnel's $1 million cost was shared by Iwataya and the city of Fukuoka. Mr. Valgora collaborated on the tunnel with two Manhattan design companies, FTL/Happold Architects and Engineers, and Art in Commerce, which did the music installation.",2000-09-07T05:00:00+0000

Vice President Al Gore, with his carefully crafted economic plan, has been careful to preserve the political capital inherited from Mr. Clinton's success in reducing the federal debt. To be sure, the hefty document Mr. Gore released on Tuesday is as much a campaign manifesto as it is an economic blueprint. Indeed, by combining his previously proposed spending and tax-cutting ideas in one package, he directed attention to the stark differences between his policies and those of Gov. George W. Bush. What emerges is an economic program that is cautious almost to a fault, yet determinedly progressive in its general thrust.

Sales rose 33 percent, to $640.8 million. Excluding one-time items, National had earnings of $149.4 million, or 76 cents a diluted share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 65 cents a share on the same basis. Its shares rose $2.13, to $47.13.

us,20 Feared Dead in Latest West Timor Attack," ATAMBUA, Indonesia -- U.N. officials said Friday they feared 20 villagers had been massacred by pro-Indonesian militias in West Timor, the day after rampaging mobs killed three foreign aid workers. In East Timor's capital, Dili, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Bernard Kerblat said militias were terrorizing local West Timorese people and refugees from neighboring East Timor. ``There are 120,000 individuals in a hostage-like situation'' because of the militias, he said. Thursday's attack happened in the village of Betun, about 30 miles south of Atambua _ where militias stormed the UNHCR office Wednesday, stabbing three workers to death. ``There are unconfirmed reports of 20 casualties. Civilian or refugees, we don't know,'' Kerblat said, adding that with U.N. staff evacuated from the area, confirmation was difficult. Indonesian military and police were not immediately available for comment. ``I think it is quite evident that Indonesian authorities are not in control in West Timor,'' said U.N. Peacekeeping spokesman Norwegian Col. Brynar Nymo. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, humiliated by the surging violence that coincided with his participation in the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York, has promised to crack down on militias. He claims the killings were orchestrated to derail his democratic reforms. The burned and ransacked U.N. compound in Atambua was under police guard Friday as the Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss security arrangements in the territory. About 250 foreign aid workers were evacuated to U.N.-administered East Timor after the attack. They had provided humanitarian assistance to an estimated 90,000 East Timorese refugees housed in West Timor camps. East Timor was wracked by violence last year following an independence referendum, as militias backed by the Indonesian army destroyed much of the territory. Militiamen dressed in Indonesian military jackets and brandishing machetes and daggers set up blockades Friday and extorted money and cigarettes from motorists on the road to Atambua. Residents said the gangs were searching for remaining foreigners. At the United Nations on Thursday, President Clinton and other world leaders called on Indonesia to disarm and disband the militias and to boost security in the region. Wahid said the international community must help remove the militia gangs, and that he wants assistance resettling the ``criminal elements'' from West Timor to other parts of the nation. ``The international community demands we do this or that, but they don't give us the necessary tools to do so,'' said Wahid, a guest speaker at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs on Thursday. Human rights groups say the militias are backed by hard-line elements of Indonesia's army, and that they use refugee camps in West Timor as bases for cross-border raids. U.N. officials warned Thursday that with the suspension of aid operations, refugees who live in the squalid camps face potentially disastrous shortages of food and medicines. Armed forces commander Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto said an extra battalion of troops had been dispatched to the region to protect the refugees. The government sent 600 soldiers and 100 policemen to the region Wednesday. ",2000-09-08T05:00:00+0000

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) agency in the East Timor capital, Dili, said the latest clashes occurred at the refugee camp of Betun, which had been taken over by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias the previous night. ``The 20 casualties reported have been killed...we have no information so far about the wounded. We don't know whether they are Indonesian citizens or East Timorese,"" UNHCR operations manager for East Timor Bernard Kerblat told reporters. Betun is a stronghold for the militias which razed East Timor after it voted in August, 1999, to end Indonesia's military rule and who fear returning to their homeland, now under U.N. rule. The camp is just south of the West Timor border town of Atambua, where militias butchered three foreign UNHCR workers on Wednesday and mutilated their bodies. FUNERAL MAY HAVE BEEN TRIGGER About 1,000 people attended the funeral in Betun of a militia leader whose murder earlier this week is believed to have triggered Wednesday's violence. ``The funeral was quite tense because the mob, mostly in trucks and motorcycles, roamed the town first, forcing shops to close and residents to stay inside,"" an army intelligence officer said in Atambua. But he denied there had been any clashes. Kerblat said no aid workers were among the latest victims but gave no further information. The United Nations pulled more than 240 workers and dependents out of West Timor after Wednesday's slayings. Indonesia's cabinet spent most of the day on the issue but came up with nothing new to appease international anger over the militias and the murders. ``Indonesia will take wise, fair and realistic steps to seek a permanent solution,"" top security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said afterwards, adding investigations were continuing. President Abdurrahman Wahid did not attend the meeting. He is in New York for a special U.N. summit, where he faced angry world leaders over Wednesday's murders in Atambua. The killings overshadowed the start of the U.N. summit in New York, where a minute's silence was held for the three men from the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Croatia and Ethiopia. At least six West Timorese residents also died in Wednesday's bloodshed and scores of houses were torched. REFUGEES ON THEIR OWN Atambua, about 2,000 km (1,200) miles east of Jakarta, was tense and deserted on Friday with almost no traffic and most residents shut up in their houses, fearing further trouble. The handful of people on the streets were too afraid to speak to visiting journalists, who were also turned away by hotels afraid their presence would bring trouble from the militias. The U.N. withdrawal leaves more than 120,000 East Timorese living in refugee camps in West Timor without any outside help. They were among more than 300,000 people the militias forced across the border from their homes in East Timor in a rampage that followed the territory's independence vote. Indonesian newspapers on Friday condemned the brutality as a national disgrace. The Jakarta Post demanded the military disband the militias it created in a failed bid to swing last year's East Timor vote. ``The Indonesian military, being the chief sponsor of the militias must be made to rein in its proxy soldiers, disarm them and arrest their leaders who have perpetrated the campaign of terror,"" it said in an editorial. And it urged the government to bring the army officers and militias behind last year's bloodshed to trial. ``Surely the government must now realise the shame and disgrace which the Atambua killings have brought on the entire nation is simply too high a price to pay to shield the dozens of murderous generals, colonels, lieutenants and militia leaders from having to appear in court,"" it said. U.S. President Bill Clinton, in New York for the U.N. summit, raised the killings at a Security Council debate on peacekeeping. ``I ask the Indonesian authorities to bring those responsible to justice, to disarm and disband the militias and to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of those continuing to work on humanitarian goals there,"" Clinton said. Authorities have arrested 15 people over Wednesday's murders. Provincial military chief Colonel Jurefar told Reuters a company of reinforcements -- about 90 men -- had arrived in West Timor and the rest of the battalion was due later on Friday. ``They will establish order there with the police,"" he said. ``They will confiscate weapons.""

But America didn't really enjoy that movie: the taste for irony had faded. So Phil looked farther afield: he made ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' a Czech film done in France; he did ''Henry and June,'' about Americans in Paris and that stranger country called Sex. Again, America managed not to be impressed. But now, I think, he's got it: he has an Australian playing the Marquis de Sade in a picture made in England.

us,Books In Brief: Nonfiction; At Play in the Cemetery,"Abandoned cemeteries, mossy tombstones, weary gravediggers leaning on their shovels: anyone familiar with the work of Eudora Welty will not find the subject matter of her latest book particularly unusual. What may come as a surprise is that the content is not prose but photography. COUNTRY CHURCHYARDS (University Press of Mississippi, $35) is a slim book of nearly 100 black-and-white photographs of Mississippi cemeteries. Welty took the pictures more than 50 years ago, long before she became known for her novels and short stories, many of which included just the kinds of settings depicted here. Several of the pictures are accompanied by quotations from Welty's writings. A line from her novel ''Losing Battles'' was apparently inspired by a bleak graveyard near Natchez: ''An army of tablets, some black as slate, marked half a hill-load of husbands and wives buried close together.'' Welty's interest in graveyards predates her passion for both photography and fiction. As a child, she played in the Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Miss., where she grew up. ''For me cemeteries had a sinister appeal somehow,'' Welty told Hunter Cole in an interview that serves as a preface to the book. But eventually she started taking aesthetic note of the marble effigies and solemn stone angels that inhabited the graveyards of the old country churches surrounding Jackson. All of it appealed to what Elizabeth Spencer, who wrote the introduction to the book, calls Welty's ''sense of reverence for life's mysteries, death being one of those.''

us,Books In Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Unlight Verse,"''We know where love is by its stillness,'' Fanny Howe writes in one of the spare, muscled poems gathered in SELECTED POEMS (University of California, cloth, $40; paper, $15.95), work culled from 20 years of her poetry. Indeed, it's stillness more than anything else that tempers this volume; its quiet, forceful poems carry an existential weight that belies their small size. Among other things, Howe has made a long-term project of trying to determine how we fit into God's world, and her aim is both true and marvelously free of sentimental piety. ''Mad God, mad thought / Take me for a walk,'' she writes, ''Stalk me. Made God, / Wake me with your words. / Believe in what I said.'' Her work is fueled by a persistent need to find out not the meaning of life itself, but how to ask what it is. ''A feeling triggers a feeling, then the heft / Of the hand to work,'' Howe states in a typically Dickinsonian moment. It's as if she can't help herself -- these fierce poems demand to be put forth. Taken together, they create a world of their own, a series of structures that dot the landscape Howe travels. ''My vagabondage / is unlonelied by poems'' she confesses at one point, as if to justify her questioning. She's on a private quest through the metaphysical universe, and the results are startling and honest. ''If goals create content stealth creates form,'' she writes. Her ''Selected Poems'' proves she's absolutely correct. Melanie Rehak",2000-09-10T05:00:00+0000

The premiere issue, produced by the Paris-based publisher Assouline, will be mailed to 300,000 of the store's customers on Sept. 12; copies are also sold at Rizzoli bookstores for $10. Sephora's Sephora.Com, based on the content of its online magazine, showcases products sold at the store, but also offers standard magazine service features from beauty tips to horoscopes. It will be available Sept. 15 at Sephora stores. The Bergdorf magazine's mission, according to its ''Welcome'' page, is ''to provide more useful information'' and ''stimulate dialogue.''

To everyone who had the good fortune of knowing her, Alice personified the qualities of extraordinary dignity, elegance and grace. Throughout both her professional as well as her personal life, she exemplified the values of integrity and kindness. Ever faithful to Am Yisrael, Torat Yisrael and Eretz Yisrael, her heart pulsed to the beat of Jerusalem, a city she deeply loved and cared for. Together with her husband Harold, a cherished member of our National Board, the Turobiner's leadership and outstretched hand of friendship benefited so many worthy institutions both in their own community as well as in Israel. The Medical Center had the good fortune to be the beneficiary of their largesse. We will fondly remember Alice's leadership as Vice President of our National Women's Division as well as the ''tight ship'' which she chaired at its Annual Luncheons. Her intelligence, wit and insight greatly benefited the hospital's international Board of Governors on which she served. Through their patronage of the Jesselson Heart Center and the Harry, Judith and Leonard Wilf Woman and Infant Center on ''Charlie's Floor'', the Turobiners have helped to place Shaare Zedek in the forefront of Israel's premier medical centers. Her legacy of charitable endeavors stands as testimony of her commitment to the highest values and ethics of traditional Judaism. Our sincerest condolences to Harold, daughters Carol Finley and Ann Dachs, and the entire family. May they be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer.

Our present civilization has little appetite for tragedy, but a wispy shadow of Frye's theory persists, as the coming of autumn sends children back to school and putatively serious movies back into the multiplexes. As the days grow shorter, the running times grow longer. Special effects give way to feats of costume and set design. The box office sprints of the Memorial and Independence Day weekends, and the damaged-goods studio yard sales of late August, are soon forgotten as the long march toward Christmas -- and the Oscars -- begins.

But probably not. While it is an engineering marvel, one bringing to fruition nearly 100 years of dreaming and planning and politicking, aesthetically speaking at least, the new span is not the stuff of verse. It is too long (10 miles) and too much of it -- nearly the first 4 miles heading east out of Copenhagen -- is under water. When it does surface from its tunnel, most of what's visible is an elevated causeway. Its middle section looks like a bridge, but its simple concrete towers, the tallest in Sweden, and the cables strung from them, are more elegant than mighty. And since the raised span is so far from shore, for all its size it seems small and slight, a few strokes from a finely pointed pen.

The owner of the L.A.-based Estate Funding Inc. gets about a third of her revenues, some $10 million last year, from entertainment clients. ''When the entertainment guys are insecure about their future, they don't buy houses,'' she says. What's making them insecure -- and what has pushed Hollywood studios to accelerate film production lately -- is the strike that began on May 1 by commercial actors in the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The actors are protesting advertisers' plans to replace their pay-per-play royalties with a flat quarterly fee, which they say neither rewards them for a successful commercial nor compensates them for any typecasting aftereffects. SAG also says that the new plan would cut actors' pay an average of 5 percent, thereby reducing the number of actors eligible for health care coverage. The advertisers counter that the union's bottom half, earnings-wise, would actually make 30 percent more. They claim the current payment system is outdated because the proliferation of cable channels now requires that commercials air more frequently to reach as many viewers as before.",2000-09-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TAVCAR, LAWRENCE R.","TAVCAR-Lawrence R., 64. A longtime senior public relations executive who was an expert in preparing corporate annual reports, died on August 24 at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital, near his home in Stamford. He managed or was involved in the production of 80 annual reports, sometimes drafting the messages of chief executive officers. Mr. Tavcar was a consultant working from an office in his home since 1990. As a consultant and, earlier, as an account executive, he served such clients as AT&T, Automatic Data Processing, Coca-Cola Bottling, Engelhard, Firestone, H.J. Heinz, McGrawHill, Reader's Digest, Scott Paper, C.I.T. Financial Corporation, and Unilever. In the late 1980's, he was senior director for corporate communications for Paramount Communications, formerly Gulf+Western. From 1978 to 1984, he was a senior vice president of the Carl Byoir & Associates, then the third largest public relations firm in the country. An annual report that he prepared as a consultant to Engelhard received an award from the National Association of Investors Corporation as one of the best from an investor's perspective. ''A masterful job,'' said the judges. Another citation for his work on annual reports, hailed his performance with the comment: ''Of all the talents in the field, none do we respect more than Lawrence R. Tavcar...Not only does he produce good work...but he's one of the industry's true thinkers.''At Paramount, his last corporate position before becoming a consultant, Mr. Tavcar produced six annual reports and was responsible for analyst and annual meeting presentations. The company's reports received awards from ''Institutional Investor'' magazine. He also directed the creation and publication of ONE, the company's quarterly magazine. ''Using spectacular graphics and sheer showmanship,'' the ''Public Relations Handbook'' said, the magazine ''achieves a dazzling impact...as attractive in content as in style.'' He played an instrumental communications role during the company's restructuring from a quintessential conglomerate with farranging operations into an international leader in entertainment (Paramount Pictures) and publishing (Simon & Schuster). Paramount was acquired by Viacom in 1994. As an account executive at Carl Byoir, Mr. Tavcar handled the public relations involved in the recall of the Firestone 500 tire, then the largest product recall in history, an incident that has reverberations in another Firestone recall that is taking place today. Also, early in his career, he conducted some of the research that demonstrated the increasing importance of institutional investors. Thus, when the New York Stock Exchange established its Institutional Investors Department, he was appointed assistant manager. In addition to his specialization in annual reports, Mr. Tavcar during his career managed projects involving corporate magazines, employee information programs, speech writing, and marketing. He won more than 20 awards from professional associations for his work. Mr. Tavcar frequently retained responsibility for the writing end of public relations projects, an activiity often delegated to writing specialists. His writing extended over a broad array of business products, testament to his undergraduate education in journalism and his lifelong appreciation of stellar articles that appeared in newspapers and magazines. Mr. Tavcar was a member of the Public Relations Society of America and served on its honors and awards committee for four years. He also was a member of the National Investor Relations Institute, the International Association of Business Communicators, the Society of Professional Journalists, and the Fairfield County (Conn.) Public Relations Association. He was a former contributing editor of the Corporate Communications Report and the Corporate Annual Report Newsletter and a contributor to many newsletters in the public relations and communications fields. Mr. Tavcar, who was born and raised in Cleveland, maintained a devotion to the Cleveland Browns football team and the Cleveland Indians baseball team through a lifetime spent mostly in the Northeast. He was a graduate of Ohio Universtiy and retained a lifelong loyalty to his alma mater. He served on the board of directors of its national alumni association, as a member of the advisory board to the university's E.W. Scripps School of Journalism, and as president of Ohio University's Greater New York Alumni Chapter. He received two service awards from the university. Mr. Tavcar leaves his wife, Denise, and two sons, Bret of Stamford, and Erik of Arlington, Va. He also leaves four sisters, Francis Tavcar, Dorothy Tavcar, Marge Conetsco, and Pauline Debevec, all of Cleveland, and a brother, Thomas, of Birmingham, Ala. A ceremony celebrating Lawrence Tavcar's life will be held at 6 P.M. on September 23 at the Bruce Museum, 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich. Directions are available from the museum at 203-869-0376. Contributions in memory of Lawrence R. Tavcar may be made to CAP Cure (for the cure of prostate cancer) at 1250 Fourth Street, Suite 360, Santa Monica, CA 90401.

Leslie and her then husband, Norman, adopted two more ''special needs'' children, a girl named Christin and her brother, Casey, who had been taken away from abusive parents when they were toddlers.

He's Bob Trupia, who left the force a couple of years ago and brought his Flatbush dreams and family from Brooklyn to the Jersey Shore. Trupia's is a pizzeria in front and a trim Italian restaurant in the back. Mr. Trupia's pizza has Brooklyn flair. There are 20 varieties, from the tried and true (the menu calls them ''New York style'') to the unexpected, like bacon, chicken parmigiana and steak. It is prepared with imported Italian tomatoes and with mozzarella made in the kitchen, and comes by the slice ($1.25 to $1.45) or pie $4.50 for a ''personal'' size to $15 for some Sicilian pies) or stromboli ($4 or $4.50). Where Mr. Trupia truly gives reign to his culinary imagination is in his ''gourmet'' pizzas. One standout is pizza alla vodka, made with mozzarella and vodka cream sauce. He has also immortalized his family in crust by naming pizzas after them. One of them, named for his daughter, is Danielle's Delight, fresh tomatoes, bacon and pepperoni slathered with mozzarella. Sometimes policemen who come in to eat will spot Mr. Tropia's N.Y.P.D. retirement plaque on the wall and introduce themselves. Mr. Trupia will come out and shake their hands.

Since the 1948 UJA study mission to Palestine, she always felt a deep sense of commitment to the State of Israel, and devoted much of her life on its behalf. Her love of the Jewish people was the source of her tireless efforts to raise funds for Israel and the Central Jersey Jewish Federation. As a lifelong supporter of UJA (the predecessor organization to UJC), Mrs. Brailove helped found the National Women's Constituency, and went on to become its president. Later, she became the chair of the Jewish Federation of Central New Jersey's Women's Division and was responsible for launching the federation's Lion of Judah program.

Mr. Sellon was the Senior Underwriting Officer of American Re until his retirement in 1972. Born May 20, 1910 in London, England, Mr. Sellon arrived in the United States with his family in 1918 and established residence in Rye, New York. He graduated from Rye Country Day and the Choate School in Wallingford, CT. He attended Princeton University for one year, but left to pursue his professional career during the Great Depression. Starting at American Re in 1931, he rose through the underwriting ranks until he became the Senior Underwriting Officer in the 1950's. He remained active in the insurance industry after his retirement, cofounding Sellon Associates, a reinsurance brokerage in 1973 with his son, Peter. Sellon Associates co-founded MISC (the municipal bond insurance service company), which is one of the predecessor entities of MBIA, Inc., the municipal bond insurance firm headquartered in Armonk, NY. Mr. Sellon remained active and involved in the re-insurance industry through his association with Sellon Associates and MBIA well into his 80's. Mr. Sellon was a benefactor to many charitable insititutions, in particular the Theosophical Society of America, which is headquartered in Wheaton, Illinois and especially the Society's Lodge in New York City. He was instrumental in the founding and development of the Theosophical Society's retreat in the Berkshires of upstate New York. Mr. Sellon made numerous international trips to theosophical gatherings in the company of his wife, the former Emily B. Sellon. Mrs. Sellon, who was a noted lecturer on Theosophy, passed away in 1993. In addition to his three sons, Peter, Michael and Jeffrey, Mr. Sellon is survived by nine grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren. A memorial service for Mr. Sellon will be planned at a later date. Donations in lieu of flowers can be made to The New York Theosophical Society, 240 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022, in Mr. Sellon's memory.",2000-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Relatives of Patrick Dorismond blamed the city, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and the officers for violating Dorismond's civil rights during a drug buy-and-bust on March 16. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, described the officials' actions as illegal, malicious, callous and negligent. Dorismond, a 26-year-old security guard, became the fourth unarmed black man shot to death by police in little more than a year when he was killed during a struggle with an undercover detective outside a bar. Attorney Johnnie Cochran said the shooting was an example of racial profiling and blamed Giuliani for releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile records to ``dirty up his character and reputation.'' ``We're going to take him to task for demonizing a person who was an altar boy,'' Cochran said. The mayor at one point suggested that Dorismond had caused his own death and refused to offer the family condolences. Giuliani has since acknowledged he made a mistake by not expressing appropriate sympathies. Lorna Goodman, a lawyer for the city, had not seen the lawsuit and had no comment Wednesday. The police department also declined to comment. Marie Rose Dorismond, the victim's mother, said she was pleased that the civil lawsuit had been filed. ``I guess it's time for the justice to start,'' she said. ",2000-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Mr. McCaw led a group that brought the company out of bankruptcy for $1.2 billion and forged plans for a satellite system capable of offering a range of data and Internet services in addition to the voice traffic ICO Global had envisioned.

But you will search in vain for Dostoyevskian themes, or indeed any themes at all. The Russian writer whose influence is most in evidence may be Chekhov, and then only because his oft-cited remark that a gun on the mantelpiece in the first act of a play must be fired in the third act is given an indie-film paraphrase: the electric carving knife used by Mom to slice up the roast in an early scene will be used to slice up Daddy later on.",2000-09-15T05:00:00+0000

For a while in the 1920's the modernist adventure was still going full throttle. Although many artists in Europe and the United States pulled back toward stylistic reason and classicism immediately after the chaos of World War I, avant-garde experiments like Dada, Suprematism, abstraction and Surrealism continued to strike sparks in much of Europe and the U.S.S.R. in the 1920's and even in the 1930's where dictators did not forbid them or social causes overshadow them. Mexico was a special case. Early 20th-century art movements had a negligible influence there before the 1920's. Just when they began to have an effect, the Mexican muralist movement spread across the country's walls and by its artistic power, nationalistic appeal and its very size and visibility, marginalized the modernist currents pulsing through the country.",2000-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Character Building,"Though the cover-up of a deadly crime propels the plot of DIAMOND DOGS (Little, Brown, $23.95), Alan Watt's dark, sparklingly written first novel, an emotionally fraught father-son relationship gives the book its depth. In his hometown, Carmen, a dingy Las Vegas suburb, Neil Garvin is a star high school quarterback -- and a notorious bully. Driving while drunk one night after a party, Neil accidentally hits and kills a lone pedestrian, who turns out to be a shy classmate Neil had roughed up and humiliated earlier that evening. After Neil hides the body, the story transforms into something far more complex than how a criminal covers his tracks. The local sheriff is none other than Neil's father -- a man who appears to be respectable, but at home terrorizes Neil with threats and violence, and whom Neil blames for chasing off his mother years earlier. Yet when this law enforcer discovers Neil's predicament, he coolly and methodically conceals the crime -- thus unhappily bonding Neil to him even further. Watt, a former stand-up comic, injects Neil's numb, guilt-ridden voice with a subtle, deadpan humor and slyly evokes telling details -- Diamond Dogs,'' for example, describes rabid Neil Diamond fans like Neil's father, disappointed middle-aged men who live for ''the greatest lounge act on earth.'' Despite some minor flaws in the pacing (the resolution involving Neil's mother feels slightly forced), Watt delivers a moving, multifaceted story that sharply explores the legacy of violence, distorted forms of love and the high cost of genuine freedom.

Yes, the diner is nestled near the river, but the truth is, most of its win- dows face north and south and offer just a glimpse of the skyscape, not the panorama the name suggests. The real reason to stop at the River View has to do with something else proclaimed on its sign ''baking on premises.'' Six days a week, John Tsilikas arrives at 6 a.m. and spends five hours in the basement whipping up eye-popping pies and cakes. His repertory includes strawberry pie, Boston cream pie, cheesecake, blueberry cake and the favorite of the owner, Tammis Mavronasios Black Forest cake. Mr. Tsilikass smooth cheesecakes and rich chocolate tortes match up well against anything a Hoboken patisserie can offer. The River View does not display the desserts in the standard rotating case, which Mr. Mavronasios says, tend to dry out the sweet concoc- tions. At the River View, Mr. Tsilikass works of art are shown off in a climate-controlled trophy case at the center of the restaurant. Oops, dont call the River View ''a restaurant'' or a Greek Diner. Its an American diner, says Mr. Mavronasios, who is proud of the 157-year history of diners in America. Stop in at the River View on a Sunday or Monday, and a prime rib dinner, complete with soup or salad and vegetables, is $12.50. You can top it off with a slice of pie ($2.10), a piece of cake ($2.25) or a slab of cheesecake ($3.25), or buy a whole pie ($15) or cake ($20) to take home.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Relentless Printmaker,"Walter Sickert, Britain's foremost Impressionist painter, was also its foremost printmaker. In 1915 he wrote: ''Now there are two things in etching. There is the value of an etching as a drawing, and there is its value as revelation of a sense of the medium.'' As demonstrated in WALTER SICKERT: Prints. A Catalogue Raisonne (Yale University, $120), by Ruth Bromberg, Sickert's particular talent was to unite both elements of etching, endowing prints with an astonishing depth of expression. The book documents the whole of Sickert's printmaking career, starting with his tutelage under Whistler through the development of his own style, influenced by Degas. Throughout, Sickert (1860-1942) experimented with new techniques and subject matter. Beginning with his early sketches of London theater life, he explored architecture and cityscapes as well as intimate domestic scenes. But while Sickert was intent on exploiting the possibilities of the medium in every etching, he was not concerned with aesthetics only; his subject matter was often a vehicle for satire or social commentary. Bromberg highlights the seminal prints in Sickert's body of work and provides salient details of his biography to explain shifts in theme or technique as they occurred. As a scholarly work, however, the emphasis is on detail rather than overview. Some prints are reproduced in as many as 16 different states, testifying to Sickert's relentless curiosity as well as his prolificacy. With characteristic British understatement, he once said of himself, ''I have always known that I was, potentially, the only living etcher, but I was quite prepared never to have the energy to prove it.''

The results echo the Paris fashion world's deconstruction of classic clothing that was set in motion 12 years ago. There is also a nod to the art world's abstract approach. For most wearers, the neck is the anchor, through the traditional hole for the head, while one or both sleeves are left dangling in the front, the back or the side. When only one sleeve is used, it pulls the sweatshirt into a draped angle. For others, the neck hole becomes a porthole on the wearer's back. The style is achieved by the wearer's imagination and has much to do with beating the heat. This fad is generations apart from wearing a sweater over the shoulders or tied around the waist.

Juniper has made its name by developing routers for the core of Internet networks that can handle flows of up to 10 billion digital bits a second. Cisco's fastest commercially available routers can handle flows of only 2.5 billion bits a second. Still, Cisco has remained the dominant provider of Internet switches that connect to paying customers rather than only to other big switches at a network's heart.

The blast was the deadliest of 40 bombings that have rocked Pakistani cities this year, and the government has blamed archrival India for many of the previous attacks. Pakistan's military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf condemned Tuesday's ``dastardly act of terrorism,'' but did not place blame. The explosion, the first in Islamabad this year, occurred while workers were unloading the crates from a truck, witnesses said. The blast triggered a stampede of workers and shoppers from the city's largest fruit and vegetable market. ``I heard the explosion and saw fruit flying in the air,'' said Hasan Khan, a shop owner who was just 20 yards from the blast. ``People started running and screaming. We pulled down the shutters on our shop and left.'' No group immediately claimed responsibility, and police were investigating. The truck arrived from Kurram Agency in Pakistan's northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan, police and witnesses said. The vegetable market is located on the city's outskirts in a relatively poor neighborhood. Many of the victims were Afghan refugees who work unloading trucks. Pakistan has been plagued by political violence, including periodic bomb blasts, for years. However, since Musharraf seized power last October, ousting an elected civilian government, overall political unrest has declined. And Islamabad has traditionally been calm even when other Pakistani cities were aflame. ",2000-09-19T05:00:00+0000

us,"Dominant U.S. Men Win Again, but Lose Fans"," SYDNEY Australia, Sept. 19 - Bill Gates paid the United States men's basketball team a visit in their locker room tonight, moments after another nettlesome competitor tried to toy with their global monopoly. The world's richest man did not commiserate with the American multi-millionaires over high tax brackets or being trapped in a Melbourne hotel by protesters of the World Economic Forum last week. But with all these uppity foreign opponents grabbing at their jerseys and making them come across as bullies when the superior Americans respond, the kinship is natural. ``These guys don't even ask for autographs anymore,'' Gary Payton lamented after Italy begrudgingly went down, 93-61. World domination is clearly beginning to wear on the United States men, who won the game but hardly won over the crowd of 8,368 at the Dome in Olympic Park. Yes, Vince Carter threw down a tremendous, alley-oop dunk in the first half that had the building in a state of disbelief. And with 22 points off the fastbreak, they entertained everyone. But the masses jeered in the second half when Carter and the feisty Italian guard Allesandro Abbio grabbed and held each other until Carter planted a forearm in his throat and knocked him down. Miffed at Italy's defiance or not, coach Rudy Tomjanovich of the United States quickly sicced a full-court press on the Italians with less than 9 minutes left. The score at the time: 78-46. Team USA apparently feels it does not merely have to win; it must win so convincingly that not a single soul comes away with the notion that America was ever in trouble. ``There are good international players,'' Tomjanovich began matter-of-factly, ``but the other countries don't have 12 of them on the same team.'' There is an ornery resilience creeping into international play, though. You can see it with each game. Whether they have been watching Heat-Knicks playoff contests on tape is unclear, but somewhere Italy and the other nations are beginning to learn the art of the well-placed elbow in the small of the back. From the opening tip, when Italy's best player, Gregor Fucka, caught Alonzo Mourning with a open hand to the face, the Italians showed none of the great respect afforded other international teams comprised of N.B.A. players. Payton, Carter and Kevin Garnett took the physical challenge to heart, going at their opponents hard. It was not uncommon to see the 7-foot Garnett bodying up his man near halfcourt, trying any tactic to take away the ball. The Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star afterward bristled at one reporter's suggestion that the Americans should begin sending college players again to make it fair. ``It's like fighting,'' Garnett said. ``I get my five, you get your five from the neighborhood. I'm going to try and find the grimiest, dirtiest cats I can.'' And whether it plays or not back home, that is how the gold-medal pursuit is apparently going to go. With three preliminary games left, the U.S. men moved to 2-0 in Group A. Carter had 13 points, Mourning added 12 points and six blocked shots and Jason Kidd contributed 7 assists. In the first half, Carter rose for an alley-oop pass from Garnett on the left side of the rim. The ball was out of his grasp, so he waited for it to come off the backboard before slamming it through for the cameras. Even Abbio was impressed, despite the forearm in the throat. ``A wonderful personality,'' he said through a translator. ``He is a special player.'' ",2000-09-19T05:00:00+0000

The world's richest man did not commiserate with the American multi-millionaires over high tax brackets. But with all these uppity foreign opponents grabbing at their jerseys and making them come across as bullies when the superior Americans respond, the kinship is natural. ``These guys don't even ask for autographs anymore,'' Gary Payton lamented after Italy begrudgingly went down, 93-61. World domination is clearly beginning to wear on the United States men, who won the game but hardly failed to win over the crowd of 8,368 at the Dome in Olympic Park. Yes, Vince Carter threw down a tremendous, alley-oop dunk in the first half that had the building in a state of disbelief. And with 22 points off the fastbreak, they entertained everyone. But the masses jeered in the second half when Carter and the feisty Italian guard Allesandro Abbio grabbed and held each other until Carter planted a forearm in his throat and knocked him down. Miffed at Italy's defiance or not, coach Rudy Tomjanovich of the United States quickly sicced a full-court press on the Italians with less than 9 minutes left. The score at the time: 78-46. Team USA apparently feels it does not merely have to win; it must win so convincingly that not a single soul comes away with the notion that America was ever in trouble. ``There are good international players,'' Tomjanovich began matter-of-factly, ``but the other countries don't have 12 of them on the same team.'' There is an ornery resilience creeping into international play, though. You can see it with each game. Whether they have been watching Heat-Knicks playoff contests on tape is unclear, but somewhere Italy and the other nations are beginning to learn the art of the well-placed elbow in the small of the back. From the opening tip, when Italy's best player, Gregor Fucka, caught Alonzo Mourning with a open hand to the face, the Italians showed none of the great respect afforded other international teams comprised of N.B.A. players. Payton, Carter and Kevin Garnett took the physical challenge to heart, going at their opponents hard. It was not uncommon to see the 7-foot Garnett bodying up his man near halfcourt, trying any tactic to take away the ball. The Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star afterward bristled at one reporter's suggestion that the Americans should begin sending college players again to make it fair. ``It's like fighting,'' Garnett said. ``I get my five, you get your five from the neighborhood. I'm going to try and find the grimiest, dirtiest cats I can.'' And whether it plays or not back home, that is how the gold-medal pursuit is apparently going to go. With three preliminary games left, the U.S. men moved to 2-0 in Group A. Carter had 13 points, Mourning added 12 points and six blocked shots and Jason Kidd contributed 7 assists. In the first half, Carter rose for an alley-oop pass from Garnett on the left side of the rim. The ball was out of his grasp, so he waited for it to come off the backboard before slamming it through for the cameras. Even Abbio was impressed, despite the forearm in the throat. ``A wonderful personality,'' he said through a translator. ``He is a special player.'' Proof that the only incredible news the Americans can make is to somehow lose, the crowd cheered wildly for Italy as they held on for the most of the first half. The Italians came within 35-33 with less than 3 minutes remaining when Allan Houston, making his Olympic debut after jamming his right wrist and missing the first game, connected on two 3-pointers before the half ended.

us,Korean Is Fencing Champion by Razor-Thin Margin," SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 20 -- Cliff Bayer will long remember the last touch of Young-Ho Kim's sword to his stomach today, the one that crushed his chance of advancing to fencing glory. Bayer came to the Summer Olympics trying to ignore the hopes of his team and his federation that come with winning two World Cup titles in the last year and of being the 12th-ranked foilist in the world. He wanted to prove that an American fencer was the equal of his foreign competition and that he was better than the anxious 19-year-old who lost his first bout at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Bayer had never faced Kim before but was wary of the resilience he had seen when Kim came back from an eight point deficit to win a world championship match. ``He was the one guy I really didn't want to face,'' Bayer said. ``When I saw him in my bracket, I was nervous. He's smart, really smart.'' In their match today, the second for each man, Bayer was cruising, up 11-7, 13-10, then 14-13. But Kim knotted the bout, then ducked under an attack by Bayer and countered with the final touch. ``I'll be seeing that for a long time,'' said Bayer, who works out of the New York Athletic Club and is on a sabbatical from attending the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. ``I just missed. It's a heartbreaker.'' Kim, 29, inflicted heartache on three more opponents to win a gold medal, staging riveting, methodical comebacks against Dmitri Chevtchenko in the semifinal and Ralf Bissdorf of Germany in the final. Three of Kim's victories came by 15-14 scores. ``I didn't want it that way,'' Kim said through an interpreter. ``I want to win from the beginning.'' In fencing, the first to 15 points wins; if no one hits 15, the most touches after three three-minute rounds wins. Athletes are frequently better at executing a strategy rather than explaining it. Throughout his bout with Bissdorf, Kim stalled frequently, doing nothing, avoiding contact while pointing his foil at Bissdorf across the strip, measuring, or maybe, lulling the German. The ploy seemed to give each man a respite, but Kim could only describe it as a defense against a Bissdorf attack. Later, he said his ability to come back against Bayer, Chevtchenko and Bissdorf was by means of a ``a skill, where I have to stretch my arm if I'm not as tall as he is. I practiced it for three months. It's an attack. . .a stretch.'' Kim is 5-foot-11, Bissdorf stands 6-2. Whatever it was, it worked, and Bissdorf understood. ``He likes to attack and he attacks very well. I do, too,'' he said. ``But we didn't attack each other as much because our defenses were so good. Today we had a real good fight. At 14-14, my strategy was not enough. His was excellent.'' Kim may have succeeded because he adapted his style to suit his foe. Against Chevtchenko, he was a Joe Frazier-like plodder, a tough guy repelling the 6-foot-4-inch Russian's trademark running charge, like an irate bull, down the strip. Their bout had all the wondrous excitement of a late-in-the National Basketball Association game Hack-a-Shaq strategy. Against the lean Bissdorf, he seemed to mimick the German's style, as they stretched their scoring into early in the third period. Bissdorf seemed to be in command at 9-6, but Kim rallied with five unanswered touches and stretched the lead to 13-10, before Bissdorf tied Kim at 14. When Kim won the decisive point, his coach rushed onto the stage at the Sydney Exhibition Center and tackled him, while Bissdorf stood to the side, waiting to congratulate him. ``I didn't know if I was dreaming,'' Kim said. ``I didn't know if it was reality. I thought about my wife, my mother, my son. History was being made. This is the first gold for Korea in the men's individual foil.'' Kim, whose wife fenced until giving birth to their son, had one request to make of the Korean Fencing Association, now that he has a little leverage. Fencing is not widely popular in Korea, and Kim rarely had enough good partners to work with. He's had to travel around Korea from his home in Taejun to stay sharp. In victory, he said, ``I ask for more opponents.'' ",2000-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,U.S. Women Hoops Team Survives a Scare," SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 20 -- Ruthie Bolton-Holyfield had just rushed two shots, long 3-point heaves that careened badly off the rim. Lacking rhythm and patience, she ran downcourt to witness something even more unsightly. Elena Pchkova, the Russian forward, beating most of Team USA downcourt, hitting a little runner from the left side, clutching her fist at the enormous possibility in front of her. The United States women trailed by seven points, their dominance threatened by the same nation that dealt them their last Olympic loss eight years ago. ``I don't if I would used the word 'scared,''' began Nikki McCray, the starting shooting guard, ``but we had to show our character at some point, or we were headed for real danger.'' It began with a McCray steal and 3-pointer with 17 minutes left, a shot that erased the first Olympic halftime deficit the women had known since 1992 in Barcelona. Their resolve kicked in again with less than 12 minutes remaining, when Bolton-Holyfield caught fire from the perimeter, knocking down two three-pointers and another jumper within two minutes of each other, baskets that helped turn a 1-point lead into a 10-point bulge. And their show of character ended with menacing defense, pressure that wore the Russian Federation down and gave the United States women a 88-77 victory, won on much more grit than skill before 8,383 at the Dome in Olympic Park. Asked if she saw the game as either a crack in the United States facade or show of perseverance after her team moved to 3-0 in preliminary play, the UNited States coach, Nell Fortner, replied, ``We were resilient. We came together when we had to against some very tough opposition.'' Lisa Leslie overcame early foul trouble to score 14 of her team-high 18 points in the second half, driving harder to her right than George W. Bush. Yolando Griffith and Sheryl Swoopes each added 16 points and Bolton-Holyfield contributed 12 clutch points off the bench. Russia was never out of the game, but the closest it came after the spurt was 68-63 with less than 8 minutes left. Yet for much of the first 20 minutes, the Russians sliced apart the vaunted defense of the Americans with the precision of a Teppan Yaki chef. The point guard, Anna Arkhipova, and the Connecticut forward, Svetlana Abrosimova, ran the pick-and-roll as well as any Hall of Fame tandem from Utah, popping out for jumpers or penetrating for short bankshots. The center tandem of Elen Chakirova and Maria Stepanova, a 6-foot-8, slender woman with golden blond hair and striking features whom the Australian press has nicknamed ``The Russian Barbie,'' were responsible for putting Leslie and Griffith in foul trouble. Taking it to the Americans like no other team in the tournament, the Russians matched the United States women in every facet until the comeback. They put, if not fear, at least major concern into the minds of Fortner and her players. The American women never trailed at halftime during any of their games en route to the gold medal four years ago in Atlanta. They had not lost in Olympic competition since the 1992 semifinals in Barcelona, when several of the same Russian players pulled off the upset. Their last loss in international competition came against Brazil in a Rio de Janeiro exhibition in March. ``We're not aggressive right now defensively,'' Griffith said. ``This is the third game we started slow. It was a great game, but we need to work on our communication a little harder.'' Russia seems headed for a semifinal showdown with Australia, who played Slovakia last night. The winner would most likely see the United States in the gold medal game. At the 1998 world championships, the Russians beat Australia by six points in the semis. As well as they played, the Russians were minus some key players. Their regular starting point guard, Irina Soumnikova, was sidelined for the tournament when she caught an elbow in the face from a Cuban player in the team's first game. Falling to the floor, she fractured her right wrist on the play and, the Russians said, had to undergo two hours of plastic surgery for a facial injury. The Russian coach, Evgeny Gomelskiy, was still blaming the Cubans tonight for leaving him short-handed, calling the act malicious. ``She forced one of our girls to end up in a hospital,'' he said. The Cuban player, Maria Leon, denied on Monday that she purposely hit Soumnikova. What's more, the center, Elena Baranova, one of the best players from Russia who stars in the WNBA, missed the Olympics with a knee injury. That left the arching 3-pointers of Arkhipova -- she made all four she attempted -- and the creative passing of her teammates to fill the void. Often, the Russian players over 6-feet tall dribbled the ball upcourt and picked up their defensive assignments in the backcourt. ``I look at Russia, and their post players can do so much,'' McCray said. ``Can you imagine Lisa Leslie picking up someone 64 feet from the basket? They're really talented in a lot of different areas of the game, where as we specialize a lot.'' Gomelskiy, the Russian coach, congratulated the Americans for their comeback and superiority on defense at the post-game press conference. He talked about the incredible individual skills of the Americans, almost inferring that his players played better together. He lamented a few mistakes by the Russians, ``but as far as the team effort, there are no tragedies today,'' he said. No, but for a few anxious moments, the United States came closer than they have in a while to going down. ``This really wasn't a scare,'' McCray said, again. ``It was a great challenge. Look, we're not going to beat the really good teams by 20 points, anymore. People just have to get used to that.'' ",2000-09-20T05:00:00+0000

The American diving coach, Jay Lerew, says it's possible, and his divers say they like the pool. ``This sort of water feels good to divers,'' said Lerew. ``It has a nice fluffy feel and you can see a lot better on entries.'' The pools at Sydney International Aquatic Centre use nearly identical circulation systems, producing remarkably clear water containing few of the harsh chemicals like chlorine that irritate divers. Water quality has been cited by competitors and swimming experts as one reason Olympic swimmers have excelled in the 50-meter swimming pool. The diving pool seems to elicit similar reviews from the American divers. ``I love this pool,'' said Michelle Davison, a 3-meter springboard diver. ``The water is great; the boards are great.'' Troy Dumais, another 3-meter springboard diver, said that he has enjoyed competing in the pool at several previous meets, but added that the facility is not perfect. He said that relatively minor drawbacks include fluctuating temperatures in the showers and in the whirlpool tubs, and a cool breeze in the locker room that sometimes chills athletes who are between dives. ``But if one person has to deal with it, we all have to deal with it,'' he said. ``It's a great pool.''

Leonard's dedication to community service followed in the footsteps of his parents, Leonard and Elinor, who were leaders of the Jewish Family Service, a predecessor agency of JBFCS, and the New York community. His commitment to helping troubled adolescents, most recently as co-chair of our Youth Counseling League Divisional Committee, and his earlier chairmanship of the Westside School, has been critical to the agency's expansion and enhancement of services. His diligence as vice chair of the Budget and Finance Committee has ensured a level of fiscal responsibility and foresight that keeps the agency at the forefront of the mental health profession. His co-chairmanship of the Capital Campaign protects the agency's financial strength and sustains its ability to provide the highest quality of services. Leonard's gentle manner, strong commitment, generosity and firm belief in the agency's responsibility to serve all those who need our help was respected by board and staff alike.

German Ugryumov, deputy head of the FSB domestic security police, told Interfax news agency that all hostage-takers and people said to be their victims walked out of the small hotel, scene of the incident, at 11:15 Moscow time (0715 GMT). First Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Kozlov told Interfax that police suspected the captors and their victims may have been partners in crime. ``There are serious suspicions that there were never any hostages, and that this was a staged situation with phoney hostages,'' Kozlov said. Earlier, Ugryumov had said the captors had launched the incident spontaneously, ``after a boisterous night and a big drunken binge.'' Officials first voiced suspicion that at least one of the presumed hostages, a woman, was an accomplice late on Thursday. Early on Friday the woman walked out of the building and officials said she was handed over to investigators to establish her role in the incident. Since Thursday, two other people have left the building, one jumping out of the window on the first (second U.S.) floor and breaking both his legs. The gunmen, who seized their hostages on Thursday, initially demanded $30 million and the release of all Chechen prisoners held in Russian prisons. But officials have played down suggestions of a political motive, saying the request to free Chechens looked like a smoke screen. ``The terrorists have no consistent demands. Various options have been discussed involving sums of money and means of escape from the scene,'' Ugryumov said shortly before the gunmen surrendered. Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky was quoted by Interfax as saying President Vladimir Putin was pleased with the outcome. POLICE WERE READY TO STORM HOTEL Ugryumov earlier said his officers were prepared to storm the building if negotiations failed. Itar-Tass had reported that crack commando units were in place around the hotel and trucks had brought floodlights and ladders. The FSB said on Thursday that the hostage-takers had thrown a video cassette from a window of the building showing three men and one woman handcuffed to a pipe. A jerry-can, said to contain petrol, and a grenade were also shown. The hotel is around 50 km (30 miles) from the main Black Sea resort centre of Sochi, in a region lying some 450 km (300 miles) west of Chechnya, where Russian troops have waged war against pro-independence rebels for a year. The FSB earlier named three hostage-takers as Igor Savchenko, and Soslan and Aslan Khugayev. The Khugayevs were described as being from the North Caucasus town of Vladikavkaz in a region neighbouring Chechnya. The hostage-takers fired a round from an automatic rifle through the window and threw three grenades onto the lawn outside on Thursday ``to put pressure on the negotiators,'' the FSB said. It said nobody had been injured. ",2000-09-22T05:00:00+0000

The teen, now 16, pleaded guilty Thursday to federal charges, and also admitted he had illegally entered a Pentagon computer system, intercepted 3,300 e-mail transmissions and stolen passwords. The young man's name was withheld because of his age. The Justice Department said he was the first juvenile hacker to be incarcerated for computer crimes. The teen was known on the Internet as ``cOmrade'' and will serve his sentence in a Florida detention center. He was 15 when the crimes occurred. ``Breaking into someone else's property, whether it's a robbery or a computer intrusion, is a serious crime,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said. Meanwhile, in California a 20-year-old man was arrested and charged Thursday by federal authorities who said he also hacked into computers operated by NASA, as well as several universities, including Harvard, Stanford and Cornell. Among the computer systems Jason Diekman of Mission Viejo, Calif., allegedly hacked into were those used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. In August and October 1999, ``c0mrade'' entered the computer network run by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which monitors the threat from nuclear, biological, chemical, conventional and special weapons. In a plea bargain, the young Florida hacker admitted to entering 13 computers at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., for two days in June 1999 and downloading $1.7 million in NASA proprietary software that supports the space station's environmental systems. NASA said it cost $41,000 to check and repair the system during the three-week shutdown after the illegal entry was discovered. Chris Rouland, who monitors computer attacks for Internet Security Systems Inc. in Atlanta, said the case was unusual in that the youngster was caught -- not that he managed to break into the computers. Rouland said the case reflects growing technical sophistication among hackers: ``This is a great bellwether as to the state of security where juveniles can traipse across computer systems with little or no fear.'' Had the hacker been an adult, he could have been charged with wiretapping and computer abuse crimes. As part of his sentence, he must write letters apologizing to the secretary of defense and the administrator of NASA. ",2000-09-22T05:00:00+0000

ETA, in a communique published in the radical separatist newspaper Gara, said it bombed a Basque discotheque earlier this month because it considered the nightclub a centre of drug trafficking. ETA accused police of turning a blind eye to the illegal drug trade that it said ``hurts Basque youth and goes against the process of liberating the Basque Country.'' The communique was released just a day after the killing of a town councillor in a Barcelona suburb, the latest attack blamed on the guerrillas. ETA did not immediately claim responsibility for Thursday's assassination -- it rarely does until weeks later. But with Friday's communique, ETA has now admitted to 12 of the 13 killings tied to ETA this year since it called off its 14-month-long ceasefire last December. The guerrillas have been blamed for about 800 deaths in their 32-year fight for an independent state in northern Spain and southern France. ",2000-09-22T05:00:00+0000

The post-Victorian Fifth Avenue milieu in which Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson), the heroine of Wharton's great, sad novel, is ruthlessly torn apart by the jackals of high society obliquely anticipates today's post-feminist climate of ''Sex and the City,'' prenuptial agreements and trophy wives. Money rules, and anyone who doesn't catch on to that fact is a fool who deserves to learn the hard way. However amorous a high-powered match might be, there is also likely to be a business arrangement lurking under the bed covers. The English director's vision of New York City in 1905 is infinitely bleaker and more sterile, of course, than the glittering Versace and Gucci-clad present. The characters are too constricted by a punishing puritanical code of behavior to have much fun; hardly a smile is cracked throughout the film's glum 140 minutes.",2000-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin, in a speech prepared for delivery here, told International Monetary Fund policymakers that a debt relief scheme they launched four years ago with the World Bank was moving too slowly. He recalled that the IMF last year had made a commitment to stepping up the pace of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC), which offers relief to impoverished nations that adhere to IMF economic reforms and draft action plans to eliminate poverty. ""We made a commitment last year to faster action and we must make good on this commitment,"" Martin told a meeting of the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee. ""Too many heavily indebted countries have still not benefited from the faster, deeper and broader debt relief promised under the enhanced HIPC initiative ...We must ask ourselves whether we cannot do more. For example, why should we not consider an immediate moratorium on debt payments from eligible reforming HIPC countries?"" He said the moratorium could be extended to countries ""committed to principles of good governance and are not in conflict."" But the actual cancellation of the debt would not take place until countries have been deemed finally eligible for relief under HIPC. Such an approach, according to Martin, would ""create an incentive for countries to continue to implement good policies.""

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Imagining Wyoming,"Film critics were jolted last year when David Lynch, who directed a version of Barry Gifford's novel ''Wild at Heart,'' released ''The Straight Story,'' a G-rated road movie with a fuzzy sheath of atypical sentiment. Now it's Gifford's turn to surprise: his new novel, WYOMING (Arcade, $19.95), is a tender and understated story that has none of the gleeful sadism or frenzied grotesqueries that have defined his earlier work. Not all of Gifford's trademarks have disappeared: The narrative is elliptical, the dialogue zigzags and Gifford's preoccupation with highway-bound drifters stands front and center. But instead of the dissipated losers and bug-eyed maniacs who've peopled Gifford's previous novels, the drifters here are a sweetly indulgent single mother and her young son, Roy; their travels through 1950's America are the novel's backbone. Just where they're headed, or why, is rarely revealed, but that's not the point, as even young Roy understands: ''Maybe sometimes it's better to imagine how something or someplace is rather than to have it or be there.'' For this pair, Wyoming is just such an imaginary place, a dream locale where Roy and his mother can always escape. ''It's really big there, with lots of room to run,'' Roy says. ''I looked on a map. Wyoming's probably a good place to have a dog.'' When anything bad happens, Roy tells her he's going to ''think about Wyoming.'' ''It's a good thing, baby,'' she replies. ''Everybody needs Wyoming.'' That Gifford forges these characters almost entirely out of dialogue makes their affecting humanity doubly impressive; by the novel's end, Roy and his mother are likely to live as vividly in the reader's mind as their unseen Wyoming lives in theirs.

us,Bogong Moths Set Upon Olympic Park," SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 24 -- As television cameras high above Olympic Stadium pull back to reveal the magnificent panorama below, the first things viewers may notice is not athletes but moths. Millions of them, jammed almost wing-to-wing around the huge stadium lights, appearing to TV cameras like shimmering stars. They are Bogong moths, distracted from their southward migration through New South Wales to the Bogong region of Alpine National Park, near the Murray River in northern Victoria state. Along the way the moths will be guests of honor at the annual Mungabareena Ngan-Girra Festival, formerly known as the Bogong Moth Festival, where aboriginal Australians will fete their return and eat quite a few. There is even a Bogong Moth Hotel (for people) in Mount Beauty. Sydney's Olympic organizers consider the moths a pest -- plagues of Bogong months occasionally infest Sydney and Canberra -- and they find it necessary to announce at night baseball games that the huge moths are harmless. The massive lights at the Olympic Stadium are an even bigger temptation, and stadium managers will dim the field lights and turn off the external stadium lights at midnight rather than 3 a.m. to encourage the moths' departure. Jayne Pearce, a spokeswoman for the track and field events, said that no athletes had complained, but that the cleaning staff has been instructed to pay special attention to moth carcasses. ""If they die they tend to create a bit of a mess,"" she said. Grown Bogong moths have two-inch wingspans, and they swoop down on startled fans, then rest on pant legs or shirts. Aborigines found the moths to be a reliable source of food, and they regularly gathered moths from the mountain caves southwest of here. The most common Bogong moth recipe includes roasting in heated sand and hot ashes, then sometimes grinding the bodies into a powder and making it into cakes. The walnut-flavored delicacy is available at the moth festival and at other aboriginal reunions. Variations include Bogong and popcorn (just what it sounds like). A Web page devoted to the moth festival includes this advice to backyard chefs: ""A simpler way to roast Bogongs is on your barbie. Just put them on sticks...they do get a bit black, but they taste about the same."" ",2000-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Drawn on Deadline,"When Bill Gallo was recently asked how long it took him to draw a cartoon, he replied, ''Two hours and 40 years.'' DRAWING A CROWD: Bill Gallo's Greatest Sports Moments (Jonathan David, $35), written with Phil Cornell, a copy editor at The Daily News, is a celebration of those four decades, and Gallo's uncanny ability to render sports stories into insightful, single-frame drawings. Gallo's stylized truth-telling even got through to Muhammad Ali, who used a Gallo cartoon, depicting a corpulent Ali pushing his own stomach around in a wheelbarrow, as motivation to get back into shape. Because most of these cartoons were drawn as commentary on breaking news, the book has a vitality and anticipatory quality that makes each turn of page into something of a surprise: Who will break the single-season home run record, Mantle or Maris? In which round will Sonny Liston knock out Cassius Clay? Isn't the newly constructed Astrodome a wonder that rivals the Taj Mahal? Early in Gallo's career at The Daily News, the managing editor tried to make the young cartoonist conform to a precise, draftsman-like drawing style, which was totally out of character. A despondent Gallo soon asked to be taken off cartooning, but not before drawing one final piece, done in what would become his loose-lined, whimsical style. Gallo's superior saw it, and said, ''From now on, do it your way.'' The sports world is richer for it. Mark Levy",2000-09-24T05:00:00+0000

So intense is the belief in the medical profession's ability to cure our ills that it is striking to note it was only 75 years ago that a medical scientist first entered American literary consciousness in the exalted role of hero. Sinclair Lewis's 1925 novel, ''Arrowsmith,'' is the story of a physician's relentless search for truth. Unlike in other novels of this period or before it, the main character is no cleric, writer or philosopher. He is not even a particularly great doctor.

us,Tough-minded Australian Pair Wins," BONDI BEACH, Australia, Sept. 25 -- Australia's Kerri Pottharst -- Potsy to her friends -- became a beach volleyball player for the most obvious reason of all. ``I loved to hang out at the beach,'' she said. Pottharst turned her cap backward, and played on, even through four knee surgeries. Natalie Cook, Pottharst's playing partner, tread an exacting path of a different sort -- occasionally across broken glass and 600-degree burning coals. Seeking a competitive edge, Cook recently sought out a ``success coach.'' It's the specialty of Kurek Ashley, an American who tutored Cook in various acts of daring-do, like walking on shattered glass and hot coals. ``It makes you believe the impossible isn't impossible,'' Cook said. And yet, for all their enterprise and empiricism, Pottharst and Cook were never more than second to the top-rated Brazilian beach volleyball combination of Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar. Pottsharst and Cook worked at the karma of the matchup, filling their team lodgings in the last month with dozens of things colored gold -- replica medals, goldfish, goblets, volleyballs and wall hangings. They bought gold toothpaste and gold shampoo. ``Our plan was to have this tidal wave of emotion and thought,'' Cook said. ``And to have it wash over the Brazilians.'' Today, surfers cruising Pacific Ocean whitecaps were visible through the portals of the makeshift Olympic beach volleyball grandstand that rises above shimmering Bondi Beach. On the sand below, Pottharst and Cook were riding a swell of their own. In a setting that could not have been more fitting of the 2000 Sydney Games -- as carefree as a day at the beach -- Australia hosted another perfect Olympic moment for itself. Before 10,000 fans, many waving Australian flags and wearing green and gold, Pottharst and Cook defeated Bede and Behar in the beach volleyball gold medal match. And the Australians did so in stunning fashion, winning the first two games of a planned best-of-three with late, startling rallies that left the home crowd delirious. When it was over, Pottharst lay face down in the sand for half a minute with Cook kneeling over her. ``I just lost it,'' said Pottharst, who at 35 years old is 10 years Cook's senior. ``I could not believe we had won. You dream of something forever and when it happens, sometimes it's too amazing to comprehend.'' Behar and a tearful Bede, who would later apologize to Brazilian fans for the loss, were also embracing at their end of the court. ``It was a great scene today, a great party,'' Behar, who won a beach volleyball gold medal with a different partner four years ago, later said. ``But you have to know the disappointment for us, too.'' For Pottharst and Cook, it was the culmination of an odd, four-year journey. Now the ``best of mates,'' according to Cook, they had split as playing partners after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when they teamed to win a bronze medal. ``We're 10 years apart and it had become too much like big sister and little sister,'' Cook said. ``I needed to learn some things for myself.'' Reunited last year, they agreed to come together as equals. ``Though we still get on each other's nerves,'' Cook said. Pottharst brought her powerful serve, Cook a consistency in all areas and some fresher, younger legs. They needed both today, especially when the Brazilians took 10-6 leads in both games. The first team to 12 points wins. They won the first game, also called a set, when Cook's serve hit the top of the net and fell straight down. So a lucky break brought the first big ovation. Bede and Behar looked stunned, but took the same commanding 10-6 lead in the next game. Consecutive spikes by Cook cut Brazil's lead in half, and then with Pottharst serving, the Australians tied the game, 10-10. Pottharst was again serving at 11-10 when an awkward return by Bede shockingly fell wide of the sideline. Pottharst fell to her knees and buried her head. Earlier in the week, she had called the crowd of 10,000 distracting. ``I wasn't used to it,'' she said. ``We don't play before crowds like that. I wanted to say, `Would you all just shut up.''' But Pottharst and Cook came to embrace the crowd and its advantage. They included the fans as partners in their pursuit of the gold medal, a movement they called, ``The Dreamachine.'' As Pottharst lay in the sand in victory, Cook beside her, the ovation reverberated around the natural rock formation that protects Bondi Beach's radiant sandy shore. Suddenly, Pottharst jumped to her feet, never more at home, and threw handfuls of sand in the air. A few minutes later, hat still on backward, she addressed the crowd. ``I know it's a dream,'' Potsy said, ``but I'll remember this day for the rest of my life.'' ",2000-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The World; Rethinking Their Tired and Poor: A Swiss Proposal,"SWISS voters will roll out the apparatus of direct democracy today and consider, alongside proposals on fuel taxes and voting procedures, whether to limit the resident foreign population to 18 percent. Sponsors of the bill point out that the current level is over 19 percent a 25 percent increase over the last 10 years. But opponents of the initiative, who appear to be in the majority, argue that it would undermine the Swiss economy and tarnish the countrys image abroad. Six similar initiatives have found their way to the bal-lot box since 1970. Each one has failed. But the 18 percent initiative, as it has come to be known, is particularly contentious because it would provide exceptions for highly educated foreigners involved in technological and scientific pursuits, leaving asylum seekers and poorer immigrants at the mercy of the new quota. Switzerland has one of the highest proportions of foreign residents in Europe. Here is a look at how the country compares with its neighbors, and where most of the new arrivals are coming from.

us,Taiwan and the Philippines Settle Yearlong Air Dispute," TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan and the Philippines have settled an aviation dispute that had severed air links between them for nearly a year and agreed to resume flights by October, a Philippine official said Sunday. Rodolfo Reyes, executive director of Manila's de facto embassy in Taiwan, said both sides will sign a memorandum of understanding Monday allowing Taiwanese air carriers to fly passengers and cargo from Manila to third destinations. ``Our prayers have been answered. We just have to finalize the details, but everything has been resolved,'' Reyes said. Normally cordial relations between the countries turned sour when Manila scrapped the 1996 air pact with Taiwan, accusing Taiwanese carriers of unfair competition by flying passengers to third countries. Taiwan complained that by canceling the agreement, Manila ignored international procedures that call for a one-year warning before an air pact is terminated. The squabble has proved costly for the Philippines, where Taiwanese investment has dropped by 72 percent to $390,000 in the first quarter of the year, compared to the same time last year, Taiwan's Economy Ministry said. Both Taiwan's EVA Airways and Philippine Airlines will be able to resume flights by Oct. 10, but China Airlines will start flying only by the beginning of November, Reyes said. As part of the deal, each side will fly a maximum of 9,600 passengers weekly, a number stipulated under a 1996 air services agreement. The Philippines said the number was too high and unilaterally scrapped the agreement last October. ``In effect, we will be going back to the 1996 agreement, Reyes said. ",2000-09-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Yugoslav Opposition Declares Victory as Votes Still Counted," BELGRADE, Yugoslavia -- Claiming victory in an election marked by fraud allegations, Slobodan Milosevic's opponents warned that the Yugoslav president may try to rig the vote in a desperate attempt to keep the power he has wielded for 13 years. ``This is the dawn of our freedom,'' law professor and opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica said early Monday as Yugoslavians poured onto the streets of Belgrade and other cities. By midmorning Monday, election officials had still not released any official numbers from Sunday's elections, nor had they resumed work suspended the night of the vote. An estimated 74 percent of the country's 7.6 million voters cast ballots for president, parliament and local officials. However, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia party claimed its candidate, 56-year-old Kostunica, had won the presidency, saying its poll watchers reported that he had an absolute majority, defeating Milosevic and three other contenders. ``Votes can be rigged when there is a slim difference between two groups, but when the difference is this big there is no way anyone can falsify the results,'' said Vladan Batic of the opposition alliance. No one in Milosevic's Socialist Party was willing to go on the record, but a senior official requesting anonymity told The Associated Press that the party's ``top people were debating all night ... We don't exactly know what we'll do.'' If no candidate ends up with an absolute majority, a runoff will be held Oct. 8. However, Milosevic was showing no signs of conceding defeat, and Western governments held late night consultations to determine how to respond. The European Union on Monday issued a statement criticizing Milosevic for intimidating voters and manipulating the presidential ballot, declaring that any effort by the Yugoslav leader to declare victory would be ``fraudulent.'' In Vienna, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the chairwoman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in a statement, ``All available information points to a clear lead by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia's Vojislav Kostunica in the first round.'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Monday said ``all the reliable evidence'' shows Milosevic had lost and urged the president to step aside. ``Be honest with your people, don't cheat them, get out of the way and let Serbia get out of the prison into which you have turned it,'' he told a Labor Party conference in London, referring to Yugoslavia's main province. Early in the vote-counting, White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said questions about irregularities brought into question ``the integrity of the whole process.'' Hours later, as reports came out that the opposition -- which the United States backs -- was in the lead, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington took a softer tone, warning simply that ``the world is watching.'' Believing that there can be no stability in the Balkans as long as Milosevic remains in power, the United States has invested millions in an attempt to organize the traditionally fractured Serbian opposition and defeat Milosevic. Milosevic spokesman Nikola Sainovic, however, claimed that with 20 percent of the votes counted, Milosevic was leading by 44 percent while Kostunica had 41 percent. Kostunica's group, an alliance of 18 parties, claimed returns from 51 percent of 10,000 polling stations showed him leading with 53 percent to 36 percent for Milosevic. The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which ran its own unsuccessful presidential candidate, said Kostunica was leading Milosevic by 53.5 percent to 37.9 percent with 20 percent of the votes counted. Confident of victory by an opposition that seemed hopelessly fragmented only months ago, huge crowds streamed into the streets of downtown Belgrade late Sunday to await official results. Helmeted riot police carrying shields and armed with tear gas cordoned off the group but later withdrew as the mood became more festive than confrontational. Similar gatherings were reported in Nis, Novi Sad, Cacak and several other towns in Serbia. There were no immediate reports of clashes, and the crowds dispersed early Monday. Despite the public euphoria, opposition leaders said they were concerned that Milosevic would try to claim victory -- or ensure a place in the runoff. ``Milosevic has to seriously understand the judgment of history, and he shouldn't gamble any longer,'' said Kostunica's campaign manager, Zoran Djindjic. Montenegro, the smaller republic that along with Serbia forms present-day Yugoslavia, said it would hold an independence referendum if Milosevic wins. If he loses, the European Union has promised Yugoslavia massive aid. Kostunica had been leading in opinion polls -- despite a campaign marred by a crackdown against opposition supporters. The Center for Free Elections and Democracy, a private group including human rights workers, lawyers and other volunteers, reported a turnout of 74.6 percent in Serbia. In Montenegro -- where the pro-Western government boycotted the vote -- the turnout was 24 percent, the opposition said. The center also reported major voting irregularities, including officials kicking opposition representatives out of polling stations or not allowing them to inspect voters' lists, voting boxes and ballots. The government's electoral commission said the vote passed without irregularities, ``despite Western propaganda.'' ",2000-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Barak and Arafat Plan Middle East Peace Talks," JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat plan to meet Monday evening for the first time since the Camp David summit to try to break the deadlock in peace talks, Palestinian officials said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting would likely take place at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip. The two leaders -- who have a history of icy relations - last met in the U.S.-hosted peace summit at Camp David in July. The talks collapsed over the future of Jerusalem and have yet to resume at full speed. In another sign that peace efforts may be moving into high gear after two months of stagnation, negotiating teams from both sides were to leave for Washington on Monday night for separate talks with the Americans, the Palestinian officials said. The negotiators are under growing time pressure. Barak faces an increasingly hostile parliament which has threatened to topple him over his peace policies when it reconvenes in late October. Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said Arafat was not meeting Barak in order to announce any softening in the Palestinian position. ``By agreeing to the meeting, we are giving the peace process a new chance, we are extending our hand to the other side to tackle the differences on the negotiating table,'' Abed Rabbo said. ``We are not going to make concessions.'' The talks are locked over rival Palestinian and Israeli claims to east Jerusalem, in particular the Al Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam and also the site of the former Jewish Temple, the holiest shrine of Judaism. Barak has said Israel would never hand sovereignty over the area to the Palestinians or any Muslim body. Palestinian negotiator Hanan Asfour, meanwhile, rejected Barak's suggestion to sign a partial agreement if a comprehensive deal cannot be reached. ``A partial or transitional agreement has no place in our political dictionary,'' Asfour said. Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's acting foreign minister and a senior negotiator, confirmed that the two leaders would meet, but did not say when. ``It is important to build trust between the prime minister and Yasser Arafat,'' Ben-Ami told Israel radio. According to the Palestinian sources, American-Jewish businessman S. Daniel Abraham, former head of the weight loss business Slim-Fast Foods, helped set up the meeting. ",2000-09-25T05:00:00+0000

Elliott Flynn, a senior analyst in ING's London office, said $155 billion might flow out of Asian equity markets as a result of the changes, which assign new weights to index components based on how freely their shares trade. Thus, companies that are partly owned by governments or by other companies, of which Japan has many, will be assigned less importance in the indexes. Stephanie Strom",2000-09-26T05:00:00+0000

Intel filed suit last month, charging Broadcom with infringing its patents on cable and high-speed networking products. In a related suit filed in March, Intel asserted that Broadcom had misappropriated trade secrets. Broadcom's suit says that Intel pressed a customer into supplying it with Broadcom high-speed networking chips that it used to develop a competing product based on Broadcom's design. The suit follows a counterclaim Broadcom filed last week in response to Intel's suit. ''We don't believe it has merit,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, referring to Broadcom's request for a preliminary injunction. ''Nor do we believe their counterclaim filed last week has merit, and we will be happy to present our case in court.'' Lawrence M. Fisher",2000-09-27T05:00:00+0000
us,"Sombre, Reflective Mood at IMF After Violent Clashes"," PRAGUE, Sept. 27 -- Violent street clashes cast a pall over sombre IMF meetings here on Wednesday as delegates met defiantly in public, but questioned privately if the costs of large-scale global gatherings were starting to get too big. Only a few dozen delegates were present for the formal start of the second day of annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, held in a city clearing up after a night of battles between police and anti-capitalism activists. South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel opened events with a message of sympathy to injured police officers and one of thanks to the Czech authorities for keeping the meeting secure. ``We wish those injured police a speedy recovery,'' he said. Delegates said they were saddened by the trouble on the streets outside, but angry that a few hundred violent demonstrators seeking to abolish the bank and the fund had stolen the world's attention. ``Violence has no place in a civilised society and I stand here on behalf of India, the land of Mahatma Gandhi who espoused the cause of non-violence, and I condemn the violence which was unleashed here yesterday,'' Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told fellow delegates. ``Whether the IMF and the World Bank exist or do not exist is a matter which will be decided by the will of the 182 countries who are represented here, not by a handful of hoodlums in the streets of Prague.'' This year's annual meetings have attracted some 15,400 delegates, about 1,000 fewer than in 1999. The gatherings are traditionally held outside Washington every three years -- the previous out-of-town meeting was in Hong Kong and the next is scheduled for Dubai in 2003. HARD TO WORK Delegates agreed that the annual meetings were an important formal for bilateral talks as well as for set piece, formal sessions. But some admitted it was hard to work against a backdrop of protest and violence -- activists on Tuesday got to within metres (feet) of the edge of the final security zone, hurling eggs and cobblestones at police and delegates. ``Maybe we should look at holding these meetings once every two years -- but you can't quote me by name on that,'' said one blue-badged delegate, the symbol of a governor or official who is formally representing his country. ``You have to wonder if these meetings can be held from now on -- who could possibly want to host them?'' a delegate from northern Europe said. But Zdenek Hruby, the Czech official responsible for coordination with the bank and the fund, said the meetings were still profitable, despite the additional security costs. ``Of course I would recommend to any country to host this event for any country, because it makes many profits for the host country,'' he told a news conference in the Prague Congress Centre. ``But I would recommend not believing any promises from the organisers and coordinators of similar street demonstrations. I would recommend strict cooperation with security forces of neighbour countries to identify these people. They are...not protesters, they are criminals. People who throw stones at buses and at citizens are criminals. They are not civilised people.'' The protest organisers had promised to keep their demonstrations peaceful and police had clearly expected sit-down demonstrations rather than violent clashes. Officers often appeared nervous and ill-prepared in the face of angry, aggressive activists. RAMPAGE AND ARRESTS Hruby said over 500 people had been arrested after the violence, which included a firebomb attack on a group of police officers and a late-night rampage through Prague's central Wenceslas Square, the scene of peaceful protests which helped bring down Communism in 1989. Protest continued on Wednesday but on a much smaller scale. The groups say they are continuing a tradition started with protests which disrupted trade talks in Seattle last year and almost halted IMF meetings in Washington last April, but delegates were wary of their motives. ``Initially in Seattle there was a lot of sympathy for the protesters, but now there is a sneaking feeling these people have got an agenda which is no longer that of the third world,'' said James Jonah, finance minister of war-torn Sierra Leone. ``We cannot stop these meetings just because others have their own agenda. How can we deal with our creditors if we do not get a chance to talk to them?'' Delegates also defended the bank and the fund, which the protesters accuse of neglecting the needs of the poor, or making life worse by attaching tough conditions to their loans. ``I am not saying that these institutions are perfect,'' said Jean-Francois Giovanni, the deputy director of the Swiss development corporation. ``But if they were not there we could have a situation like in the 1930s with the total collapse of the world financial system.'' ``If there was no international cooperation and no international management, the Asian crisis would have been 10 times worse.'' An IMF board member said the fund needed to do more to get its message across. ``The IMF is a very disciplined institution with very capable people, but sometimes we are viewed from outside as arrogant and aloof. We have to be careful,'' he said. ",2000-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,At Least 55 Dead as Greek Ferry Sinks in Aegean," PAROS, Greece -- A Greek ferry struck a patch of rocks in the Aegean Sea and sank, killing at least 55 of the more than 500 people aboard who panicked and started jumping overboard, rescue officials said. ``We're finding bodies all the time. There are 55 dead and about that number of people missing,'' rescue force chief Andreas Kois said Wednesday. Many of the dead were young children, who were not required to be counted on the passenger list. A port official also suffered a heart attack and died after hearing news of the sinking, the coast guard said. Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos said the accident was caused by ``criminal negligence,'' and prosecutors ordered the arrest of the ship's captain and four crew members. Coast Guard chief Andreas Sirigos said the 34-year-old ferry boat hit a large rocky outcrop late Tuesday in rough seas about two miles off the popular resort island of Paros. A crew member interviewed by telephone said there was an orderly evacuation. But passengers reported a strong collision and then panic. ``The ship fell apart as it sank. There were people hanging from the railings. Children were crying and old people were screaming,'' Zoe Kolida told private Mega television. ``I jumped in and looked back after about 50 meters and the ship was gone.'' ``I thought of the Titanic,'' another survivor, engineer Stamatis Delavinias, told Mega. ``The boat sank in about half an hour. There were old women and others who were afraid to jump in the sea.'' Dozens of fishing boats, other vessels and British Navy helicopters rushed to the scene and helped in the rescue. The ferry's owner said there were 447 tickets sold and 63 crew members aboard, but the exact number of passengers was not known as some may have purchased their tickets onboard and children under the age of 5 are not required to have tickets. Some reports said at least 20 people from another ship owned by the same company may have boarded the ferry. The head of the Paros Health Center, Dimitris Stavrakis, said ``there a number of young children among the dead.'' A British Navy helicopter in rescue operations touched down at Paros airport and was seen unloading four bodies, including that of an infant. Some survivors taken to other locations, including the nearby island of Antiparos, also said they had not been registered by rescue authorities. It was not known how many foreigners were aboard, but they reportedly included passengers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United States. Coast guard officials were baffled as to why the 345-foot, 4,407-ton Express Samina hit the Portes islet, a large rocky outcrop which is marked on maritime charts and has a navigation light. ``You have to be blind not to see it,'' Sirigos said. ``It is inexplicable how the ship collided with a well-known rock that carries a light visible from a distance of seven miles.'' The accident was even more surprising for a vessel such as the Express Samina, one of more than a dozen ferries that daily sail to Paros and other resorts. The ship's captain Vassilis Yannakis, his lieutenant, Anastasios Psychoyos, and three crew members were arrested. A supreme court prosecutor also summoned two senior officials from the ferry's operator, Minoan Flying Dolphins, to give testimony. The captain of another ferry, Theoharis Tsoukalas, said he made the same run almost every day and could not remember ``any other ship ever hitting there.'' Greek and British warships on maneuvers in the area scoured the area as life rafts and vests washed ashore. Rescue efforts were hampered by a fresh gale with winds blowing up to 46 mph. British helicopters rescued at least 12 people, including two Britons, clinging to rocks in the swelling seas and took them aboard the HMS Invincible for treatment. They were suffering from cold, shock and minor cuts and bruises. Sirigos said 443 people from the ship had been accounted for at the island's health center. He appealed for any survivors staying at hotels or private homes to register at the health center. The ferry makes regularly scheduled runs from the Athens port of Piraeus to the island of Samos with a final stop at the tiny Lipsi islands near the Turkish coast. It was about to make a stop on Paros, 100 miles southeast of Athens, when it hit the reef. Sirigos said the coast guard was also investigating why it took the crew nearly 20 minutes to inform the coast guard that the ship was sinking. ",2000-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Undeterred, they moved two blocks south and created Swifty's, where the spirit of Mortimer's has migrated with surprising ease, along with the Mortimer's ''in'' crowd. In the meantime, the partners who run La Goulue bought Mr. Bernbaum's building, transformed it into a French brasserie and, in a final dismantling of the Mortimer's legacy, are serving very good food.

Two passengers attempted to hijack Xinhua Airlines flight LW126, which took off from the city of Baotou in Inner Mongolia at 7:20 a.m. (2320 GMT) bound for Beijing, said CCTV.com, a website run by state television. The report said members of the crew on board the Boeing 737-300 overpowered the assailants, but that two crew members were injured in the scuffle, including the captain who was seriously hurt. The plane, carrying 143 passengers, was forced to divert from its original route and landed in Jinan, capital of eastern Shandong province at 9:36 a.m. (0136 GMT), said CCTV.com. The website said one of the hijackers was shot dead by police at Jinan airport and the other was arrested, although it gave no further details. The official Xinhua news agency said there was only one hijacker. It gave no details of any casualties but said all the passengers were safe. An official at Jinan airport confirmed all the passengers were safe, but he declined to give further details. A spokesman for Xinhua Airlines also declined to comment. The reports gave no details of the motive for the hijacking or any indication of any weapons the assailants may have been carrying. Early this year, a passenger tried to hijack a China Southwest Airline plane bound for the southeastern city of Fuzhou, wielding a knife, but he was also overpowered by the crew. In 1993 and 1994 there was a spate of hijackings of Chinese aircraft by people trying to flee to the island of Taiwan, which has been ruled separately from the mainland since 1949.

The highlights include campy cartoons from the 1952 Eisenhower-Stevenson race and infamous attack ads from the campaigns of Lyndon B. Johnson (the ad that showed a little girl picking the petals of a daisy -- until a nuclear bomb exploded) and George Bush (the Willie Horton ad). The Desktop Candidate area links to sites with TV ads from the 2000 race and archives with the 1996 campaigns' online efforts.

The Officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York are deeply saddened by the loss of Susan Bailis, a dear friend who shared an enduring commitment to the Jewish community with her beloved father, Sanford Solender, and her cherished brother, Stephen D. Solender. Through her own heartfelt efforts, she embraced the legacy of her father, who served as executive vice president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York for 11 years, a predecessor to UJA-Federation. And like her brother, who served as executive vice president of UJA-Federation for 13 years, Mrs. Bailis combined a deep concern for humanitarian causes with love for the Jewish people. A social worker who rose to the ranks of top hospital administrator, and eventually built New England's largest nursing home company, Mrs. Bailis was a tireless crusader, dedicated to improving health care for the elderly and promoting research leading to advanced treatments and cures for breast cancer. A devoted leader respected by her colleagues, friends, and family for her generosity and vision, Mrs. Bailis served as chair of the board at the Heller School at Brandeis University and at the Simmons College School of Social Work. She was a dedicated member of the boards of Brandeis University, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Boston, and Americans for Peace Now. We extend our sincerest condolences to Mrs. Bailis' beloved husband, Lawrence; her children, Kathryn and David; her father, Sanford, and brother, Stephen; her sister-in-law, Elsa; and her entire family.

About 200 Palestinians were wounded in the violence sweeping the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the death toll rose to at least seven from violence earlier this week. It started after right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon -- a figure of hatred for Palestinians -- visited a site in Jerusalem's Old City on Thursday that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. Witnesses said Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers opened fire during clashes near a Jewish settlement in Gaza on Saturday, and medical sources said more than 70 Palestinians had been injured in the violence there. Israeli security forces also opened fire in the West Bank city of Nablus when hundreds of Palestinians marched towards an army checkpoint. Witnesses reported three people hurt. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the divided West Bank city of Hebron. Some threw stones and others hurled petrol bombs at Israeli soldiers and at least 60 people were injured. In Jerusalem, Israeli police said Palestinians threw stones at cars and buses and, as a security precaution, police evacuated worshippers from the Western Wall of the Old City where Jews were reciting prayers on the Jewish New Year. Dozens of other people were reported injured in isolated clashes across the West Bank. The Israeli army said it had used live ammunition in Gaza to target people ``endangering soldiers,'' as well as rubber-coated metal bullets and teargas there and elsewhere. ``PROVOCATIVE'' VISIT BY SHARON BLAMED Palestinian leaders had called a one-day general strike in memory of Palestinians killed on Friday during clashes at the Jerusalem holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Harim al-Sharif. They blamed the violence on the Israeli authorities' show of force and the ``provocative'' visit by Sharon to the Old City. A total of at least 400 Israelis and Palestinians, and several tourists, have been reported injured so far. The explosion of Arab-Israeli violence soured not only Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Barak's New Year, or Rosh Hashanah, weekend but also his push for lasting peace with the Palestinians. In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan telephoned Barak as well as Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Friday. ``He expressed his concern over the recent violence in Jerusalem and urged the leaders to do everything they can to reduce tensions, restore security and continue to work towards a peaceful settlement of the remaining issues that divide them,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. Arafat arrived in Cairo to discuss the violence with Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, a close ally of Washington and president of one of the only two Arab states to have made peace with Israel. Egyptian radio reported Mubarak had issued a statement blaming ``provocative Israeli actions'' for Friday's clashes in Jerusalem, the main stumbling block in the peace process. ``A statement issued by the Egyptian Presidency noted that, at a time when the peace-loving forces were looking forward to a breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, they were taken aback by the bloody incidents that too place yesterday (Friday),'' the radio said. SAUDIS BLAME ISRAEL Palestinian Minister Nabil Shaath said he was due to leave on Sunday to meet foreign ministers of Luxembourg, France, Britain, Ireland and Belgium and top European Union officials at Arafat's request to brief them on the bloodshed. Saudi Arabia, another staunch ally of the United States and supporter of Washington's role as Middle East peace broker, put the blame for the violence squarely on Israel. ``Saudi Arabia condemns the brutal assaults inflicted on Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem by Israeli occupation forces,'' the Saudi Press Agency quoted an official statement as saying on Friday night. Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to the world's two main Muslim shrines. Gulf media railed against the ``horrific massacre'' of Palestinians in Jerusalem and one newspaper in Qatar said the killings showed Israel was still the Arabs' foe. ``The events prove that Israel was neither a neighbour nor a peace partner. It is no more than an enemy,'' Al-Sharq's editorial said. In south Lebanon on Saturday, thousands of Palestinian refugees demonstrated against the killings. They marched through Ain el-Hilweh, the biggest refugee camp in Lebanon, chanting anti-Israeli slogans and burning an effigy of Sharon. ``Sharon, we will never forget your massacres in Sabra and Shatila. The Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) is Arab and will remain Arab,'' read one banner. In 1983 an Israeli inquiry found Sharon indirectly responsible for the killing of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut. He was defence minister at the time, during an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Russia called on Palestinians and Israelis to stop further bloodshed from derailing the peace talks. ``Moscow is extremely alarmed,'' a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said on Saturday. ``These tragic events are the consequences of provocative acts in the area of Muslim holy sites on September 28,'' it said in apparent criticism of Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount.
