It is now evident that the destruction of antiCommunist forces in Indochina has simply created a major new ideological battlefront for Moscow and Peking in their twelveyearold political war. The Russians apparently hold the upper hand in South Vietnam and Laos, and the recent news about the rapidity with which 1,500 Soviet advisers have appeared in Laos indicates the importance the Soviet Union attaches to this area.

Tom Seaver of the New York Mets had struck out 200 batters for the eighth consecutive season, also striking out Walter Johnson and Rube Waddell from the record book. He enjoyed the lingering moment, watching Jerry Grote toss the historic ball to the dugout, accepting Grote's congratulations at the mound and softly patting his catcher on the back, listening to the ovation. But, he says, strikeouts aren't any fun particularly, they're just part of the way I attack my job. He attacks it perhaps as well as any pitcher in major league history. For that reason, Tom Terrific is the symbol of the Mets, the Franchise as he's often called. Yesterday the Franchise put the franchise in the National League East race with his 20th victory, a fourhit, 10strikeout, 30 shutout that moved the Mets within four games of first place.

us,Screen: A Frothy 'Wilby Conspiracy':Apartheid Is Backdrop for Chase Melodrama,"""The Wilby Conspiracy"" is a sort of light hearted ""Defiant Ones,"" played for a good many laughs as well as for suspense and of course social content in the Union of South Africa. It's about a black political activist (Sidney Poitier) and an apolitical white English businessman (Michael Caine) who become locked together by their need to escape from the Cape Town police.The film, which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, was directed by Ralph Nelson (""Lilies of the Field"") and written by Rod Amateau and Harold Nebenzal. For a whileat the beginning when the film is establishing the reasons for the flight and pursuit that make up most of the filmit seems as if ""The Wilby Conspiracy"" is going to take itself seriously and solemnly as one of the first major American movies to come out firmly against apartheid.It does take itself as seriously as the plot demands but never too solemnly, since 'The Wilby Conspiracy"" is, at heart, a good old chase melodrama, decked out in modern dress and in liberated racial attitudes. The best thing about the movie, flimed mostly in Kenya, is its performances, funny and hip and self-assured in the manner of television personalities working in front of loving audiences.Mr. Caine and Mr. Poitier are never unaware that their material may not be the greatest, but that doesn't spoil their good spirits, and when a good line comes along they get maximum results without stomping on it or us.Giving them excellent support, acting, in effect, as straightmen to the two leading comics, are Nicol Williamson, who is brilliantly wicked as the Cape Town security officer dedicated to the capture of the fugitives, and Saeed Jaffrey, who plays what is described as ""a deeply committed Indian dentist,"" who attempts to assist the fugitives in Johannesburg. Mr. Jaffrey is gently, soberly funny, and it's no reflection on him when Mr. Caine says with some skepticism: ""A deeply committed Indian dentist? That sounds like all the people I hate at cocktail parties.""""The Wilby Conspiracy"" has a lot more plot than need be gone into here, some of it involving jet fighters, helicopters and Prunella Gee, as a pretty, liberated white South African lawyer, and Persis Khambatta, as a beautiful, perfidious Indian dental assistant, who, according to this film, should never be trusted with anything more lethal than a cotton swab.",1975-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Macon County' and 'McCullochs,' a Double Feature","Bonnie and Clyde did not die in vain. Go to a movie set in the thirties or forties or fifties. Let it begin with two or three funny, rebellious and attractive youngsters climbing into a car to conquer the world. It is going to end with the world squatting on them.One of the troubles with ""Return to Macon County""besides a mindless plot and its gross imitation of the atmospherics of ""American Graffiti""is that no sooner do its young protagonists begin to charm than the viewer begins to wait unhappily to see where the bullet holes will appear.As it turns out the bulletsfired by the customary hate-choked rural policemansmash the car but not the heroes. This spares us the final grisly convention of doomed-youth pictures. It doesn't spare us from sitting through most of the picture waiting for it.""Return to Macon County,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is about two country boys who set out for California with their lovingly supercharged stock-car, determined to become champion racers. They pick up a hash-house waitress, an endearing pumpkin-faced girl played by Robin Mattson, who wants to get to California to be a movie star.Besides being endearing, she is somewhere between fey and mad, and as dangerous as booby-trapped peanut butter. The two young racers think they're reasonably toughthey drag-race for money and sass police carsbut the waitress has the disconcerting habit of pulling out a revolver in moments of stress. ""My Daddy gave it to me,"" she explains to her startled companions. ""He says you meet some funny people.""The three tangle with some mean-spirited rival dragracers, who improbably get on their trail with shotguns. They also cross a maniac policeman who, even more improbably, takes it upon himself to kill them. In fact he shoots their car full of holes, but it is the shotgun-wielding rivals who are in it at the time.It is a pity about the car. It was boxy, cheerful and vivid yellow and it functioned serviceably, if unoriginally, as a symbol of youth and hopefulness. It is one of the curious things about movies, in fact, that the yellowness of the car should serve to shore up this picture's frail virtues. A color itself can have an emotional value; as it does when the waitress tries on an old hat, and its yellow arouses the same brash hopefulness already flaunted in the canary car.Both the young men, played by Nick Nolte and Don Johnson, are very good. Mr. Nolte, in particular, conveys exuberance, a reasonable but not excessive violence, and vulnerability.Robin Mattson is the picture's strongest asset, however. Her half-innocent explosiveness is skilfully conveyed: at first it captivates her partners, and finally it is too much for them. She has some wonderful moments: one of the best, when in the middle of fantasizing about the future with Mr. Nolte she looks at him, takes in his boyish good looks, says matter-of-factly: ""You're going to lose,"" and resumes the fantasy.On the same double bill is a terrible picture called ""The Wild McCullochs.""

Performed in a 183seat, 50yearold theater in a seedy section of Hollywood, Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been has been playing to packed houses for over six months. Bentley's play was first produced at Yale, and then at the Riverside Church in New York, but the Los Angeles presentation is the first to have caught fire. Partly, this success is due to some fine acting and good direction and script editing by William Devane. What makes the Los Angeles production a special event, however, is that here the audiences include movie personalities who were either directly or peripherally involved in the HUAC hearings. Members of the Hollywood Ten  the group of writers and directors who went to jail for refusing to testify before the committee have seen the play and been free with their comments afterwards. (Later this month the play may also rattle a few skeletons on Capitol Hill. Are You Now is set to open a fiveweekrun at Ford's Theatre in Washington on Sept. 19, with most of the members from the Los Angeles company; at the same time the play will continue running in Los Angeles with a replacement cast.)",1975-09-07T05:00:00+0000

They must have been many. He met her when she was 50, famous, and had achieved her hardwon personal harmony. He asked friends for her letters. Some refused. Edith Simcox, a friend and admirer of Eliot's, whom he was afraid to ask, did not offer hers, and so far these letters have not been found. John Chapman offered Cross his letters, but was refused.

However, if there is one certain thing about the behavior of such chemicals as carotin and xanthophyll (the pigments that turn leaves yellow) and anthocyanin (which makes them red), it is that this behavior is as unpredictable as the weather. The wise countryman knows that as soon as he makes fall foliage forecasts, Mother Nature will step in and turn the situation around. It is the brilliant reds and scarlets that, combined with the yellow tints, make foliage of outstanding beauty, and it is the reds and scarlets that depend most on the right weather conditions. Some trees will turn yellow regardless of the weather, but the trees producing red leaves will only assume vivid colors when warm sunny days prevail, followed by cool nights with temperatures below 45 degrees. That is why the colors are more pronounced in some years than in others.",1975-09-07T05:00:00+0000

Whence It Came, Where It Went, is not so much the definition and history its title leads one to expect as it is a diagnosis of our present economic ills. Or more precisely, an indictment of economic policy under the Nixon Administration and a set of prescriptions for future economic planning. For the economically sophisticated who wish to know where Professor Galbraith stands these days: his indictment takes Mr. Nixon's advisers to task for failing to compensate for the shortcoming of the Keynesian system that is, for failing to impose the necessary wage and price controls that he judges necessary in the light of the current wage price spiral and the difficulty of cutting government spending and raising taxes. As for his prescriptions for the future: Mr. Galbraith believes that (1) monetary, as opposed to fiscal, policy has about had it as a tool in economic management; (2) the balancing factor in economic management will have to be the national budget, and the decisive need here is to overcome its presently fatal inelasticity for dealing with excess demand; (3) Direct wage and price control where there is market power is inevitable, market power at present being what strong corporations and strong unions wield; (4) Monetary and economic management are inextricably a part of the larger problem of income distribution in the modern economy; (5) Planning for the supply and conservation of use of important products and services will, increasingly, be an aspect of monetary and economic management; and (6) the problem of instability in international exchanges will recur; no more in the future than in the past will unpredictability seem a solution.",1975-09-08T05:00:00+0000

Webster's New International Dictionary: ""Yaw . . . deviate from one's own course; move or cause to move erratically."")There are plenty of sharks in ""Sharks' Treasure,"" which opened yesterday at the De Mille and neighborhood theaters, but they are puny and don't pay proper attention. They move in circles, erratically.Their distraction will be shared. Cornel Wilde, whose work as a director occasionally raised a spark of interest, has made a home movie. The home needs cleaning.Mr. Wilde stars as a charter-boat captain who takes on a crew and finds sunken treasure near a Caribbean island. He poses in a brief, black bathing suit, lectures on the dangers of smoking and shows his fitness by doing one-hand push-ups.A gang of homosexual convicts comes on board and ties up the crew. The leader, a big, bearded man, capers around the deck and alternately beats and caresses a small, blond convict. The small convict cries a lot.Sometimes the camera mounts to the mast and films everything straight down. Either it is taking a correspondence course in cinema esthetics or it is trying to get out of the way.Eventually Mr. Wilde and his crew untie themselves and manage to eliminate the convicts. By this time the sharks have long since left and if the audience is wise it will have taken the hint.",1975-09-11T05:00:00+0000

A visit to Colonial Williamsburg means walking the same streets, sitting in the same halls of government, relaxing in the same taverns where Washington, Jefferson, Patrick Henry and other Virginia leaders of the 1770's walked, worked and imbibed. In the last 49 years, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, aided originally by John D. Rockefeller's millions, has restored 88 original buildings from the 18th century with meticulous care. Other buildings have been completely reconstructed on original foundations. The result has been to give back to the 20th century the charming 18thcentury town that was the seat of government of Britain's biggest American colony and this country's most populous original state.",1975-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,'Swept Away' Is a Wertmuller Film With Solid Appeal,"Summer. A blue Mediterranean seascape seen through sunlit mist. In the distance a handsome white yawl moves with the light breeze. On the soundtrack we hear some jazzy instrumental music that recalls the score of every Italian film about the sweet life you've ever seen, but there's a point to it in the film. It pollutes air that once was as pure as it looked.As the camera nears the yacht, the music gives way to the bickering of the yacht's well-heeled passengers. The mood that from a distance had seemed so serene turns suddenly, abrasively indolentand furiously funny. People who have nothing to do, no visible responsibility to anything except tan skin, angrily debate capitalism, Communism, consumerism, the role of the Vatican in Italian life, while complaining about a crewman's smelly T-shirt.This is the beginning of Lina Wertmuller's most entertaining new Italian comedy, ""Swept Away (By an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August),f"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema II Theater.""Swept Away"" is Miss Wertmuller's fourth film to be released in this country. It follows ""The Lizards,"" which was shown in New York several years ago as part of a Festival of Women's Films, ""Love and Anarchy"" and ""The Seduction of Mimi,"" and it's played by the two actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, who were so remarkable in the latter two films. It's also by far the lightest, most successful fusion of Miss Wertmuller's two favorite themes, sex and politics, which are here so thoroughly and so successfully tangled that they become a single subject, like two people in love.The shape of the film is as artificial as a fairy tale or a cartoon strip. Raffaella (Miss Melato), the rich, beautiful, acid-tongued Milanese who has chartered the yacht, and Gennarino (Giannini), the swarthy Sicilian deckhand whose T-shirts offend her, are marooned for several weeks on the only Mediterranean island not yet occupied by German tourists. They are Popeye and Olive Oyl locked in passionate combat.The way Gennarino folds his pants and shirtquickly, neatly, according to careful training that has become habit, you know he is a man who believes all things have their place, including women, who belong in the house with the children. Raffaella is an intelligent, selfish, superficially liberated slob who has never picked up anything in her life if there was an outside chance someone else would pick it up for her.He is a Communist with the dedication of a first-century Christian. She is a capitalist because, for her, the system has paid off. More important, he is a man and she is a woman, for which there is hell to pay on both sides.""Swept Away"" is the story of their tumultuous, slapstick courtship, his systematic humiliation of her (as she sees it) until, suddenly, she submits to her love for him and becomes in the process truly liberated. Feminists, I suspect, will debate a number of plot points as if Miss Wertmuller had set out to write a treatise and not to make a love story, some of whose meanings are not easily translated into feminist agitprop.More easily apparent are the director-writer's concerns about the Italian society that bred these two people and turned them into the mixed-up, wrong-headed characters they are, capable occasionally of unexpected, if imperfect nobility. Her sympathies appear to be more with Gennarino than Raffaella, but that's a matter of politics, not sex, and he is, on the surface, a male chauvinist pig of a classic type.""Swept Away"" is less a film about ideas than about previous commitments, for which neither character can be held completely accountable. The enormous appeal of the comedy has to do with the way, briefly, each character, is able to overcome those commitments.It also has to do with the performances of Mr. Giannini and Miss Melato, who tear into their roles with a single-minded intensity that manages to be both hugely comic and believable, even in the most outrageous of situations. They are the best things to happen to Italian comedy since Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren squared off in the nineteen-sixties.",1975-09-18T05:00:00+0000

When it breaks down to support individual soloists, the group retains these same qualities  but only up to a point. The soloists have flair and even individuality, particularly Danny Moore on flugelhorn: Harold Mahern, piano; Frank Strozier, on alto saxophone, and Mr. Coleman on tenor saxophone.

us,Screen: Poisonous 'Bug':Story of Beetles That Set People Afire,"Movie companies have the right to make bad pictures and reviewers the right to say unkind things about them. Normally, that is that: The public buys tickets, or not, the producer makes money, or not, and not much other harm is done. ""Bug,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State 2 and Cin, raises a different problem.To put it by analogy: If a restaurant reviewer eats a poor meal, that's one thing. If he gets ptomaine poisoning, that's another. ""Bug"" is decidedly poisonous.It is not simply a scary picture, nor simply a violent one. It is a cruel picture. Not necessarily because of the theme which is as improbable as, but not necessarily more harmful than, those of dozens of other pictures.An earthquake releases from the depths of the earth a swarm of ash-eating beetles with the property of setting objects, people and animals violently on fire. Cars explode, people burn up, buildings are set ablaze. The beetles are badly adapted to surviving above ground until a mad scientist develops a new, resistant strain. There are horrendous explosions at the end, and as far as the viewer can tellthe narrative is pretty fuzzythe new beetles swarm out to destroy the world.So far, so bad. In the classical horror film the horror was somehow overcome at the end. Stakes were driven through the vampires. Civilization, in some fashion, fought back. In ""Bug""as in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" an earlier film by the same producer, William Castleevil won and civilization was not only ineffective, but also virtually compliant.Horror pictures need upbeat endings as no other kind of movie does, precisely because they are pure fantasy. Who could stand a fairy tale in which the witch ate Hansel and Gretel and staved in business?But there is worse. The fear and loathing of small, crawling, barely visible creatures are a lot more basic and widespread than the fear, say, of white sharks. Spiders, mice, snakesthese are specific children's nightmares. The movie does vile things with this susceptibility. A girl answers the telephone and a beetle hidden in the receiver sets her ear on fire. A housewife is thumbing through a cookbook and a beetle gets in her hair and sets her hair on fire. A cat plays with a beetle and is horribly burned to death. All this is done with highly competent special effects and relentless, unending screaming.For some inexplicable reason ""Bug"" is rated PG. This means that parents should advise their children whether or not to go. Most parents will not be able to see ""Bug"" before deciding. This review urges them to decide no. ""Bug"" is sick, and literally sickening.",1975-09-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Ali the Man':Portrait of the Fighter Finds Him an Enigma,"On the eve of his third bout with Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali is still as much an enigma as a charismatic, enduring champion to judge by ""Ali the Man,"" which, with the previous ""Ali the Fighter,"" arrived at the Penthouse yesterday. As a documentation of a long career that, according to Ali, includes 280 fights, it is a slick, surface, fragmented portrait that is not especially penetrating or memorable. It is largely the Ali the public already knows, a truly fascinating figure but one whose heart and mind are rarely exposed fully.Out of an amalgam of color footage directed by Rick Baxter, old black-and-white film dating back to the callow Cassius Clay of Olympics fame, and a Richie Havens recording session intercut into the action, the Muhammad Ali that emerges appears to be all things to all men. Ali's philosophies are represented in discussions with black kids in Harlem, in projecting his feelings about his Muslim faith and in his somewhat confusing attitude on violence in the ring.This production, which ranged from Harlem to Tokyo, as well as stops at bouts and training camps in this country, also manages to focus on his wartime confrontation with the armed forces and the conflict between his faith and Army service that made the front pages, which unfortunately doesn't add to these old records. And, there's a good deal of highly stylized footage of Ali jogging through sylvan settings against the background of Mr. Haven's plaintive music (""don't let them try to keep you down""), as well as constant chatter by the champ, who, at one point, makes it comic when he says, ""I hate fighters who talk too much.""Of course, there are clips for the fight fans too. A succession of knockout in slow motion, as well as prefight, stagy, vociferous clashes with such opponents as Jerry Quarry and Sonny Liston, are fleeting and, like much of ""Ali the Man,"" it merely illustrates but doesn't really reveal a highly complex, controversial human being.The associate attraction, ""Ali the Fighter,"" the documentary of the first Ali-Frazier fight, which was released here in January, 1974, as ""The Fighters,"" is highly recommended, however, both as an excellent fight film and as an incisive view of the principals and the fight game, which isn't a game at all.",1975-09-18T05:00:00+0000

Consider that it had been 83 years since Wilbert Robinson, known best as Uncle Robby when he later managed the Brooklyn Dodgers had seven hits for the old Orioles of Baltimore in an 1892 game. Consider that if it takes that long for another major leaguer to do it, the deed will occur in the year 2058, perhaps on the moon. The record had lasted so long it was almost unknown.

us,Book Ends,"Comics. Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang have without a doubt sold more paperback collections of their adventures than any other comicstrip charactersover 100million copies is the current claim. Hardcover collections are another matter. There was a collection of Peanuts strips published four or five years ago by Holt, Rinehart & Winston, and come October 2which by no chance whatsoever is 25 years to the day from the first appearance of Peanuts in the papers Holt will bring out the most ambitious hardcover Peanuts yet. This is a coffee table book called Peanuts Jubilee, and will consist of the best Peanuts strips over the years as selected by their progenitor, Charles Schultz. As it turned out, though, the book is more than a collection, for it also contains Mr. Schultz's autobiography. Originally he was supposed to write only some caption material but, according to Holt publicity director John Taylor, once he got started, he couldn't stop. Known as an intensely private man, Mr. Schultz nonetheless wrote a 20,000word account of his life and career and he would have written 100,000 words, if they had let him, Mr. Taylor said. Also included in the book are various SchultzPeanuts memorabilia; such as his early commercial, art, pages from a World War II sketchbook and other drawings. Holt obviously expects Peanuts fans to sit up and take notice; the first printing is 100.000 copieshigh for a $35 book ($29.95 until Dec. 31).",1975-09-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Lumet's 'Dog Day Afternoon',"""Dog Day Afternoon,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1, is Sidney Lumet's most accurate, most flamboyant New York moviethat consistently vital and energetic Lumet genre that includes ""The Pawnbroker"" and ""Serpico"" and exists entirely surrounded by (but always separate from) the rest of his work. Mr. Lumet's New York movies are as much aspects of the city's life as they are stories of the city's life.""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a melodrama, based on fact, about a disastrously ill-planned Brooklyn bank robbery, and it's beautifully acted by performers who appear to have grown up on the city's sidewalks in the heat and hopelessness of an endless midsummer.If you can let yourself laugh at desperation that has turned seriously lunatic, the film is funny, but mostly it's reportorially efficient and vivid, in the understated way of news writing that avoids easy speculation.Each of the several principal lives it touches has been grotesquely bent out of shape. The director and Frank Pierson, who wrote the fine screenplay, don't attempt to supply reasons. The movie says only that this is what happened. No more. This severely limits the film's emotional impact, though not its seriousness or its fascination. ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is a gaudy street-carnival of a movie that rudely invites laughs at inappropriate moments, which is in keeping with the city's concrete sensibility.The incident on which the film is based was the attempt to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank on Aug. 22, 1972. The two bandits, one of whom was seeking money for a sex-change operation for a boyfriend, failed miserably, after they held the bank's employes hostage for 14 hours, appeared live on television, became the center of an impromptu neighborhood Mardi Gras, and negotiated for a jet plane to fly them out of the country.Mr. Lumet's film is exclusively concerned with the robbery attempt and the time it occupied. Only briefly does the film move out of the bank and away from the lower-middle-class neighborhood of apartments over pizza parlors, barber shops and barrooms. We occasionally see the neighborhood in a high, smoggy long-shot, the tar-paper shingles shimmering in the reflected heat.Most of the time the film stays contained within the bank. This concentration in space and time is responsible for much of the film's dramatic intensity.So too are the brilliant characterizations by the members of the large cast, including Al Pacino, as the (probably) more than a bit mad mini-mind of the holdup, a man with bravura style when he plays to the crowds outside the bank but apparently quite demented in his personal relationships.He vows his love for his wife and children and especially for his boyfriend, whom he had ""married"" in a drag wedding some months earlier with his mother as a witness. On the other hand, the boyfriend, played with just the right mixture of fear, dignity and silliness by Chris Sarandon, testifies that his would-be patron has tried to kill him on several occasions.The other characterizations that one remembers are those of Penny Allen as the bank's efficient head teller, Estelle Omens as a woman teller of a certain age who objects to profanity even under stress (""My ears aren't garbage cans""), John Cazale as Mr. Pacino's sidekick in crime, a man who doesn't smoke because ""the body is the temple of the Lord,"" and James Broderick and Charles Durning as the chief representatives of the law. Of particular interest is Susan Peretz as Mr. Pacino's wife, in whom one sees the tangle of city distress, anger, sweetness and violence, which is one of the main things that ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is all about.",1975-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"Whitmore, in Film, Gives 'em Truman","It starts bumpily and against the grain. ""Give 'Em Hell, Harry!"" a filmed version of James Whitmore's monologue re-creation of Harry S. Truman, has a lot going against it.Almost any stage show put flatly and squarely on camera gives a weakened, strained effect, like coffee made with used grounds. Filming a monologue imitationa uniquely theatrical formis especially chancy.When a lone figure comes out on a stage to do something so seemingly impossible as juggle seven balls or imitate a courting elephant, the audience is at least briefly on his side. Its sympathy, its will to believe, can be quickly dissipated by a bad performance, but it is there for a while.Films are different. We are skeptical when they try to address us. Movies have to wait a little. We only assent slowly to a face talking to us from the screen; there has to be some preparation first. Perhaps that is why so many movies begin with long shots, aerial sequences, views of people going about their business and paying us no attention.And here is Mr. Whitmore straight off, sitting at a desk and trying to make us believe he is Harry Truman. We know he isn't Truman; he doesn't even look very much like him. And whom is he trying to fool, with his noisy snuffling after each especially trenchant remark? Stage devices come unbuttoned in front of the camera.And yet ""Give 'Em Hell, Harry!,"" which is being shown for a limited run at the Ziegfeld Theater, works its way gradually past these problems. In the end, it captivates and even moves.For one thing, Mr. Whitmore may suffer the disadvantage of playing a stage part on the screen, but it is a first-rate stage performance. It is clear why his show has been such a success onstage in Washington. If at the start he is an actor straining away to imitate Truman, by the end he is the man.The script, put together by Samuel Gallu, is beautifully articulated and balanced. Mr. Gallu has taken a series of Truman confrontationswith General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, with the Ku Klux Klan, with the railroad unions, with a lawn mower back in Independenceand, using real quotations, friends' reminiscences and his own sensitive and restrained imagination, has made a portrait that is stirring as well as amusing.Perhaps the main force at work among all the craftsmanship is the way that Truman's authenticity  his sense of his limits and his additional sense that these limits were also possibilitieskeeps gnawing away at our awareness of what has happened since in American politics.In a way it took Richard M. Nixon to make Truman appreciated. How else could the sight of Mr. Whitmore fishing in his pocket for a stamp to mail a letter convey such a dramatic pang, a sense of the coarsened Presidential ethics of more recent times?",1975-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Dave Anderson,"MANILA, Sept. 24He continues to be introduced as Smokin' Joe Frazier, but the smoke flutters in wisps now, as if the flames inside him had burned out. Once he was a gladiator consumed by fury. In those years he attacked his sparring partners, snorting and grunting and ripping them with his left hook, punishing them. When he finally had his headgear yanked off, he was smiling from the sheer joy of brutality. His sparring partners puffed their cheeks in relief. But today that fury and that left hook seldom were evident as Joe Frazier prepared to challenge Muhammad Ali in their world heavyweight championship fight, which will be available at United States closedcircuit television locations Tuesday night. Wearing an orange version of a small boy's playsuit, the 31yearold former champion worked methodically, almost mechanically, at the Folk Arts Theater where both boxers train.

In the ring, Joe Frazier pretended not to notice Ali's presence. By the time his workout ended, Ali had departed in a howl of sirens. But even as Joe Frazier, wrapped in an orange robe, leaned on the ropes above a multitude of newsmen, Ali intruded again.",1975-09-25T05:00:00+0000

us,'La Chienne' Is Story of Degradation,"""This is neither a comedy nor a tragedy. It proves no moral at all. It's simply another story about He and She and The Other Guy.""So says, in effect, the master of ceremonies, the hand puppet that introduces Jean Renoir's 1931 classic, ""La Chienne"" (The Bitch), whereupon the camera moves across the apron of the miniature stage, through a cloth backdrop and into the world of real-life Paris.Maybe it's not an absolutely real-life Paris. The city we see is familiar in all its physical characterstics, but it is lit by the unique combination of compassion, wit, amusement and surprise that this greatest of all French directors has brought to virtually every film he's ever made.""La Chienne"" will be screened as a retrospective entry at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall this afternoon at 3 o'clock and once again next Saturday at the same time and place. Of the seven festival films I've seen at this writing, it's the only one that can be recommended without reservation. It's fresh, funny, rude and gentle about the appalling consequences one faces if one has the gift of staying alive.""La Chienne,"" which apparently has never been released here in an English-subtitled version, is Renoir's first full-length sound film. It's based on the novel by George de la Fouchardire that was also made into quite a different movie, ""Scarlet Street,"" by Fritz Lang in 1945. The basic story lines of both films are approximately the same, but where the Lang is dark, violent and obsessive, the tone of the Renoir is contemplative and ironic. In spite of what the master of ceremonies says, ""La Chienne"" is a comedy in the best sense.It's the not-really-so sad story of Maurice (Michel Simon), a painter on Sundays and a quiet, self-contained, somewhat comic figure of a bookkeeper the other six days. One night, Maurice, who is married to a perpetually furious shrew, meets a vulgar prostitute named Lulu (Janie Marze). In the way of such tales, he falls desperately in love with Lulu and sets her up in a flat that is occupied mostly by Lulu and her pimp.""La Chienne"" is the tale of Maurice's degradation, his victimization and his ultimate liberation, first through love, followed by violence, then by that curious, benign second-sight that Renoir bestows upon charasters who have the courage to survive.The late Mr. Simon is superb as the bookkeeper who doesn't fit into any stereotype of henpecked husband. His Maurice is a man of many parts, including the will to indulge his pleasures and a remarkable resolution, when necessary. All of the performances are close to flawless, but it's Renoir's unseen presense one remembtrs most vividly, the man we saw on screen, and recognized immediately, when he introduced the vignettes of his last film, ""The Little Theater of Jean Renoir.""",1975-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Fassbinder's 'Fist-Right of Freedom',"There is no air in front of the camera. The outdoor scenesdamp green foilage, overstuffed German shop windowsseem shot indoors; the indoor scenes, in velvet boxes. Cars move noiselessly, their windows clean and closed.Rainer Werner Fassbinder's work is highly prized in Europe and crosses the Atlantic each year to the New York Film Festival, where it tends to die. His entry this year, ""Fist-Right of Freedom,"" is a movie that gives us social protest in terms of social dyspepsia. It is not really deadit has, in fact, considerable drive and stylishnessbut it excludes all life that is not within the very narrow intentions of its author. Its pores have been painted over.Mr. Fassbinder denounces the injustices of civilization by laying more stress on the heartburn of rich than on the hunger of the poor. This is common enough with modern film makers. Visconti did it in ""Conversation Piece,"" which opened the festival yesterday. So, in more complex and lively fashion, did Lena Wertmuller in ""Swept Away by an Unusual etc . . ."" which is playing here to full houses. It allows the film maker to explore decadencealways more fun than exploring scabies  while compiling revolutionary credits.""FistRight is a full-suds treatment of the oldest weepy in the history of tears. Decades ago it was being parodied on the British music-hall stage:She were poor, but she were honest, Wictim of the squire's whim. First 'e loved 'er, then 'e left 'er An' she lorst 'er honest nyme.Mr. Fassbinder does it with homosexuals, and he sets it in a modern Germany. His victim is the virtuous proletariat  as homosexual  taken up, used, destroyed and discarded by the gilded bourgeoisie  as homosexual.Foxy comes on as the Talking Head in a traveling freak show. At the film's start the show is shut down, and Foxy buys a winning lottery ticket and picks up a middle-aged furniture dealer in a public lavatory. They go home and soon Foxy has paired off with Eugen, the languid, vulpine son of a factory owner.Foxy is brash, violent, warmhearted and naive. At first he dominates, or seems to, but Eugen, with his world of wealth and savior-faire, gradually tames him. In fact Eugen's world is rotting away  image of capitalism  the family factory is broke, and Foxy is the golden goose to be plucked.And he is plucked, painfully, relentlessly, in unsparing humiliation. Inevitably, the degradation is heightened by the style if not the fact of the homosexual setting. Mr. Fassbinder may not be explicit about it, but he has adjusted the emotional tone of his film to use homosexuality as a symbol of decadence. His characters mince, leer, flirt and favor pink.It is a ""Blue Angel"" done in drag, and its political message hardly redeems it. As a performer, in the part of Foxy, Mr. Fassbinder creates a character of some charm, dignity and originality. He struggles in the elegant, seamless shroud devised for him by Fassbinder the author and Fassbinder the director, and it is hardly surprising that he succumbs.",1975-09-27T05:00:00+0000

This would include the neorealist ""La Terra Trema"" and ""Rocco and His Brothers,"" as well as the elegant ""The Leopard"" and even the wildly operatic ""The Damned.""""Conversation Piece"" is a disaster, the kind that prompts giggles from victims in the audience who, willingly, sit through it all feeling as if they were drowning in three inches of water.The movie was shown in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. The 19 remaining selections of this year's festival will be screened at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall during the next two weeks.""Conversation Piece"" continues to explore concerns that occupied Mr. Visconti in both ""The Leopard"" and in his later, much less successfull screen adaptation of ""Death in Venice."" The barbarians, the forces that represent social and political change and that acknowledge their physical passions, are attacking a citadel of the intellect, a place where reason has reigned at the cost of any possibility of love or commitment. It's one of Mr. Visconti's more dubious propositions that a person of taste and intelligence must always sleep alone in sterile splendor.In ""Conversation Piece"" the citadel is the handsome old Roman palazzo owned by the Professor (Burt Lancaster), an aging, American-born, Roman-bred art historian who devotes his life to his books, his paintings by Old Masters, and his stereo recordings of Mozart. His life is turned upside down when his house is invaded by the real world as represented by a rich, pushy, overdressed marquesa, played by Silvana Mangano, the wife of a Fascist industrialist, her teen-age daughter (Claudia Marsani), her young German lover (Helmut Berger) and her daughter's lover (Stefano Patrizi).The members of this rampaging horde of four are supposedly so vital and so fascinating that they are able to persuade the Professor to lease to them his upstairs apartment for a year, though to anyone watching the movie they seem less interesting than a group of ordinary, run-of-the-play dress extras. Part of it has to do with what they say and the way we hear it.The screenplay is by Mr. Visconti and his longtime associates, Suso Cecchi D'Amico and Enrico Medioli and is said to be based on ""an idea"" by Mr. Medioli, which may well have once been a one-set play, the kind that has carefully timed entrances and exits and makes frequent use of the telephone to pass on information to us, if not people offscreen.I suspect the screenplay was originally written in Italian, though the version shown last night is in English, with some of the actors (Mr. Lancaster, Miss Mangano and Mr. Berger, most likely) having post-synchronized their own lines in English, while other voices have supplied the English dialogue for the remaining characters. The result is a soundtrack that is not only lifeless but also often impossible to understand.But then it is even worse when you can understand it. ""Conversation Piece"" is a movie made up of one part chit-chat (""May I use your telephone?""), one part unwanted confessions (""I threw myself into the student movement  deeper than most"") and one part lumpy aphorisms (""The way of progress is destruction"").As in bad plays, everyone always means exactly what he says and never has to think a second before saying it. There is no feeling for the complexity of the mental processes, for the mysterious ways in which the mind works. This, of course, wouldn't be bad if these people had the wit and insight of George Bernard Shaw characters, but they don't.As the invaders ultimately destroy the old professor, they also are the undoing of the German gigolo who, we are asked to believe, was once politically committed until ravaged by the bourgeoisie. Possibly some other actor could have handled this part, but Mr. Berger (who played the title role in Mr. Visconti's ""Ludwig""), is such a lightweight he can function no more than as an ideogram for decadence.Miss Mangano is grotesque in a grotesque role, while Miss Marsani, as her daughter, acts as if she'd seen too many ""Gidget"" movies.Mr. Lancaster, fine old profassional that he is, is awful, adopting that humble, ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" manner he uses when employed in what he apparently thinks is serious movie-making. ""Conversation Piece"" is the kind of fatuous film that the professionally pragmatic Burt Lancaster, the action movie hero, would snort at and leave in the middle of.",1975-09-27T05:00:00+0000

us,'Grey Gardens' Visits Recluses on L.I.,"Set a movie camera down in a jungle clearing: Life is stood on end. The children caper and gesticulate or simply gape; the adults, a few paces back, pay wholehearted attention or self-consciously pay none. There is authenticity, but there is also incitement. Part of what the camera sees it has created.Something like this happens in ""Grey Gardens,"" where the camera has been placed not in a backland settlement but in the decayed East Hampton, L. I., mansion of two lovely and tormented recluses. They are Edith Bouvier Beale, somewhere around 80, and her daughter Edie, in her mid-50's. They are the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Onassis.The two hidden and disabled lives, who have fashioned a littered, cat-infested carapace the same shape as themselves around themselves, are brought out for scrutiny by Albert and David Maysles, makers of some distinguished American documentaries.The cycle of attachment and tension, the cramped routines in the large, crumbling house, the regular scratching and salving of each other's psychic wounds: all these elements of a two-part relationship are made triangular. The camera is there, the Maysles stand behind it, and the effect is like that upon moths in a dark room when a light is switched on outside. They are instantly at the window, fluttering their wings.The stories of the two women come only blurrily to view in the film's 94 minutes of argument, reminiscence and halting, shifting monologues, which often go on simultaneously.Mrs. Beale, who is bent and feeblethe camera is unsparing of her old sagging flesh, draped in a sort of towelis witty, fierce and the center of the household. She was once a great society beauty, was divorced when Edie was a child, fell ill and some 25 years ago brought Edie back to stay with her.Edie, who still has considerable beauty, seems the more deeply disturbed. She dresses in a strange costume that exposes most of her legs in black open-work stockings, keeps her head constantly covered with a tight hood and dances and sings disjointedly. She complains, sometimes confidentially to the camera, sometimes in brawling arguements, that her mother has chained her, driven away her lovers, ruined her life.Mrs. Beale rejoins that if Edie has stayed it was because she really didn't want to do anything else. ""You never fell for a man,"" she says. ""France fell, but Edie didn't fall."" But at another point, something else breaks through: ""I didn't want that child taken away. I'd be entirely alone.""The camera picks up relentlessly the litter of the house, the cats and raccoons nesting, the motionless world where two women sprawl side by side on beds, eating ice cream and liver paste, singing, posturing, bickering.And continually addressing the camera or rather, the microphone. They use it as a judge, an ally against each other and, in the case of Edie, as something more. ""Darling David, where have you been all my life? Where have you been?"" she calls out as she finishes a painful drum majorette routine. ""All I needed was this man, David. DavidI wish I'd had David and Al with me before this.""And all that comes back in response to this extraordinary unfolding by the two recluses is a quick view in the mirror of the Maysle's brothers, one at work on the camera, the other on the microphone. Or an occasional, perfunctory snatch of an answer delivered in the tone a doctor uses with a half-anesthetized patient.There is no doubt about the artistry and devotion that the Maysles have used in recording the life in ""Grey Gardens."" There is no reason to doubt them when they say they love and admire the Beales. But the moviegoer will still feel like an exploiter. To watch ""Grey Gardens"" is to take part in a kind of carnival of attention with two willing but vulnerable people who had established themselves, for better or worse, in the habit of not being looked at. And what happens when the carnival moves on?",1975-09-27T05:00:00+0000

Or is it the other way around?This is the beginning of Mr. Welles's latest film, ""F for Fake,"" a charming, witty meditation upon fakery, forgery, swindling and art, a movie that may itself be its own Exhibit A.The opening sequence is set in a fine old European railroad station, the kind with a peaked glass roof that romantics cherish, that Mr. Welles used in ""The Trial"" and that urban renewal people tear down. On a colder, snowy day, Anna Karenina might throw herself under some wheels here, but now it's sunny and warm. The mood is cheerfully skeptical.Mr. Welles, the master of ceremonies, the credited director and writer as well as star of ""F for Fake,"" welcomes us with some sleight of hand, turning a small boy's key into a coin and back again. ""The key,"" says the charlatan, ""is not symbolic of anything."" The warnings keep coming, and you may be reminded of the late Old Gold slogan: ""It's fun to be fooled, but more fun to know."" Perhaps sometimes.""F for Fake"" is a documentary compounded of tricks, reversals, interviews with real forgers and re-creations of events that never happened. It's as much magic show as movie, a lark that is great fun even when one wishes the magician would take off his black slouch hat and his magician's cape and get back to making real movies. But did he really make this one? And is ""F for Fake"" not a real movie?There are amused rumors to the effect that Mr. Welles did not actually direct a large part of ""F for Fake."" This part is an extended sequence set in Ibiza involving interviews with Elmyr de Hory, the well-publicized art forger, and Clifford Irving, who wrote Mr. de Hory's biography (""Fake"") and later went on to make his own name by attaching it to Howard Hughes's.The rumors are that these scenes were shot by Franois Reichenbach, one of the first practitioners of cinma vrit, who himself shows up throughout ""F for Fake,"" for which he receives credit as the production coordinator. ""F for Fake"" is so stylish in all its parts, in its editing and particularly in a final fiction sequence that, if it is a fake, it's a marvelous one, and to hell with the signature on it.Which is one of the things that ""F for Fake"" is all about. Midway through the film, after we've listened to stories that may or may not be true about Mr. de Hory's sucess in supplying the art world with fake Matisses, Picassos and Modiglianis, Mr. Welles reminds us that there are no signatures on the cathedral at Chartres. Chartres needs no ""experts"" to authenticate its grandeur, he says. ""Experts"" are the villans of ""F for Fake""people who must tell us whether we should swoon when looking at a particular painting or turn up our noses in disgust.Mr. Welles, who has been the subject of a lot of such expertise and takes a dim view of it, has a grand time with the film's final. This is the fanciful story of how Picasso was tricked by a ravishing Hungarian model, whose grandfather, an art forger, confesses on his deathbed to a furious Picasso that his dearest desire has always been to create ""an entirely new Picasso period.""I have some minor reservations about ""F for Fake."" I don't share Mr. Welles's affection for either Mr. de Hory or Mr. Irving. Unlike the generous Mr. Welles, they are small potatoes. When Mr. Welles asks, ""Doesn't it say something about our time that Cliff [Irving] could only make it through trickery?,"" my answer is no. It says more about Mr. Irving, who as far as I can tell, hasn't made it at all.",1975-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Herzog's 'Every Man for Himself' Is Stunning Fable Full of Universals',"The early tenor aria from ""The Magic Flute"" arches in a high arrow's trajectory over the opening shots: a boat moves on a blue river, a washerwoman on the bank looks up and regards us solemnly, and wind pushes the marsh grass in heavy waves.It is impossible to know why these things move us, or why they prepare us for an experience out of the ordinary. Throughout ""Every Man for Himself and God Against All"" there are moments when we drift a bit outside of ourselves, in a kind of detached gratefulness that the person occupying our seat is being given so much.Werner Herzog is a young German director with a rapidly growing reputation in Europe and, as yet, not much of a name here. ""Every Man for Himself,"" which won this year's Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, should change that.Mr. Herzog does not deal with small corners of reality; he riddles with universals. Like Ingmar Bergman, his concerns are more mtaphysical than social, and again like Mr. Bergman, he explores them in ways that keep engaging our imagination, our intellect and our emotions.His pictures are populated with freaks and deformities or people in freakish or deformed circumstances. Not, at least in his latest films, in order to dwell on these extremeshe is in no way exoticbut to focus on the main human condition, as a man might climb to the foothills at the edge of a city to see the city better.""Every Man"" is set on a real historical incident. In the early 19th-century a man appeared in a square in Nuremberg. He could not speak, he could barely stand, he had apparently been kept in some kind of dungeon. His identity was a mysterythe only clue was a paper he carried that gave his name as Kasper Hauser and asked that he be taken into service as a soldier.He was taken in, taught to speak, to read and write, and then, in a fashion as mysterious as his first appearance, he was murdered.This is Mr. Herzog's fable, allowing both a concrete and a philosophical exercise of the questions: Where do we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go?A sound fable is not enough for a sound movie: ""Every Man"" is a superb movie because Mr. Herzog has managed to treat the fable in stunning human and dramatic terms. He has done so, in large part, through his use of a man identified only as Bruno S.he is not a professional actor, and he has spent some time in mental institutionsas Kasper.There is more than acting; there is a total, magical immersion of Bruno in the man who arrives in the world as a stranger, takes it in, tries to grasp it, judges it and is removed from it.Kasper is seen first in his dungeon, grunting and playing with his only possession, a wooden horse. His keeper, a man in blackMr. Herzog conceives God as a secret policeman  appears, jams boots on his legs, which are as soft and white as maggots, and carries him to the town square at dawn.The world discovers Kasper and Kasper discovers the world. Nothing very dramatic happens until the end: The film is mostly a gentle, meditative and poignant discourse. The authorities send a tiny owl of a notary around after Kasper to record his actions and pronouncements, beautifully played by Walter Ladengast.Kasper's extraordinary face, his eyes strained wide to see better, his whole posture suggesting a man trying to swallow, trying to grasp a world of strangeness, is the film's central image.As he learns to speak, he learns to think. He wants to accept society but he cannot. ""Every man is a wolf to me,"" he tells the professor, haltingly. His only struggle is to search for his own meaning: He has no ego. ""Nothing lives less in me than my life,"" he says.Scholars come to question him: he baffles and holds them off. He is trying to understand life, not the rules of life. He strains and strains; he dreams the beginning of a dream that may have the meaning he is looking for, but he can't manage to dream an ending.The man in black reappears""Wait here for me,"" he had instructed Kasper when he left him on the squareand strikes him down. Kasper dies, recounting the first half of his dream, an autopsy finds that his brain is deformed.The notary society's representative, emerges, writing in his book. ""We have found an explanation for this strange man; we cannot find a better one,"" he says with deep satisfaction. As he walks up the street and this beautiful cryptic and satisfying movie ends, we see that he is limping: He too is deformed.",1975-09-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Malle's 'Black Moon',"The time is early morning, midsummer. A fat badger noses its way across the macadam surface of an otherwise deserted two-lane highway. What would so fascinate a badger on the surface of a highway? The trail of a lost friend? The scent of an old hot dog? In the distance we hear a chorus of crickets and, close up, the sniffing of the badger.All is serene until a car appears in the distance. The self-absorbed animal pays no attention. It continues to sniff, to consider and to move a few more inches on. You know what's going to happen. It does, swiftly, with a small thud. The animal is squashed. The car swerves to a halt and a pretty young woman with blond, Alice-in-Wonderland hair alights. She looks at the body, but there isn't much one can do. She gets back into the car and races off.At this point, the beginning of Louis Malle's vivid fable of a film, ""Black Moon,"" the girl suggests Lewis Carroll's Alice going down the rabbit hole in a sports car, falling into another dimension of experience. It's a world where, like Alice and sometimes like Goldilocks, she is successively ignored, threatened, bullied and laughed at, while she tries stoically to make order of things and only occasionally loses her temper.""Black Moon"" will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall tonight at 9:30 o'clock and again on Thursday at 6:15 P.M.It's an uncharacteristically eccentric film to come from Mr. Malle. His best movies""Le Feu Follet,"" ""Murmur of the Heart."" ""Lacombe, Lucien"" and the documentary ""Humain, Trop Humain""have, by the simplicity and precision of the film-maker's style, transformed the banalities of the real world into poetic visions. ""Black Moon"" is a poetic vision made to look so absolutely literal one doesn't question the validity of the images.Alice/Goldilocks (the character's name is actually Lily) is running away from a ferocious, all-out war between men and women. We first hear the sounds of battle on the highway. Further on, the girl witnesses the execution of a dozen women soldiers by a male patrol. As she continues to flee, she comes across the body of an old shepherd hanging from a tree above his flock.Finally she finds uncertain sanctuary in a handsome old farmhouse occupied by a batty, bedridden old woman who converses on a two-way radio across time (""What's that you say? Priam's dead? What about Helen?""), her mute son and her nonmute but equally enigmatic daughter.The movie evokes the dream state without once resorting to the use of fuzzy filters, slow-motion photography or even lap dissolves. We see everything with the clarity with which Lily observes it, though, unlike Lily, our tendency is to interpret what we see rather than simply to accept it. If one can accept the images in this way, the movie has a liberating effect. If not, it's a diagramless crossword puzzle.I'm not sure it's ever possible to respond to anything as literal as a movie composed of recognizable people, animals and objects, and not to wish to interpret the images in some fashion, at least part of the time. Thus, Lily's flight to me, seems to be out of a world of accepted, natural disorder (war) into a state where no laws yet apply, at least none that she understands. At the end it's as if she were at the beginning of comprehension and a new order.""Black Moon"" is baffling and beautiful and occasionally very funny. The cast includes a rather testy unicorn who can quote Lady Maceth and a large rat named Humphrey who talks in an unknown language to the old lady. There are flowers that moan when Lily lies on them and the recurring image of small naked children herding pigs. When Lily listens to a slug as it crawls over a log, it sounds as if a defeated army were making its way over a mountain.""Black Moon"" is dazzling to look at, for which Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer, is partly responsible. The cast includes Cathryn Harrison, who is Rex Harrison's granddaughter, as Lily, Joe Dallesandro (the mute son), Alexandra Stewart, (the daughter) and the late Theresa Giehse, to whom Mr. Malle dedicates the film, as the old lady. There is an order to this film, but we must supply it, each according to his needs.",1975-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Visually, it is erratic, with moments of great force and others of considerable silliness. Dramatically, it is weightless. Politically, it is schizophrenic. The libertarian points made in the first hour, when the Electra legend is retold, are lopped off in a mushy 15-minute coda that has the effect of an ideological sales tax.With a muddy plain, and horsemen wheeling and maneuvering in the background, Mr. Jancso produces a stripped-down ""Electra,"" in the sense that there is virtually no scenery besides the plain itself and a brick barn, and virtually no props. Also in the sense that many of the figures who mime the chorus wear no clothes.Electra, played with windblown fierceness but not much effect by Mari Torocsik, is held in unwilling subjection by Aegisthus, who has killed her father, Agamemnon. She strides about reproaching Aegisthus for his bloody rule and warning him that her brother, Orestes, will come and kill him.Aegisthus, whose portrayal by Jozsef Madaras is the one dramatic strength of the film, speaks of the need of rulers to be harsh, asserts that people live better under fear and blames Agamemnon for confusing his subjects by giving them freedom.Perhaps the boldest bit of political satire, in a film made under Hungarian state auspices, comes in the scene of a feast day when Aegisthus's subjects, normally herded about by black-garbed men with whips, are entitled to speak freely.""My wife bore me three sons this year,"" one man says.""Money was worth twice as much ""this year,"" says another.""This year I had good dream,"" says a third.Mr. Jancso brings tragic tension to several confrontation scenes: the first between the prisoner Electra and the tyrant Aegisthus; the second between Orestes and the tyrant he has overthrown. In each case the dialogue proceeds while the weaker person advances instead of retreating, and the stronger one retreats instead of advancing. It is a bold reversal, and works brilliantly.Orestes shoots Aegisthus with a pistol, and he and Electra walk off. It would be kind to suppose that Mr. Jansco has walked off too. In any event, somebody left the camera running for another quarter of an hour.Orestes and Electra shoot each other, fall dead, get up again, climb into a red helicopter. This hovers overhead while a voice tells about a firebird that gives the working classes strength and hope. The movie peters on out with masses of people dancing and the voice droning such phrases as: ""Tomorrow is a new day,"" ""A new world starts at last"" and ""Perhaps this, our great creed, shall someday be realized.""It is as if somebody had poured a great deal of water into a small and never very robust soup.",1975-09-30T05:00:00+0000
