us,A Leg Up on Running Injuries,"As the rush of fall road-running races nears, one challenge is to reach the starting line without first joining the large majority of runners -- as many as 80 percent -- who suffer a leg injury each year. A review of injury studies about lower-body injuries among runners, published in the current issue of The British Journal of Sports Medicine, provides some explanation for what causes so many injuries. It might not be everything youd expect. Those most likely to be injured, the review found, include people whove been injured before; are too obsessive, running for a year or more without a break; or are men taller than 5-foot-6. (No study in the review looked at the issue of women's height.) Runners with a relatively high body mass appear to somehow avoid foot injury -- perhaps, the authors speculated, because Clydesdales, in general, run less. Surprisingly, some factors didnt contribute to injury risk, including having legs of different length, using alcohol, or running after dark, when people may be more prone to misstep. The one element that was found to prevent running injuries most consistently was increasing mileage gradually, to a maximum of about 40 miles per week. ",2007-08-02T04:00:00+0000

After the installation was mentioned in an article published in The International Herald Tribune on July 20 (and in The New York Times on July 25) Mr. Mortara wrote to the National Arts Council in Singapore to declare that Ms. Lus work, identified by the title X, above, was a substantively direct copy of a copyrighted piece that he created in 2002 and called Memories Revisited. In it he used ink to write memories from his life on pieces of toilet paper before burning them over a candle. In X Ms. Lu wrote the names of former friends, colleagues and lovers on toilet paper using apple juice so that the names would appear briefly when exposed to the heat of the candle. Mr. Mortara said a coincidence was impossible, because he and Ms. Lu knew each other and they had performed on the same night at a show in San Francisco in 2003. After questioning by Heman Chong, curator of the Singapore show, Ms. Lu said that she had been inspired by Mr. Mortaras work and that she and he had agreed to retitle her installation X (After Memories Revisited by Jason Mortara) and to share the small grant she had received for her work. She said: It had not occurred to me before this that Mr. Mortara would consider X a copyright infringement of his work, as artists often influence each other, but I saw it as a grave insensitivity and carelessness on my part.

us,O. J. Simpson Blames His Ghost," O. J. Simpson has distanced himself from the description of the 1994 slaying of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman in his aborted book If I Did It, Reuters reported. In an interview streamed live on Tuesday by the Web site Market News First (www.MN1.com) Mr. Simpson, who was acquitted of criminal charges in the case but found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial, said the book was composed by an unidentified ghostwriter and that he reluctantly assented to a chapter about the night of the crime as told by him only after the publishers agreed to label it hypothetical. Mr. Simpson said he allowed the author to ask him questions, but was otherwise passive in describing the killings. I read what he wrote, and I saw all of these major holes, all of these impossible things, Mr. Simpson said. All of these other parts of the book I would correct, but I told myself, If I correct this, there are going to be people out there that say, Oh, look how accurate this is,  Right? Rights to the book, dropped by HarperCollins after a public outcry, have been awarded to the Goldman family in payment of the multimillion-dollar civil judgment against Mr. Simpson. He criticized them, The Associated Press reported, saying, I find it sort of hypocritical that they talked everybody in America to boycott the book: it was immoral, it was blood money. But now we see it wasnt blood money if they got the money. David Cook, a lawyer for the Goldman family, said: Mr. Simpson himself has placed us in this horrific setting of seeking to liquidate this asset.

The workers failed to cover up the electrified third rail or set up warning lights, and a supervisor who had promised to act as a flagman, watching for trains, left his post.

Lawsuit,"A federal judge has ruled in favor of the C.I.A. in its effort to prohibit the former agent Valerie Plame Wilson from disclosing the dates she worked for the agency in her coming book, Publishers Weekly reported yesterday. Ms. Wilson, along with her publisher, Simon & Schuster, filed a lawsuit in late May in New York seeking to stop the C.I.A. from interfering with publication of the book, Fair Game, right. In their suit they argued that since the dates of Ms. Wilsons C.I.A. service have been made public, she should be able to use them in her memoir. But Judge Barbara Jones ruled that the dates were never declassified, and said that a letter from the C.I.A., which neither Ms. Wilson nor her publisher has seen, convinced her that there were national security reasons for keeping the dates out of the book. A spokesman for the publisher said that it was disappointed in the courts ruling, which we believe runs counter to the First Amendment, sets a dangerous precedent and creates an unreasonable standard by which the government can disappear public information and rewrite history. He added that no decision had been made about whether to appeal the ruling, but that Simon & Schuster still expected to release the book this fall.",2007-08-04T04:00:00+0000

us,The Van Gogh That Wasnt,"Experts have determined that Head of a Man, a painting attributed to van Gogh for more than 70 years, is a fake, probably painted by one of van Goghs peers, The Associated Press reported yesterday. Gerard Vaughan, the director of the National Gallery of Victoria, in Australia, said that a team at the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam had found that the painting differed stylistically from the artists other works and was mostly likely painted by one of his contemporaries. The painting was taken to Australia in 1939 by Keith Murdoch, father of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The museum bought it in 1940 for about $3,500. It was purchased as a van Gogh work, and had been accepted as a van Gogh for more than a decade before the purchase, Mr. Vaughan said in a statement. The paintings authenticity was first called into question last August, when it was on display at the Dean Gallery in Edinburgh. Critics said the work, dated 1886, was of a different style than other van Gogh paintings of the same period and was not mentioned in any of the artists letters. When the Edinburgh show closed, the National Gallery of Victoria sent the painting to the van Gogh Museum for analysis. It is very important to make the point that its not a forgery, Mr. Vaughan told reporters. There is no evidence to suggest that someone produced this picture ... to pass it off as a work by van Gogh. When it was thought to be a van Gogh, the painting had been valued at about $21 million.",2007-08-04T04:00:00+0000

The circle of women in this sprightly and eager-to-please novel  an artist, a writer, a hostess of sex-toy parties and a pair of twins who own a bookstore  are wise and worldly, enjoying the gentrification campaign that has given them their own ersatz Manhattan. Ashley, a writer of sexy novels that dont sell very well, conducts erotica-writing workshops and fights valiantly against the genres clichs, forbidding any characters mouth from forming into a perfect O of pleasure or surprise or delight, or into an O of anything, for that matter. With her best friends  Viv, the artist, and Deedee, who has found great success selling, Tupperware-style, what used to be called marital aids  Ashley has made her little slice of redeveloped downtown Omaha into a swanky scene that meets chick lits exacting locational criteria. But its setting aside, can a novel still be called chick lit if (a) its written by a guy, and (b) most of the chicks in question are in their late 30s to early 40s and not especially interested in shoes?

There are a few billionaires, working hard to give their wealth away, and there are even some Christian evangelicals, who have decided the earth is not theirs to trash, but the movement is mostly about shared beliefs, even if those beliefs are unproclaimed.

They vowed to pass a local ordinance that would penalize landlords that rented to illegal aliens and businesses that hired them. They also pledged to make English the official language of the village, which would mean discontinuing the practice of printing various notices  including building-code violations and the monthly newsletter  in both English and Spanish. The third candidate on their slate also won, giving them a majority on the board. Sigwalt and Humpfer considered their election a mandate. Indeed, many in this village consider them heroes.

us,Up Front,"Michael Beschloss, who not long ago was named the official presidential historian of NBC News, became interested in American presidents at the age of 8, when his parents took him to visit the Abraham Lincoln house in Springfield, Ill. From that moment on, he wrote in an e-mail message, Lincoln was the man for me. Soon after, it dawned on me that one could write history books on presidents as a profession. Beschloss has gone on to write about Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. His latest book, Presidential Courage, recently spent nine weeks on the best-seller list. Asked how George W. Bush fits his idea of presidential courage, Beschloss observed: Bush partisans will insist that the president was brave to go to war in Iraq because the outcome of his presidency would depend on whether or not America won. But presidential courage  as I define it in the book  is when a president risks his popularity for an important cause for which Americans of the future are grateful. At the moment, its sadly hard to imagine that future Americans will feel that way about the Iraq war. ",2007-08-05T04:00:00+0000

Not surprisingly, given that he opened doors for future black filmmakers and collaborated with important figures like Paul Robeson and the novelist Charles Chesnutt, a whole scholarly industry has grown up around Micheaux. Now Patrick McGilligan, biographer of Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and George Cukor, has synthesized the advance work of these scholars and written Oscar Micheaux, a popular life of this colorful figure.

The Septembers of Shiraz, poignant once youve read this first novel by Dalia Sofer, is, on its own, a title at once overly poetic and misleading. An American reader might be forgiven for thinking Sofer has written a romance set in the Napa Valley, Sideways with Vaseline on the lens. And that would be a great shame because The Septembers of Shiraz is a remarkable debut: the richly evocative, powerfully affecting depiction of a prosperous Jewish family in Tehran shortly after the revolution.

With all the zeal of a Baptist preacher's, a young boy's amplified voice shrieked repeatedly in Arabic, ""There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his witness!"" and a shrill chorus of his schoolmates howled the words back at him. I got out of bed and went to the window - at 7:00 a.m. the glass was already warm as an infant's forehead - and discovered that during the night many colorful cloth banners had been strung above the corniche, Luxor's Nilefront boulevard. In hand-fashioned Arabic characters, the banners read, ""Welcome Mister President of the Government, Muhammad Hosni Mubarak, the Leader of Our Victorious and Progressive Destiny."" Scores of teenage Egyptian soldiers in black uniforms, woolen berets, and white plastic spats lined the avenue in the ninety-eight-degree heat, more or less at attention, rifles at their sides, evidently awaiting the president's arrival. Profiting from a police barricade, the usually hectic street was, for once, mercifully quiet.

Simpsons accounts of its creation and content, including the hypothetical description of the slaying of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, Reuters reported. The ghostwriter, Pablo Fenjves, disputed Mr. Simpsons characterization of himself as a mostly passive participant in the composition of the chapter that depicts him holding a bloody knife at the scene of the crime. The whole book, the whole idea for a book, originated with O. J. Simpson and a couple of his handlers, Mr. Fenjves said. O. J. read the book, his book, several times. I made every change he asked for, and he signed off on it. In an Internet interview last week Mr. Simpson said he had been approached by publishers at HarperCollins about doing the book and had reluctantly consented to a chapter about the night of the crime as told by him only after they had agreed to label it hypothetical. Mr. Fenjves said: I find it completely unnecessary to defend myself against this man. All I can say is that if there are errors in the book, its because O. J. didnt correct them, or worse, he fed them to me. Amid public outrage, publication of the book was canceled last year.

The painting was found below the paint surface of van Goghs Ravine, owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The news, announced by that museum and the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, came as the National Gallery of Victoria, in Australia, was reporting that a team at the Van Gogh Museum had determined that Head of Man, attributed to van Gogh for more than 70 years, was probably executed by one of his peers. The painting beneath Ravine was discovered during a technical examination by Meta Chavannes, a Museum of Fine Arts conservator. It was most likely painted in June 1889, when van Gogh was at the asylum of St.-Paul-de-Mausole and was reused as a support for Ravine a few months later. Louis van Tilborgh, the van Gogh research curator at the Van Gogh Museum, related it to Wild Vegetation, a drawing van Gogh sent his brother Theo in mid-1889. Scholars have suggested that the drawing was one of about a dozen copies of paintings that van Gogh sent to Theo at that time, but until now, no one was aware of a painting upon which this drawing could have been based.",2007-08-06T04:00:00+0000

Mr. Jamous, 62, has been confined to a United Nations hospital in Kordofan, east of Darfur, where he was moved by the United Nations without permission last year. He is in need of a stomach biopsy, which cannot be performed there. The government, based in Khartoum, has said he will be arrested if he leaves, but has declared itself open to discussing his release. In a letter to President Omar Hassan al-Bashir  of Sudan, posted yesterday on her blog at www.miafarrow.org, Ms. Farrow, who is also a Unicef goodwill ambassador, wrote: At the Inter-Sudanese talks in Abuja in 2005, before his seizure, Mr. Jamous played a crucial role in bringing the S.L.A. to the negotiating table and in seeking reconciliation between its divided rival factions. She said, I am therefore offering to take Mr. Jamouss place, to exchange my freedom for his in the knowledge of his importance to the civilians of Darfur and in the conviction that he will apply his energies toward creating the just and lasting peace that the Sudanese people deserve and hope for.

The museum said that Louis Vuitton would pay for the construction and staff of the 1,000-square-foot boutique, and that no revenues from its sales would go to the museum, which receives some public financing.

us,A Pastor Finds a Way to Serve Two Disparate Flocks,"CAMPBELLSPORT, WIS. The brick church, more than a century old, stands at the junction of two county roads tracing the glacial hills of southeastern Wisconsin. In the field across the way, the summer corn stretches eight feet from root to tassel. This being a Sunday morning, the Rev. Daniel Schultz greets the faithful on the front steps as they arrive for 9 a.m. worship at the Salem United Church of Christ. Pastor Dan, as he prefers to be known, is the only man in the congregation wearing a coat and tie. Over the next hour, he leads the 70 worshipers in a round of ""Happy Birthday"" for Jim Maul, a longtime member. He invites a half-dozen children to the pulpit, where he crouches among them to teach them to recite ""The Lord's Prayer."" In the part of the service designated for ""sharing joys and concerns,"" he listens as people rise in the pews to tell of a relative's surgery, a brother's recovery from a liver transplant. Here is ministry at its most venerable, ministry at its most tender and intimate and finely grained. And it comes from a minister with a strikingly unlikely double-life, one part as the small-town preacher in a socially conservative spot of the Midwest, the other as an abrasive and confrontational voice of the religious left in the blogosphere. Exactly one week after Mr. Schultz presided over Sunday worship at his home church here, he gave a sermon in the vast arena of the McCormick Convention Center in Chicago. Instead of the farmers, factory workers and tradesmen who typify his regular congregation, the audience for his denunciation of the Iraq war consisted of the self-proclaimed ""netroots"" attending Yearly Kos, the annual political and media convention organized by the Daily Kos Web site. For three years, Mr. Schultz has supplied the voice of religion for Daily Kos, an epicenter of left-liberal activity with an otherwise fiercely secular bent. In 2004, Mr. Schultz began fielding prayer requests every Sunday night as part of a Daily Kos feature called ""Brothers and Sisters."" A year later, Daily Kos's founder, Markos Moulitsas, let Mr. Schultz spin off a formally connected online community, Street Prophets. In 4.3 million page views since then, Mr. Schultz's readers have found comparatively little balm in Gilead. True to the take-no-prisoners style of blogosphere discourse, Street Prophets traffics more in calumny and condemnation, though with an extremely learned theological intelligence behind it. ""If Conservative Christians are looking for salvation,"" Mr. Schultz wrote in one characteristic post, ""they ought to start looking to save themselves from themselves. They have much to repent for, like the rest of us. But unlike the rest of us, they have a unique level of judgmentalism and separation to get out of their system."" Besides decrying the religious right on issues like gay rights, abortion and intelligent design, Mr. Schultz has also disparaged even seeming allies like Jim Wallis, probably the most prominent liberal among the evangelical Christian clergy. Mr. Schultz has reviled Mr. Wallis's ""patronizing lectures."" Somehow this balancing act seems to work, meeting the needs of two wildly disparate flocks and reconciling Mr. Schultz to himself. As someone who suffers from, and is medicated for, bipolar disorder, Mr. Schultz has, of necessity, become an expert on reckoning with extremes. ""There's a part of me that's been angry since I was a kid,"" Mr. Schultz, 39, said in an interview. ""Part of that is my illness, and part of it is a deep sense that the world isn't the place it was meant to be. I had to find a productive place to put that anger or it would swallow me whole. And part of my spiritual journey has been to claim that anger as spiritual."" In choosing the blogosphere as his pulpit, Mr. Schultz forms part of a trend in which liberal members of the clergy are using the Internet the way Christian conservatives used cable television and talk radio in earlier decades. Diane Winston, a professor of religion and media at the University of Southern California, points to such similar figures online as Mr. Wallis, Rabbi Michael Lerner at Tikkun, the Rev. Tim Simpson at PublicTheologian and Rachel Barenblat at Velveteen Rabbi. ""The blogosphere offers a new way to organize religious people into political communities,"" Ms. Winston wrote in an e-mail message. ""For better or worse, it plays to traditional strengths and weaknesses of progressives."" She continued, ""It's not a political movement like the religious right and there's no inkling it could be. On the other hand, the Web seems the ideal medium for the wide-ranging discussions, coalition-building and open-ended organizing that characterizes the left."" In the more prosaic part of Mr. Schultz's life, Salem United Church of Christ sought him out last year for eminently practical reasons. The congregation had released its previous pastor. Struggling to survive with about 80 active members, the church was limping along with guest preachers on a weekly basis. Mr. Schultz embodied both familiarity and new vigor. He was a ""P.K."" - a preacher's kid - who had grown up in his father's church 80 miles away in Madison. After earning degrees in English and history at the University of Wisconsin, and in the process falling away from religious observance, Mr. Schultz returned to it as he earned a master's degree in divinity from Emory University in Atlanta. He had pastored a church in Georgia and substituted at several congregations in Pennsylvania before being called by Salem. Along the way, Mr. Schultz chose as his theological heroes Reinhold Neibuhr, Martin Buber and Jack Kerouac. What impresses many congregants here far more, though, is the way Mr. Schultz and his wife, Jennifer Milazzo-Schultz, have enacted their faith by taking in two foster children. He has also managed to express his politics without imposing them. ""Over all, we're a fairly conservative congregation, but everybody loves him,"" said Denise Goetsch, a member of the church's governing board. ""Whatever people's personal politics are, they're here because they believe in God. And Dan's been good at making friends with pretty much anybody."" Mr. Schultz's sermon here the week before Yearly Kos offered a prime example of how. Drawing on a passage from I Corinthians, Mr. Schultz preached for social justice while speaking directly to his humble church and its obscure home. ""I believe in the underdog,"" he told the congregation. ""I believe in the lost and the lumpy and the people nobody has ever heard of and the towns that don't quite exist on anybody's maps. I believe that they are where God has chosen to become incarnate."" ",2007-08-11T04:00:00+0000

The man, Arturo Gil, was declared dead shortly after 5 p.m. at the site, the Whale Industrial Terminal Building at 14B 53rd Street in Sunset Park, the police said. The elevator had become stuck between the second and third floors and Mr. Gil was trying to move it, according to relatives, who said his body was caught as the elevator began to move.

No one is certain how many pedicabs are currently in use, but estimates have placed the number as high as 800 to 1,000.The pedicab industry started in the mid-1990s.

Bloomberg seemed poised to sign the bill in March, but at the last minute, he changed his mind, swayed by arguments that the tiny industry should remain relatively unregulated.

The fragile but magnetic father whom Garis adored, and whom she depicts memorably in House of Happy Endings, was at times strangely remote and distracted, even when he managed to speak the right lines. Her pretty young mother, who once wanted to be an opera singer, often locked herself away in her room with migraines, overwhelmed by the difficulties of coping with three children, an emotionally dependent husband and the magnificent turn-of-the-century house they had moved into when they left metropolitan New York in the late 1940s for Amherst, Mass. Even Gariss younger brothers seemed troubled and had difficulties in school. But the Garis children had been brought up to believe that a good person is happy; a happy person is good. For Leslie to admit her family was unhappy would have constituted a flaw in character. Nonetheless, she became a precociously perceptive observer and eavesdropper.

It cant have been Maurice Ravels thrill-seeking behavior that prompted Echenoz to imagine his way into the head of this musical genius. Indeed, given the delicacy with which Echenoz teases out lifes minutiae, perhaps the attraction was precisely Ravels quietly uneventful existence. Leaving the bathtub is sometimes quite annoying, the opening sentence reads. First of all, its a shame to abandon the soapy lukewarm water, where stray hairs wind around bubbles among the scrubbed-off skin cells, for the chill atmosphere of a poorly heated house. Yes, this is what everyday life is like for Maurice, as it might be for any Jean or Pierre  how to get a good heating system, a good nights sleep or good food while on tour in 1920s America. Ravel was a private man, his life never bared before all, and rather than add gratuitous spice, Echenoz puts his enchanting imagination to work exploring the mundane, the curmudgeonly, the quirky: Ravels refusal to perform unless hes wearing his patent-leather shoes (Street shoes with a conductors tails are out of the question); his exhausting struggles with insomnia (he who invariably chases sleep until dawn only to snag just some mediocre cut-rate, secondhand variety); his fondness for machinery and engines (Bolro is described as an orchestral factory without a purpose, a suicide whose weapon is the simple swelling of sound). This beautifully musical little novel, translated by Linda Coverdale, ends in 1937 at Ravels deathbed, where he leaves no will, no image on film, not a single recording of his voice.",2007-08-19T04:00:00+0000

How bad did things get? At one point, I couldnt even listen to country music, Denise told The Tennessean. It was too painful.",2007-08-19T04:00:00+0000

The Goalies Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, Short Letter, Long Farewell, A Moment of True Feeling, even his script for Wim Wenderss monumental Wrong Move, which effectively linked Handke to the lan of German New Wave cinema: the list of revelatory, exciting works of prose went on and on.

His oversight, however, is understandable. While it's easy to detect the role of the eyes, nose, skin, tongue, and ears, the receptors of balance are hidden from view and don't easily give up their secrets.

us,"Um . . . : Slips, Stumbles, and Verbal Blunders, and What They Mean"," If the world of verbal blunders were the night sky, the Reverend William Archibald Spooner of Oxford University could play the role of the North Star. Spooner, who was born in 1844, was famous for verbal blundering so incorrigible that his exploits have been immortalized in poems and songs and, most enduringly, by lending his name to a type of slip of the tongue he was unusually prone to make. In the spoonerism, sounds from two words are exchanged or reversed, resulting in a phrase that is inappropriate for the setting. For Spooner, these embarrassments ranged from wild to mild. Toasting Queen Victoria at dinner, Spooner said, ""Give three cheers for our queer old dean,"" and he greeted a group of farmers as ""noble tons of soil."" There was the time he cautioned young missionaries against having ""a half-warmed fish in their hearts."" He described Cambridge in the winter as ""a bloody meek place."" Once Spooner berated a student for ""fighting a liar in the quadrangle."" ""You have hissed all my mystery lectures,"" he reportedly said. ""In fact, you have tasted two whole worms and you must leave Oxford this afternoon by the next town drain."" A spoonerism can also involve the reversal of two words, as in ""Courage to blow the bears of life,"" or, when saying good-bye to someone, ""Must you stay, can't you go?"" ",2007-08-19T07:47:00+0000

So it was that on a December night in 1991 the fifth generation of the Rockefeller family-counting from John D. Rockefeller Sr. and his wife, Laura Celestia (""Cettie"") Spelman Rockefeller, for whom the house had been built-gathered in the dining room of Kykuit for a farewell dinner. ""It was an extraordinary evening where everyone reminisced about their childhood experiences on the estate,"" remarked one person afterward. Someone else recalled walking through the house and gardens, ""just thinking how sad it was that it was changing. It was the end. It wasn't going to be a family house anymore. It was going to be a public place."" ",2007-08-19T07:47:00+0000

More PhotosThousands of spectators turned out for the festivities surrounding the 57th Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance on the Monterey Peninsula of California, where some of the rarest vehicles in the world were on display and in competition. Judging at the event included 24 classes, from antiques (pre-1916) through post-World War II sports cars, with special categories for Aston Martins and models from the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg group.   The Best of Show award went to a 1935 Duesenberg SJ Special owned by Harry Yeaggy of Cincinatti. Nicknamed The Mormon Meteor, the car was once raced by Ab Jenkins, who used it to set a 24-hour land speed record in 1935. Readers can see more images of the SJ, as well as some of the other vehicles on display, in this photo gallery. Full judging results can be viewed here.  Classic-car auctions attract much of the attention during Pebble Beach week. A sale run by Gooding & Company featured a set of first-series Rolls-Royce Silver Ghosts as well as a steam-powered vehicle from 1884, known as La Marquise, which is thought to be the world's oldest functioning automobile. La Marquise sold for $3,520,000 including the buyer's premium, well above the pre-auction estimate of just over $1.5 million. Full results from Gooding & Company are available here. La Marquise was featured in an article in Sunday's Times, as were the Rolls-Royces. RM Auctions also held a sale nearby, in Monterey. Results from that auction are available here.

The calmer intervals appear to last 1,500 to 2,000 years, they said.

The high winds prevented firefighting planes from taking off, news accounts said, leaving just ground forces to fight the fires. The emergency brought an appeal by the government for urgent help from other European Union countries. News reports said some of the victims had been trapped by flames near their homes and in their cars as they tried to flee. Tourists were also reported to be among the dead.

And it was true: New Orleanians found pleasure even in oblivion. But in their blindness to certain threats, they could not have been more typically American.

A self-described aimless, melancholic, bumptious freelance writer, he shirks fashionable topics, even if they might bring in a buck. In the engaging title piece of this slim, occasionally stuffy volume, Krystal makes a vigorous case for the virtues of old-fashioned literary criticism, twitting the navel gazers of creative nonfiction, which he dismisses as just a fancy word for memoir: Writing interestingly about Jane Austen requires more imagination than confessing to having slept with someone named Jane Austen from Beaumont, Texas. Krystal ranges widely, taking on subjects ranging from the typewriter to boxing, and hes not afraid of weighty topics: he slogs through the notebooks of Paul Valry, ponders different theories of beauty and offers a defense of the seven deadly sins. (On the whole, he writes, it helps to have sin around; its like having a set of instructions for building a life that God approves of.) In My Holocaust Problem, Krystal (whose grandparents died in the camps) complains that the profusion of Holocaust books, films and memorials  the pomp and circumstance of remembrance  has trivialized the event. If the argument isnt terribly original, he subtly ponders the obligations of remembrance. In his charming concluding essay, Who Speaks for the Lazy?, Krystal returns to justifying his underachieving ways: Lets face it, some boys and girls become writers because the only workplace theyre willing to visit is the one inside their heads.

I used to hang around the New York Dolls, and they were definitely into those jackets. I remember having one that was black on the outside with red pleats in the back. Eventually, I started noticing lots of women in the music scene doing a West Side Story kind of tough-girl look with motorcycle jackets in different colors.

Why a memoir? I had a lot of theological ideas about myself and about religion and God, and I felt they were getting in the way of my fiction writing, Steinke said. Everybody was in the pulpit. Fiction is so much about paradox and ambiguity  so is religion  but I had all these new exciting ideas getting in the way. A devotee of Augustines Confessions, she thinks memoirs should transcend the pulp-paperback form  I was a sinner and now Ive been saved  yet still engage with ideas of spiritual transformation.

Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover raced to Memphis and took command. Hoover talked railroads into transporting the displaced for free and carrying freight at a discount. He commandeered private outboard motors and built motorboats of plywood. He urged the people who were not yet flooded out, such as the population around the Bayou des Glaises levee, to evacuate early, then rescued with the trains those tens of thousands who had ignored his warning. He helped the Red Cross launch a fund drive; within a month the charity had already collected promises of more than $8 million, an enormous figure for the time. ",2007-08-26T16:49:00+0000

This, it was felt, would both stoke nationalist aspirations and force the British to seriously consider giving up power. In an essay in his journal Young India, Mahatma Gandhi set out how the day should be observed: ""It would be good if the declaration [of independence] is made by whole villages, whole cities even....

At three, she was stricken with polio, and she never had the agility to get in or out of a bathtub.

More Photos  Tucked to one side of Citrons sprawling auto factory in Aulnay-sous-Bois, about 20 minutes outside of Paris, is a gray and mirrored-glass building surrounded by a fringe of green grass. One double-chevron logo adorns the awning of the entrance, but otherwise the structure is nondescript and incredibly reserved, like a warehouse from the future.   This is the Citron Conservatoire, the company's private museum, which houses an extraordinary collection of cars and an example of nearly every car the company has ever produced.  Stepping inside its immediately clear that this is no parts depot. Rally cars, dune buggies, show concepts and elegant DS sedans from the 1950s all sit in orderly rows under high ceilings. A two-passenger helicopter powered by a Wankel rotary engine  developed by Citron and the defunct German manufacturer, NSU  guards the end of a long line of former show cars dating back to the 1970s.   Photos: Inside the Citron Conservatoire  Also included among the hundreds of classic cars are incredibly detailed and carefully organized archives: hand-written sales logs from the 1920s, original design sketches and even blueprints for the first Citron dealerships.  The Conservatoire isn't usually open to the public, though this doesnt mean that the cars in the collection are camera shy. Nearly all of the vehicles are kept in excellent running condition. Many are used on a regular basis, for a wide range of classic car events and publicity campaigns. On rare occasions, the Conservatoire is open to groups, including journalists and Citron clubs from around the world.  I walked down row after row and found a gold-colored mystery machine hidden among the rest of the cars. Built sometime around 2000 -- Citron isnt clear about the exact date -- it was only a foam mock-up, and lacked an engine and interior. Based on the humdrum Citron Xantia sedan, its mini pickup lines were awkward. To be honest, its unremarkable in every way except one: it was a little-known styling exercise for a proposed return to the United States market.   Denis Huile, director of the Conservatoire, pointed out one small clue to the concepts American aspirations. Rather than sitting on Citrons standard Michelin tires, this car wore chunky all-terrain Goodyears. Yet the car never appeared at an auto show and, to the best of Mr. Huiles ample knowledge, was never given an official name. In the end, nothing came of the proposed return to the United States, and the idea faded into obscurity.   But in an automobile museum that really isnt a museum, is it any wonder that the most intriguing car is the one that doesnt even have a name?

us,Botero Gives Abu Ghraib Art to Berkeley,"The Colombian artist Fernando Botero, right, has donated 25 paintings and 22 drawings inspired by the abuse of Iraqis imprisoned at Abu Ghraib to the University of California, Berkeley, Agence France-Presse reported. The gift, valued at $10 million to $15 million, will be housed at the universitys art museum, said Kathleen Maclay, a Berkeley spokeswoman. She said final details of the gift were being worked out. The art, a sharp departure from Mr. Boteros familiar images of corpulent figures, was based on photographs and testimony of the detainees. One painting depicts a prisoner face to face with a snarling dog; others show naked and beaten Iraqis in heaps on cell floors. The art toured Europe in 2005, was displayed at Berkeley this year and is now on view in Milan in a Botero retrospective. Although his works regularly sell at auction for $1 million or $2 million, he has said that this series is not for sale and should have a home in the United States or Baghdad. ...
