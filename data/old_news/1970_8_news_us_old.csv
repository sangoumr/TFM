It needed restoration, but it was there to be restored, said Mrs. Snyder, who paints under her maiden name, Patricia Stegman. (Mr. Snyder is a labor lawyer.) Their main tasks were modernizing the wiring and plumbing, peeling away a houseful of ancient wallpaper and relandscaping the rather oldfashioned backyard. The Snyders were lucky enough to be able to buy some of the house's original furnishings and have added more Victorians to go with them. HOUSE AND GARDEN The Snyder house, framed by old trees, is red brick with green shutters. The railings are black iron. The garden (right), just beyond the kitchen door, serves as their 4yearold son's playground. It is filled with flowering shrubs and plants in pots.

The question has even been raised as to whether the nation might not dispense with a laborious head count every 10 years and substitute the cheaper and actually more reliable sample surveys to keep track of population growth and change. However, only a complete count can provide the detailed knowledge of individual states, counties, cities and smaller areas desired by many users of the census for political, commercial and scientific purposes.

Either way, like planned obsolescence in automobiles, the concern is more for the future than for the present. The nervousness of the question reveals a very 20thcentury obsession by evaluating art beyond the immediate purpose it serves, an evaluation that would have been unknown to, say, Bach. The questionusually posed by the academic middleaged  also implies that art, as a value, is in a precarious situation, that it should last, but probably won't. Meanwhile, certain young people maintain that the lasting ingredient makes no difference. As long as 20 years ago painters were already painting in momentary materials; some of the pictures destroyed in the Museum of Modern Art conflagration in 1958 would have, in any case, disintegrated by now.",1970-08-02T05:00:00+0000
us,Movies:His Happiness Is A Thing Called 'Joe',"THERE he was as big as a Mack truck""Joe""standing on the stoop of his West 79th Street brownstone, dressed entirely in black, his bald pate gleaming under the mid-morning sun. His name is really Peter Boyle, and he's a 34-year-old former Christian Brother from Philadelphia. But it's hard to think of him as anyone but ""Joe"" after seeing his sensational performance as the gun-loving, beer-swilling, tough-talking tool-and-die maker from Queens who hates ""niggers,"" hippies and fags, and not necessarily in that order. Peter is such a good ""Joe,"" in fact, that columnists are already touting him for the 1970 Oscar as best actor. And even those critics who jumped on ""Joe"" raved about Peter's performance.Peter is waiting outside his building, he says, because he doesn't want any stranger to see his sparsely furnished (TV, two chairs, a ""Joe"" poster, a bed) bachelor apartment. So he decides in his rather assertive manner (""I'm really very shy"") that we will walk down Broadway and get some breakfast at a neighborhood greasy spoon. Peter is stopped several times along the way, and it is obvious by his reactions that he loves the recognition. Well, the guy deserves it. It's taken him 10 years of odd jobs, two-bit roles and ""tough guy"" commercials to get it.""Hi, Joe!"" a shaggy-haired youth shouts in passing. ""Loved your movie."" ""Thanks,"" the grinning actor replies, proudly hoisting his slightly pot-bellied, 220-pound frame up to its full 6-feet-2-inches. At 77th and Broadway, where a scene for Woody Allen's new movie, ""Bananas,"" is being filmed, a red-haired woman extra rushes up to Peter and kisses him on the cheek. ""Oh, you were wonderful!"" she squeals. ""Thanks, Naomi."" On the edge of the crowd, a handsome black actor pumps Peter's hand and says, ""Hey, man, do you remember me from that beer commercial in Pittsburgh? You wore my orange sweatshirt."" Peter remembers, and they talk about old times.Peter chooses a coffee shop at 75th and Broadway, and after ordering ham and eggs, he begins talking about the ""incredible timing"" of ""Joe."" At first his tone is matter-of-fact, but as he goes on, it becomes somber, disconsolate.""We finished it last February, and that was way before Kent State or Jackson State or the construction workers beating up on the kids on Wall Street. Mylai had happened, of course, and I think the last scene in ""Joe,"" where the kids are murdered in the commune, may have been inspired by that massacre. But none of us were propheticnone of us knew that the hardhats were going to do what they did on Wall Street. The minute I heard about it, I knew it was going to affect the way the movie was received. I wasn't happy . . . who could be happy about that? If anything, I'm scared. I've been scared for a couple of years. I get scared when I meet people like Joe. And I get scared when I hear that kids are standing up at the end of the movie and yelling. 'I'm going to shoot back, Joe.' In fact, the other night I was walking down 46th Street and I had a flash of myself being shot down in the street, just because someone thought I really was Joe.""Peter pauses for a moment, plucks eight pills in assorted colors of red, white and brown  ""all vitamins,"" he saysfrom his shirt pocket, and gulps them down with orange juice.""The message of the movie is very plain,"" he goes on. ""It says that we'd just better stop that war in Vietnam now; that we'd just better stop killing our children there or we're going to be killing our children in the streets here. The Bible says that if you live by the sword, you die by the sword, and that's what's going to happen.""Politically speaking, Peter says he is probably best described as a ""conservative radical."" ""I got that from Norman Mailer,"" he says, ""and I like it, although I did not support Mailer for Mayor. I did not want to encourage such excesses of megalomania."" Peter traces his ""leftward leanings"" to Chicago in the summer of 1968, when he was acting at Second City at the time the Democratic convention was going on.""One night I was standing peacefully with some friends in front of a bar in Old Town,"" he recalls, ""and some cops started chasing us. An Episcopal clergyman picked us up in his car, and gave us sanctuary in his house. I remember saying, 'My God, I'm in America, and I'm afraid for my life!' I'm always ready for a fight at any time, but quite frankly, I didn't want my face beaten in just then because I had acting jobs. On another night I was just sitting in my apartment on Schiller Street and I was tear-gassed. At first I thought it was a sneeze coming on, so I took a vitamin C tablet. Then I discovered it was tear gas wafting down from Lincoln Park where the kids were getting gassed.""Despite it all, Peter says he is not entirely unsympathetic with ""Joe."" ""He's a man who's really trapped,"" he says. ""He doesn't like his job, his taxes are sky high, and his kids are causing him trouble at home. Sometimes I worry that maybe we were too hard on him. He is lovable in his own way. But then I get to thinking how scary it is that the hardhats are becoming activists, and it reminds me of the brownshirts in Germany during the thirties. The hardhats say they're patriotic, but their unions are the most notoriously racist of all the unions. If that's who's representing patriotism in our country, then we're really in trouble.""Peter wasn't the first choice for ""Joe."" He read for the part three times and was told he was ""marvelousbut too young,"" so an older, more experienced actor was selected. He didn't work out, and Peter was called in after production had begun to take over the role. He was paid a total of $2,520 for six weeks' work.""At the tryouts, I improvised instead of reading the script they gave me,"" he says, ""because I had been hearing that character all my life. In Philly, where I grew up, people all around me were spouting off about 'those damn niggers, and people on welfare, and wops, and kikes.' I did the same type of character at Second City, and I knew the character so well that when it came to the actual shooting of the movie, I was worried that I would do a caricature.""""Joe"" is not his first movie, but it is the first one he has made a splash in. He was an extra in ""The Group,"" and played the man who ran the gun range in ""Medium Cool."" Peanuts, as far as money goes, but he managed to support himself fairly well doing commercials for TWA (he was the baggage handler), Buick (he was a customer) and Instant Replay (he was a baseball catcher who caught ""the best pitcher in baseballTom Seaver""). He has a small part in a group therapy scene in the upcoming ""Diary of a Mad Housewife,"" which he did after ""Joe"" was completed. ""David Gill [""Joe's"" producer] told me I was crazy to do that bit with 'Joe' coming up. I said, 'Look, I don't have any idea what's going to happen to 'Joe.'""Breakfast is over. We walk up Broadway and into Riverside Park, where Peter straddles a park bench. Curly black hair shows beneath his unbuttoned shirt, and he looks so rough, tough and ugly-handsome that he reminds one of Rod Steiger . . . no, Telly Savalas . . . no, the late William Bendix, Or better yet, a mixture of the three, Machismo.It's not surprising, then, that his acting idol is Marlon Brando. ""He's the best,"" Peter declares. ""I had this fantasy of meeting him the other day. Frankly, I'd be a little scared of meeting him. I mean, what would I say?""Peter was born in Philadelphia to Irish immigrant parents. His late father, whose professional name was Pete Boyle, was a commercial artist who later hosted children's shows on a TV station there. Mrs. Boyle now lives in New York with one of Peter's two sisters.Peter became a Christian Brother while a student at La Salle College, but he left the order soon after graduation. ""My name was Brother Francis,"" he recalls, ""and I prayed so hard I had callouses on my knees. I tried to reach God, I did a lot of studying, and I found it was an unnatural way to live. The celibacy is ridiculous. Boy, I really got horny.""I'm really into a Zen thing now,"" he goes on, lying down on his back on the park bench. ""I just don't like the authoritarianism of the Catholic Church. And I don't like the materialism I see in the parishes, with their concern for money and building larger and larger schools. But there are some very exciting people in the church now, like Father Berrigan.""The next stop after the monastery was the U. S. Navy, where Peter was discharged after a few months of service because of a ""severe nervous breakdown."" Then he headed for New York, with dreams of becoming an actor. He took lessons from Uta Hagen, worked in the Post Office and as a bouncer at O'Neals' pub, toured in the national company of ""The Odd Couple,"" and finally hit pay dirt in the television commercial world.Although he has nothing in the works right now, he says he hopes his next job will be another movie. ""You can improvise in the movies. I know, I know, the screenwriters will pull out their hair when they read that. They're all overpaid, anyway. When people first started making movies, the actors improvised. Charlie Chaplin improvised.""Peter improvised some of the dialogue in ""Joe,"" including one line of his lone nude scene where he makes love to a hippie girl. ""I really felt uptight about that scene,"" he says. ""For one thing, I weighed 10 pounds more than I do now. Anyway, I take her breast in my mouth and she says, 'Hey, wait a minute.' Well, I ad-libbed. 'I hope I'm not out of line,' and they left it in.""Does he worry about being typecast as a Silent Majority man?""It's a danger. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. But I think I can do other things. I remember once going up for it part, and the woman said, 'You don't look menacing enough.' This summer I'm in the CBS Comedy Tonight show [Sundays at 9 P.M.], and I took that so I could show people I could do other things, too."" (If you don't recognize him on the show, that's probably because he'll be wearing his hair-piece.)Although Peter has been ""reasonably close to marriage once or twice,"" he is wary because he has seen so many unhappy marriages among his friends. ""I know that if I'd gotten married when I came out of the monastery, I would probably be getting a divorce by now. Being a bachelor has its points. By the time you're 34, you've really been through a lot of things with women, and you know what you don't want. What I want is children. I think a man and woman who live together and have children are very courageous.""It is noon and Peter has an appointment with a photographer, so we walk back to his building. I leave him as I found him, standing on the stoop and guarding the door because he is ashamed of having a stranger see his bare apartment.Judging from the long lines of people queued up to see ""Joe,"" Peter probably won't he ashamed much longer.",1970-08-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Losers' Arrives:Motorcycle Gangsters at War in Vietnam,"Sooner or later it was bound to happen  a picture about American motorcyclist supermen pitted against the Vietcong on enemy terrain. Brought together overseas by a wary Army command, these five super-tough civilians include two veterans of Vietnam. Their mission is to rescue a Presidential adviser held captive in a remote village.""The Losers,"" opening yesterday on the circuits, has a good idea with some fine, ironic possibilities. And sure enough, this low-budget enterprise uses a slam-bang, blood-dripping massacre of a climax, spearheaded by these hardies, to stress the seeming futility of the war. The film also falls all over itself along the way in dawdling admiration of the bone-crushing quintet as symbols of rebellion.For a full hour  and we timed it  the recruits slam around an outpost town in typical cyclist-movie style, brawling, drinking and anchoring to the local brothel. Watching them cynically, unlike the camera, is a tough-talking Army captain, played by that excellent Negro actor, Bernie Hamilton, who finally gets them  and the showon the road.Two sideline romances extend right to the front, with the secret-mission truck also carrying two girl friends, and we're not kidding. One of them, as a native girl with a Negro baby from the bordello, is beautifully played by a young Philippine actress named Ana Korita. Her stunned moment of reunion with the captain, who had deserted her, is the only genuinely touching thing in the picture.As for that climactic rescue, the boys roar into the thatched-hut village for an explosive holocaust, with blood flying, quite literally, at the slow-motion camera. The liberated ""Presidential adviser"" turns out to be a cringing, snapping man in a white-linen suit who denounces his burly rescuers as ""trash,"" and leaves two of them to dieall five do. He then barks to the captain: ""Now get me back to Washington so I can straighten out this mess.""On one count, this project shows solid pluck. It was filmed entirely in the Philippines by an independent outfit called Fanfare. The exotic settings, stamped with harshly colored photography, look authentic every inch of the way. There is also evidence that the strapping William Smith, as the brightest of the five, can act. But the scenario by Alan Caillou and the limber direction of Jack Starrett (who also plays the Washingtonian) seem mainly concerned with one thing. War or no war, you can't push these guys around.",1970-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Search for Self Among Peers:Adolescents in 'Out of It' Sift Verities on L.I.,"Paul Williams's ""Out of It"" opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, but it was made in 1967, according to the distributor, and it looks and feels just a bit oldersay 1963even allowing for South Shore cultural lag.A sort of teenage rites of passage in Bellmore, L. I., ""Out of It"" concerns one summer's misadventures among a group of kids who go to the beach, suffer football practice, neck and pet (the mere thought of ""not going all the way"" may secretly thrill the most determined overage immoralist), drive into the city at night, and hang around with a young man named Paul (Barry Gordon), mostly because he has the keys to his mother's car.Paul is a little awkward, physically inept, unpredictable, gauche, moody, deep (his companions keep asking one another: ""Do you think Paul's deep?) and self-effacing. He reads Camus on the beach, but allows that ""I'm really very ignorantlike Socrates."" And like Socrates, perhaps; like many of us, his life may be seen as a searchfor an understanding soulmate (preferably 36-C) who Really Thinks About Things.The girl in question, an intellectual cheerleader named Christine (Lada Edmund Jr.), happens to belong to the high school football bully (Jon Voight; his first film), whose reactions precipitate the movie's climax and Paul's locker-room victory. Ultimately another girl (Gretchen Corbett) will understand Paul (""You're not deep; you're just horny""), but the taste of triumph remains.""Out of It"" has received some remarkable advance reviews, and it is easy to see how a movie critic, possibly trembling on the edge of modern maturity, might appreciatively long for the anxieties and frustrations of a simpler time. Indeed, the notion of a movie attuned to the rhythm of the station breaks on WMCA is appealing, and ""Out of It"" is very long on appeal, but short on achievement.Filmed in a style that might best be described as master's thesis modest, ""Out of It"" turns to ironic understatement as an all-purpose substitute for a controlling point of view. Too flat, too scattered, really, too dependent on the kind of sympathy a lot of people will give it, ""Out of It"" does pretty well as a young man's first feature (Williams, who has since made ""The Revolutionary,"" was 23 years old when he directed it) but not well enough for its material, its glamorous locale, or its excellent cast.Both Jon Voight and Barry Gordon create the manner and matter of their time and placeto continue in yet another setting the endless opposition between tall, blond and muscular and short, dark and not muscular. Miss Corbett succeeds as the very type of the wise and warm girl next door.But Miss Edmund (or, Miss Edmund Jr.) succeeds as something else, and duty requires me to say that she is fantastically, overwhelmingly, heartbreakingly sexy. From the perfect curve of her well-tanned calves to the tips of her false eyelashes, she exemplifies what everyone must want the deep-thinking adolescent to be.And in the vigor of her stunning profile she is sufficient justification for the invention of the moving picture, for both parts of ""War and Peace,"" for the screen career of Stanley Kramer, for the Film Industry in Crisis.",1970-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,'Barbara' Puts Emphasis on Sex,"Toward the end of ""Barbara,"" after a clutch of young hippies have spent the summer wallowing in sexual variations, one young man announces that next autumn he just might go out and get a job. A pall settles over the picture. It just isn't done.Just about everything else is attempted, at least sexually, in the picture that opened yesterday at the downtown Garrick Theater. Most of it is given over to copulation, with the camera explicitly trailing the young people as they stalk one another over a corner of a sand-dune resort(which turns out to be Fire Island).Occasionally they are heard railing against the Establishment, when the sound track clears up. They wear clothes about half the timeonce, rather astonishingly, when they elect to dip in the waves. In another sequence, gravely labeled ""Tribute  Godard,"" they settle down for a picnic, pass around a long-stemmed pipe and scrape rice from bowls while discussing ""the exploration of human behavior."" If the esteemed French filmmaker ever sees this picture and digs that rice, he'll probably go to work for the Disney organization.The theme music of the picture, independently produced and presented by Druidstone-Hottentot Productions, is ""Just a Little Bit of Love.""

us,The Screen: Gangland French Style:An Elaborate 'Borsalino' Opens at Cinema I,"If filmmaking were just a decorative art, and if mis-en-scene included no more than setting the scene, then ""Borsalino,"" which opened yesterday at Cinema I, might have some small claim to being a good movie.Given the limitations of its time and place (the Marseilles underworld of the early 1930's), ""Borsalino"" is one of the most elaborately, even pedantically detailed period reconstructions I have ever seen. But given the possibilities of its time and place, of its genre, of at least some of its cast, of the medium itself""Borsalino"" is a failure of stupefying proportions.The story concerns two punks (Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon) who, by enterprise and luck, work their way up through the Marseilles protection rackets to emerge finally in lonely eminence as kings of local gambling, prostitution, and wholesale meat and fish.Along the way they kill a little, love a little, fight a little, and do in more or less regular order everything that is expected of the heroes of gangland cinema  before they learn that the fruits of their struggle have turned to dust and ashes, and that the price of success is death.Anybody who goes to the movies will be able to fill in the details, give or take a few dozen, and, by moving the action back from Marseilles to, say, Prohibition Chicago, will be able to call to mind several good and some great films of the past.Where ""Borsalino"" fails is not so much in the hoariness of its plot as in the lassitude of its pacing (it is, I think, meant to be funny in a subtle, wry, fist-in-the-guts way) and its numbing subordination of scene, movement and gesture to costume and dcor.The interiors, whether seedy or sumptuous (especially a gambling casino in the Chinese style) display the paraphernalia of their period as meticulouslyand in their very completeness, somehow as inauthenticallyas any museum reconstruction. The exteriors are if anything even more completeto the degree that some rather elaborate scenes seem to be held beyond all dramatic need so you can see that the next car around the corner, the next walker on the block, will be, down to the last particular, genuinely of the period.Jacques Deray's direction seems not so much to lead, as to accede to the demands of the scene designer and the costumer. There are, indeed, six costume credits. But where he has his way, he is equally indulgentphotographing the sunlight through what looks like layers of scrim, introducing gratuitous motor trips simply as you may admire the cars, staging fist fights and beatings that manage to be both dull and unusually brutal at the same time.In this context, it is impossible to speak well of performances. Delon and Belmondo smoke endless cigars, wear the broad-brimmed hat for which the film is named, saunter (the way punks do) rather than walk, and pose in the clothes and with the objects that are intended to express them.The result is not a characterization, but rather a collection of affectationswith which Belmondo seems uncomfortable, but not Delon, who comes more and more to look and act like an inanimate object of the 1930's.There is a real difference between costume drama and costume display, between films that playfully court decadence (for example, ""Performance"") and ""Borsalino,"" which really is decadent because it is so deliberately drained of vitality.Much talent has been wasted in this film (in major parts, Michel Bouquet and Catherine Rouvel, among others), and neither the rooms nor the cars look as if anyone had really lived in them.",1970-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,FILM ON MOZART IN U.S. PREMIERE:Camera Technique in Movie Shows Lack of Imagination,"""The Life of Mozart,"" a film given its American premiere on Thursday night at Philharmonic Hall as part of the Mostly Mozart Festival, is as descriptive, honest and dull as its title. It can be respected for its respect toward its subject, admired for sticking to pictorial fact, praised for a few imaginative flashes of appropriate imagery. It is still dull.It begins with the moving of Mozart's parents to Salzburg, where he was born. Two hours and 20 minutes later, after countless shots of streets, houses, palaces, countrysides, portraits, manuscripts and performances by contemporary musicians, it ends with the composer's death.This is the nature of biographical documentaries, although rigid chronological order is not necessarily part of it. Yet a creative film artist could have given depth and vitality, not just coverage, to the material.Molto AdagioTempo and rhythm, so beautifully, and subtly handled by Mozart in his music, had little counterpart in the camera work. For most of the time it moved at an adagio pace in and out of rooms, across a landscape, closing in on a picture, scanning a letter. Once, quickly alternating shots of Gluck and Piccini suggested the fight between their Parisian factions. Again, the camera swayed drunkenly to Mozart's music for Vienna's winebibbers.There were a few visual metaphors  Notre Dame Cathedral's gargoyles for references to Paris's hostility to the adult composer, a Greek temple to go with excerpts from his three great final symphonies. These were too few to help.To the film's credit, the narration often ceased for the performance of complete musical sequences. Even here, the shots of instrumentalists and singers were conventional, and some of the operatic singing and acting was embarrassing. In this respect, the Salzburg Marionettes in a bit of ""The Magic Flute"" came off best.The English narration, at least, was literate, often nicely tinged with irony. A great many distinguished ensembles, conductors and solo performers furnished the sound track. A German film, ""The Life of Mozart"" was made in 1966 by Hans Conrad Fischer. It drew a capacity audience, several of whose members could be seen dozing during its progress.",1970-08-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Eldridge Cleaver in Algiers,"""Eldridge Cleaver,"" which opened, without warning, at Cinema II yesterday, is a generally intelligent, wholly sympathetic treatment of the thoughts and personality of Eldridge Cleaver in exile in Algiers. Its apparent aim is not so much to study Cleaver as to provide access to his thoughts and his voice, but in doing this it necessarily does study him. Insofar as Cleaver is the subject, the film is thoughtful, ironic, valuable. Insofar as Johnson, Reagan, Nixon, Agnew and the ""crimes of American imperialism"" are the subjects, the film is very tired and very ordinary propaganda.Directed by William Klein (""Mr. Freedom,"" ""Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee,"" an episode of ""Far From Vietnam""), the film consists at its best of interviews with and scenes from Cleaver's Algerian exile. It includes excellent footage of the First Pan-African Cultural Festival, at which Cleaver spoke, and material from Vietnam, from protest marches and beatings in the United States. It is divided into thought-segments introduced by titles (for example, ""Culture Is a Gun"") flashed on the screen, in the manner of some recent Jean-Luc Godard propaganda movies.However, ""Eldridge Cleaver"" is sufficiently unassertive in its approach to the man to allow his mind and what he has to say essential controlto a degree, even undercutting the more strident rhetoric of some of its images. As he discusses the revolutionary aims and methods of the Panthers, contemplates exile (with rather too desultory a subjective camera exploring the alleys of Algiers), meets African nationalists, laments the captivity in Babylon (the United States)  he emerges as a man of considerable wit, grace, personal sadness and hard-headed realism.Although he advocates an orthodox revolutionary toughness (""So far as I'm concerned, the neutrals are part of the problem.""), he rejects black racism in favor of an internationalism of the oppressed that, if short on analysis, is also short on the appeals to anti-American paranoia that seem so often to motivate ""third-world"" indignation.At one point, Cleaver is shown visiting the North Vietnam delegation in Algiers. Through an interpreter he exchanges friendly views. And before he leaves he poses for Klein's camera, holding hands with the Vietnamese, whom he dwarfs but with whom he seems formally at ease. It is a moment of shy warmth and slightly awkward good feeling, and it is not too atypical of the best film-making in ""Eldridge Cleaver.""",1970-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Joan Baez and Her Challenge:'Carry It On' Follows Singer and Husband,"Although the voice and face of Joan Baez are the focal points through almost all of ""Carry It On,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, the motivating factor of the film is the imprisonment of her husband, David Harris, for refusing to be inducted in the Army.His arrest is the frame through which this documentary, as a whole, is seen. He appears briefly in the opening sequenceshighly articulate, low-keyed but forceful as he discusses the draft and the nature of democracy in formal and informal settings.But once he is taken away by Federal marshals, the camera turns to Miss Baez as she travels across the country, singing, talking, thinking aloud and anticipating the birth of her baby.As a result, the film works on three levels simultaneously. Superficially, it offers a generous, almost continuous concert by Miss Baez as she sings 13 songs in concert situations, in impromptu accompaniment to ironing or cooking and as over-all background. Fundamentally, it provides a platform for the views of Miss Baez and Mr. Harris. And in between, it reveals something of the person behind the celebrity who is Miss Baez.That all three aspects remain in balance and come through effectively is due to a great extent to the calm, direct, unpretentious tone that flows through the film, a tone that is subtly implemented by the use of black and white photography. Like Mr. Harris, Miss Baez takes a very positive stance in situations in which she feels challenged  facing a conference of young people who sharply question some of her aims, or on Joey Bishop's television show.But after her appearance with Bishop and a subsequent talk with an admiring girl on Bishop's staff, she discusses with a friend the validity of some of the things she said in a fashion that not only reveals how she thinks but also where her own uncertainties enter in.""Carry It On"" presents a point of view but it presents it with the warts, the questions, and gives the viewer an opportunity to consider the questions. And it shows us a very unusual artist at work  on stage, backstage and at home getting ready. And waiting. Waiting for David. Waiting for the baby. But involved.",1970-08-27T05:00:00+0000

It covers practically every aspect of black life: history, literature, educa tion, law, racial injustice, theater, art and music. It examines not only black life in the United States, but also in the West Indies, South Amer ica, Europe and Africa. At the time when the book first appeared, 1934, the inferiority of blacks was still an unquestioned assumption among whites, except for a small minority of artists and intellectuals. Nancy Cunard was one of the latter, and her purpose in compiling, editing and publishing this anthology at her own expense was to prove that there was no superior race, merely cultural differences, that racism has no basis whatsoever. The result is a book that is unashamedly didactic and, in great part, polemical, expos ing the persecution of blacks through reportage on chain gangs, lynchings and the case of the Scottsboro boys, and proving the equality of blacks through essays on their intellectual and artistic accomplishments. It is a book that was valuable and neces sary for its time. Today it is a histor ical artifact, but a fascinating one.",1970-08-30T05:00:00+0000
