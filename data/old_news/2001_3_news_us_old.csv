us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; 'Give Me Rapture and Bliss',"Not what love is but what love does: that's the subject of Mary Jo Bang's lush new book of poems, LOUISE IN LOVE (Grove, paper, $13). Bang's book is a verse novella that caroms here and there but essentially revolves around a certain Louise, based loosely on the silent film star Louise Brooks, and a cast of Scott- and Zelda-like characters, including Louise's sister Lydia, her lover, Ham, and various other sybarites. So it helps if you're in the throes of amour as you read -- or at least have memories, preferably fond ones, of a state of mind in which cause and effect seem not to exist and the things of this world are constantly rearranging themselves into startling new combinations. In one poem, the name ''Charlotte'' turns into ''Charcot,'' who was Freud's teacher, and then ''charcuterie,'' and indeed these poems do have the febrile jumpiness of Freudian dreamscapes, not to mention the paintings of Bosch, Dali and Tanguy, whom Louise praises, just as she damns the Northern European school as ''Sterile takes / on quotidian twilight.'' (''Give me rapture and bliss, she told Ham.'') As Bang says in her acknowledgments, she borrows lines from two of literature's world-class emotional athletes, Keats and Woolf, but in its incandescent giddiness the book seems closer to John Ashbery's ''Girls on the Run'' and Peter Klappert's neglected masterpiece ''The Idiot Princess of the Last Dynasty.'' The great melter of boundaries, love is a marvelous tool in this poet's hands, for ultimately it dissolves time itself, so that the end of ''Louise in Love'' is ''the end / that is no end at all but is more like an endless beginning.''

But his masterpiece is WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966), which shocked Broadway audiences in 1962 with its raw language and emotions. It's the portrait of a bad marriage, demonstrated during one night of vitriol in a small college town. Mike Nichols, the film's director, pulled an Oscar-winning performance out of Elizabeth Taylor as the crude, disillusioned, braying middle-aged daughter of the college president. She can't forgive her husband for not having the right career stuff. Richard Burton, magnificent as always, is her spouse, a weary, hostile, ungracious history professor who is never going to head the department. George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the new young marrieds on campus and the lead characters' guests for a late-night get-together that turns ugly and more revealing than anyone meant it to be.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; And Ye Shall Know Them,"The New York graphic design studio Chermayeff & Geismar has been creating trademarks since 1960, including some of the country's most ubiquitous corporate logos: the NBC peacock, the Mobil trademark with the red O, the Chase bank octagon and the three east-facing heads of PBS. TM: Trademarks Designed by Chermayeff & Geismar (Princeton Architectural Press, $40) is a chronological selection of the studio's work by its partners, Ivan Chermayeff, Tom Geismar and Steff Geissbuhler. Each design is given a full page without explanatory captions, working drawings or even examples of the trademarks that were replaced. The effect is somewhat misleading. Logos evolve, and these are no exception. The NBC peacock emblem, for instance, was not actually originated by Chermayeff & Geismar, but adapted in the 1970's from a commercial broadcast in 1956 to show off the network's new color technology. Similarly, some of the logos presented here as stand-alone works of art might have been more helpfully pictured in their natural habitat, among rival company insignia, where they gain meaning and status from a shared visual language. As this book illustrates, Chermayeff & Geismar played a significant role in the development of corporate identity -- only in the latter half of the 20th century did corporations begin diligently applying a single badge to every manifestation of their business. By omitting context, however, this book encourages the reader to simply marvel at the design studio's proficiency. And that is only half the story. Peter Hall",2001-03-04T05:00:00+0000

After moving to California from the Midwest, the two embarked on a ''campaign of distraction'' that blended antic, slacker freedom with traditional parenting methods. His intensely self-conscious, often hilarious memoir, which was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, includes a new appendix correcting and updating the original. ''Eggers's real achievement is to provide a counterweight to what Ian Frazier once called 'the encroaching Hefty bag of death,' and to write about it, in our age of irony, with genuine, unsentimental poignancy,'' Sara Mosle wrote here.",2001-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Despite some nods toward energy efficiency, it is essentially an oil driller's bill. The larger danger is that it could serve as a template for the cabinet-level task force appointed by President Bush to devise a comprehensive national energy strategy. That panel, which is led by Vice President Dick Cheney, an oilman himself, is already disposed to honor Mr. Bush's campaign pledge to sweep away regulatory impediments to new exploration.

Harding Isaacson, who gave his utmost in the service of his country during WWII and as an active member of the military and veteran community within New York State up to the day of his death. Col. Isaacson distinguished himself in WWII flying 30 missions over occupied France and Germany in a heavy bombardment group that was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French government after the war period. After being discharged from the Army Air Corps in 1945, Col. Isaacson continued his military career in the US Air Force Reserves, where he served for 5 years, and the New York State Guard where he served as an officer for many years in the 9th Regiment. Some of his most serious contributions to the military and veteran community in New York State were made as a colonel in the Veteran Corp of Artillary of the State of New York, which is the honor guard of the Governer of New York, and as commander of his American Legion Post in Sayville, Long Island. Col. Isaacson received numerous federal, state and foreign military medals and awards throughout his extensive military career. Col. Isaacson is survived by his lovely wife Janet, one nephew and two nieces. To them The New York Society of Military and Naval Officers extend our deepest sympathies.

Smith Foundation; the Dana Farber Hospital in Boston; founder and member of the Board of Directors of The Inner City Scholarship Endowment Fund in New York City as well as board member of the Gregorian University in Rome, Italy. Additionally, Mr. Quick served as Chairman of the Board of St. Francis Heart Hospital and on the advisory council of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, TN. He was a Trustee of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. Mr. Quick was a Knight of Malta, Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a member of the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity of the Archdiocese of New York.

Mr. Quick was the father of three Fairfield University graduatesThomas, Christopher and Mary and a daughter-in-law, Eileen Manning Quick.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Mankind Won't Last,"Science fiction, it is often said, reveals more about the time in which it was created than about the future it imagines. With that in mind, the tales in Arthur C. Clarke's COLLECTED STORIES (Tor/Tom Doherty, $29.95) are best appreciated not as adventures set on places like the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter -- though they are sometimes that -- but as products of the cold war. Clarke began writing shortly before World War II, and he consistently infused his work with both an optimism about technology and a fear of its misuse; the atomic bomb looms large over this book's 900-plus pages. That balance of dread and wonder is Clarke's hallmark, and it's what made his (and Stanley Kubrick's) screenplay to ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' such a deft fable -- after all, what's the HAL 9000 computer if not our collective technophobia personified? Clarke himself, however, was often a maddeningly unsubtle writer. His early stories for pulp magazines like Astounding Science Fiction are, well, pulpy -- formulaic, wooden tales turning on a science factoid and featuring a human race threatened by aliens, atomic hubris or (too often) our future insect masters. His skills did improve by the end of the 1960's -- when he all but abandoned the short story -- though technology and its discontents remained his obsession. In ''Improving the Neighborhood,'' a fable published in Nature magazine in 1999, Clarke makes humanity blow up the earth yet again. Cold war or not, Clarke wants to remind us, we're always a hair's breadth away from engineering our own ruin. Mark Athitakis",2001-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,"Children's Books; Mabel, the Night and the Music","The evening of their gala dancing party, young Mabel's caring parents scurry about, mindful of including her, whenever possible, in the preparations. She ''blew bubbles in the bath while Mama dressed up and Papa tied his dancing shoes.'' Eventually, though, Mabel is lovingly tucked into bed and that is supposed to be that. But, as Amy Hest's words and Christine Davenier's illustrations in MABEL DANCING (Candlewick, $15.99; ages 4 to 8) tell us so charmingly, like so many children left out of grown-up fun, Mabel feels forlorn, ''alone in the night.'' Hearing the music from the party ''floating up the stairs,'' she creeps to a perch at the top of the staircase and watches the ''papas in bow ties'' and ''mamas, too, in swirling gowns.'' It's only a matter of time before Mabel has danced her way down the stairs and ''in the bright party light . . . spinning past the guests . . . floating through the rooms.'' The ball they are giving may be glamorous, but Mabel's parents are down-to-earth and utterly captivated by their little girl. They love seeing her dance, and encourage her to take a deep bow in her red nightgown and yellow cape (a blanket). Best of all, Papa asks her to dance with him and Mama, and the three of them ''danced away in the velvet light.'' Eventually, they dance ''up and up the stairs,'' and Mabel is finally, happily, put to bed for the night. A dreamy, evocative portrait of parental love as it's supposed to be: all-encompassing and unconditional. Betsy Groban",2001-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Newark; A Cornucopia for Carnivores,"Fancy restaurants might try to impress with cheese carts or Caesar salads made tableside. But those pale next to the spectacle at Brasilia, a Brazilian barbecue spot in the Ironbound district of Newark. Although there is a large menu, loyal customers have only one thing on their minds when they enter this sprawling cafeteria-style place: the rodzio de churrasco, an all-you-can-eat procession of charcoal-grilled meats. After a warm-up trip to the salad bar, the fun begins. Your waiter slips a card with the number of rodzio eaters in your party onto a tall silver stand, and in seconds the first of an army of servers arrives. ''Beef?'' he asks, brandishing a two-foot-long skewer of sirloin, which he then slices onto your plate. Steps behind him is another server with a skewer of pork, and another with a skewer of chicken. Soon your plate is piled high with sirloin, ribs, chicken, pork, bacon-wrapped turkey, leg of lamb, spare ribs and a variety of sausages. Then there are the sides of rice and beans, fried plantains and bananas, French fries and so on. Don't expect any tangy red barbecue sauce. While the chicken and pork are marinated overnight, the beef is simply seasoned with salt. ''We let the charcoal and smoke do the rest,'' said the owner, Ademir DeSouza. The price of this never-ending feast is $16. That's a bit higher than the normal Quick Bite tab, but considering the cost per bite (if you're a light eater, what are you doing here?) it's a steal. When you're done, the waiter lowers the green flag, signaling that for you, the show is over. Dessert? Dare you. Gretchen Kurtz",2001-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Making the World Anew,"Jacob Lawrence (1917-2000) was a consummate storyteller, and during his 65-year career he painted vivid narratives, ranging from sweeping historical epics to intimate vignettes of daily life. Lawrence's vast output is aptly captured in THE COMPLETE JACOB LAWRENCE (University of Washington, $150), a two-volume set that documents more than 900 of the artist's paintings, drawings and murals. Essays track Lawrence's life and evolution, including his precocious beginnings in Depression-era Harlem and his becoming, in 1941, the first black artist represented by a major commercial gallery. Lawrence's ability to negotiate the demands of both the art world and the black community is also explored, along with his balancing acts between abstraction and figuration, personal expression and social commitment. While the surface of Lawrence's work remained fairly constant over the decades -- bearing a trademark style of flat shapes, bold color and rhythmic patterns -- his art was informed by diverse sources and beneath the bright facade lay a strong sense of injustice at the suffering caused by discrimination and poverty. Although his works focused on the plight of black Americans, most notably in series like ''The Life of Harriet Tubman'' and ''The Migration of the Negro,'' Lawrence sought to address ''the struggle of man to always better his condition and to move forward.'' As one of the essays argues, this larger human aspiration is best expressed in Lawrence's paintings devoted to the theme of builders, a subject that engaged him from the mid-1940's until the end of his life. This was also an image that mirrored Lawrence's own constructive endeavor: a figure striving to refashion the world through creative labor. Suzanne Ramljak",2001-03-11T05:00:00+0000

He was raised and died on East 15th Street in Manhattan. He was 89. Essentially a self-taught man, he was hired by the New York World in the 1930's. In 1941 he joined the Daily Mirror as a Copy Editor. During his tenure at the Mirror, he also taught journalism courses at Long Island University. Nineteen years later, he became a member of the foreign and then metro copy desk at The New York Times, again for nineteen years. He was a staunch union man and a shop steward for the Guild while at the Times. In 1979 he spent a year in Paris working for The International Herald Tribune before returning to New York. He then continued copy editing at India Abroad until he was 85. A lifelong automotive enthusiast, Mr. Philips authored two books in the late 1950s for Arco/Fawcett about small cars, predicting America's enbrace of the compact, as well as many feature articles on a variety of subjects for various publications. In addition, he was a gifted musician able to play several instruments. In fact, his first job as a journalist was music critic for a small chain of newspapers in upstate New York. A lingering case of Tuberculosis from his youth kept him out of World War II, his greatest regret. Above all, Bill Philips was a kind, gracious, empathetic, cultured, nurturing man with a wonderful S.J. Pearlman/ Monty Python sense of humor.

The grain in Delbert McClinton's voice was built up the old-fashioned way: 40 years of singing in roadhouses and honky-tonks. Having grown up in the down-home musical crossroads that is Texas, he soaked up blues, country, gospel and rhythm-and-blues without worrying about particular pedigrees. Mr. McClinton, 60, has also had plenty of time to observe love lost and found. In the 13 songs on ''Nothing Personal,'' all of which he wrote or helped write, lust and heartbreak continue their endless roundelay, and Mr. McClinton sings with humor and grit, whether he is celebrating an all-night tryst or ruefully recalling how ''my ship came in and she sank it.'' He is more eccentric and existential writing without collaborators, sketching people in trouble in ''Desperation'' and offering strategic advice in ''Nothing Lasts Forever.'' Although Mr. McClinton hasn't always sounded comfortable in a recording studio, this time he romps through the songs, especially when his band adds New Orleans to the beat.

us,Poles and the Jews: How Deep the Guilt?,"On July 10, 1941, 1,600 Jews, nearly the entire Jewish population of the Polish village of Jedwabne, were murdered by their Polish neighbors. Some were hunted down and killed with clubs, axes and knives; most were herded into a barn and then burned alive. Although the slaughter was not a secret, publicly the Nazi occupiers were blamed. A monument in Jedwabne (pronounced yed-VAHB-nay) declared: ''Place of martyrdom of the Jewish people. Hitler's Gestapo and gendarmerie burned 1,600 people alive, July 10, 1941.'' But last May, Jan T. Gross, a historian at New York University, published ''Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne'' in Poland. The book, which will be issued in the United States in April, documents the massacre by Polish villagers in gruesome detail. In a country whose people think of themselves as wartime victims, not villains, it set off a storm of debate in corner shops, cafes and classrooms, and among the country's political and church leaders. Some Poles have continued to deny Polish responsibility; most have tried to wrestle with the country's history of anti-Semitism and questions of collective guilt. Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Roman Catholic Primate, and President Aleksander Kwasniewski have publicly asked for forgiveness, and on Thursday the Jedwabne memorial was removed. Adam Michnik is a dissident and historian who spent six years in prison under the postwar Communist regime, served as an adviser to the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and is now editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborcza, Poland's largest daily newspaper.

Odd, isn't it? It wasn't that long ago, after all, that any straight actor playing a gay character would have been news. And it wasn't that long ago that we were all being rushed to the barricades to defend or attack any number of other hot-button social topics -- abortion rights, gay visibility, pop-culture trash, affirmative action, the war on drugs -- and not only as separate political issues but as a contest for the very soul of the country.

Shoppers can choose from a selection of 11 scents in 121 combinations in categories like Citrus, Spicy and Heavy Floral. At the touch of a button, a 15-second video plays as the nozzles release a gentle infusion of fragrance -- 10 percent oil and 90 percent air.

Each of the 16 tables in the cafe is decorated with a floral arrangement, and the menu offers breakfast and sandwiches; the specialty is ''giant pancakes,'' 10 inches in diameter. On the walls or on tables of their own are items like plaques, handmade dolls and embroidery. Mrs. Lisco calls them crafts -- and she should know: she made many of them herself. Some are there for show, others for sale, none more than $4 or $5 (sometimes less, for children who need something for Mom). On a recent Saturday morning, Mrs. Lisco jumped up to hug and kiss customers, many of them regulars from the array of communities for the elderly that dot the area.

As Bermuda was one of the few island clusters in the world without a native population, early botanic observers had the opportunity to record flora untouched by human habitation before the 17th century -- with the exception of the occasional shipwrecked crew that either perished or stayed on shore long enough to build a ship out of cedar and sail on.",2001-03-18T05:00:00+0000

And why does she consider it a ''downside,'' instead of a sign of wonderful progress, that ''the islanders seem to take a certain comfort level for granted''? Does she think that only Americans are entitled to take comfort for granted, and that the ''remote South Pacific islands'' should forgo fast food and other innovations to exist as a living museum?",2001-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Now, Take My Lemon","It was barely a year ago that Dave Eggers burst into the spotlight with ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' his oversized, self-conscious and showstopping memoir about raising his young brother after the deaths of their parents. Trailing him onto the stage came McSweeney's, the idiosyncratic literary quarterly and Web site he was producing out of a famously messy Brooklyn apartment. McSweeney's lacks the mainstream appeal of Eggers's memoir: it was, and remains, an incubator for abstruse, droll, often satirical bits of writing. Now come the first two works of fiction from the new McSweeney's book imprint. Like the magazine, the novels are handsome, smartly written and deeply eccentric. Consider LEMON (McSweeney's, $16.50), Lawrence Krauser's first novel, which tells the story of Wendell, a corporate memo writer who, after his girlfriend leaves him, becomes obsessed with a lemon. He notices the fruit lying in the foyer of his apartment building, picks it up, pockets it and soon finds himself mooning over it, bathing with it, taking it to work, rescuing it from a colleague's cup of tea and, perhaps inevitably, making love to it. He tapes it to a seesaw and he and the lemon ''ride for hours, then fall to the grass and lay in its rustling till daybreak.'' Krauser, who is a playwright, has interspersed scenes of Wendell and his lemon with elegant ruminations on the cultivation of lemons and descriptions of contemporary cubicle life. His prose is immaculate; his premise, patently ridiculous. This book is odd, exquisite and trivial, like a drawing on a Ping-Pong ball or an etching in a bar of soap.",2001-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Still Life With Thumbtacks,"Unframed art has long been popular with struggling artists low on funds and with galleries started on a shoestring. But this winter, art without borders hit the big time, turning up in such mainstream spaces as the Whitney Museum of American Art (the Sol LeWitt retrospective), the Andrea Rosen Gallery (the Wolfgang Tillman show) and the Armory Show. In lieu of frames, art is hung with masking tape, metal clips or even thumbtacks, often weighted at the bottom corners to prevent curling. ''Unframed art definitely isn't about saving money anymore,'' said Thomas Delavan, co-founder of the Gramercy Art Fair and an art adviser to Bankers Trust Private Banking. ''It's about achieving a pared-down presentation -- the art world meets Helmut Lang. Art and fashion have intermingled for so long, it makes sense that the whole unfinished seams, clean-scrubbed-face fashion model sensibility would spill over into galleries.''",2001-03-18T05:00:00+0000

First, like the air of cheery bonhomie in the voice, the casual theatricality is typically Southern -- not for nothing did McWhorter achieve what she terms ''the platonic ideal of white Birmingham girlhood,'' the presidency of the elite high school sorority Theta Kappa Delta back in 1969.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Leonardo's Fingerprints,"Pietro C. Marani's LEONARDO DA VINCI: The Complete Paintings (Abrams, $85) places its subject firmly in his historical context so that we can understand just how profoundly he transformed it. According to Marani, co-director of the restoration of Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' and a professor of art history at the Politecnico di Milano, it was Leonardo's new pictorial representations of movement and perspective, informed by scientific observations and the study of classical sculpture, that propelled the early stirrings of the Renaissance into the full flowering of the High Renaissance. Marani convinces untrained eyes that the slight twist of a torso, the subtle dilation of pupils, the rose-colored reflection of light from a red velvet sleeve, all signal enormous artistic triumphs. In ''Mona Lisa,'' for example, Leonardo's talents allow us to ''see blood flowing beneath the subject's painted skin and lips that tremble in a mobile face whose muscles contract slightly in the beginning of a smile. He achieves the miraculous description of nature, depicted as it comes into being.'' This lavish book contains 200 color plates, including enlargements in which it is possible to see Leonardo's very fingerprints in the paint. These fingerprints illustrate his unconventional techniques, but they also show how deeply Marani knows his subject and how completely this book introduces its readers to Leonardo. Douglas A.

Adron was born on November 8, 1904, the son of Cleveland Adron Trantum and Lottie Pauline Dewey. He is survived by his sister Mary Alice Higgins of Asheville, North Carolina, and brother Leland Trantum of Southbury, Connecticut; and predeceased by sisters Emily Gates and Elizabeth Denham Roth. Adron leaves four children, Martha Lee Cooper and her husband Victor C. of Vero Beach, FL; Rhona Jean Beltz and her husband R. Judson of Latrobe, PA; Kathleen Joan Riester and her husband Frederick C. of Selkirk, New York; and Tad Trantum and his wife Lynda Ann of Hendersonville, TN; thirteen grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Adron was predeceased by his wife of 42 years, Kathleen Simpson Trantum, in 1981, and by his wife of 17 years, Peggy Jarvis Trantum, in 1999. Adron was born in Jamestown, New York, and spent his early years in Hagerstown, Maryland, and Ingold, North Carolina. He attended Columbia University and obtained his degree at Pace College in New York City. In the summer of 1929 Adron joined The Investors Management Company, now part of the American Funds, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He retired from the same firm as senior portfolio manager in 1968. In 1941 Adron and Kathleen moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey, where their family was raised and their children graduated from Ridgewood High School. He was a Decaon of the West Side Presbyterian Church. Adron and Kathleen spent the first five years of their retirement in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, before moving to Vero Beach, Florida, in 1972. Following Kathleen's death, Adron and Peggy married in 1983. Adron, Peggy and their late spouses had first met in 1949, so when they lost their life's mates, their union and love for each other was natural. It was an inspiration for their families and confirmed that life does not end with the loss of a spouse. Their enjoyment of life together should be a reminder that life can begin at eighty! Adron's time with us was filled with career achievement, caring, and laughter. Above all, his legacy is his devotion to Kathleen and Peggy, his children, and his extended family. All who knew him miss him. Donations in his memory may be made to VNA Hospice of Indian River County, 1111 36th Street, Vero Beach, FL 32960.

Brennan, the 57-year-old former penny stock promoter, an envelope containing 30,000 British pounds sterling in a London hotel on Oct. 27, 1998. The witness, Ian Plummer, managing director of the Valmet Group's office on the Isle of Man, in the Irish Sea, said a woman offering the password ''slush'' was to collect the money, the equivalent of $50,124, in late 1998. But she failed to appear in the hotel lobby, Mr. Plummer testified. He said his office then instructed him that Mr. Brennan would arrive with another password, ''the big ugly one.'' The testimony was offered in support of one of the 13 charges of bankruptcy fraud and money laundering against Mr. Brennan, who is on trial in Federal District Court in Trenton. Prosecutors say the money came from the sale of $4 million in municipal bearer bonds that he is accused of illegally failing to report on a 1995 bankruptcy petition. During cross-examination, Mr. Brennan's lawyer, Michael Critchley, contended Mr. Plummer was watching movies in his room at the time he says he turned over the money, a claim that Mr. Plummer denied.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Glory That Was Penn Station,"Peter Moore, who died in 1993, was known for photographing avant-garde performances. But he also documented the three-year-long demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station. More than 100 of his images are reproduced in THE DESTRUCTION OF PENN STATION: Photographs by Peter Moore (Distributed Art Publishers, $40), edited by Moore's wife, Barbara. As the sequence begins, in August 1963, one can almost hear the doomed station laboriously exhaling its last breath, its grandeur not wholly departed but long since compromised by the carelessness of the struggling Pennsylvania Railroad. By June 1964, the protective tarpaulins are in place. Behind them, Moore records the shocking evisceration of the main waiting room, a process that has also revealed the 20th-century steel framework underlying this stupendous recreation of the tepidarium at the Baths of Caracalla. October 1965 brings the final glimpses of the vast, faceted lightscape formed by the barrel vaults of the concourse ceiling. These have been rendered into skeletal, stub-ended fragments by March 1966, when the chronicle ends. Powerfully composed and richly tonal, Moore's photographs are in one sense an appreciation of the undeniable bravura of the demolition.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Spikenard and Cesspit,"Jean Echenoz's new novel, I'M GONE (New Press, $22.95), is very French. Echenoz combines a crime story, an anthropological study of Paris, a meditation on love and sex and a journey to exotic lands. ''I'm Gone'' won the 1999 Prix Goncourt and is now crossing the Atlantic in an agile, colloquial translation by Mark Polizzotti. The novel's greatest virtue is its rapid pace, which slows only for moments of cafe observation and philosophy. We follow Felix Ferrer, a recently divorced, sexually hyperactive gallery owner. Ferrer's assistant, Delahaye, tells him about the Nechilik, a small commercial ship that was carrying a fortune in paleoarctic art when it ran aground almost a half century earlier. The wreck was never recovered, and Delahaye dies a few weeks after telling Ferrer about the treasure. So Ferrer takes a sabbatical from his midlife crisis, his mistresses and his gallery to fly to Canada, cross the Arctic Circle by icebreaker and trek via dogsled to the ship's last known location. He finds the vessel and its antiquities intact and returns with the loot to Paris, only to have the collection stolen before he can insure it. Ferrer, a man without self-pity, bounces back. The plot continues swiftly to a surprising conclusion. Along the way, Echenoz delivers acute observations on everything from the Paris Mtro system to the problem with ill-fitting socks to obnoxious perfume. (''Brangre Eisenmann is a big-boned, fun-loving girl, highly perfumed. . . . The perfume issue quickly became a problem. Extatics Elixir is a terribly sour and insistent scent, which teeters dangerously on the cusp between spikenard and cesspit, which satisfies while it attacks, excites while it smothers.'')

Two weeks later and a mere 15 miles from the convention site, two students died in America's most recent school shooting. Robert Schwartz, head of the nonprofit Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia and the author of the A.B.A. resolution, says the murders in Santee, Calif., haven't changed his mind about zero tolerance.

The present-day heirs of this tendency are conceptual artists, with their penchant for inscrutable brainteasers. When did ''experimental'' become synonymous with ''mystifying''? Mark Ford's smart new biography, ''Raymond Roussel and the Republic of Dreams'' (Cornell University, $35), hints at a novel answer: with Roussel (1877-1933), a strange and possibly mad French poet and fantasist whose following has included many of the most influential avant-gardists of the 20th century.

us,India's AIDS Crisis,"Outside of Africa, India likely has the world's most worrisome AIDS crisis. India suffers the same virulent strain of AIDS that is killing Africans, its general health conditions are poor, and heterosexual transmission is common, putting the whole population at risk. In the last few years, the Indian government has begun to carry out a well-designed campaign to cut the spread of AIDS, but it has been spottily administered and will not show real gains for several years. India's experience is a warning to other nations that prevention plans are complex to carry out and take time to show effects -- all the more reason for governments to begin now. J. V. R. Prasada Rao, the director of India's National AIDS Control Organization, says that India had a total of 3.7 million people infected with the AIDS virus in 1999. Some outside experts believe the real number is double that or more. Many parts of India have a low infection rate of under 1 percent. But there are pockets where AIDS is far more prevalent, especially in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Some prenatal clinics in the state of Tamil Nadu report that nearly 5 percent of their patients are infected.",2001-03-27T05:00:00+0000

E!'s outrageous pre-awards special, starring the comedian Joan Rivers and her daughter Melissa, drew a slightly larger audience than it did in 2000. Still, size is relative when comparing network audiences with those of cable television. E!'s ''Live from the Red Carpet: The 2001 Academy Awards'' was watched by 3.1 million people, up from just over 3 million in 2000. The ABC Oscar broadcast, on the other hand, was watched by 42.9 million people, down from 46.3 million last year. ABC, meanwhile, may in large part have HBO's ''Sopranos'' to blame for the Academy Awards' ratings decline. ''The Sopranos'' was watched by 7.4 million people on Sunday at 9 p.m., or by about 2 million more than watched ''The Sopranos'' on Oscar night last year.

Under the commission's regulatory system, penalties, returned to customers as rebates, are imposed if Verizon does not meet various monthly, quarterly and annual performance requirements, though the penalties may be waived when the company shows that the shortfalls resulted from circumstances beyond its control. The commission denied additional waiver requests that Verizon had requested for reasons other than the strike.

Now, Samsung Electronics America has a 15-inch, flat-panel monitor that costs $499 after a $50 rebate good through June. The new monitor, called the SyncMaster 570vTFT, requires a third of the space and less than a third of the electricity of a cathode-ray tube monitor.

Then in a dramatic turnaround, a compromise was reached raising regular campaign donation limits in the bill and swiftly approved by a lopsided vote of 84 to 16. It was nothing less than a historic vote for cleaning up the American election system. The higher contribution limits are less than ideal but modest and far better than the current system. We urge all supporters of campaign reform to protect the bill from being nullified if any part of it is deemed unconstitutional and to vote for its final passage. Rarely has there been the kind of day that unfolded in the Senate yesterday. The arguments were impassioned because the senators were really talking about dismantling a discredited system of campaign finance and moving to something new, unknown and healthy.",2001-03-29T05:00:00+0000

Verizon had requested the waivers, saying that an 18-day labor strike in August and the backlogs it caused had been responsible for the company's inability to meet the commission's standards for repairs, installations and other activities in those months. Under the commission's regulatory system, penalties, returned to customers as rebates, are imposed if Verizon does not meet various monthly, quarterly and annual performance requirements, though the penalties may be waived when the company shows that the shortfalls resulted from circumstances beyond its control. The commission denied additional waiver requests that Verizon had requested for reasons other than the strike. Verizon's penalties for the regulatory year ended Aug. 31 now total at least $17.6 million, much more than the total in each of the three previous regulatory years. Joseph P.

The security vulnerability, which affects Microsoft Explore 5.01 and 5.5, is particularly troubling because the illicit program could be executed on a victim's computer simply by trying to view a message containing HTML data. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard notation form for representing World Wide Web pages. The flaw could also be exploited by visiting a Web page that contained a hidden program that would be downloaded to a computer without the user's knowledge.
