Dickens helped rescue the two women with whom he had been vacationing and whose connection to him he did not want revealed: his lover, the young actress Ellen Ternan, and her accommodating mother. After hours of helping attend to the wreck's victims, some seriously hurt and others dead, he climbed back into his compartment to rescue the manuscript he carried with him, a chapter of his novel in progress, ''Our Mutual Friend.''

While they are occupationally biased toward rationality, their stock in trade is imagining plausible futures -- and no speculation about future societies can be complete without considering the evolution of current belief systems or the advent of entirely new religions. Yet few writers have taken this challenge seriously. When religion has not served merely as a symbol of irrational reaction, it has usually figured as window dressing -- a few hints of altered rituals or creeds to remind the reader that this is indeed ''the future.'' Among the memorable exceptions: Walter M. Miller Jr.'s ''Canticle for Leibowitz,'' James Blish's ''Case of Conscience,'' Frank Herbert's ''Dune'' series, Gene Wolfe's multivolume ''Book of the New Sun.'' Add to these Octavia E.

us,Eat Drink Man Woman,"Jim Harrison is best known for his novels and essays, but in the introduction to THE SHAPE OF THE JOURNEY: New and Collected Poems (Copper Canyon, $30) he maintains that poetry ''is the portion of my life that means the most to me.'' In fact, Harrison has published nearly as many books of poetry as prose, from the youthfully expansive ''Plain Song'' (1965) to the Zen-inflected ''After Ikkyu'' (1996). This large collection, which also includes a new grab bag of nature verse and prose poems called ''Geo-Bestiary,'' has a meandering feel, although Harrison's concerns -- aging, women, eating and drinking, hunting, the craft of writing and above all the spirit and rhythms of the natural world -- are remarkably constant, as are his intentions: ''In our poetry we want to rub our nose hard / into whatever is before it; to purge / these dreams of pictures, photos, phantom people.'' His voice is obsessively unaffected and colloquial, which is surprising for someone so quick to acknowledge his lifelong debt to poets as diverse as Apollinaire, Rimbaud, Li Po and Keats, and who experiments with Buddhist-inspired verse and obscure poetic forms like ghazels. Harrison's writing is graceful, direct and muscular, even in those occasional places where the poems feel like dashed-off diary entries or, rarer still, when they hit a mawkish note. Much of the best verse -- particularly the fine introspective reveries in ''The Theory and Practice of Rivers & New Poems'' -- is set in rural Michigan, where Harrison is clearly most comfortable, pacing through the woods or confronting his appetites and his mortality: ''It is not so much that I got / there from here, which is everyone's / story: but the shape / of the voyage, how it pushed / outward in every direction / until it stopped.'' Throughout his wanderings he is great company -- a restless, self-questioning, intelligent writer, humble before nature and above all grounded in the flesh and blood and feathers of the planet: ''A modern man, I do not make undue connections though my heart wrenches daily against the unknowable, almighty throb and heave of the universe against my skin that sings a song for which we haven't quite found the words.''

An example: ''They're the only ones who stand a chance with the young skinny guys, but they always seem to be dating the old geezers you thought you'd be dating.'' Ms. Shaskan, 43, who lives in Morristown and is a consultant in corporate communications, was inspired by the fact that her female friends use humor to deal with aging and its insecurities. She wrote and illustrated the book and published it herself last fall, under the Motherbee Productions imprint. Not all women are chuckling, Ms. Shaskan says. ''Women either love it and howl with laughter or absolutely hate it.''

Her first recordings, from the middle 1950's, are utterly individual. In 1956 she recorded the song ''Social Call,'' and in it you hear the curved elegance of her mature style.

Augusto Pinochet of Chile are expressions of the idea that how a nation treats its own citizens is everybody's business. That principle was established 50 years ago at the Nuremberg trials, and one of its most important architects was Telford Taylor, who died of a stroke on May 23. Taylor was a deputy prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal that tried the top Nazi officials and chief prosecutor at a dozen American-run trials that followed. His work at Nuremberg helped shape the human rights movement and define modern international law. But Nuremberg was just one piece of a long career marked by a moral courage unusual in American public life. After the International Military Tribunal ended in 1946, Taylor was promoted to brigadier general and led 12 American trials of German military officers, concentration camp doctors, industrialists and death-squad members. These trials, which convicted about 185 defendants, established the idea that accountability for crimes is not limited to those at the top. The notion that a soldier confronted with an immoral order cannot simply turn off his conscience has become part of most of the world's legal systems.",1999-01-03T05:00:00+0000

''It grew in boarded-up lots and out of neglected rubbish heaps and it was the only tree that grew out of cement.'' ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' published in 1943, was an immediate best seller, and since then has become for its devoted readers a treasured rite of passage. A friend told me it was where she first learned at 12 about sex. Another reader was dismayed to realize that her mother had purloined incidents from Francie's childhood and made them her own, telling her daughter tales from the book as if she had lived them herself. The novelist Helen Schulman would read the book again and again, never finishing, each time starting from the beginning so that for her the book never ended. ",1999-01-03T05:00:00+0000

I was an aspiring 13-year-old cartoonist in 1961 when the feature first began appearing in Mad magazine, and although I admired Antonio Prohias's voluptuous brush strokes, his pantomimed sequences and streamlined drawing style struck me as forced and difficult to decode. I worshiped Mad -- it was the distorting mirror through which I learned to see the world -- but ''Spy Vs.

us,THE LIVES THEY LIVED: Jerome Robbins; Dancing Outside the Box,"''I suppose you know I'm engaged to Nora Kaye,'' Jerome Robbins told Buzz Miller -- an acclaimed show dancer who lived with Robbins from 1950 to 1955 -- during their first weekend together. (The 1952 photograph of Robbins, right, is from Miller's private album.) Even so, Robbins never married Kaye, American ballet's great dramatic ballerina of the 1940's and 1950's. But she was a principal dancer in Robbins's ''Facsimile'' -- appropriately enough about a love triangle. Robbins's truest love was classical ballet. Although he mounted such musical monuments as ''The King and I,'' ''West Side Story'' and ''Gypsy,'' Robbins left the commercial theater after directing and choreographing ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' in 1964. Drama critics begged him to return to Broadway -- ''where he belongs'' was how they typically put it -- without success. Ballet purists, meanwhile, were inclined to regard him as a show-business type aspiring above his talents. Robbins's ballets, however, are masterpieces precisely because his imagination refused to be contained. In works as varied as ''Fancy Free,'' ''Interplay,'' ''The Cage,'' ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' ''Dances at a Gathering'' and ''The Goldberg Variations,'' he exhibited an extraordinary range of style and subject, marrying classical ballet technique to an exploration of human emotions.",1999-01-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Artist vs. the Art World,"''The appearance of struggle,'' Nicholas Fox Weber writes in CLEVE GRAY (Abrams, $39.95), has often been identified with being '' 'the real thing.' '' This is a key argument in his attempt to dispel the aura of privilege that the painter Cleve Gray believes has interfered with the art world's perception of him. Written as a continuing encounter among artist, author and several barnloads of paintings, this monograph is unusual both in its frankly informal tone and its subordination of the work to the worries of the maker. ''I've often been mistaken for a rich boy who could buy his way in,'' Gray laments, in a manner that reveals his private fear more than it elucidates his artistic ambitions. What does emerge from Gray's hand wringing, however, is an oddly affecting and sympathetic portrait of the struggle to create in the face of indifference. The book also traces the delicate path required to achieve success and shows how sincere efforts can turn into self-sabotage -- like Gray's diatribe against the Abstract Expressionists written in 1959 for The American Scholar, in which he excoriated the art world's poor taste. Curiously, as his ideas evolved Gray's own paintings came to resemble that very work he dismissed as lacking content. But his conversion came too late, and despite prestigious commissions, including the ''Threnody'' series -- 14 enormous murals commissioned for the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College of the State University of New York -- poor critical reviews have dogged his career, rendering elusive the recognition that every artist hopes for. Though Gray emerges from this fragile paean to his perseverance as a worthy martyr to art, Weber fails to make a convincing argument for a reconsideration of Gray's work as commensurate with the struggle that made it.

Just a group of devotees who came from as far away as Holland to swap memorabilia and watch concert videos of the pop icon, who died in May.

From the earliest days at Brooklyn Tech with his lifelong partner Martin Kaltman, to the founding of Kaltman Press in New York City in 1932, and on to partnership with Jack Hecht and the evolution to Queens Litho, Max brought his innate technical and creative engineering skills to their growing enterprise. His technical innovations and unique modifications of manufacturing processes helped to grow and secure for the company a prominent place as a leading producer of packaging for recorded music. He took great pleasure in designing numerous factories for the company and homes for members of his family, and never lost the interest in architecture that he developed in high school. In the last decade of his life, Max refocussed his energies from business to his personal life and interests. He enjoyed many creative pursuits, which he shared with Mollie, his beloved wife, to whom he would have been married sixtytwo years next March. He was an accomplished amateur violin player and a prolific sculptor, working in stone at his home studio. All of us at Queens Group extend our condolences to his family: to his wife Mollie, his son Lenny and daughter-in-law Jodi, his daughter Hildi and son-in-law Walter, and his six grandchildren.

But AT&T can still throw its weight around, as it did in forging the most important communications deal of 1998 - its agreement to acquire Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable company, for $32 billion. And that was in addition to taking over Teleport Communications Group for $11.3 billion, and putting together a $10 billion joint venture with British Telecommunications. The big local phone companies also continued to consolidate: In May, Ameritech agreed to become part of SBC Communications for $56 billion; in July, Ivan Seidenberg, far left, chief executive of Bell Atlantic, and his counterpart at GTE, Charles R. Lee, announced the planned $52 billion merger of their companies.

Probably his most noted building is the poetic Wayfarer's Chapel in Palos Verdes, Calif. He also designed the concrete block Millard Studio, 1926; the sleek white and copper Samuel-Novarro house, 1928, whose entry is at left, and the Bowler House, 1963, which looks positively Jetsonian.

A treasured jewel of the Jewish people has been called by the Almighty to return his soul to its eternal reward. An extraordinary and humble man whose very being radiated kindness, dignity and modesty, his life reflected the majesty of Judaic values and ethics. His complete commitment to the health and well being of Klal Yisrael and the strenghthening of Torah in America and Israel were exceptional. His acts of tzedakah and chesed were the daily inspirations that guided his life, but he would not allow plaques or markers to identify his exceptional largesse. In fact, his generosity excelled beyond any rabbinic definition of tzedakah. He always viewed his resources as granted to him by the Almighty to benefit others. In the world of international business and finance where he was a giant, he never forgot for a minute who he was, his purpose in life, and his bond to Jewish tradition. He was tall in stature but reached greater heights in his deeds. When a modern day history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel is written an important chapter will be devoted to the remarkable deeds of compassion that he performed during his life, including his status as a Benefactor of the ''Hospital With a Heart''. The people of Jerusalem and Israel will be grateful for his patronage of the Jesselson Heart Center and the Harry, Judith and Leonard Wilf Woman and Infant Center on ''Charle's Floor,'' in memory of Charles H. Bendheim, z''l. Our sincerest condolences to his mother, Martha, wife, Mem, son, Claude, daughters Rochel Leah and Leslie, and the entire family.

The National Jewish Outreach Program mourns the passing of Zalman Chaim Bernstein, noted businessman, distinguished philanthropist, and devoted Jew. Reb Zalman played a key role in NJOP's founding, and his magnificent generosity through the AviChai Foundation, which he created and endowed, enabled NJOP to offer the Turn Friday Night Into Shabbat and Beginners Services programs to the entire Jewish community of America. Mr. Bernstein's love for the Torah and the Jewish people was exemplified by his vital role in the establishment and support of the Association of Jewish Outreach Professionals, dedicated to improving the professional status and skills of the Jewish outreach worker. Reb Zalman, you will be sorely missed. Our sincere condolences to his mother Martha, wife Mem, son Claude, daughters Leslie and Rochel Leah, and brother Paul. Hamakom Yinachem Etchem Btoch Shear Aveilay Zion V'yerushalayim. Rabbi Ephraim Z. Buchwald, Dir. BERNSTEIN-Zalman Chaim.

The Orthodox Union deeply mourns the passing of a visionary and resourceful friend who invested much of his life and drive in an unparalleled effort to inspire and motivate scores of thousands of alienated Jews to emulate his personal example-to return to the faith of his fathers.

Zalman brought to his philanthropic work a broad vision, incredible energy, a keen eye for detail, and a passionate love for the Jewish people. He will be sorely missed.

In timeless adoration and loving remembrance of a matriarch unsurpassed by all others. Lil was born in NYC and raised in Hurleyville, NY, where her father, Sam Newberg, had a general store. She was like a beautiful and delicate flower, loved to travel and laugh. A child of a bygone era, Lil managed to incorporate Old World values and tradition with modernday life. She was a shrewd businesswoman, had an eye for fashion and was the essence of a true ''yiddisha Momma.'' Lil's unwavering devotion, love, strength and nurturing kept this family bound together despite all tragedy, strife and adversity. Perhaps of greatest merit was her steadfast devotion to her husband of 56 years, who became ill in recent years. Her courage and love enabled Ben Blechman to live with dignity at home. Throughout Lil's lifetime she continued to give of herself and was always prepared to sacrifice for her loved ones. Whatever else failed, we could always depend on Lil. Lil was our home. Her wonderful stories of her life and times always kept us amazed and riveted. Her genuine concern and interest in our lives never waned. What a joy and honor it has truly been to know and love her. An angel of a Mom, a loving and proud grandmother, a champion negotiator and a best friend. She was precious beyond words. Lillian, Our Angel, God Bless and keep you in his loving embrace. Watch over us, Lil, guide us and stay with us forever. We will never stop thinking of you and loving you Your Family and Friends",1999-01-08T05:00:00+0000

The surprisingly still crowd was there to sit back and listen to the quartet Nerve perform a few sets of the dizzyingly fast dance music known as drum-and-bass. With its 164-beat-a-minute tempo and complex rhythms, drum-and-bass is ordinarily machine-generated and played by deejays -- not exactly easy listening. But Nerve, with a stand-up double bass, guitarist, drummer and keyboardist, is one of a handful of downtown bands that have been turning drum-and-bass into a form of music performed live. ''I'm trying to reverse-engineer electronic music,'' said Jojo Mayer, the drummer for Nerve. Popularized by such English artists as Roni Size and Goldie, drum-and-bass has been adopted by artists as disparate as Metallica and Madonna. At Izzy Bar, the full house listened to improvised sets, applauding midsong after a virtuoso drum fill or feedback guitar break as if they were trumpet solos at the Blue Note. ''Live drum-and-bass is very different from listening to a deejay,'' said Yuki Ando, a Japanese graphic-design student at Parson's and a regular at Nerve's shows. ''It's like going to listen to music in a jazz club, but in a more modern way.'' Six months ago, Nerve was playing to a near-empty house, but on Jan. 19, the group will move to Shine, a larger club at 285 West Broadway, for a party called ''Prohibited Beatz.''

This illumination continues nightly and, it might be argued, casts a more meaningful glow. In 1916, the tower atop the building was decorated with four 15-foot windows showing Nipper the dog, leaning toward a gramophone and listening to ''his master's voice.'' It was a beacon displaying a well-known commercial logo and a symbol of industrial Camden. The building closed in 1992, and since then windows have been disappearing to vandalism. But they have been refurbished and now shine in hope of lighting a candle against the darkness of urban decay, and perhaps sparking a rebirth of historic preservation, if not industry.

To bridge the planets, the Kim Lepine Salon at 61st Street and Madison Avenue has patrons take a multiple-choice personality quiz. Questions range from ''What's your favorite TV show?'' to patrons' shopping habits and the kinds of music they listen to. The answers determine whether the client should have a high-, medium- or low-maintenance style. Ms. Lepine, the salon owner, explained the scoring logic: '' 'Friends' is considered a high-maintenance show because the actors' hair is a big part of who they are. 'Law and Order' is moderate maintenance because, while the people need to look good, the focus is on their professional lives. The Super Bowl is no maintenance.'' Quiz scores are explained with celebrity examples. High maintenance is Susan Lucci, the soap-opera star; moderate maintenance, the actress Helen Hunt; no maintenance, the actress Jada Pinkett. ''Customers often can't articulate what they want,'' Ms. Lepine said. ''The quiz helps them communicate with the stylist.'' Still, as one customer asked Ms. Lepine midquiz, suppose you drive a Volvo but want a haircut that reflects a Porsche-like sensibility? ''No cheating,'' Ms. Lepine said.

His innovative, pioneering educational, cultural and community service programs for the residents of the borough of Brooklyn and the City of New York have demonstrated all the positive aspects of collaboration, cooperation and commitment to excellence.

Bailey, the chief curator of the National Gallery of Canada, at the beginning of RENOIR'S PORTRAITS: Impressions of an Age (Yale University/National Gallery of Canada, $30). Financial necessity is the primary answer: commissioned portraits paid the rent. Moreover, we learn that Renoir was the only Impressionist to achieve financial security through the practice of portraiture. ''Yet, just as the Impressionists catered, at one level, to the conventional requirements for bourgeois representation -- namely, portrait painting -- so did they also expand and redefine the genre,'' Bailey writes. During the years of his greatest demand as a portraitist, between 1878 and 1883, Renoir painted his most ambitious compositions of contemporary life, including ''Luncheon of the Boating Party,'' ''Ball at the Moulin de la Galette,'' ''Dance in the City'' and ''Dance in the Country.'' Anne Distel, the chief conservator at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, contributes a cogent essay about the Impressionist patron and collector Leon Clapisson. But it is the art historian Linda Nochlin who offers the sharpest and most perceptive essay in the book, giving the social context for Impressionist portraiture and offering a fascinating explication of Degas's ''Place de la Concorde,'' among other paintings. Nochlin's essay, which scarcely mentions Renoir, is accompanied by reproductions of portraits by fellow Impressionists like Manet, Degas and Cassatt that invite comparison with Renoir and present an odd disjunction; some readers may feel that the detailed, psychologically oriented and less romanticized portraits by these painters are more successful than Renoir's. Nevertheless, Renoir's portraits, Bailey believes, are distinguished by ''the extraordinary light with which they are imbued.'' Robin Lippincott",1999-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Naturally, Naomi denies all, and even if convicted of anything, the likelihood of her doing hard time is remote. But the notion of a supermodel in stir led to thoughts of jailhouse frocks. Prison blues were just too declasse to imagine, vulgar, even, in the context of such physical radiance. We asked a few designers for alternatives.",1999-01-10T05:00:00+0000

And in the cultural turmoil of post-Revolutionary Russia, it was Ms. Semyonova whose dancing made an eloquent case for preserving classical ballet in the new order. However, the oldest, most revered bearer of Russia's ballet traditions is not about to start looking back and writing her memoirs: she's too busy.",1999-01-10T05:00:00+0000

He traveled extensively in Africa and brought back many wonderful stories to go along with his collection of both films and photographs. Ted is survived by two sons, Edward R. (Rob) Bucklin, Jr. (Tina) and Timothy Schauffler Bucklin (Julia), both of whom live in Millbrook. He is also survived by his former wife and good friend, Julie Schauffler Bucklin of Sharon, Conn. He was the loving brother of John J. Bucklin of Pasadena and William N. Bucklin, III of San Francisco. Ted leaves two grandchildren, Taylor Bucklin and Sophia Bucklin, and fourteen nieces and nephews.

It is unfortunate that welfare policy continues to be gripped by the same conflicting impulses to protect and to punish the needy that have characterized American public-assistance policy for more than 200 years. The coexistence of social-services workers and fraud investigators within agencies whose stated purpose is to serve the needy epitomizes this tension. The overworked and undertrained workers on the front lines of welfare reform across the nation deserve some clarification as to whether their duty is to alleviate poverty (an economic condition, let us not forget) or to cut welfare caseloads.

us,"Smart Women, Foolish Choices","In modern fiction about the lives of women in middle age, or fast approaching it, there seems to be one overarching goal -- to create fresh, quirky types with attention-grabbing jobs and wacky lives, characters who make at least three crackling quips per page. Writers will do anything, in other words, to avoid the cliche of the aging woman who fears she'll either lose -- or never find -- the right man. What's remarkable about Toni Graham's first book, THE DAIQUIRI GIRLS (University of Massachusetts, $24.95), a collection of short stories about four 30-something or older women, is that Graham takes characters who could easily become dreary stereotypes -- characters left feeling insecure by failed marriages and failing health, by the realities of aging, by men who treat them badly -- and fleshes them out beautifully, without doing the literary equivalent of a rain dance to convince us they're ''interesting.'' Graham doesn't wallow in these women's vulnerability, but she doesn't apologize for it either. She uses their loneliness and confusion as backdrops for the action, not as personality traits. And her prose is entertaining without being forced: Graham allows a good deal of brainy good humor to flow naturally. (One woman, who gets a chilly reception from her lover's progressive, liberal-thinking family because she's a WASP, notes dryly: ''I saw Phillip's sister Lenore last Sunday night at the family party. Her smile reminded me of the grille of an old Buick, except mean.'') Graham's characters aren't spunky role models, cozy potential best friends or women who run with the wolves. They're the sort who keep the wolves on their toes. Stephanie Zacharek",1999-01-10T05:00:00+0000

The lessons of his life can be measured by his achievements in the medical world and the gifts of loving compassion and generosity that he shared with all who knew him. He learned very early about inequality and discrimination as a poor youth growing up on the streets of the Lower East Side of New York. His drive to change the world from what is to what should be inspired a social consciousness that made him a committed physician who believed in the mission of medicine to comfort and heal. He served as a Navy medical officer in World War II and made the ''D Day'' invasion on Omaha Beach, which convinced him of the horrors of war and fueled his lifelong pacifism. His progressive political vision led him to join with the physician founders of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York in what was the first pre-paid group practice model of health care. His extraordinary leadership abilities resulted in his becoming the Medical Director of the Central Queens Medical Group, the Manhattan Medical Group, the Garden State Medical Group of New Jersey, the President of the Medical Group Council of H.I.P., the Vice Chairman of the Board of H.I.P., the President of Centralized Laboratories, and the President of the Group Council Mutual Insurance Company. His profound commitment to women's health led him to co-found Choices Women's Medical Center in 1971, two years before the Supreme Court legalized abortion. He was the Vice President for Strategic Affairs and was an active, dynamic part of Choices until the day he died. As a physician, he practiced the art as well as the science of medicine, and his patients loved him for it. As a mentor, he inspired many young professionals to move beyond their limitations and live their dreams. As a man, he was honorable, honest, loving, witty, and kind. He will be deeply missed and very fondly remembered by his loving wife, Merle Hoffman, and his devoted son (by his first wife, Bernice Cherkos), Edward Gold, M.D. of New Jersey; daughter-inlaw, Holly Gold; his adored grandchildren, Elizabeth, Marissa and Max; and his loving sister, Thelma and her family of Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TAMARKIN, NORMAN R.","TAMARKIN-Norman R., M.D. Age 60. A prominent Washington, DC, psychiatrist and national expert on political psychology died suddenly while battling a long illness. Born in Youngstown, OH, Dr. Tamarkin graduated from Ohio State Medical School. After completing psychiatric training at Illinois State Psychiatric Institute in 1968, he came to the Washington area to do research at the National Institute of Mental Health. He ran the drug addiction program at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington after which he entered private practice. Dr. Tamarkin was also on the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School and was a consultant to the Public Affairs Commission of the American Psychiatric Association. During the more than 25 years that Dr. Tamarkin practiced psychiatry, he gained a reputation for his ability to help prominent political and entertainment figures deal with their many stresses. At a time when this was considered unorthodox, his sense of intellectual adventure led him to integrate psychological, social and physiological factors in both his medical practice and his life. June Bingham, co-author with Dr. Tamarkin of ''The Pursuit of Health'' (1986), said ''The world is full of people who are a lot better for having known Norman Tamarkin, either professionally or otherwise.'' Dr. Tamarkin was widely loved because of his gift for friendship. Survivors include his companion, Sabrina Cassagnol; his sister, Bryn Tamarkin-Jacobstein; his nephew, Tommy; and scores of loving friends.",1999-01-11T05:00:00+0000

us,The Cost of Living With a Ski Slope At the Back Door,"The architect Robert A. M. Stern has once again mined the past and coined a name. American Alpine is what he calls his style for the shops, restaurants and 73 condominiums he is designing at the heart of Aspen Highlands Village, a 10-acre ski resort in Colorado (top), which is scheduled to open in the winter of 2001. Dennis Wedlick, like Mr. Stern a New York architect, is designing 32 semi-attached houses (above), which will flank the village. He calls the style Great Camp. By either name, the buildings will have stone walls, exposed rafters and beams and giant posts and lintels. What inspired the architecture, Mr. Stern said, were American buildings like the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park and Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone Park. The small scale of the resort -- residents will be able to walk to shops and restaurants and to ski from the slopes to the back door of their houses -- was inspired by European ski villages like Chamonix, France, and Zermatt, Switzerland. In 1995, Gerald Hines, the developer of the resort, invited Mr. Stern to tour European ski resorts with him. ''Chamonix and Zermatt -- those were little villages that evolved a street scene with cafes,'' Mr. Hines said. The two concluded that ''people like intimacy, little shops,'' Mr. Hines said, ''and they don't like a straight line in the street.'' The 5,000-square-foot houses will sell for $2.7 million to $3 million each (no prices yet for the condos); the cost of developing the resort, which will extend over 65 acres, is expected to exceed $250 million, Mr. Hines said.",1999-01-14T05:00:00+0000

us,N.F.L. Conference Championships; NATIONAL CONFERENCE,"The Falcons have the pedigree. Coach Dan Reeves is only one of three coaches to take teams to both conference championships (Bill Parcells and Chuck Knox are the others). They have the confidence. Running back Jamal Anderson said this week he is not intimidated by the Vikings. They have the offense and defense. Atlanta averages 342 yards a game of offense, and the Falcons' defense is rated third in the conference. The Falcons seem to have everything, so why won't they beat the Minnesota Vikings? Because while Atlanta is impressive, the Vikings possess potentially the best offense of all time. They have unparalled explosion, especially at home, where they are unbeaten this season. To beat the Vikings a team cannot play conservatively, which the Falcons are sure to try. Atlanta will attempt to duplicate the game plan of the only team Minnesota lost to this season, Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers used a pounding running game and kept the Minnesota offense off the field for much of the afternoon. But there are two important distinctions. First, the game was on grass, and it somewhat nullified the quick Vikings' defense. Second, the offensive line of Tampa Bay is bigger than Atlanta's, and that made a difference. Atlanta will score some points, because Anderson will probably gain more than 100 yards, but the Falcons will see what each team that has come to the Metrodome has all season -- it is a different ball game in the Vikings' house. They jump on you quick, then when you fall behind, 14-3 or 17-7, the crowd becomes a significant factor in the game. Reeves has pumped crowd noise into the Falcons' facility, but that doesn't come close to duplicating the effect. Atlanta's defense, average despite its ranking, gets savaged. A close game early becomes a blowout in the end. Vikings, 38-20",1999-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Intimate Encounters,"Perhaps no one in our time has been able to capture the essence of an individual's character in the snap of a shutter with as much artistry as the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson. With a searching eye and an intuitive grasp of human psychology, he has roamed the world over the last seven decades, recording the faces of the unnamed and anonymous as well as some of the greatest artists of the century. In TETE A TETE: Portraits by Henri Cartier-Bresson (Bulfinch/Little, Brown, $65), he has selected some of the most haunting and memorable images of his prolific career. Here we see a portrait of a robed Matisse, looking like a pampered pasha; a young, distracted-looking Jean-Paul Sartre, pipe at his lips as he converses on the Pont des Arts in Paris; a pudgy-faced Jean Genet, dragging on a cigar with an expression of amused indulgence; and an aging Colette, flashing the camera a coquettish glance. Included too is a trove of photographs that are among his most legendary -- a stunning picture of Samuel Beckett looking more hawk than human, a classic shot of the melancholy Alberto Giacometti lost in thought and an electrifying picture of a hoary Ezra Pound, his brow furrowed in barely suppressed fury. Marcel Duchamp shares the camera frame with one of his ready-mades, an expression of ironic detachment suffusing his face. A bare-chested Picasso stands beside a tousled bed, unabashed in his frank physicality. ''In whatever picture-story we try to do, we are bound to arrive as intruders,'' Cartier-Bresson once wrote. Yet his great gift is to take us inside the intimate encounter without creating a feeling that we have trespassed. Andrea Barnet",1999-01-17T05:00:00+0000

Ms. Ito was the widow of musician Teiji Ito, with whom she sometimes performed and with whom she made the widely shown documentary film about Haitian Voudoun, ''Divine Horsemen'', utilizing the footage and music recorded in Haiti by Maya Deren in 1947 to 1955. An accomplished film editor, Cherel Ito will perhaps best be remembered for her black and white still photographs. Startling in their beauty, these works reveal her natural instinct for stylized composition and her deep sensitivity to the human condition. Cherel Ito is survived by her mother, Mimi Feldman, her stepdaughter, Tavia Ito, and her three brothers, Dr. Gary Stolzoff, Jeffrey and Bob Winett. The estate of Maya Deren, which Ms. Ito administered, has been conveyed to Daren scholar Catrina Neiman, New York City. The important Daren collection of Haitian ritual objects and art which Ito cared for has been donated to The Museum of Natural History's African American collection, New York City. The memorial service will be held Monday evening, January 18, 1999 at 7:00 PM at 814 Broadway, third floor. Donations in the name of Cherel Ito can be made to Gilda's Club, 195 West Houston Street, New York, New York 10014.",1999-01-17T05:00:00+0000

His latest collaboration with himself, JOHNNY ON THE SPOT (Margaret K. McElderry, $16; ages 5 to 9), is an exciting yarn set in the old New York of radio serials, when gangsters toted machine guns in violin cases. Sorel's vivid and engaging illustrations include some big urban tableaus that capture the romance and innocence of the era. The plot is just as lively. When young Johnny's radio conks out during his favorite program, he takes it to Dr. Zaga, the mysterious and eccentric inventor (is there any other kind?) who lives downstairs. Dr. Zaga zaps it with ''a small charge of electrostatic magnetism,'' which causes the radio to broadcast not today's news but tomorrow's. This allows Sorel to present, in quick, deft strokes, some of the usual paradoxes and moral quandaries of time travel. Dr. Zaga tells Johnny that they must not interfere with the future, but he does not explain why, and in any event they do it anyhow, in various ways. At first Johnny merely takes pictures of a bank robbery and sells them to a newspaper, but soon he is rescuing a girl in a burning building and hanging out at the race track, placing bets. (''It's not gambling,'' Dr. Zaga explains to a reluctant Johnny. ''We know which horses will win.'')",1999-01-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Bidding Wars,"Want to lunch with George Soros? For $100,000 you can chew over money markets with the philanthropic financier. Rather discuss metaphors with Norman Mailer? A mere $2,800 will get you a seat at the writer's table. These are but two recent examples of who's up for grabs at the charity auctions that every school, foundation and nonprofit group in the business of good works seem to be staging. Where bidders once took out their checkbooks for a lock of celebrity hair or a handkerchief touched by a noted nose, they're now using their big bucks to buy ''an experience'' with ''a name,'' be it mogul or model, author or actress, pol or potentate. And as illustrated by Soros and Mailer, the index on fame can really fluctuate. As a rule, circumspection speaks when you talk to organizers of such benefits, whether out of true noblesse oblige or potential embarrassment. They insist, a tad defiantly, that the varying price tags say nothing about the relative worth of celebs on the auction block, either in terms of persona or profession. ''If Norman Mailer were auctioned off at a charitable event where there were people capable of paying 50 times more than they were paying, he would have gone for 50 times more,'' says David Saltzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation in New York. Maybe so, but in addition to Soros, Saltzman's gang also sold a hockey lesson with Wayne Gretzky for a hundred grand, the same donation the Boy Scouts got for a breakfast with Phil Condit, the Boeing bigwig. Gioietta Vitale, who as chairman of the American-Italian Cancer Foundation recruited Mailer for her cause, isn't fazed. ''Next year, we'll just have some C.E.O.,'' she says.",1999-01-17T05:00:00+0000

Awakening in the middle of the night, Helen finds herself sharing a compartment with an old woman named Rosa Kovslovsky, who is somehow linked to her -- so closely linked that Anna starts to believe her own body parts are being replaced by Rosa's. Then this odd companion hands her a small box full of wonders and clues, which will accompany Helen on a tour of Europe in search of much more than her missing spouse. The box contains a book on human anatomy, jewels and notes. And, in a nice twist, the design of Barbara Hodgson's novel THE SENSUALIST (Chronicle, $22.95) incorporates all these visual aids. As readers follow Helen, we see the same images she is seeing: illustrated plates from ancient anatomy texts, medicine vials, a pearl-studded picture frame. Like the historical works she researches, Helen's box -- and Hodgson's book -- provides a way of interweaving ''the significance of the words with the importance of the pictures.'' Helen soon finds herself embroiled in a historical mystery as printing blocks from the works of the anatomist Vesalius seem to have resurfaced long after they were reportedly destroyed in World War II. Helen's husband was on their trail, and she quickly resumes his quest. ''The Sensualist'' is a quirky and intense novel, full of weird events and oddball characters (a man who is interviewing every person in the Vienna telephone directory; a doctor who is inspired to become a train conductor when the conductor on his own train drops dead) built around an investigation of the senses. The best part is Hodgson's combination of pictures and text: as a physical object, ''The Sensualist'' becomes an integral part of the plot, guiding the reader as the complex narrative unravels.

In the two years since Congress passed tough new enforcement legislation, the Feds have deported 300,000 immigrants, twice as many as in the two years before. These days, coming to America illegally is a real crap shoot -- which is precisely the point of an interactive exhibition called ''Juegos Ilegales/Illegal Games'' that opened Thursday at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo. Created by Anaida Hernandez, the casinolike installation allows visitors to embark down the risky path of unlawful entry. ''Immigrants dream of a better life,'' Hernandez says. ''This exhibition is about the chances they take to achieve that dream.'' The artist herself arrived in New York (legally) two years ago from Puerto Rico.

us,"Woodman, Spare That Transvestite","In his eighth novel, TREE SURGERY FOR BEGINNERS (Faber/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25), Patrick Gale takes up the elements of the 18th-century comic novel - abandoned babies, characters in disguise, the wanderings of a feckless youth - and recombines them into an elegant romance that manages to be both playful and wise. Passionate but slightly dim, Lawrence Frost, an unhappily married English tree surgeon, returns home one morning after a fight with his wife, Bonnie, to discover that he has been accused of murdering her. The missing spouse soon turns up at the local police station, only to confirm Lawrence's suspicions that she has been having an affair with Craig McBridge, the kind of architect who designs everything ''down to the chopping board and shoe rack.'' His marriage and his equilibrium upended, Lawrence agrees to accompany his bachelor uncle on a bridge players' cruise to Miami. Although neither the endless rounds of cards nor the shipboard classes in vegetable sculpture win him over, he does fall in love with a transvestite chanteuse named Lala, whose big jaw and muscular legs make her look like ''Sophia Loren crossed with Tony Curtis.'' Rebuffed, Lawrence eventually makes his way to California, where he settles in as a ''glorified groundsman'' at a ranch-cum-health-spa run by a gay couple. In prose of sparkling precision, Gale serves up still more misadventures - satirical, farcical and tragic sentially comedic vision, the novel ends with lost identities revealed and multiple happy pairings of all persuasions. With its subtle interplay of dark and light elements, ''Tree Surgery for Beginners'' is infused with a smiling, Mozartean sensibility, reminding us that we can ''go so awry, break so utterly apart and still find the strength to continue.''",1999-01-24T05:00:00+0000

So upset was Roseann Trezza, the assistant director of the Associated Humane Societies, that she began a drive to provide bulletproof vests for all the state's police dogs, all through donated money. Last month, Vested Interest, as her fund is called, presented 47 vests to dogs, and last week, an order went out for 21 more. Ms. Trezza priced vists at as much as $1,700 apiece but found a company that would see them to her for $300. That is a small investment, she points out, in an animal that often costs $5,000 to buy and thousands more to train. She has received a number of letters from police officers thanking her and reporting that the dogs moved easily and seemed comfortable wearing the vests.

This surreal image was but one of many such gruesome pictures designed by the Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913) and created for Antonio Vanegas Arroyo, a leading publisher of broadsheets -- single-page periodicals -- that reported on lurid crimes, executions, bullfights, cultural events and politics. A precursor of today's tabloids, broadsheets were cheaply printed and widely distributed as news and entertainment to Mexico City's urban masses. They were the most ephemeral of printed matter, bought, read and tossed away -- even Posada did not save the majority of his works. But ''taken together, they form a 'people's history' of life in Mexico City during the years bracketing the turn of the 20th century,'' writes the book's author, Patrick Frank, who teaches art history at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Posada was a hugely prolific commercial artist, designing newspaper advertisements, product labels and magazine illustrations; his work and import were rediscovered in the 1920's by the Mexican political muralists Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco and the French printmaker Jean Charlot. Posada, whose imagery is reminiscent of Goya, is now considered one of Mexico's most acerbic commentators and satirists. Although the prints are mistakenly reproduced in halftone, which diminishes the strength of the artist's powerful black line, ''Posada's Broadsheets'' nonetheless offers an insightful analysis of both the art and the history of the time when it was created.

Even the two Nobel Laureates on staff, who could very easily have slipped back into their caps and gowns in the dead of night and pretended none of this ever happened, have stayed and worked, quietly. The man in charge, John Meriwether, has shown a genius for lying low. Photographers in helicopters circle his house, and journalists bang on his front door at odd hours and frighten his wife. Yet whenever the question ''Who is John Meriwether?'' has demanded an answer, it has been supplied not by those who know him and work with him but by a self-appointed cast of casual acquaintances and perfect strangers. They have described Meriwether and his colleagues as reliable Wall Street stereotypes: the overreaching, self-deluded speculators.

He received a Doctor of Laws Degree from Giessen University in Hesse, Germany. He became an anti-Nazi activist in the early 1930's and, in 1933, fled to Holland under threat of death. There, in 1938 he met his future wife Margot Caan. After the German invasion of Holland, the two joined the Dutch Underground where, for several years he smuggled endangered Jews across the German/Holland border and, she, forged I.D. cards for the escapees. The couple married in 1942 at the height of the War. They continued working in the Underground and, after a few narrow escapes from the Gestapo and their Dutch sympathizers, the couple was forced to find refuge by hiding in a loft. They remained there for more than two years surviving the Holocaust. In 1980, Donald Wolf was invited back to Holland to be honored for his work with the Underground at a nationally televised event. After the War, the couple immigrated to the United States and became a successful book designing team: known for their expertise in editing and designing educational books for children. These included: Simon and Shuster's, the Fireside World Encyclopedias; Grosset and Dunlop's, How and Why Wonder Books and Parent Magazine's, New Wonderworld Encyclopedia. The couple won the Publisher's Award for the most successful teamwork in designing books in both 1958 and 1961.

Upon his retirement, he served the Renbrook School and then the Mooreland Hill School as interim headmaster, Bob Lazear dared generations of young people to live life with gusto, introduced them to the world's joys, exposed them to the world's injustices, and incited students to fight for their beliefs with compassion as well as passion, wisdom as well as fire. He had a wonderful life and a beautiful voice, and was as likely to burst into a Gershwin lyric as he was to offer a hearty greeting.

Some might stash the cash for retirement; others would plunk it down on black or red in Las Vegas.

us,Never Marry a Dog,"In 1993, Yoko Tawada won the Akutagawa Prize, one of Japan's highest literary awards, for the title story in THE BRIDEGROOM WAS A DOG (Kodansha, $19). Here a schoolteacher's retelling of a randy fairy tale -- involving a young princess promised in marriage to a dog -- makes her a favorite subject of local gossip. Yet the tale takes on an unsettling reality when a doglike mystery man quietly but firmly seduces the teacher, even taking over her housework and cooking. His aura of mystery dissipates, however, when she learns that her accomplished lover is on the lam from a wife and a job, and is carrying on a homosexual affair with the father of one of her students. In ''Missing Heels,'' a poor mail-order bride, spiritual sister to Kafka's K., travels by train to an unfamiliar city, where she moves into the eerie house of her new husband and finds only circumstantial evidence of his existence: a morning cup of tea, her daily cash allowance on the night stand, the sounds of quickly disappearing footsteps. She begins to imagine her husband as a hideous old man or, more hopefully, a shy, orphaned young heir -- until her curiosity drives her to break into his locked room and she finds a reality much stranger than her imaginings. In the last of this trio of stories, ''The Gotthard Railway,'' it is the journey rather than the destination that matters when a quirkily philosophical woman takes a surreal railroad trip through a Swiss mountain tunnel. As translated by Margaret Mitsutani, Tawada's slender accounts of alienation achieve a remarkable potency. Each one sustains a masterly balance between the tenuous but meaningful connections of dreams and the direct, earthy storytelling of folk tales. Michael Porter",1999-01-31T05:00:00+0000

us,"A Little Here, a Little There","Jackson Pollock (1912-56), who had little native talent for art and none for words, revolutionized painting and provoked more words about his work, and himself, than he probably spoke in his lifetime. His celebrated ''drip paintings'' -- executed on the floor, in a series of dancelike movements that became almost as famous as the canvases themselves through Hans Namuth's photographs -- have been interpreted as everything from sublimely lyrical works of art to violent assaults on the whole tradition of painting; certainly they influenced any number of ''subversive'' artists -- sculptors and performance artists as well as painters -- who came after him. And Pollock's life, filled as it was with emotional turmoil that ended with his death in a drunken car crash, has been variously depicted as the apotheosis of romantic suffering and a cautionary tale about the dangers of fame in an age of mass media. All these contradictory theories about the man and his work are scrupulously explored and evaluated in JACKSON POLLOCK (Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, $75). Kirk Varnedoe, chief curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, and Pepe Karmel, an adjunct assistant curator, have also made an original contribution to Pollock scholarship by analyzing the techniques he used to produce the poured paintings -- techniques that were much more varied and complex than once was thought. Ironically, as Varnedoe acknowledges, the beautiful reproductions of these paintings, which are the centerpiece of the book, can only remind us how much their extraordinary power depends on their physical presence. The sense of explosive energy, the feeling that these strangely rhapsodic objects were never exactly made but simply are, gets lost in reproduction. So, far from being abstract, they may be the most concrete paintings ever made. Evelyn Toynton",1999-01-31T05:00:00+0000
