(AMC) HALT AND CATCH FIRE Set in Texas during the 1980s tech boom, this new series stars Lee Pace (Lincoln, Pushing Daisies) as Joe McMillan, a former IBM salesman who enlists the help of a has-been computer engineer (Scoot McNairy, above left, with Mackenzie Davis and Mr. Pace) and a talented computer science student (Ms. Davis) to reverse-engineer an IBM PC. The story is fiction, but based on the actual technology race of that decade, in which companies were trying to create their own version of a PC. With AMCs Mad Men, focusing on the ad executive Don Draper, ending next year, the network seems to be looking for another period drama that can seduce viewers with old-fashioned customs and atavistic sins, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. Joe, like Don, is handsome, suave and moodily enigmatic, a salesman who pitches his product with passionate intensity. Unfortunately, Halt and Catch Fire doesnt seem to carry the same panache. The period music is fun, but there is nothing particularly glamorous about high-tech Dallas. Most of all, the early 1980s are not a distant enough memory to cast a retro glow.

CBS Television Distribution, which owns the show with Tribune Media, has announced a cancellation because of a ratings decline among the viewers most advertisers pay for in late night, people between the ages of 18 and 49. (The ratings leader in that group is Jimmy Fallon on NBC.) Mr. Hall, left, who had a hit syndicated late-night show in the early 1990s, revived the franchise with some fanfare in September, and he scored some early impressive ratings. But the late-night scene had become intensely crowded, with as many as 10 shows fighting for a shrinking number of viewers. The ratings drop set in motion a pattern of downgrades from a host of local television stations, which began relegating Mr. Halls show to little-watched hours of the night. In February, his old friend Jay Leno appeared on the show with a letter confirming a second year. The ratings slide forced CBSs syndication division to rescind that decision.",2014-06-01T21:07:42+0000

The film stars the Fab Four poking fun at Beatlemania in a plotline that takes viewers through the misadventures before a big show. And all the way through the picture, there are frenzied episodes of the Beatles encounters with squealing fans and with reporters who ask silly questions, all in a facile, witty vein, Mr. Crowther wrote. But more than this, its a fine conglomeration of madcap clowning in the old Marx Brothers style, and it is done with such a dazzling use of camera that it tickles the intellect and electrifies the nerves. Above, Mr. Lester at the train window with the Beatles. ",2014-06-02T04:16:00+0000

Jamie Foxx (above right, with Mr. Tatum) plays the president, who needs saving  from the terrorists, and from big business  if only for his workable peace plan for the Middle East. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, Richard Jenkins, Lance Reddick and Jason Clarke portray the administrations team players. The film is as demented and entertaining as promised, and a little less idiotic than feared, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Emmerich makes the opening siege unsettling enough to grab your attention and then, once he has it, begins folding in lighter moments  one-liners, cartoonish bits of business, laughably impossible situations and stunts  that ensure that at least this American collapse doesnt end up feeling too heavy.

On Monday, the government sent jets to bomb rebel areas after rebels came close to taking over a government checkpoint, Mr. Bakry said.

The country has had a surge of cases since March  many apparently originating in hospitals  but they seem to be falling off, an adviser to the Health Ministry said. That surge led to the dismissal of the health minister, and on Monday, his replacement dismissed the deputy health minister who has been the public face of the countrys response. The deputy, Dr. Ziad Memish, was recently  profiled in The Lancet for his preparations for the annual visit to Mecca by up to three million Muslims. Most of the 133 new cases are from March and April, suggesting that many were either not tested or not reported. ",2014-06-04T04:52:23+0000

The six-piece assortment gets its striking shade from woad, a medicinal plant in the broccoli family that the designers discovered in a workshop in a village near Toulouse, France. The ancient species was a key component of southern Frances economy during the Medieval and Renaissance eras; royalty and high society, including Napoleon, favored it for its distinctive blue hue. Its also known for the anti-inflammatory and healing properties it provides when applied to the skin, and is unusual in the way that it continues to live as a garment ages. The color grows stronger as you wash the material, and, if left in the closet, it will become irregular, explains Verdelhan. Its such a beautiful, particular blue, and is quite important in Toulouse.

While Justice Minister Peter MacKay said the bill aimed to focus on pimps and the customers of prostitutes, he added that prostitutes who offered their services in public areas where children might be present would, in most cases, be fined.

In Canberra, there are no beaches or iconic opera houses, and European chic is best sought an hours flight away in Melbourne. But what the bush capital lacks in big-city tousle, it makes up for in big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly. Set on an artificial lake and spread across a valley between mountain ranges, Canberra is the Brasilia of Australia, designed by the American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, who won a competition in 1911 to create the countrys political heart because Sydney and Melbourne couldnt stop bickering about their own fabulousness. A year after the citys centennial celebrations and with a steady influx of artists and gastronomes, Canberra is best appreciated with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.",2014-06-05T14:34:09+0000

Iran says the program is for civilian purposes, while the United States says it is a military program.

The Arab News quoted Fahd Balghuneim, the agriculture minister, as saying the tests to determine the extent of infection would be conducted via blood or mucus samples. Saudi Arabia has in the past few days adopted a more aggressive response to the virus, known as MERS, which originated in the country two years ago and has been linked to camels, which spread the virus to humans. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry said a review showed that the death toll was 282, 92 more than reported a day earlier, and it announced that the deputy health minister had been relieved. On Wednesday, in the clearest evidence yet that MERS can be passed directly from camels to humans, research published in The New England Journal of Medicine said genetic sequencing had shown that a Saudi man who died of MERS in November had a strain virtually identical to that in one of the camels in his herd.

Hes now swinging from the high wire with THOSE WHO WISH ME DEAD (Little, Brown, $26), a heart-thumping backwoods adventure that sends two creatively sadistic killers into Montanas Beartooth Mountains, where they spark a monster forest fire to flush out the only witness to their crimes: Jace Wilson, a 14-year-old boy. Jace was just trying to escape his reputation as class coward when he dived into a quarry near his Indiana home. But when he swam into a dead man  and spotted the killers flinging a second victim into the water  Jace knew he was going to die. Reborn with a new name, he finds himself among the bad kids in a grueling wilderness survival course, parked there when his parents couldnt be persuaded to put him in a traditional witness protection program. Jaces hunters, the Blackwell brothers, are heartless sociopaths whose professional detachment is etched in their unnervingly precise grammar and careful diction. (The way they say things.

us,"Classical Playlist: John Adams, Handel, Lewis Spratlan and More","LEWIS SPRATLAN: Apollo and Daphne Variations; other worksBoston Modern Orchestra Project, Gil Rose, conductorEliot Gattegno, on soprano and alto saxophones(BMOP/Sound)The American composer Lewis Spratlan, born in 1940, gained wide attention in 2000 when a concert version of Act II of his opera Life Is a Dream, which was completed in 1978 but had never been staged, won the Pulitzer Prize for Music. This welcome new recording from the impressive Boston Modern Orchestra Project offers three ingeniously written and distinctive Spratlan works. A Summers Day (2008) uses a simple, dreamy Celtic tune at the start as a jumping-off place for an elusive, complex suite that ruminates on the tensions below the surface of an inviting day. In his Concerto for Saxophone and Orchestra (2006), Mr. Spratlan finds a gripping, fresh approach to what might seem an awkward classical music genre; the music evolves from mystical musings to raw, jazzy vehemence. Apollo and Daphne Variations is like a Spratlan version of a Schumann suite, with alternating episodes of whimsy, frenzy and innocence. (Anthony Tommasini)",2014-06-06T16:29:19+0000

The case involves two large portrayals of Adam and Eve by the 14th-century master Lucas Cranach the Elder that were taken from the prominent Jewish Dutch dealer Jacques Goudstikker in a forced sale and are now in the collection of the Norton Simon Museum in California. Goudstikkers daughter-in-law, Marei Von Saher, has been trying to reclaim the dyptich for years but has repeatedly run into legal stumbling blocks. In a 2-to-1 decision, though, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed a lower courts decision and permitted Ms. Von Sahers lawsuit to proceed. The diptych was recovered and returned to the Netherlands after World War II, when the Dutch negotiated a partial settlement with Goudstikkers widow, which did not cover the work.The Norton Simon bought the paintings in 1971 from a collector. In 2012, a district judge ruled against Ms. Von Saher, saying that the United States had fulfilled its obligations to restitute the art, and that any effort to alter the Dutch resolution of the case would interfere with the federal governments sole authority over foreign policy. But the appeals panel noted that the United States had signed two international agreements  one in Washington in 1998, and another in Terezin, Czech Republic, in 2009  intended to remove obstacles to the recovery of possessions stolen by the Nazis. The Norton Simon released a statement saying it remains confident that it holds complete and proper title to the paintings and that it would continue to pursue, consistent with its fiduciary duties, all appropriate legal options.",2014-06-06T22:18:02+0000

(HBO) ENOUGH SAID (2013) Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in a Golden Globe-nominated role, plays Eva, a divorced massage therapist in Los Angeles who finds her life emptying out as her daughter (Tracey Fairaway) prepares to leave for Sarah Lawrence College. Then she meets Albert (James Gandolfini, above, with Ms. Louis-Dreyfus), another divorced parent of a college-bound girl, and although he isnt her usual type, Eva suddenly finds herself falling for this funny, tender and sexy slob. Enter Marianne (Catherine Keener), a glamorous bohemian poet and Evas new client  who, Eva finds out a little too late, also happens to be Alberts former wife. And so Eva listens to Mariannes complaints about her ex  hes a bore and a loser, clumsy in bed and unable to take care of himself  and surreptitiously tries to correct the faults in Albert that caused their marriage to disintegrate. The real genius of Enough Said is that it takes this entirely plausible anecdotal circumstance and unlocks both its farcical potential and its latent profundity, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this small miracle of a movie written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. This movie will make you laugh and leave you in tears. Some of the pathos is the accidental byproduct of seeing Mr. Gandolfini, so playful and alive, in one of his final major movie roles and feeling once again the loss of his remarkable gift. There is also the pang of the empty nest, that mixture of grief and pride that is the special anguish of modern parents. But there is also something deeper. The ache that Enough Said leaves behind comes from the blunt force of truth. ",2014-06-07T05:00:03+0000

This approach has been replaced by less extensive surgery that, through decades of clinical trials, has proved to be equally effective at treating patients, as well as safer and less disfiguring. Even simple mastectomies, in which most nodes and the muscles were left intact, have become far less common. Dr. J. Dirk Iglehart, director of the Susan F. Smith Center for Womens Cancers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, estimated that he now performs a tenth of the number of mastectomies than when he entered the field in the 1970s.",2014-06-09T15:30:15+0000

As an aperitivo, the Negroni opens up your palate, kick-starts your digestion and prepares you for the meal ahead of you. It actually makes you think about all the flavors your are experiencing, and I think thats part of why it lends itself to being so relevant to chefs developing their own versions.

On Monday, North Korea said that raising a racket over a nonexistent human rights issue was a politically motivated campaign to defame its government. It said the United Nations office and its staff would not be excepted from being targets of its punishment. In March, a panel of United Nations investigators published a report documenting what it called systematic and widespread human rights violations against political prisoners and others in the North. The United Nations has said it hopes that a field office in South Korea, where a large number of North Korean refugees have settled, will aid its investigation of human rights abuses in the North.

General Brun, speaking at Israels annual Herzliya Conference on policy and security, said that Iran was abiding by a temporary agreement with major powers, and that economic pressures on the country are leading it toward a dialogue, which we view as serious, on a permanent agreement. The temporary accord expires on July 20, and diplomats have said significant obstacles remain in achieving a permanent agreement to guarantee that Irans nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.

Established decades earlier by Carvin (Alan Alda), now in a wheelchair and battling memory loss, and his hippie friends, the commune is home to a touchy-feely guitar-strumming collage led by Seth (Justin Theroux), a creepy Lothario; and a novelist and nudist (Joe Lo Truglio) who wears the occasional sanitary pouch (like a hairnet, but lower) when hes crushing grapes for homemade wine. Part of what gives this movie unexpected resonance is that Linda and George have joined only somewhat voluntarily, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this mostly funny comedy from David Wain.

The book recounts Gaimans early days as a hungry arts journalist and his rise to cult success as a writer of comic books, notably the Sandman series, before he turned his hand to novels. It also reminds readers that Neil himself (as hes known on Twitter) once wrote a scrapbookish tribute of his own: His first published book  written solely for the money, he says  was Duran Duran: The First Four Years of the Fab Five (1984). I got a phone call from a lady, Gaiman explains in an interview cited in the book, and she said would you like to write a rock n roll book for us? A rock n roll biography? And I thought, Oh God, yes! Im in!  Gaiman suggested a handful of subjects, including the Velvet Underground, David Bowie and Elvis Costello, before the editor interrupted: Do you want to write the Duran Duran book, the Barry Manilow book or the Def Leppard book?

(HBO) THE CONJURING (2013) Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, above, play Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life paranormal investigators who declared an infamous Dutch colonial-style house on Long Island haunted, leading to more than a dozen Amityville movies. Their target this time is a Rhode Island farmhouse, where the blissful dreams of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Tayor and Ron Livingston) and their five daughters become a moaning, creaking nightmare when they find themselves playing cat-and-mouse with an evil force. The director, James Wan, smartly keeps enough distance from the Warrens that you can see that these true believers are also hovering at the edge of dangerous fanaticism, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. That gives the movie a shiver of political currency, even if a greater, more sustaining pleasure of this particular haunted-house fantasy is how it works as a metaphor for moviegoing itself. When the Perrons first settle into their house, theyre facing the future with bright, anxious smiles that arent much different from those of the horror-film faithful who are waiting nervously, hopefully, to be jolted by the next great shocker.

(Starz Cinema) HELLO I MUST BE GOING (2012) A divorced 30-something (Melanie Lynskey) finds a haven from her adult problems in the suburban Connecticut home of her critical mother (Blythe Danner) and indulgent father (John Rubinstein) in this comedy written by Sarah Koskoff and directed by Todd Louiso. There, she finds sex and romance with the 19-year-old stepson (Christopher Abbott, above with Ms. Lynskey) of a potential client her father is desperate to impress, who has allowed his doting mother (Julie White) to believe he is gay. Needless to say, there are complications, some farcical, some belonging more to the realm of therapeutic melodrama, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. This is ultimately a tale of affirmation, self-acceptance and second chances, and its lessons, while not unwelcome, are a bit too forced and neatly packaged to make it fully satisfying. But when Ms. Lynskey and Mr. Abbott are together, there are inklings of a wilder, riskier, less predictable movie  one you may wish the characters could escape into, even though you know they never will.",2014-06-17T05:00:03+0000

It is impossible, he writes, to mount a coherent anti-Clinton campaign because there is no issue that divides the mass of Democrats. Theres no equivalent of the intra-Democrat war over the Iraq War that gave us Dean v. Kerry and than Obama v. Clinton; the neoliberal/populist debate over Wall Street is muddled and complicated; theres unanimity on the need to tackle inequality; the education reform debate is real but doesnt matter enough at the federal level to shape presidential politics; and the partys demographic diversity coexists with increasing ideological conformity.

But thats pure hindsight, and looking forward most of the strategic options being discussed look somewhat fantastical, from the invasion 2.0 favored by the editors of The Weekly Standard (in whichspecial operators, and perhaps regular U.S. military units would rout ISIS, and then somehow re-join together what Maliki has very deliberately put asunder) to the ally-with-Tehran option advanced as the thinking internationalists alternative(which even its advocates acknowledge requires lending U.S. resources to the cause ofa strengthened expansionary Iran), to the targeted air strikes reportedly being contemplated by the administration (which, as a certain general with some in-theater experience just pointed out, would risk turning the U.S. military into the air force for Shia militias).",2014-06-18T17:15:02+0000

It sells clocks and watches from Braun, flatware by Konstantin Grcic for Serafino Zani, and classic posters by Bruno Munari and Enzo Mari for Danese. Upstairs, shoppers will find furniture and lighting from &Tradition, Santa & Cole, Max Bill and the Josef Albers Foundation. The 6,000-square-foot complex includes a library stocked with books on industrial design and will be open to the public for research. Plans are afoot to host industrial design conferences and exhibitions.

us,Descend Into Giddiness,"I think it would change our lives if we could slide more, said the Belgian artist Carsten Hller, who has been building slides on and off since 1998. The structures not only carry you efficiently from place to place, he believes, but they also create a special state of mind that, borrowing a phrase from the French sociologist Roger Caillois, he likes to describe as voluptuous panic. On Wednesday, Mr. Holler unveiled his first free-standing slide on the campus of the furniture company Vitra in Weil am Rhein, Germany. It is a steel spiral descending from a 100-foot-high tower with a platform that offers a rare elevated view of the architectural masterworks around it. (Among the neighbors are buildings by lvaro Siza, Tadao Ando and Zaha Hadid.) Topping the structure is a large, numberless clock that is positioned askew so that viewers must tilt their heads and guess the correct time. Mr. Holler prefers that idea to consulting a cellphone, a gesture that can be construed as rude. People think you could be checking your email, he said.

Instead, that Jersey music man Frankie Valli and the other Seasons, along with a crowd of central-casting types, gather one last time and together warble and fancy-foot down a back-lot street. They finish big and then they all stop, staring straight ahead as sweat pops and bodies tremble under the now harsh lighting. Thats entertainment, baby, and it is hard work.

But thats the case with the British soul artist Christian Gregory, who started Movement Records in London last year as a platform for emerging soul artists in the U.K. There were a few labels doing kind of throwback stuff, he says, but none that really cater to soul as an art form in itself. The child of classical musicians, Gregory started looking for his own musical direction at an early age. My parents record collection is mostly orchestral stuff, so I would hunt through and look for anything that was different, he says. The closest thing I could usually find was either jazz or swing. By his teens, his love for soul had taken hold.",2014-06-19T17:00:46+0000

In the past few months, Egyptian courts have drawn international condemnation by issuing hundreds of death sentences against Brotherhood members and supporters after rushed trials that have relied on questionable evidence. On Thursday, the court referred the cases of Mohamed Badie, above, the Brotherhoods spiritual leader, and 13 other people to Egypts highest religious authority, in what is seen as the first step in confirming the death sentences. Mr. Badie was also sentenced to death in April, in an unrelated case, but he is entitled to a retrial because the sentence was passed in absentia. In the latest trial, Mr. Badie and other senior leaders, including Essam el-Erian and Mohamed el-Beltagy, faced charges that included inciting murder during violence in Cairo last August.

It would have taken mad willfulness to drag his wife and four children out of their settled New Hampshire life in a quixotic assault on the London literary scene. Still, he was soon spending a candlelit evening with Yeats in the poets curtained rooms, having come to the attention of that stormy petrel Ezra Pound, who lauded him in reviews back home.

Too tall, spindly, self-described as a leftover from a novel Graham Greene had decided not to write, he had managed through a stubbornness born of sheer neurotic panic to wheedle his way, despite considerable and justified resistance from the United States Navy, into private quarters on the giant but very crowded vessel: the Vice-Presidential Room, no less. His report of his first day on board is a nonstop string of complaints: The noise is unbearable, he keeps knocking his head on the low ceilings and hatches, the spaghetti is cold and the lettuce inedible, the oil fumes are overwhelming, the temperature is like a blast furnace, the air is toxic, the ocean glitters but is spoiled by a sky greased with jet fuel. Dyer admits he is constitutionally incapable of adjusting to new environments; in fact, the only thing hes grown accustomed to, over the years, is that he never gets used to things. This is the same man who, when asked by a friend (Alain de Botton) if he would like to spend some time writing in an interesting and relaxing environment, immediately replied: Put me on an American aircraft carrier.

These books describe the escapades of an 18th-century Scotsman and the World War II-era English nurse who fell into his world courtesy of a witches coven; writing in Salon in 1999, the critic Gavin McNett called it the smartest historical sci-fi adventure-romance story ever written by a science Ph.D. with a background in scripting Scrooge McDuck comics. Its been five years since the last Outlander title hit stores, and with a new Starz TV show based on the series coming in August, fans are primed for the latest installment. Gabaldon answered their questions recently on the website Goodreads. People often say to me, You write such strong female characters,  she told one reader who praised the depiction of her heroine, and I say, Well, I dont like stupid women.  Gabaldon also cited her belief that fiction has three kinds of characters: mushrooms, hard nuts and onions. Its a theory shes expanded on at her official website. Onions, she explains, develop slowly through the addition of multiple layers of personality, rather than popping up full-fledged as the mushrooms do. Hard nuts, meanwhile, play a merely functional role, making them difficult to animate. Onions, mushrooms and nuts, Gabaldon writes; this is beginning to sound like an exotic recipe for turkey stuffing.",2014-06-20T14:45:15+0000

But in the spring/summer 2015 collections so far, looser, longer jeans silhouettes are on the rise. Unlike the baggy low-riders of the hip-hop 90s, the new crop of wide-legged jeans is surprisingly understated. At the E.Tautz show in London, the designer Patrick Grant offered a version that was dark-washed, cuffed and slightly high waisted. (He sported a pair for his bow.) Worn monochromatically with a tucked shirt and long mac coat, the runway look was put-together but relaxed. Margaret Howell, who continues to show strong collections of covetable basics, also introduced a loose-fitting pair of jeans, which was topped with a simple shirt and coat. And Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, the duo behind MarquesAlmeida, took a more youthful approach, fraying the pants hems and pairing them with an equally frayed top and coat that evoked a similarly laid-back minimalism, but with an edge.",2014-06-20T15:30:31+0000

It affirms the findings of a report published in 2012 that called for more careful tracking. The V.A. has tracked symptoms in some members given treatment, but it is not clear how many and whether those veterans are in fact improving, experts said. Given that the D.O.D. and V.A. are responsible for serving millions of service members, families and veterans, we found it surprising that no PTSD outcome measures are used consistently to know if these treatments are working or not, the chairman of the panel, Sandro Galea of Columbia University, said in a statement.

He was taken to a hospital, where he died early Saturday morning. No cause of death had been determined as of Sunday afternoon, Jennifer Jacobs, senior coroner investigator at the Clark County Coroners Office, said.

About 250 medical calls were made that night, five of which resulted in trips to the hospital, according to the Las Vegas police. A spokeswoman for Insomniac, Jennifer Forkish, said in a statement on Saturday that one death is one too many, and asked festivalgoers to help keep one another safe on the remaining two nights. Saturdays was not the first death tied to an Electric Daisy event. In 2010, a 15-year-old girl died of a drug overdose at the festival in Los Angeles.

The board calls on financial regulators to monitor executions, for the good of the American economy and maintaining fair competition: Securities regulators clearly need to better enforce the best execution requirements on brokers, combined with better disclosure on brokers routing decisions and the rebates they earn. If Congress wont provide more resources for enforcement, rebates need either to be passed along to the customer or eliminated altogether.",2014-06-23T10:42:37+0000

The Iranian Students News Agency quoted Dr. Fryes Iranian colleague Turaj Daryaii as saying the family had waited more than two months for official Iranian permission to bury him in Isfahan, the ancient capital of the Persian Empire, before deciding to cremate him on June 8. It was not clear what the family intended to do with his ashes. Dr. Frye, who died on March 27 at age 94, had dedicated his career to Irans culture and language, and he had written the burial request into his will. He was widely regarded in Iran as a friend, even among some conservatives, but his death coincided with growing resentment by Iranian hard-liners over signs of reconciliation with the United States after decades of estrangement. A month after Dr. Frye died, the leader of Friday Prayer in Isfahan denounced his burial request, calling him a spy and a robber of cultural artifacts. ",2014-06-25T00:20:38+0000

Before a 2008 accident left the man, Vincent Lambert, a former psychiatric nurse, paralyzed and unresponsive, he had repeatedly said he did not wish to be kept alive in such a condition, according to his wife and several family members, who have sought for him to be allowed to die. Given that, the court found that the feeding tube that has kept Mr. Lambert alive could be considered unreasonable medical obstinacy, and could be legally removed. Mr. Lamberts parents, who oppose that, have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, and Mr. Lambert will be kept alive during the months or years of that courts examination of the case.

His older brother died of malaria, and so did his best friend. This disease can be cured with a pill, yet it claims about 1,700 lives each day  mainly children in sub-Saharan Africa who dont take this medicine within a week of falling sick. Even when kids survive, some remain disabled or irrecoverably behind in school. Thats why Dicko, now a malaria researcher at the University of Bamako in Mali, took matters into his own hands when he became a father.Dicko gives malaria medicine to his children before they get the disease during the rainy season  the period when the mosquito-borne illness peaks in Mali. Tourists do something similar by taking malaria drugs prophylactically on trips to Africa, but for decades, health officials have said that Africans should not do so, because the widespread use of a drug eventually renders that drug ineffective. However, Dicko, who studies malaria prevention, has come to believe that the immediate health benefits are worth that risk.After a decade of clinical trials demonstrated that the preventive measure reduces malaria cases by 75 percent, medical authorities reversed their position against it, in areas where its most effective. They decided that the number of lives saved outweighs the cost of losing these drugs eventually. For every drug you give, you will increase the risk of drug resistance, Dicko says. But these drugs are efficacious right now, so why dont we use them and save thousands of lives?",2014-06-25T15:59:40+0000

Of particular interest is Jon Vickers in the title role. Here, Vickers is early in his career before it became clear that he would be the great dramatic tenor of his generation, bringing a powerhouse voice and expressive intensity to roles like Wagners Tristan and Verdis Otello. This is Vickers in a more youthful, lyric mode, but still singing with chilling power and ardency, despite occasional moments of strain in his high range. The cast boasts Gr Brouwenstijn as Elisabetta, Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo, Fedora Barbieri as Eboli, and Boris Christoff as Filippo II.

Often made with scavenged wood mixed with raw lumber straight from the yard, the buildings were designed by Marcel Breuer, Eero Saarinen, Serge Chermayeff, Maurice Smith and serious amateurs. In this rich cultural setting, left-leaning figures including Mary McCarthy, Edmund Wilson, Dwight Macdonald and Noam Chomsky dined on plywood tables, bathed nude in brisk waters on principle and exercised elastic morals among the unpainted two-by-fours.

Naturally, it strikes me as a very impressive and encouraging speech.

us,Troubled Inquisitor,"Political novels are full of pitfalls, particularly for a novelist with strong political leanings. Writers may craft their world however they like, so they need not deal with the complexities of reality if it inconveniences their narrative. Ayn Rands philosophy can work in Atlas Shrugged, for example, because its a fantasyland of her creation. A better approach can be found in The Brothers Karamazov, in which Dostoyevsky makes his ideological opponents his most articulate characters. Great writers force themselves to confront the challenges the world can throw against what they believe. The poet Tom Sleigh explains this as the difference between exploring a political emotion, say, rather than a political conviction. Whereas a political emotion is concerned with the lived experience of how politics impact peoples lives, a political conviction is primarily didactic  it weaves no web, traps no chaotically buzzing flies  its hygienic, and easily put aside when the moment of outrage or conversational animus has passed.",2014-06-26T20:32:37+0000

She hung out with an older African-American food service worker at the university, and one thing led to another. Before long, she had moved into an apartment in a poor, largely black neighborhood in Philadelphia, her housemate a young man whose family lived down the block. Goffman became such a part of the fabric of the community that she was harassed by the police, witnessed someone getting pistol-whipped, was even set up on a blind date.

Serious disturbances have taken place in Sarajevo and other towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yesterday, another bomb was thrown at a street corner in Sarajevo by a young man, a Mussulman being wounded by the explosion. Martial law has been proclaimed in the town.The bodies of Archduke Francis Ferdinand and the Duchess of Hohenberg were embalmed during Sunday night, and were removed yesterday by special train to Metkovich, Dalmatia, on their way to Vienna. The funeral will take place on Friday, the interment being in the mausoleum on the Archdukes estate at Artstetten. Emperor Francis Joseph will not be present at this ceremony, but will attend a requiem mass on the following day.A representative of a Prague bank in which Archduke Francis Ferdinands will had been deposited has arrived in Vienna with the document. It is stated that certain questions of State in which the Archduke was interested will be confided by the Emperor to the new heir to the throne.

A natural phenomenon?  the residents of the fictional Mapleton, N.Y., are still searching for answers in this dystopian series created by Tom Perrotta, adapted from his novel, and Damon Lindelof, a mastermind behind ABCs Lost. Churches have closed while cults have formed, including the Guilty Remnant, whose followers wear white, take a vow of silence and chain smoke. One member is Laurie (Amy Brenneman), the mother of Jill (Margaret Qualley), a high schooler, and Tom (Chris Zylka), who has joined another cult led by a man who claims that he can hug the pain out of people. Laurie is also the wife of Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux, the towns chief of police, above, speaking with Amanda Warren), whose colleagues worry that he may be losing his mind as he tries to maintain order. The show may never explain what happened to the people who disappeared, but the measure of its worth is that it may not have to, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. As with any good drama, the mystery lies in human nature more than in the supernatural. Once the show gets going, and it takes more than one episode to do so, The Leftovers bores into the characters and the fissures that crack their community so astutely that the cause is almost secondary.",2014-06-29T17:23:48+0000

Plans are to add 30 to 50 items a month to the site, where they will tell a story that fans might not otherwise see, Mr. Crane said by phone on Sunday from Israel. For a Bruce fan, this gives you insight into your hero and the way he grew up, he said. Among the items is an eighth-grade report card, above right, featuring mostly low grades, including Ds in composition, physical education and music. The young Springsteen didnt have a great time in Catholic school, Mr. Crane said. He wasnt allowed to be who he wanted to be and to express himself. Mr. Crane said his favorite item is a photo of Mr. Springsteen and his father on a 1972 visit to Mexico. Bruce has described their relationship as tumultuous, Mr. Crane said, so its cool to see Bruce as just a kid laughing with his dad. Admission is $9.99, which allows a month of access to the site, the ability to download a font that replicates Mr. Springsteens handwriting style, the use of a ticket and memorabilia exchange, and entry to a monthly raffle.
