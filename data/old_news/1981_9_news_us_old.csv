A. =Ordinarily a laser beam will be reflected by a mirror, but it may penetrate, depending upon the quality of the mirror and the intensity of the beam. A laser beam is an intense beam of ''coherent'' light, whose waves are of a single frequency and all in step with one another. The backing of the mirror and what it is coated with can determine whether the light is reflected or transmitted. Certain mirrors will partially reflect and partially transmit a laser beam. Some beams can damage a mirror by burning a hole through it.",1981-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Looking beyond this September festival, the Society will be offering at least one Haydn work on each of its 14 subscription programs during the season.

Even during the good periods when his breathing grew strong and rhythmic, his illness kept him from the swimming, running, dancing and other activities that young men of his age take for granted. Then, in 1975, at the age of 24, Mr. Ristow was introduced to a drug called albuterol. ''I'd been taking 90 inhalations a day of my old medication, which was 10 times the recommended dosage,'' he says, ''and that was just barely keeping me ambulatory. I not only needed a lot less albuterol - my daily intake fell to 15 inhalations - but it produced an almost magical change in my quality of life.

Although Mr. Mendelson stops in 1939, when Auden and Christopher Isherwood abandoned England for the United States, he has already made an impressive case for the continuity of a career. According to this case, Auden shrugged off modernism. He even came to suspect symbols. He rid himself of family, ghosts, trolls, landscapes, history and pure form. Inside his exacerbation, he sought the words to praise. The end of his quest, ""the real world,"" was rootless America. Mr. Carpenter, while he emphasizes the chur ch to which Auden returned as if to his difficult mother, finds in the career less continuity than hodgepodge. He would seem to agree with Stephen Spender: ""One of Auden's characteristics is t o make a cult of whatever he happens to be doing, which become s to him what the poet must do.""

The Council of Ministers in Warsaw told Solidarity that the Government was prepared to take ''all means'' at its disposal and ''definite measures that might become necessary for the defense of socialism.'' (Page 1, Col. 1.) The U.S. accused Moscow of ''interference with Poland's internal affairs'' in a response to Moscow's note to the Warsaw Government.

Last night's performance seemed on paper to be another such traditional opening. The opera, after all, was Bellini's ''Norma,'' in nominally the same production that dates back to 1970, when Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne, Carlo Bergonzi and Cesari Siepi were the principals. However, as it turned out, very little of the evening could be recognized from previous ''Normas'' in the house. The three leading singers were taking their parts for the first time at the Metropolitan and so was the condu ctor, James Levine. Moreover, the sets had been extensively redes igned by their creator, Desmond Heeley, and Fabrizio Melano had resta ged the entire production. The tenor, Placido Domingo, was a ppearing for the first time anywhere as Pollione, the unfortunate Ro man proconsul and fatherof Norma's two children. Mr. Domingo made a s plendidly heroic figure out of Pollione, who emerges in many performa nces as a male cipher between two female exclamation marks. His voi ce was equally heroic, though it was pressed to the limits of its en durance in Pollione's punishing first-act recitative and cavatina.",1981-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Well-known in San Francisco and having appeared in the movie ''Popeye,'' this 31-year-old fresh talent has just scored a sensation at Dance Theater Workshop's ''New Mime'' series in New York. It is perhaps understandable that an experimental dance sponsor, not a theater group, presented him. By conventional standards, Mr. Irwin is neither strictly a mime nor a dancer. Yet it is the dance world that has been most sympathetic to the variety of nonverbal theater cropping up in recent years. Deprived of intelligible syllables, the theater critic frequently experiences getting-the-back-up symptoms. Dance critics, of course, know that gesture preceded speech not only in the history of the theater but in the history of mankind. It might also be suggested that the rise in nonverbal performance confirms again the richness of expression which a literary theater does not always possess.",1981-09-27T05:00:00+0000
