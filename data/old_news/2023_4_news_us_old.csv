In his 1989 debut, Horse Crazy, Indiana revives Thomas Manns Death in Venice (1912) in Lower Manhattan, where a writer not unlike the author falls for a young artist who may or may not be hustling him. His trilogy of crime novels, Resentment (1997), Three Month Fever (1999) and Depraved Indifference (2002), borrows material from the high-profile murder cases of the Menendez Brothers; Andrew Cunanan (who killed Gianni Versace); and the grifter Sante Kimes, elevating the New Journalism of Truman Capote and Norman Mailer to postmodern carnivalesque. For much of his career, aside from a brief stint in semi-obscure prominence as the staff art critic of The Village Voice from 1985 to 1988, Indianas writing has eluded the attention of the mainstream literary establishment. But at 72, he has found a new audience. In May, Semiotext(e) will reissue Do Everything in the Dark (2003), Indianas mordant depiction of the New York art world aging into a new millennium, and Rent Boy (1994), his noir about a male prostitute who becomes an unwitting accomplice to an organ harvesting scheme, was brought back into print by McNally Editions in January.

And OPEC Plus could be responding to the darkening economic outlook, made dimmer by the failure of several banks. OPEC Pluss changes to oil production may ultimately have limited effect.

I first found your art on strap-on.org in the early 2000s. The way that you drew trans people was different from other portrayals Id seen at the time, when there was so much trying to be invisible. Your art was a refutation of that. It was affectionate but also unafraid to be grotesque or hideous or beautiful.

Each poem also has a metaphysical fixation, performing a sticky reckoning with questions of being and time, enacted in language that travels swiftly and surprisingly between the casual and the philosophical. In this iteration, it is the question of death  and its seemingly indefatigable forces, the death guys  that is met with the sweet bewilderment of a poet.

First, Fox News announced that it had ousted Tucker Carlson, its most popular prime-time host. The move came less than a week after the company paid $787.5 million to settle a defamation suit with Dominion Voting Systems. A focus of the case had been Mr. Carlsons texts, showing him denigrating Donald J. Trump after the 2020 presidential election. But it wasnt until the day before the defamation trial was to begin that Fox leadership discovered private messages sent by Mr. Carlson that had been redacted in previous legal filings showing him making highly offensive and crude remarks. Those messages served as a catalyst for his firing, several people with knowledge of Foxs discussions said. Soon after Mr. Carlson was fired, CNN announced that it had parted ways with Don Lemon, a longtime star on the network who most recently was a morning show co-host. Mr. Lemon met backlash in February when he made comments about women and aging that many considered sexist.",2023-04-30T11:00:05+0000
