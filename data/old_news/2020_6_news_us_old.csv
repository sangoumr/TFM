One such resource that has resurfaced is this documentary, which is streaming for free through June 12. In the 1960s, Swedish journalists came to the United States to explore the nascent black power movement. They interviewed political activists including Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael and Bobby Seale, as well as residents of Harlem, Brooklyn and Oakland. About 30 years later, their footage was discovered by a Swedish television network, and the director Goran Hugo Olsson pieced clips together to create this film. He also added voice-over commentary by contemporary figures, like Erykah Badu and Questlove, who explain the movements relevance decades later.

In ancient Egypt, it was used to ward off evil forces. Buddhist monks, too, relied (and still rely) on incense to purify their meditation spaces, while in Japan, the Koh-Do (incense ceremony) has been popular since courtiers and samurai took it up in the 16th century. Of course, incense also just smells nice, its scent hanging in the room even after the physical material has burned to a tidy pile of ash.

Chaos ensues, naturally. Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critics Pick, calling it strange, challenging and boundlessly confident in her review in The New York Times. Gathering the living, the dead and the undead together on a single, surreal plane, she wrote, the movie turns its sordid, sex-trafficking plot into a decadent, redemptive fairy tale.",2020-06-10T05:00:08+0000

A prosecutor in their case was a young Roy Cohn, whose involvement quickly led Senator Joseph McCarthy  a staunch anti-communist Republican  to appoint Cohn to his chief counsel. There, Cohn played a major role in expelling government officials thought to be communists or gay, and shortly thereafter he became a personal lawyer to then-businessman Donald J. Trump. Though Cohn played many prominent roles, much of his personal life was veiled from public view. He was thought to be gay, despite his opposition to homosexuality, and he died from AIDS in 1986.
