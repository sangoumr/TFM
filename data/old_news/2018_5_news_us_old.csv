When theyre happy with the food, they jot down a few notes, then cook the dish again and again until it can be made by rote. The people who work for them watch and listen and smell and taste until they can do the same  professional cooking is about apprenticeship and technique. Most line cooks dont receive formal recipes from which to cook.

Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain. And so the straw  ubiquitous in most restaurants, bars, cruise ships and luxury resorts  has become a prime example of how tourism can have a deeply negative effect on the environment.

In March, at the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong (a trade show featuring 248 galleries from across the globe), a co-founder of Microsoft sold a Willem de Kooning painting for $35 million. Later this month, a $150 million Modigliani will go on sale at Sothebys in New York, a highlight of a spring auction season that Bloomberg has already predicted is poised to be the biggest on record.

Tammie Jo Shults of Southwest Airlines made her emergency landing of a Boeing 737 on April 17 after an engine explosion and traumatic injuries in the cabin, the world took note of the previous history she made as one of the first women to serve as a fighter pilot in the Navy. Shults, 56, who had wanted to fly since she was a teenager, first tried to enlist in the Air Force and was turned down. She was instead commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and served first as an instructor pilot for the T-2 Buckeye, a training aircraft for student aviators, and then flew as an A-7 Corsair pilot. When her squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet, then the Navys newest fighter jet, Shults was one of the first women to pilot it. But because she was a woman, Shults was prevented from joining a combat squadron, and so she transferred to the Reserve in 1993.

First settled in the Stone Age, the islands remain wild, heather-carpeted outposts of Celtic and Norse tradition, scattered with ancient croft fields, medieval castles and gray-stone fishing villages.

The journey to St. Kilda has not been easy. First, there were three consecutive days of last-minute boat cancellations as I sat in Portree on the Isle of Skye off the west coast of Scotland, around 250 miles northwest of Edinburgh, waiting for favorable weather conditions. They arrive, as if by magic, on the very last day that I can conceivably remain on the island before heading back home to London. Without that last-minute salvation, I would have had to return next summer to get to St. Kilda, which is another (nearly) hundred miles farther west. And the phrase favorable weather conditions here means something more obscure than the absence of driving rain. It depends on two things  wind speed, which is obvious enough once its pointed out, and sea swell, a surface state of water that dictates whether a boat can make landing at the bay in Hirta, the main island in the small archipelago of St. Kilda. It rains all morning as I take a taxi to Uig, the port from which boats depart to St. Kilda, and increases in intensity for the first three hours of the four-hour ride.",2018-05-07T09:00:08+0000

Other dishes include an avocado salad with snow crab, and gochujang ribs with miso. At the sushi bar, a $65 omakase includes more than a dozen pieces. The restaurant is the work of Danny Hahn, who has managed restaurants but never owned one before.

There was a museum to the composer Tikhon Khrennikov in his old house; there was a gallery of lace; there were several museums for local crafts, a museum for cheese and a museum dedicated to Leo Tolstoys death. Nearly always, my companions and I were the only visitors; the staff, who combined the roles of receptionist, curator, docent and locker-up-at-night, appeared faintly shellshocked that anyone had stopped by at all. Much later, I remembered a word that best describes these museums: wunderkammer, a cabinet of curiosities, the dinky and congested collections of objects that were once so popular in Europe.

That faulty valve had been replaced several years ago but wasnt working properly and was leaking again. To fix the valve, the cardiac surgeon intended to remove the old tissue, resecting the ring-shaped wall of the aorta around it. He would then build a new vessel wall, crafted from the heart-lining of a cow, and stitch a new valve into that freshly built ring of aorta. It was the most exquisite form of human tailoring that I had ever seen.",2018-05-09T09:00:01+0000

Its here, in a space in the historic Palazzo Capponi Antonelli, a 16th-century building with a pebbled cortile and a stone fountain, that the boutique Chez Dd sells the best of contemporary Italian artisanry. In the ground-floor boutique, whose walls are hung with posters drawn by co-owner Andrea Ferolla, a 56-year-old fashion illustrator and creative director, items are arranged in inviting tableaus  a retail version of the ideal Roman home. The brands own patterned canvas carryalls sit atop velvet-upholstered couches, and the living rooms lampshades are sewn from vintage Arjumands World wallpaper; the vanitys shelves are lined with Linda Rodins perfume; and beyond that, there is a closet dedicated to robes, dresses and coats by the Italian line Giuliva Heritage Collection. I wanted to show how objects could inform each other, says co-owner Daria Reina, a 48-year-old photographer and creative director who, with Ferolla, opened the shop three years ago.

us,"Girlhood Across America, Captured by One Photographer","The photographer Justine Kurland didnt learn how to drive until she was 27, a year before she set off on a two-decade-long road trip. At the time, she was an M.F.A. candidate at Yale working on her now-iconic series Girl Pictures (1997-2002), staged portraits of adolescent girls cast as runaways wandering beneath highway overpasses and mucking around in roadside drainage ditches. At first she stayed close to home, shooting in and around New Haven, Conn., but eventually she began traveling farther afield; she wanted her own process to reflect the stories her images told. If the girls were running away, she tells T, then it made sense that I should, too. From 1998 onward, Kurland crisscrossed the country shooting Huckleberry Finn-meets-riot grrrl vignettes  a gang of Ophelias paddling in a lake; a pair of girls carrying a slain deer through the woods; a trio scaling the burned-out shell of a car.

Other books this week drop us into the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide (The Girl Who Smiled Beads), unexpected motherhood (And Now We Have Everything) and Eleanor Roosevelts relationship with the reporter Lorena Hickok (White Houses). And since books, unlike black boxes, can also show us what people are thinking, we have two books puzzling out the fate of democracies, one taking on the modern worlds biggest ideas, and a posthumous collection of psychologically astute stories from a master of the form, William Trevor.
