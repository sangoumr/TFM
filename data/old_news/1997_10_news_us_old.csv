From a vast array of sources in our common culture, he fashioned an art of sharp sophistication that was humorous, ironic, elegant, and continually inventive. His brashness on canvas was balanced in life by a quiet, self-effacing manner informed by tremendous good will and generosity. Few artists so admired in the inner circles of the art world have had such a global impact on the visual sensibility of their time, and fewer still have commanded such a special blend of love and respect from those who knew him. He altered the way we see our culture, and the way we think and feel about it. Though his career was long and productive, we thought that he, like his art, was permanently blessed with an unassailable edge of usefulness. A singular joy has been taken from us, and in our sadness and loss we offer condolences to his beloved wife Dorothy and his family. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D.

A wonderful man of wisdom, courage and love, adored by his wife, Bernice, his children, Pam and Seth, and the rest of his family, including Miriam, Selma, Harold, and so many other family and friends. Everyone who knew Bob loved him. He was genuine, caring and passionate about everything-his family, his friends, his work, his life. People where drawn to Bob, and often surprised by his intense interest in their lives, whether he knew them for seven seconds or seven decades. Class, religion, race, were just words to him when it came to people. Each person was moved by him, impressed by him, and better for having met him. He grew up poor, during the depression, but crafted a life built on integrity, commitment and kindness. He loved his work, from his little theater in The Bronx to successful, multi-theater company. He was respected both for his great success in business and his high moral ethic. Above all, he lived for and devoted his energies to his family. He took care of everybody. In the last ten years, he and Bernice proved to be an even greater inspiration to those around them, facing an increasingly debilitating illness with courage and grace. They both remained optomistic during the worst of times. His strength, her devotion, their love, went beyond our imagining. You always wanted us to be happy, and we will try.

The hero of this bluntly pointed allegory, tricked out with some wildly impassioned Gypsy songs and dances, is the great Spanish-Arabian philosopher Averroes (Nour el-Cherif), who shocked his contemporaries by insisting that reason and faith need not be incompatible. Averroes's philosophy drew intense fire from both Christian and Muslim zealots.

Susan Tunick's TERRA-COTTA SKYLINE: New York's Architectural Ornament (Princeton Architectural Press, $45) is a first-rate Baedeker to the astonishing variety of terra cotta decoration in the city. Terra cotta (literally ''burnt earth'') is kiln-baked clay, a light, economical architectural material capable of holding high definition and rainbow hues. The rise of the terra cotta industry and the New York skyscraper are inseparable: the facade of Daniel Burnham's Flatiron Building of 1901-3 featured richly modeled masks of Greek women, and Cass Gilbert's Woolworth Building of 1910-13 was clad in cream-colored terra cotta in a flamboyant Gothic style. The use of terra cotta reached its acme in 1930-31 with the sea-colored McGraw-Hill Building (now badly chipping); fell into a serious slump with post-World War II glass and steel buildings, and is now making a small return with the restoration of such clay classics as City Center. Some technical chapters on how terra cotta is actually produced may make the average reader's eyes glaze over, but the enthusiasm of Tunick -- who is also president of the Friends of Terra Cotta, a preservation society -- for her subject is contagious.

The director had tried to add a feminist twist by having the women overhear the bet in the first act, so that they were only ''pretending'' to be unfaithful in the second. I suggested to Justice Ginsburg that perhaps this conceit was hard to reconcile with the sexual double standards of the 18th century, which were central to the plot and reflected in the traditional translation of the title: ''Never Trust a Woman.''",1997-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; What Rough Beast?,"It's late in 1999, 33 years after the birth of the son of Satan in ''Rosemary's Baby,'' and somewhere, if he still lives, the child has reached the traditional age of Christ at His crucifixion. But this is not the first thought that occurs to his mother. As Ira Levin's latest novel, SON OF ROSEMARY (Dutton, $22.95), begins, Rosemary herself is miraculously emerging from the coma she has been in for 27 years, struggling to understand the world into which she has been reborn, a world where virtually the entire population sports ''I k Andy'' buttons. Yes, it turns out, this Andy is her Andy, the demonic son who was taken from her so many years earlier. But why all the adoration? Isn't he still a prisoner of evil? Or has he really become the incarnation of good? Cleverly, in this sequel to his best seller of three decades ago, Levin leaves such questions hanging. When she and Andy are finally reunited, Rosemary helps her son to prepare for the global lighting of candles with which he and his organization, God's Children, will greet the millennium, and ''I k Rosemary'' buttons also begin to appear. But, disturbingly, Rosemary notes that Andy sometimes demonstrates incestuous feelings, and his eyes occasionally take on the satanic cast she remembers so vividly from his childhood. Is her son leading humanity toward extinction or rebirth? All these things are not quite resolved in an ambiguous, not entirely satisfying conclusion. James Polk",1997-10-05T05:00:00+0000

The interiors shown in this issue all express a common aspiration, by their designers and architects, to create work that is better than just O.K. These are spaces that are meant to wear well, to keep their good looks 20 years from now. They offer examples of how proportion, light, detail, color and texture affect the way it feels to be in a room.

The theater and Hollywood have nothing worse to offer. Last week a Senate-House conference committee agreed to give the N.E.A. $98 million for fiscal year 1998, a reduction of $1.5 million from 1997 and $78 million since 1992. That is the kind of thing Ms. Alexander has been obliged to call a victory, and in this legislative climate, it is. But as part of the settlement, Congress has granted itself added authority over the distribution of arts money and placed its own representatives on the N.E.A.'s grant-making board.

There's also a final ironic twist that the British serve better than anyone else. But the Guinness gallery makes the fun memorable, from a doddering admiral (above) to a bewigged suffragette dropping leaflets from a balloon. Mr. Price calmly tilts a bow and arrow, telling us: ''And Lady Agatha went down in Berkeley Square'' -- FRIDAY at MIDNIGHT on Channel 21. Howard Thompson",1997-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Beauty and Truth in Boston,"Published to mark the centenary of the founding of Boston's Society of Arts and Crafts, and the earliest American Arts and Crafts exhibition in 1897, INSPIRING REFORM: Boston's Arts and Crafts Movement (Davis Museum and Cultural Center/Abrams, $75) documents what Marilee Boyd Meyer in a foreword calls ''a pattern of New England connections . . . affirming Boston's role as a catalyst in the popularization of the Arts and Crafts movement in America.'' Founded in Britain in the 19th century and spearheaded by luminaries like William Morris and John Ruskin, the Arts and Crafts movement called for esthetic and social reform in reaction to the decline in craftsmanship and dehumanization of labor that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. Boston's primary contribution, Meyer writes, was not style but the transmission of ideas through education; by 1900, for example, Boston area colleges (including Harvard) were offering public enrollment in summer art classes. The Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston, numbered some 1,000 members in its first two decades, and one of the charms of this book is its brief biographies of many of those men and women; among the better-known members whose work is discussed are the painter and printmaker Arthur Wesley Dow and the photographer F. Holland Day. Informative essays explore pottery, woodcarving, furniture and jewelry making, metalworking and bookmaking. This elegant book, with its handsome design and more than 200 photographs, is itself an Arts and Crafts artifact. Robin Lippincott",1997-10-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Can't Steer From the Back Seat of Life,"Relationships in varying degrees of stress or disintegration are a recurring concern in NOT HER REAL NAME (Anchor, paper, $12), a debut collection of 12 moody short stories by Emily Perkins, a young New Zealander who now lives in London. Kicking off with the title selection, about a financially challenged waitress who ends up sharing her apartment with a man she had an adolescent crush on years before, Perkins goes on to present a variety of disgruntled protagonists amid a variety of settings. Among the more memorable yarns are ''After McDonald's,'' a painfully funny account of two talent-free former employees of the Golden Arches on a quest for fame, and ''A Place Where No One Knows Your Face,'' which perfectly captures the impatient stream-of-consciousness ramble of a child trapped in the back seat of the car on a family vacation. Perkins exhibits a flair for subtle details, deployed in concentrated blasts. Not surprisingly, most of the work in ''Not Her Real Name'' reflects that familiar mid-20's feeling of edgy dissatisfaction with one's personal status quo, often accompanied by a vague sensation of confusion. But while many of Perkins's stories are tinged with a hint of melancholy, they also display strong threads of optimism and humor. And so, in ''The Shared Experience,'' when a discontented secretary finally wakes up and takes charge of her life after a drunken one-night stand with her boss, she vows not only to ''get a life'' but ''a hamburger as well.''

I often wonder if we are actually concerned with seeking the best outcome for the child or if we are pandering to parents' fears of their child being viewed as ''different.''

She is a sensitive person for whom the evening -- a panel discussion on book publishing sponsored by The New Yorker magazine at the New York Public Library on 42d Street -- was a strain in any case. Timidly, she assured Mr. Riggio, who said she would probably like to sell more but then so would Stephen King, that she was not complaining. She seemed humbly grateful that so many of her books of fiction, essays and criticism were still in print. But for me, some melancholy lingered after hearing that Mr. Riggio's nationwide empire of nearly a thousand stores had, for instance, sold only a few hundred copies of ''The Shawl,'' Ms. Ozick's masterpiece of Holocaust literature.

Even its long-range rationale -- the future colonization of space -- was a deferral of sorts.

Many centuries before Polo, also, Arab merchants opened up regular trade routes by sea with China, with networks of commercial entrepots stretching from the Persian Gulf and the western coast of India through southeast Asia to Fujian province. Jewish merchants certainly explored part of this route, and communities of Jews were scattered along it. The Spanish Jew known to us as Benjamin of Tudela traveled in the years 1169 and 1170 from Barcelona to Constantinople and thence to Baghdad and Basra, leaving a brief report of what he saw and of the Jewish communities he encountered along the way. He mentions some of the ports on the Indian coast, notes that it took 23 days by sea to get from southern India to Ceylon and, in an aside that has tantalized readers ever since, adds that from Ceylon ''to cross over to the land of Zin is a voyage of 40 days.

On Dec. 7, 1995, President Clinton told a group of contributors that the Democratic National Committee's so-called issue ads on television were, in fact, being used to drive his poll numbers in states where he had failed to get electoral votes in 1992. He also confirmed that the White House was using the D.N.C. as a shield to avoid the $1,000 limit on individual contributions to candidate advertising. Taken with Dick Morris's revelation that Mr. Clinton designed the television ads, this videotape shows that the White House had a thoroughgoing plan to operate outside the Federal Election Campaign Act's spending limits.",1997-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Many of the men were in suits; the ushers had on white dinner jackets and white gloves. In their daytime lives, these men and women were bus drivers and police officers and electricians and small businessmen -- members of the vast black middle-class community that stretches eastward from St. Albans to the Nassau County line. And the soaring new cathedral, with its burgundy carpet and oak pews and its great balcony suspended way up in the air, held an almost allegorical power for them.

And they have. From Irish policemen to Korean grocers to Jewish jewelers on 47th Street, immigrants have followed their cousins and countrymen into ready-made professions -- forging ethnic toeholds that have become part of the New York landscape. Known to urban planners as niche labor, the phenomenon is as visible today as it was a century ago. According to ''The Newest New Yorkers,'' a report issued by New York's city planning department, on average more than 100,000 documented immigrants settle in New York every year, one-third more than a decade ago. ''No matter how large a distance they have crossed, immigrants still go by word of mouth,'' says Saskia Sassen, professor of urban planning at Columbia University.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; A Stomach Full of Needles,"The Chinese writer Can Xue's latest collection of stories is a book for readers who have grown tired of minimalist fiction. THE EMBROIDERED SHOES (Holt, $20) offers fanciful language and plenty of action, much of it bizarre: an old woman ransacks her neighbor's bedroom each night in search of a pair of shoes she lost years before; a man wakes up with his stomach full of needles, which appear on X-rays but do him no harm. The best of these tales have the compression of dark fables. Others sound like surreal poetry or a paranoiac's mutterings, veering here and there without a unifying thread. Reading Can Xue's fiction is like running downhill in the dark; you've got momentum, but you don't know where you're headed. At times, her characters adopt a formal speech that seems to parody the rhetoric of the Chinese Communist state: bureaucracy with a lunatic ring. Then the narrative shifts gears and comments on itself: ''Deep inside they hoped to find some trace of something related to present matters that could provide a new passion to the stories they made up. But they also knew that its arrival would be for the most part accidental.'' Translated by Ronald R. Janssen and Jian Zhang, the stories in ''The Embroidered Shoes'' describe strange, disordered worlds where people speak in riddles and time and setting are as fickle as the wind.

Born in Jersey City, NJ, Dr. Gorlin earned his undergraduate and medical degrees at Harvard, and was associated for more than two decades with Harvard Medical School and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, where he rose to the position of Chief of the Cardiovascular Division, before joining Mount Sinai in 1974 as Murray M. Rosenberg Professor and Chairman of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine, a post he held for 18 years. He played a pivotal role in strengthening the capacity of Mount Sinai School of Medicine during its critical, formative years, developing programs of excellence in numerous medical disciplines, recruiting outstanding faculty, setting and achieving ambitious research goals, establishing a Division of Molecular Medicine to help Mount Sinai realize the potential of modern biomedical research, and transmitting his vast knowledge and skill to medical students. He also served Mount Sinai in numerous additional capacities, ranging from membership in the President's Advisory Group and President of the Medical Board of The Mount Sinai Hospital, to Dean for Clinical Affairs of Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Gorlin was known for his compassionate as well as expert care of patients, and he was recognized worldwide for his numerous outstanding contributions to the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. He authored more than 400 published papers and over 100 invited articles, delivered no less than 75 honorary lectures, served on the editorial boards of prestigious journals, and was Editor-inChief of the journal Primary Cardiology for 20 years. He held countless appointments on task forces and memberships in professional societies, and his numerous awards included the Scientific Achievement Award from the American Heart Association, The New York Academy of Medicine's Glorney-Raisebeck Award and Medal for distinguished lifetime achievement in cardiovascular disease, and the Jacobi Medallion, highest award of The Mount Sinai Alumni.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Banners for Ballots,"At the turn of the century, English and American women took to the streets to demand the right to vote. Suffragist movements mounted propaganda campaigns using the tools of publicity -- banners, placards, floats and ribbons -- that were equal, if not superior, to any conventional electioneering. This visual agitation had an indelible effect on the public and ultimately helped the suffragists achieve their goals early in the long history of the use of fine art and applied art in the service of women's issues. However, until recently these documents received curiously little scholarly recognition. In SUFFRAGETTES TO SHE-DEVILS: Women's Liberation and Beyond (Phaidon, $59.95), Liz McQuiston, a graphic designer who has also written a history of protest graphics, traces in word and image an impressive legacy, from the earliest public demonstrations to contemporary street art and advertising, of advocating equal rights, abortion rights, AIDS research, rape law reform and protection against domestic violence. This exhaustive study reveals that little has actually changed in feminist protest art since the earliest handmade signs hit the streets. A portion of the book surveys how women's health and other issues are visually represented in the third world. Another addresses the ways sexist advertising is satirized and parodied. This book rejects issues of esthetics in favor of the contexts in which art is made and the constituencies that it serves. Steven Heller",1997-10-19T05:00:00+0000

Glimpsed only rarely in circus sideshows or in the written accounts of adventurers, the Bushmen (of what is now called Namibia) symbolized the ultimately primeval, the ''missing link,'' the anthropologist Robert J. Gordon writes in PICTURING BUSHMEN: The Denver African Expedition of 1925 (Ohio University Press, cloth, $44.95; paper, $24.95). Interest in these ''human curiosities'' was avid. Hence, it was with great fanfare that two Denver residents with dubious credentials -- C. Ernest Cadle, a disillusioned Methodist minister, and Paul Hoefler, a former Hollywood cameraman -- set off on a lavishly funded expedition to the Kalahari. Their ''scientific'' goal was not to study the customs of these traditional peoples, but to bring back photographic evidence of what they called the ''lowest race on earth.'' That was, after all, what Americans in the throes of a Tarzan craze wanted. When the expedition encountered the Bushmen, they proved to be good actors, Hoefler wrote, ''and to do just what they are told.'' In return for tobacco and other gifts, the Bushmen were asked to be accomplices in posed shots; many illustrate the contrast between Western notions of ''primitive'' and ''civilized.'' Several feature Hoefler and Cadle as swashbuckling, rifle-toting types, accompanied by one or more sparsely clothed Bushmen, ''childlike'' in contrived comparison. Largely in response to these popular photographs, the Bushmen became tourist attractions. Eventually, when their traditional way of life interfered with game park operations, many were expelled or settled in fringe communities. ''Picturing Bushmen'' is the account of how a stereotype is created, packaged, delivered and consumed. Suzanne MacNeille",1997-10-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Pressing Against the Thorns,"''Portuguese fatalism gravitates to the absolute,'' observes the son of an immigrant from the Azores early in Katherine Vaz's first collection of short fiction. Fittingly, each story in FADO & OTHER STORIES (University of Pittsburgh, $22.50) becomes a fado, the literary equivalent of a Portuguese song ''of fate,'' an evocation of ''a kind of possession by love and sadness.'' Fierce desire -- be it for revenge, love or quietude -- impels Vaz's characters, all of whom share Portuguese ancestry. ''Listen for the nightingale that presses its breast against the thorns of the rose, that the song might be more beautiful,'' a professor writes in one story. Like him, all of Vaz's characters press willingly, painfully, against the thorns, first to realize and then to accept their fates. Throughout the collection, Vaz succeeds in creating unusual protagonists: an ungainly healer whose hands grow larger and smaller as the plot demands; a young woman who rises into the air and whose much older lover waits for the rain ''until he could feel her pouring over him.'' In another story, a man's eyeball completes an obsessive pilgrimage to the house of his married lover -- only to confront the unwanted knowledge that his love permits her to live contentedly with her husband. ''Fado and Other Stories,'' which won this year's Drue Heinz Literature Prize, is a celebration of the drama of individual lives. With inventive lyricism, it explores the notion of a ''grand event allotted to each person -- only one, with every other major event a consequence of that.'' Janet Kaye",1997-10-26T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW YORK CITY MARATHON: SPECIAL PREVIEW SECTION: Sports of The Times; ... If James Joyce Had Put on Sweats For Marathon Day,"The editor called in the middle of the endless baseball playoffs and asked me to write a column about the New York City Marathon, and I groaned and said, ''Mercy, I'm stuck in a motel room somewhere out in America, and it's hard to believe I'll ever get home to cover the marathon,'' but she replied, ''Look, you've often written that the Marathon is the best single sports day of the year in New York, so why don't you just write something off the top of your head about why you love the Marathon?'' and immediately all these images starting forming of these elite runners and gallant plodders roaming through the neighborhoods of New York, and I could hear Mel Torme crooning, ''New York on Sunday,'' and I got all nostalgic, remembering the first New York City Marathon I covered in 1981, when I wangled a spot in Fred Lebow's open pace car, and there we were in Staten Island and the best runners started over the bridge, and Fred spotted some schleppers on the bridge, ahead of the start line, and he yelled at them through his bullhorn, ''I know who you are, you hot-doggers, vee haff your numbers!'' New York gamesmanship from them and New York aggression from Fred, and then we raced through the city, 26 miles and 385 yards, until Fred personally congratulated the American Alberto Salazar and the New Zealander Allison Roe, and I learned to admire the great runners, with their infuriatingly lean bodies, but then I stayed around for the normal clunky people built like me who had somehow willed themselves into running the marathon, and these four-hour runners became my heroes. Fanfare for the common runner. When I finally left the park that year, I just happened to be walking behind Roe as she walked down Central Park West wrapped in a silver heat-holding cape with a garland in her hair, still remarkably spry, and hardly anybody on that hazy November afternoon -- in their sport jackets and leather coats, on their way to dinner or Lincoln Center -- even recognized her, just a vibrant young woman with her boyfriend, ambling down toward Columbus Circle. From that day, I was hooked on the marathon and always volunteered to cover it, starting with observing runners all over the region, in city parks, on suburban roads, doing their roadwork in the snappy fall weather, pushing themselves into better shape, and slugs like me, doing a few silly miles, would mutter, ''next year, next year.''",1997-10-28T05:00:00+0000
