This has certainly been the case with the recent work of the American painter Sonia Gechtoff. Increasingly important for this artist, too, are the elusive and affectionate memories of certain modes of 19th-century landscape painting. Yet Miss Gechtoff, who made her artistic debut in the 1950's as an Abstract Expressionist, still brings an abstractionist's sense of form and structure to the very conception of her work. It is thus in the way memory and form, recollected emotion and rigorous technique are now combined in her work that gives it its special magic.",1982-01-08T05:00:00+0000

Not that it was ever exactly a secret, of course. Benton had been to Paris before World War I. There, like other aspiring artists of his generation, he had discovered Cezanne, Matisse and the Cubists, and willingly succumbed to their influence. He was especially drawn to the Synchromist innovations of Stanton Macdonald-Wright and Morgan Russell, and painted for a time in the Synchromist manner.

Finally, his top advisers were unanimous in recommending that he present for 1983 a budget containing significant proposals for tax increases. Even the last holdout, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan - the only member of the inner circle who had been arguing in private what Mr. Reagan had been arguing in public, that new tax increases would drag the economy down - had switched. ''I think,'' announced Mr. Regan, ''there will be some new tax increases'' in 1983 and 1984 beyond the $22 billion package the President reluctantly accepted in September. There seemed to be no one left. On Capitol Hill, Representative Jack F. Kem p, the upstate New York Republican for whom tax increases are anathem a, assessed Mr. Regan's comment as a defection that did not mean that the battle was lost. Mr. Kemp said he had been promised one last c hance this week to make the opposition case, and he sounded hopeful. ''I have been assured that the decisions are not locked in,'' he sa id, adding defiantly: ''Douglas MacArthur once said that the counci ls of war breed timidity and defeatism.

If its exhibitions, by and large, are too broadly inclusive, lacking the ''eye'' and standard of taste that could be expected from a privately run gallery, one might blame the center's policy of presenting group shows ''as diverse and unstructured as possible'' to illustrate its definition of drawing: any unique work on paper.

us,GLOSSARY OF COMMONLY USED TERMS,"Term Insurance Revertible term insurance is generally the cheapest policy for healthy people who gamble on continuing to stay healthy. However, it is not au- tomatically renewable. In later years a person who becomes sick would not be able to renew at the cheap rate and might have to pay a higher rate, sometimes much higher. Before buying compare the higher rates. Renewable term insurance offers a guaranteed option to renew without a health examination up to retirement age and sometimes beyond. In shopping for renewable term policies, buyers should keep an eye on re- newal costs for all ages. Since there is tremendous competition among companies selling one-year renewable term, it usually is the cheapest. Convertible term insuran ce can be converted t o a cash-value policy at any time, generally up to age 60 or 65, without another medi cal examination. Almost all renewable policies are convertible. When comparisionshop- ping, look for policies that have the oldest age for con version. Joint-life term insurance covers two persons but pays one death benefit. It may not be cheaper than two individual term policies. Decreasing term insurance, often used to cover the outstan ding balance of a home mortgage, has a fixed annual cost. Initially it o ffers largecover- age for a small premium, but since its benefits decline over time it should not be used as a primary insurance policy, accord ing to Consum- ers Union.

Another is nature documentaries, affording the armchair explorer fascinating close-ups of everything from undulating bacteria to ominously gliding sharks. Advances in photography have enabled camera crews to record aspects of wildlife in astonishing intimacy and detail. The result has been a fairly steady stream of splendid nature essays. Now, along comes ''Life on Earth,'' and, wi thout hestitation, the stops can justifiably be pulled out on the so unding of superlatives. This 13-part series, produced by the BBC's Na tural History Unit in Bristol, England, in association with Warner Brothers Television and a German company, is quite simply a brilliant and thoroughly awesome achievement.

His ''Rumpole of the Bailey'' series was shown on American public television last year. By JOHN MORTIMER LONDON Evelyn Waugh wrote ''Brideshead Revisited'' during a five-month leave from military service in 1944. It was a bleak period of our history, a time, as he said, ''of soya beans and Basic English,'' and so he produced a book that saw the past in a roseate glow. The splendors of country-house life took on a glamour, and Oxford in the 1920's appeared to have a succulent decadence, which may never have been apparent at the time. The book, as he said, tells us more about the England of the 1940's than it does of the 20's and 30's: Our dreams of the days that are gone throw less light on our past than on our present situation.",1982-01-17T05:00:00+0000

The Grumman rebate of property taxes was $8.4 million, rather than $4 million. Experience always being the best teacher, might I suggest that driving to Islip and viewing the areas of prevalent foreclosures (noting also that they appear like mushrooms here and there) would allow one to feel the tragedy of people who lost their homes.

This is especially true in ballet - modern dancers can begin their study of technique at a later age. On the other hand, changing times may now be altering the insider's traditional image of the very young dancer who remains the perpetual student. Memoirs such as those by the Russian ballerina Tamara Karsavina have always suggested the passage from the classroom to professional dancing to be only one of degree. As full members of a state company, dancers like Karsavina continued to rehearse and take class day in and day out in the very studios in which they had grown up and been hermetically enclosed since childhood. The formative and early professional years of young dancers no wadays tend to be quite, even brutally, different. These thoughts ca me to mind the other day after two recent and contrasting viewing ex periences. One involved the appearance of the Joffrey II Dancers at Brooklyn College's Whitman Hall. The other was the first American br oadcast on WNET/Channel 13 of ''Dancing Bournonville,'' a Danish fi lm about the legacy of August Bournonville - his ballets and his tr aining - as handed down to young dancers at the Royal Danish Balletin Copenhagen.",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

As Mr. Haig flies to Geneva to meet with Mr. Gromyko on Tuesday, Poland's own crackdown has punctured recent expectations that, after two years of chill in Soviet-American relations, some warming trends were on the h orizon. ''We have got a decent dialogue going, which offers some b asis for optimism that perhaps, in the months ahead, we'll make pr ogress, but we have to be prepared for the opposite,'' Mr. Haig had confided on Nov. 20, emphasizing the positive. The Secretary had had two days of talks with Mr. Gromyko at the United Nations in Se ptember that he found free of polemics. And President Reagan, at Mr . Haig's urging, had delivered a major speech on arms control that was free of such anti-Soviet invective as his remark, inhis first new s conference, that Moscow was prepared ''to commit any crime'' to sp read communism.",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,LENNIE TRISTANO- A NEGLECTED JAZZMAN,"Historians of modern jazz have been curiously and almost unanimously parsimonious in their appraisals of Lennie Tristano, the pianist, composer, bandleader, theoretician, teacher, and recluse. When Mr. Tristano died of a heart attack at his home in Queens on Nov. 18, 1978, only one album of his work was in print, and it was on a Japanese label. Most critical accounts of the development of modern jazz in the 1940's and 1950's treated him as an interesting but minor footnote, more impressive as the mentor of first-rate improvisers l ike Lee Konitz and Warne Marsh than as a musician in hisown right. The reasons for Mr. Tristano's exclusion fr om so many jazz critics' pantheons are almost as interesting as the pianist's longneglected music. He has been taken to tas k for emphasizing melodic counterpoint and difficult, altered h armonies while bullying his drummers into functioning as self-effacin g human metronomes. The Dutch critic Martin Schouten has called the s ound of the pianist's bands ''pale'' and ''characterless'' and conc luded that Mr. Tristano's recordings betrayed a ''lack of fe eling for the role of 'sound' in jazz.''",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

If there is a reform movement slowly gathering momentum, as optimists maintain, and if that catastrope is not inevitable, it is natural to wonder why the South African authorities squander the little time left for change.

us,Home Clinic;          A TOP-QUALITY PAINTBRUSH MAY BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN,"ALTHOUGH rollers and flat painting pads have almost replaced brushes as tools for applying paint to interior walls, ceilings and other large flat surfaces, a brush is still the most versatile and useful applicator for painting woodwork and trim, as well as furniture, cabinets and other objects where a really fine finish is desired. However, paintbrushes vary widely in grade, and it is essential that a top-quality brush be selected for those fine-finish jobs. Even the best of craftsmen cannot get a smooth, professional-looking finish with an inexpensive, poor-quality brush. It will not have enough bristles to spread the paint on uniformly, and the bristles it does contain will leave streaks and brush marks that will be almost impossible to smooth out. In addition, ''bargain'' brushes often shed bristles continuously, so that picking them off the wet finish becomes an almost impossible problem. Top-quality brushes will, of course, cost more, but for fine work and for maximum ease of application, they are well worth the difference. Their better grade of bristle will spread the finish on more uniformly, and the brush will have more bristles so that the finish is applied smoothly without brush marks or streaks showing up after the paint dries. In addition , a brush of good quality will, if properly taken care of, also last much longer than a cheap one, so in the long run it will often ac tually cost less than an inexpensive so-called ''throwaway'' brush. The latter are really not good for anything other than ap plying a wood stain or penetrating sealer, or perhaps slapping on a paint remover so you can strip off an old finish. The bristles in a top-quality brush may be either of natural origin or of a synthetic filament made for the purpose. The most widely used and best-quality natural bristle is hog bristle, which is imported from China. But for really fine work with varnish and lacquer, there are also badger-hair and ox-hair brushes that many serious craftmen prefer - especially for furniture finishing. However, these are very expensive and also hard to find in most local paint stores. They can be obtained through mail order houses that cater to craftsmen. Good-quality Chinese hog bristle is naturally tapered, which gives it resiliency, and the bristles have naturally ''flagged'' tips (split ends) that greatly contribute to their ability to spread paint on smoothly. However, like most natural bristles, hog bristle is porous and tends to absorb water, so while it is excellent for use with alkyd enamels, varnishes and oil paints, it doesn't work well with latex paints (the bristles tend to swell and lose their springiness). Synthetic bristles are either nylon or poly ester filaments, and thebetter grades are made so that the individual bristles are tapered and ''flagged'' at the ends to duplicate the excellent working qualities of good hog bristle. Neither of the se synthetic bristles isaffected by water, and they can be used in la tex (water-thinned) finishes without swelling or getting floppy ( losing their springiness). In addition, both synthetic bri stles will withstand wear better than natural bristle, and thus la st longer than natural bristle (nylon will outwear polyester when us ed on rough surfaces). One drawback to nylon bristles is that they tend to soften and lose their springiness when used in shellac or lacquer, as well as in some of the newer synthetic finishes that use powerful solvents. Polyester, on the other hand, is not affected by shellac or lacquer, or by any of the other common solvents found in most paints and finishes used around the home. Regardless of the type of bristle used, a good-quality brush should have a very high percentage of bristle with flagged tips, especially around the outside of the brush. The bristles should also be of different lengths so the brush will spread paint on smoothly from all positions, and will continue to do this as the longest bristles start to wear off. To check for this, hold the brush upside down at eye level, then spread the bristles between your fingers and look for the flagged ends. Next, separate the bristles in the center, as shown in the illustration, to see how wide the block is in the center. All brushes have a filler block to create a hollow in the center, but if this block is much thicker than in other brushes of the same size, it probably means that there is less bristle in that brush than there should be. Cheap brushes often have thick blocks to make them look as though they have more bristle in them than they actually do. Answering the Mail Q. We recently had new shingles installed on the roof of our house, on top of the old shingles. When the original shingles were installed, none of the nails used penetrated through where you could see them sticking out on the inside. However, our new roof has longer nails that now stick down inside the attic by approximately threequarters of an inch (the attic is unfinished). When I asked the contractor about this, he said there was nothing wrong. Another roofer has told me, however, that under certain winter conditions condensation would form on these exposed nails and drip down onto the attic floor, so he advises cutting all the nails off. This would be quite a job. Is it really necessary? -M.B., Oradell, N.J. A. If the attic is not properly ventilated, condensation could form - on roof rafters or sheathing, as well as on the nails. Since the nails are metal and would get colder than the wood, condensation would be more likely to form on them first. But cutting off the nails would not necessarily eliminate the problem. If this does become a problem, it means your attic needs more ventilation above the insulation because with proper venting condensation should not form anywhere in the attic.",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,THE TEXT AND THE TRUTH,"THE REALISTIC IMAGINATION English Fiction from Frankenstein to Lady Chatterley. By George Levine. 357 pp. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. $25.EVEN the title of this rich and provocative book says a good deal about the range and authority of its claims: Realism and Frankenstein? Lady Chatterley? Inside we find other surprises: discussions of Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy, Emily Bronte as realists. Of course George Levine is fully aware of the conventional lineup of realists in English fiction - Jane Austen, William Makepeace Thackeray, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot - and he gives them full attention. But, alert to the slipperiness of the term and the tradition (''All writers believe they are realists,'' says Alain Robbe-Grillet), he is less interested in rehearsing the cliched characteristics of a school of writing than in investigating the urgent, ingenious, often heroic attempts by writers to overcome artificial conventions and make some connection between the text and what is ''out there.'' Mr. Levine argues that the great Victorian realists were fully aware that conventions could be replaced only by other conventions, and that they were struggling to get at the ''true'' by means of structures and plots demonstrably unreal and by means of a language dangerously distanced from the ''real.''",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,'SHIELD LAWS' PROTECT PRESS SOURCES- IN MOST CASES,"On Aug. 4, 1978, M.A. Farber, a reporter for The New York Times, was jailed in Hackensack, N.J., for contempt of court. He and his newspaper had refused court orders to turn over documents detailing what they knew about the case of a surgeon, Doctor X, charged with murdering patients at a small osteopathic hospital 13 years earlier. As the jail doors slammed shut on Mr. Farber, many lawyers and journalists shuddered at what it meant for the press. They feared that the Farber decision would encourage others to demand reporters' unpublished notes and records, scaring away sources who would reveal wrong-doing only if their identities could be kept secret. Last week, in one of his last acts as Governor of New Jersey, Brendan T. Byrne pardoned Mr. Farber and The Times and remitted $101,000 of the $286,000 in fines the newspaper had paid. The journalists' purpose, Mr. Byrne explained, ''was not to insult or frustrate the judicial process, but to stand on a noble, if sometimes imperfect, principle.'' Those who had supported the reporter and the newspaper, however, were already breathing more easily. A review of cases over the last three years shows no sharp increase in the number of reported incidents in which journalists were forced to disclose their sources or were jailed for not doing so. Twenty-six states now have statutory protections for newsmen, and some, New York among them, have strengthened their ''shield laws.'' Among states without shield laws, several courts have ruled in favor of reporters. This turn of events, say legal experts, rests in part on the specific circumstances of the Farber case, where the issues of press freedom were colored by the fact that the reporter's investigation of the unsolved deaths of patients at the Riverdell Hospital in Oradell, N.J., had prodded the county prosecutor to reopen the matter. Accusations of collaboration between journalists and law enforcement officers have not figured prominently in other courtroom battles between the Sixth Amendment rights of defendants to a fair trial and the First Amendment rights of the press. The courts, themselves, have helped shift the legal climate in favor of the press, generally insisting that defense attorneys must vigorously seek alternative sources of information before they can demand the notes of newsmen. In a major ruling in 1980, for example, a Federal Appeals Court in Philadelphia affirmed a reporter's ''qualified privilege'' not to disclose unpublished information, although it allowed that defendants in a fraud case involving fast-food franchises might be entitled to some ''outtakes'' - footage not broadcast - from a CBS ''60 Minutes'' program on the subject. In a more explicit commentary last year, the appellate court instructed the trial judge to release only footage that was material to defense efforts to impeach the testimony of prosecution witnesses. In the years since the Farber case, New Jersey has rewritten its shield law and the State Supreme Court has upheld it in a decision widely read as an acknowledgement that its 1978 decision, affirming the contempt finding, went too far. ''To all confidential sources,'' the court said, ''the promise of silence is absolute, and any breach is a total one.'' To compel a reporter's testimony would destroy the ''free flow o f information,'' the court concluded. Not all such cases have ended with as clearcut a judgment in favor of press protections. In September 1980, Ellen Marks, a reporter for the Idaho Statesman in Boise, was ja iled for a day and her paper was fined $36,000 when they refused tote ll a magistrate how Miss Marks had found a woman whose former hu sband had charged her with kidnapping their child. The case againstth e reporter became meaningless when the parents reconciled. But it is not meaningless for Miss Marks, who in a recent article for the So ciety of Professional Journalists wrote: ''We all pay in a co mmunity where the line between law enforcement and the media is bl urred, and where reporters are punished for being reporters.'' Lastwe ek, a Superior Court judge in California ruled the state's tw oyear-old shield law unconstitutional. The judge said the rights ofa criminal defendant are simply stronger than those of the press. Libel Cases as Pressure Points While the criminal cases involving journalists tend to grab the headlines, the issue of compelling a reporter's testimony may be developing more rapidly on the civil side, particularly in libel cases, where press defenses are weakest. The Supreme Court opened wide the civil suit door in 1978, in the case of a Green Beret colonel, Anthony Herbert, versus ''60 Minutes.'' The Court said that because libel plaintiffs who are public figures must prove malicious intent, they must be given access to the information reporters and editors had gathered for the article or broadcast in question. In 1980, the New Hampshire Supreme Court took the High Court's reasoning one step further, striking down the libel defense of The Concord Monitor by ruling that if the paper would not reveal its sources, it should be presumed not to have any. Libel litigation has raised other seemingly quirky issues, such as who constitutes a confidential source. A nightclub owner in Babylon, L.I., for example, is suing The Babylon Beacon, a local weekly, over an anonymous letter to the editor criticizing the bar. The nightclub owner has demanded the name of the letter writer. The newspaper owners, citing shield law protections, have lost the first round of court action, Still, several observers see Governor Byrne's pardon last week as the ultimate vindication of press principles. In a letter to the Governor, Floyd Abrams, the lawyer who began seeking pardon more than a year ago, observed: ''Journalists generally believe, and in this case firmly believed, that only by protecting their sources could they serve their country as well as their profession. That they do not always prevail, that they did not prevail in the Farber case itself, should not lessen the recognition that the 'crime' committed here was one committed with regret, in good faith and out of a sense of honor.''",1982-01-24T05:00:00+0000

The sermon was followed by a pastoral letter read in churches all over Poland that warned of the dangers of civil war and said workers had the right to organize independent trade unions. The sermon and the letter indicated that the church hierarchy was united in an effort to put intense pressure on the military rulers on the eve of a major address to Parliament by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader. (Page A1, Col. 6.) The Kremlin turned against Italy's Communist leaders after years of increasing tension brought to a head by events in Poland.

THE ECONOMY: Mr. Reagan said his Administration would continue to rely on what he called the four ''common-sense fundamentals'': reducing the growth of Federal spending, preserving tax reductions designed to stimulate saving and investment, limiting Government regulation, and working to maintain a healthy dollar. FEDERALISM: Mr. Reagan said he hoped to give responsibility to states and localities for Federal programs now worth $47 billion. As a major element of this proposal, Washington would assume full responsibility for Medicaid while the states assume responsibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps. TRUST FUND: The Federal Government would apply the proceeds from certain excise taxes to a temporary trust fund of $28 billion; states could use their trust fund allotment to pay for the programs being assigned to them or use it as they see fit. SPENDING REDUCTIONS: The President said he would press to dismantle the Departments of Energy and Education, cut spending and reduce the number of Federal workers by 75,000. THE DEFICIT: The President said he expected the Federal deficit to be under $100 billion in the fiscal year l982 and to decline thereafter because of elimination of tax abuses, renewed economic growth and budget reductions.",1982-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Proposing to change the relationship between the Federal Government and the states with ''a single, bold stroke,'' Mr. Reagan called for a ''financially equal swap.'' The Government would exchange its responsibility for food stamps and payments to poor families with dependent children, for the Medicaid program. (Page A1, Column 6.) Continued large budget deficits threaten the economic recovery President Reagan has forecast for this year, Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said at a hearing of Congress's Joint Economic Committee. Rejecting recent criticism of the Fed by the President and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, Mr. Volcker said that big deficits - not the Fed's tight monetary policy - were a key cause of continued high interest rates and the chief threat to recovery. The President, in his State of the Union address, asked Congress to approve a program that included major spending cuts but a smaller package of tax increases than his advisers had recommended to reduce the deficit.

us,THEATER: INDICTMENT OF ALL-AMERICAN FAMILY,"Among the more bizarre news stories to haunt our culture in recent years are those follow-up features that appear after the arrest of a mass murderer. In these stories, reporters ask the neighbors of a Texas sniper or a so-called Son of Sam whether they noticed any odd behavior on the killer's part during his months of heinous crime. The answer is inevitably no. Right up until the end, it seems, these fellows were shy, well-mannered types who minded their own business and helped little old ladies with their groceries. In the very sick, very funny first act of ' 'The House Across the Street,'' a new play at the Ensemble Studio T heater, a young writer named Darrah Cloud examines the absurd dimens ions of this paradox. ''House'' is set in a Chicago suburb and is l oosely inspired by the John Wayne Gacy case. It tells of a typical a ll-American family, the Fortunes, who wake up to discover that the ni ce man across the front lawn has raped and strangled 31 boys and then buried them in every crevice of his home. Although the family's li ving-room window looks right into the murderer's house, no one ever noticed ''anything out of the ordinary.'' So what if the man poured a new concrete floor in his basement every week? Maybe he was just do ing his bit to keep up property values.",1982-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Just before arbitration, the player usually revises downward his initial demand, and the club comes up a little, then both sides submit their proposals in writing. An arbitrator hears the case and selects one figure or the other. Except that in Flanagan's case there will be no hearing, because there is no need for one. Jerry Kapstein, Flanagan's agent, submitted a demand of $485,000, and the Orioles submitted $500,000. This is only the second time in the seven-year history of baseball salary arbitration that a player has submitted a lower figure than the club. Two years ago, Tom Reich, agent for Mike Edwards, put in a salary of $50,000 for the Oakland second baseman, and Charlie Finley, then the owner of the A's, made the figure $58,000. Edwards signed a contract for $58,000, and Flanagan will now sign one for $500,000. ...

us,A NOVEL OF CATHOLICISM IN ENGLAND,"SOULS AND BODIES By David Lodge. 244 pp. New York: William Morrow & Co. $12.50THE person who writes about religion must inevitably discuss sex, marriage, children, authority, free will, death and all the other cheery ingredients of conventional satire. When this novel by David Lodge appeared in Britain in 1980, its title was ''How Far Can You Go?'' - that horribly simple question asked by sexually frustrated Catholics in the 1950's. That title sets the tone better than ''Souls and Bodies.'' This is for the most part a gently humorous novel about the social implications of Catholicism for an English person over the past 30 years. Mr. Lodge invents a dozen or so characters - he is quite frank about his inventing - and allows them to illustrate various aspects of Catholic bewilderment, disillusionment, doublethink and paradox. The novel begins like a fun-poking magazine article about churchgoing students (''Why have they come here, and what do they expect to get out of it?''), continues in a schematic way, partly as novel and partly as an essay (''Patience, the story will resume shortly.''), and then all the loose ends are bound up in the novelties of Catholic modernism and the author tips his readers a wink.",1982-01-31T05:00:00+0000

us,         HOW TO AND HOW NOT TO INSULATE AN UNFINISHED ATTIC,"MOST of the instruction pamphlets that tell how to install insulation in an unfinished attic describe the procedures involved in putting the insulation down on the floor, between the ceilings joists. If the attic has some type of flooring down on top of these joists, then the insulation is either blown in under the floorboards (using loose-fill fiberglass or cellulose), or enough of the flooring is pulled up so that regular batts or blankets can be slid underneath. All this is fine for an attic that is to be left unfinished, but how is insulation installed if the attic is to be finished sometime in the not too distant future - that is, if walls and ceilings are to be paneled or finished in order to create one or more additional rooms up there? Insulation on the floor will not be of much help in keeping the attic rooms warm. It is needed up between the roof rafters and in the walls that will enclose the newly finished rooms. However, this may call for some carpentry -even though the attic will not be actually finished for some time. Additional two-by-fours may have to be installed before the insulation is put up so that the insulation can be placed where it will do the most good for the present, as well as in the future (when the rooms are actually finished). This does not mean that all the walls or partitions have to be framed out before the insulation is put up - just those two-by-fours that will form the short outside ''knee walls'' that will separate the finished rooms from the unfinished parts of the attic (over the eaves). Also, you may have to put up the collar beams across the top that will eventually form the ceiling of the new rooms (both are shown in the accompanying drawing). In many homes, collar beams are already in place because they are part of th e roof's structural framing (they p revent the rafters from spreading the walls outward under the weight of the roof). However, in some types of construction they are not ne eded, so the builder maynever have put them in and you will have to a dd them yourself. As shown in the drawing, they are nailed to the sides of each rafter so that insulating blankets or batts can be stap led up between them as they go horizontally across on top of the roo m. In addition, the collar beams will serve as the framework for the ceiling panels when you are ready to put them up. If insulation were put up between the rafters in an attic that had no collar beams, the insulation would have to run all the way to the peak -an undesirable alternative. When insulation goes all the way up to the peak (as it does in some cathedral ceilings, unfortunately), there is no air space above the insulation to provide ventilation, but this is important to prevent problems with condensation in cold weather. Stapling the insulation to the collar beams solves this problem. It creates a small area under the peak that can be ventilated by means of louvered openings installed in each end wall, up near the peak. When installing these collar beams in an attic that now has none, position them about one-third the length of the rafter down from the peak. Or locate them high enough so that there will be adequate headroom when the ceiling panels are installed by nailing them up against the collar beams. To provide a level nailing surface that will also be at a uniform height from one side of the room to the other, use a long straight edge to line up the bottom edges of each beam before nailing it in place. The two-by-four knee-wall studs (you can use two-by-threes instead) are nailed up after first nailing down a horizontal two-by-four that will form the bottom of the wall (this is called the bottom plate). Each short vertical stud is then nailed to the side of the roof rafter as shown, with its lower end resting on top of the bottom plate. To determine the position of the bottom plate, and the kneewall studs that will rest on top of it, some preliminary plans for the attic will have to be established - at least those that will show where these outside walls will be located. The insulat ion, with the vapor barrier toward the heated side, thengoes up betwe en these studs, under the roof between the overhead rafters, acro ss the collar beams at the top, then down the other sidetill it meets the floor again. The occupied area of the attic will beinsulated and kept warm, while the space in back of the walls will not be insula ted. However, in that space part of the attic floor willstill be expo sed (over the ceiling of the room below), so that part of the floor should be insulated to keep heat from escaping through the ceiling o f the rooms below.",1982-01-31T05:00:00+0000

This approach requires modification for New York City. Monumental as its budget is , the city is not a fully independent actor; a network of participan ts share in its fate, particularly the national and state governm ents, which provide a very substantial share of its budget, and a variety of independent or semi-independent agencies managing tran sit, public housing, hospitals and other key city functions. An d perhaps most important of all, the city cannot run in the red with the easy assurance of the Federal Government, which knows that wh atever the deficit, it will be and can be made up, and there is no o ne to say otherwise.",1982-01-31T05:00:00+0000

The answer, like the answer to most Bostonian questions, was Paul Revere. So I put Paul Revere's gold dome into an ''article,'' and took it (though I was just as scared by recklessness then as I am now) to The Boston Globe, on Washington Street. The Features Editor had a bare severe head, a closed parenthesis mouth, and silver Dickensian spectacles.
