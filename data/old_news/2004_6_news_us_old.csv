It was not clear if Yukos would appeal. Yukos has owned 92 percent of Sibneft on paper since October, when the deal was completed, though Yukos has not been able to establish operating control. Sibneft scrapped the merger after Yukos's founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was jailed last October. As a result of the ruling, Millouse Capital will see its stake in Yukos fall to 9 percent from 26 percent.",2004-06-01T05:00:00+0000

The judge, William T. Chandler of the Delaware Chancery Court, made the ruling Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana. The suit said that the dividend might force Regal into bankruptcy while enriching Regal's controlling shareholder and director, the billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, by $368 million. In his ruling the judge said that none of the fund's claims had merit. At issue in the lawsuit was whether Regal's assets were greater than its liabilities, because Delaware law requires that a company must have a surplus to declare a dividend. Stuart Grant, a lawyer for the teachers system, said the fund might sue to recover the dividend for the corporation. Rita Farrell (NYT)",2004-06-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Report May Have Hastened Tenet's Resignation," WASHINGTON, June 3 - George J. Tenet's resignation may have been hastened by a critical, 400-page report from the Senate intelligence committee that was presented to the Central Intelligence Agency for comment last month. Government officials and people close to Mr. Tenet said the classified report is a detailed account of mistakes and miscalculations by American intelligence agencies on the question of whether Iraq possessed illicit weapons before last year's invasion by the United States. An unclassified version of the report is to be made public later this month. Some close to Mr. Tenet say the report was among the factors that led him to step down from a post he had considered leaving for several years. Officials who have read the report described it as presenting an across-the-board indictment of the C.I.A.'s performance on Iraq. They said its criticisms ranged from inadequate prewar collection of intelligence by spies and satellites to a sloppy analytical peformance, often based on uncorroborated sources, that produced the mistaken conclusion that Iraq possessed biological and chemical weapons. ""There are some things that are indefensible,"" said a recently retired intelligence official familiar with the report. ""There are some real errors, of omission and commission, and it's not going to be a pretty picture."" A congressional official declined to comment on the tone or specific content of the report, but said: ""Our intention has been to be as detailed and as thorough as possible, and we've been very specific."" The version of the report that was shared with the C.I.A. included only factual findings, not the separate conclusions that are still being worked out by Democrats and Republicans on the Republican-controlled panel, government officials said. But the findings alone were portrayed by three separate officials as likely to be particularly embarrassing to the C.I.A., whose analysts were the main proponents within the intelligence community of the view that Iraq possessed illicit weapons. To date, Mr. Tenet and his agency have insisted that it is too soon to say whether the C.I.A. made mistakes in its prewar assessment. But even before Mr. Tenet announced his resignation, the committee chairman, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, said at a breakfast meeting on Thursday that he believed the intelligence community was still ""in denial"" on the issue. Richard J. Kerr, a former deputy director of central intelligence who has been leading the C.I.A.'s own internal review of its performance, said in an interview that he had not read the Senate report. But he said he believed it had been a factor in Mr. Tenet's decision to step down. ""This has been a very rough go,"" Mr. Kerr said, citing the criticism during Mr. Tenet's tenure of the agency's performance on other issues, including the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, the subject of another forthcoming report, by an independent presidential commission, which is due to be released next month. The reports by the Senate committee and the Sept. 11 commission ""are going to be very critical"" of Mr. Tenet and his agency, Mr. Kerr said. ""I think he was at a point where he thought maybe it was better that he was no longer the person up front on this."" Until early this week, congressional officials said, Mr. Tenet had been tentatively scheduled to appear before the Senate committee in a closed session on Thursday, in what would have amounted to a final rebuttal before the report was released. The officials said that Mr. Tenet had cancelled that appearance, citing other committments but giving no hint that he was preparing to step down. A senior intelligence official said that the C.I.A., which has the power to decide how much of the classified report can be released in unclassified form, was expected to complete its review soon. One senior government official who works outside the C.I.A. and who has seen the report described it as prosecutorial in tone. ""This is not what you'd call a balanced, analytical document,"" said the official, who is not normally an ally of Mr. Tenet. ""It's very, very harsh."" Mr. Tenet and President Bush both said Thursday that Mr. Tenet's reasons for leaving were personal, and others close to Mr. Tenet endorsed that account. Some, including David Boren, the former Democratic senator from Oklahoma who was Mr. Tenet's mentor on Capitol Hill, emphatically denied that the forthcoming Senate report or the one by the Sept. 11 commission had anything to do with the resignation. But in anticipation of the report, Senator Roberts, the intelligence committee chairman, had by Thursday morning adopted a newly critical tone toward the intelligence agencies that Mr. Tenet oversees. ""Simply put, I think the community is somewhat in denial,"" Senator Roberts said at a breakfast meeting, at which he also called for ""fresh thinking"" within the intelligence community. A joint statement issued later by Senator Roberts and his Democratic counterpart, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, praised Mr. Tenet for his contributions but also called attention to to the stormy environment in which he was departing. ""While he steps down during a period of controversy over events leading up to the attacks of 9/11 and the quality of intelligence prior to the Iraq War, we should not lose sight of a simple truth: George Tenet has served his country with distinction and honor during difficult and demanding times,"" the two senators said in the statement. Among the particular criticisms that government officials said were spelled out in the classified version of the Senate report were the failure of the C.I.A. to develop human sources of intelligence within Saddam Hussein's government before the war. As late as 2002, intelligence officials have acknowledged, American intelligence agencies could count on no more than four informants within the Iraqi government. The report is also critical of what is described as the C.I.A.'s heavy reliance on foreign governments for intelligence about Iraq, including sources who were never interviewed by American intelligence agencies and whose veracity is now doubted. Among those sources were one known as ""Curveball,"" who was introduced to German intelligence by the Iraqi National Congress, a group headed by Ahmad Chalabi, and who was cited in American intelligence reports as the primary basis for what now appears to be the mistaken assertion that Iraq had mobile laboratories for the manufacture of biological weapons. The report also calls attention to what one official called ""slipshod work"" and ""factual errors"" by C.I.A. analysts and operations officials, including cases in which single sources of intelligence were identified as multiple sources, and in which at least one warning that identified a source of intelligence as a fabricator was ignored. The information provided by the fabricator - that Iraq possessed mobile biological laboratories - found its way into Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's presentation last February to the United Nations Security Council making administration's case for war. In a speech earlier this year, Mr. Tenet acknowledged in general terms the mishandling of the notification about the fabricator, who was also linked to the Iraqi National Congress. Other intelligence officials, also in general terms, have acknowledged mistakes involving a single source being listed by various names, so that the accounts were presented as corrroborating one another. But government officials who have read the Senate report said it spells out many more mistakes and does so in abundant detail. ",2004-06-03T05:00:00+0000

His choice of subject was characteristically rich and arcane: the death (in 1940) of the German thinker Walter Benjamin, who became recognized posthumously as a hero of intellectual adventure.

Soon it was the bustling Oklahoma capital, but resentful politicians helped Oklahoma City snatch away that title in 1910, and Guthrie went into a deep slumber. It awoke in the 1990's as a preserved piece of Americana -- its downtown historic district is a National Historic Landmark -- where visitors walk brick streets, take snapshots of elegant facades and poke through folksy antiques stores. Crowds come for events like the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association Range Roundup, a rodeo taking place this weekend, or the International Bluegrass Festival in the fall, with the likes of the Japanese Bluegrass Band. At the State Capital Publishing Museum, you can read the newspaper editorials that provoked Oklahoma's first governor, Charles N. Haskell, to threaten, ''I'll see grass grow on the streets of Guthrie.'' The grass never came, but his curse left a late 19th-century prairie town intact for 21st-century pleasure.

The blast was initially reported as an accident caused by exploding gas or oxygen cylinders, but within hours the authorities said they had found evidence of a bomb. Aleksandr P. Kromin, spokesman for the region's prosecutor, said in a telephone interview that more than two pounds of explosives had been used. It was not immediately clear who placed the bomb or what the motive might have been. Televised images of the site showed destroyed stalls and mangled aluminum roofing strewn over the ground. A representative for the Ministry of Emergency Situations said Samara, a city of roughly 1.2 million near the border with Kazakhstan, had no history of terrorism related to Russia's war in Chechnya. Mr. Kromin said the possibility that the bombing was related a dispute among criminal gangs had not been ruled out. C.J. Chivers (NYT)",2004-06-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   LAUTENBACH, TERRY R.","LAUTENBACH -- Terry R. Long time Darien, Conn., resident and retired IBM senior executive, Terry R. Lautenbach died Wednesday in Bedford Hills, NY. He was 65. He died of heart failure, according to his family. He was with his nephew, Marc Lautenbach, at the time of his death. Born August 10, 1938, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Mr. Lautenbach was the second son of the late Frances Herbert and Robert Charles Lautenbach. Mr. Lautenbach graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati in 1959 and joined IBM that same year. Mr. Lautenbach and his wife, Carole, moved to Darien in 1974, where they raised their six daughters. He held a variety of senior executive positions while at IBM. When he retired in 1992, he was a senior vice president and a member of the four-person IBM Management Committee. He oversaw a large part of IBM's operations, including its U.S. sales force and its worldwide manufacturing and development. He held a number of marketing and management posts during his rise to become the youngest president of the data processing division in 1976. Afterward, he served in a series of senior positions in the United States and internationally, including chairman IBM Americas, Far East, and Group Executive Information Systems and Communication Group. Mr. Lautenbach left a strong legacy at IBM. Retired IBM Chairman and CEO, John Opel, said of Mr. Lautenbach ''Terry has an extremely bright and quick intellect matched with his sensitive good humor and energy that gave him the ability to be excellent in everything he pursued -- family, business, career and social and civic endeavors--every place he added value. We all wanted him on our team.'' Part of Mr. Lautenbach's legacy included contributions to the advancement of women and African Americans at IBM. Ted Childs, IBM vice president, said of Mr. Lautenbach, ''Terry was committed to all people and ensured that everyone has a fair chance. He hated intolerance and injustice and had a profound impact on my career and ability to do the work that I do at IBM.'' Mr. Lautenbach was also an active member of the Darien community, serving as president of the board of trustees of the Darien Library, Campaign Chairman for the Darien United Way, and on his church council. After retiring from IBM, Mr. Lautenbach moved to Sanibel, Fla., but continued to visit Darien frequently. Mr. Lautenbach remained active after his retirement, serving as a director on various corporate boards, including Varian Medical Systems, CVS, Footstar, Air Products, and Loomis Sayles. Mr. Lautenbach was also an avid golfer and a founding member and first president of the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, Fla. While known primarily as a leader in the business world, Mr. Lautenbach was most proud of his family, both immediate and extended. He was a beloved husband, father and grandfather known to his thirteen grandchildren as Poppop. He was at his happiest when surrounded by as many family members as possible. Mr. Lautenbach is survived by his wife of 44 years, Carole; his six daughters, Jennifer Streeter of Darien, Conn., Susan Bates, Julie Maxman, Martha Lautenbach, Mary Lautenbach, and Anne Stern of Atlanta, Ga.; three brothers, Ned Lautenbach, Dan Lautenbach, Jim Lautenbach and one sister, Cynthia Chappell. Mr. Lautenbach's oldest brother, Thom, is deceased. Mr. Lautenbach is also survived by his thirteen grandchildren and four godsons. A memorial service will be held at the Harvey - Englehardt - Metz Funeral Home, 1600 Colonial Boulevard, Fort Meyers, Fla., Sunday, June 6, 4-8 PM. The mass of Christian burial will be celebrated on Monday, June 7 at the Saint Isabel Catholic Church, 3559 Sanibel Captiva Road, Sanibel, Fla., at 1 PM. Private urnment will be at a later date.

In the words of Lucy Baldor, the narrator of Janice Kaplan and Lynn Schnurnberger's midlife-crisis bonbon, THE BOTOX DIARIES (Ballantine, $23.95), which should be sold with fuzzy slippers and a tube of cucumber eye gel: ''One good kiss from the right guy still makes you more radiant than a year of dermabrasion.'' But don't cancel that beauty appointment just yet because, in these metrosexual times, a good kiss can be hard to find. Lizzie Miller, the nubile agency peon who stars in Clare Naylor and Mimi Hare's high-spirited sprint of a novel, THE SECOND ASSISTANT: A Tale From the Bottom of the Hollywood Ladder (Viking, $21.95), likes to frolic in pools wearing nothing but diamonds and a G-string, but even she usually strikes out. Caroming from one cad to another, she grows used to ''men who wear mascara in between eyelash dyes'' and tell their girlfriends how to dress to go shopping at Whole Foods. ''I was starting to think that if I had to kiss one more freak,'' she wails, ''I might not make it through.'' And yet, in the opinion of Drew Vance, who tackles a conquest in the elevator of a doorman building in THE RIGHT ADDRESS (Broadway, $21.95), a bitchy and brittle Park Avenue fable by Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman, a kiss remains ''a good way to pass the time.''

It's rare to find a performance going on behind a singer that sounds relaxed and organic, like a working band rather than a pile of studio musicians' excited contributions. The young singer Maria Rita happens to be the daughter of Elis Regina, one of Brazil's greatest pop stars in the 60's and 70's, and her first album, ''Maria Rita'' (Warner Music Latina), proves an exception. It's produced by Tom Capone, who recorded Ms. Rita and her acoustic band live in the studio, with nicely clanky details and open space in the sound. They switch happily from samba to Afro-Cuban rhythm to ballads to funk, using great songwriters, and Ms. Rita's lithe, small voice warms the mix without her mother's nervous edge. The album has become a hit in Brazil, and rightly so.",2004-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Thoughts and ideas pile up furiously in his notebooks; diagrams and scribbles and equations issue forth at all hours of the day and night. When Joy, 49, finally moved out of a small Sun office in downtown Aspen, where he had worked since the late 1980's, he had to archive 900 pounds of professional papers.

Myers, who has said that elected officials who favor abortion rights should not take communion. During a news conference, when asked if he favored denying communion to such officials, Bishop Serratelli said that a committee of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops was studying that matter and that it would be premature to offer his views until the committee issues a report.

The plan includes a ''millionaire's tax'' on households that earn $500,000 or more. The proposal is intended to raise an estimated $800 million for the NJ Saver and Homestead rebate programs, increasing direct property tax relief in New Jersey to nearly $1.5 billion a year. It also calls for a constitutional convention, which would be limited to the issue of property taxes, as well as a 2.5 percent cap on increases in municipal and school budgets.

us,What The Bagel Man Saw,"Once upon a time, Paul F. dreamed big dreams. While studying agricultural economics at Cornell, he wanted to end world hunger. Instead, after doctoral work at M.I.T., he wound up taking a job with a research institute in Washington, analyzing the weapons expenditures of the United States Navy. This was in 1962. After four years came more of the same: analyst jobs with the Bureau of the Budget, the Institute for Defense Analyses, the President's Commission on Federal Statistics. Still, he dreamed. He had ''potent research ideas,'' as he recalls them now, which the Environmental Protection Agency failed to appreciate. He developed a statistical means of predicting cancer clusters, but because he was an economist and not a doctor, he couldn't make headway with the National Cancer Institute. He still loved the art of economics -- the data-gathering, the statistical manipulation, the problem-solving -- but it had led him to a high-level dead end. He was well paid and unfulfilled. ''I'd go to the office Christmas party, and people would introduce me to their wives or husbands as the guy who brings in the bagels,'' he says. '''Oh! You're the guy who brings in the bagels!' Nobody ever said, 'This is the guy in charge of the public research group.'''",2004-06-06T05:00:00+0000

My eye wandered to an Asian-style risotto of lobster and black truffles. Irresistible, so why resist? -- although $34 was pushing the upper limit on what was, when you got down to it, a glorified bar menu.

Dressed in forest-green pants and shirt, with white socks and black shoes, he looked more like the guy who comes to fix your dishwasher than an inmate of a federal institution. This was the Transfer Center of the United States Bureau of Prisons, the transportation hub for thousands of state and federal convicts passing through each year on their way from one prison to another. Jones was part of the ''cadre,'' or group of inmates who dish up the meals, cut the grass and generally keep the facility running. I had last seen him six months before, on June 30, 2003, in an upscale subdivision south of Tulsa where he wished goodbye to his wife and his daughter and his son-in-law standing on the steps of their house. He had changed considerably since then. His ruddy face had acquired the proverbial jailhouse pallor; he was down about 20 pounds, owing to his distaste for prison food.

That afternoon, I was trailing my book's main subject, Lolli, as she bought the month's groceries. She was a teenager, pregnant, homeless and already the mother of two children. Her young family subsisted on food stamps and vouchers from the federal subsidy program, WIC. The shield of my judgment rose when she passed right by the C-Town weekly discount flier and made her way down the dirty aisles with her shopping cart. She just grabbed things -- packs of chicken legs and pork chops, bags of sugar and rice, bottles of vegetable oil; in went cans of beans and tins of Spam. I stood, stunned, as she reached for the individual-portion cartons of juice -- with their brightly colored miniature straws -- ignoring the larger, economy-size bottles. No calculation of unit price, no can'ts or shoulds or ought-not-to's, no keen eye to the comparative ounce. By the time her stuffed cart reached the checkout line, my unease was turning into anger.

Richard Colburn's generous leadership support as a Founding Angel, through the Colburn Foundation and as a Domingo Angel enabled Los Angeles Opera to reach higher levels of artistic achievements each season and grow into an internationally acclaimed major opera house. Richard Colburn leaves a legacy of vision in philanthropy and the arts. He will be remembered especially for his personal energy, his prodigious knowledge of music and musicians, and his passion for excellence in performance. An accomplished violist himself, Richard had a deep appreciation for musicians and their accomplishments. He was a memorable presence in the opera house where he particularly relished opening nights, premieres and other festive evenings. We will miss his quiet encouragement from the first row at each performance he attended and the unusual rapport he had with our musicians and other members of the Company. We will miss his wise counsel during challenging times and his irreverent wit in even the most difficult of circumstances.

Hannah Simpson was a strong-willed Pennsylvania woman who believed that work could save souls and who told people (apparently with some repetition) that she wanted to live ""unspotted from the world."" People noted that she meant what she said.

The French Ambassador, M. Paul Claudel, disagrees with his British colleague on this question. It is reported here that M. Claudel has received notes from nine wine merchants at Bordeaux, who fear the loss of their trade with the Diplomatic Corps in Washington. The business, they state, is worth $50,000 annually.

Madstone, based in New York, is an offshoot of Madstone Films, a production company founded in 1999. Its theaters aimed to attract movie buffs with documentaries, foreign films and retrospectives, as well as first-run films. They also offer BYOBaby, a weekly film series that allows parents to bring children under 2 years old at no charge. Officials said attendance at the three theaters did not meet expectations.

The tent camps, some housing thousands of refugees, have been an embarrassment for Russia, though officials have denied forcibly resettling Chechens. At least 170 families remained at the last camp, called Satsita, until the regional government issued its decree ordering them to leave, saying they would no longer receive aid, according to Tamerlan Akiyev of the human rights organization Memorial. ''There was no violence, no force used to make people go,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''Former refugees are leaving for Chechnya not because they want to,'' he added, ''but because there is no choice.'' According to official numbers that some believe to be understated, tens of thousands of Chechens remain in Ingushetia, living in private homes or makeshift housing.

Many royalists believe the heart belonged to Louis XVII, and a DNA test of the heart four years ago confirmed that it came from a close relative of the executed queen. But controversy still swirls over whether Louis XVII died as a child or survived to adulthood. After the ceremony, monarchists shouted ''Long live the king!'' in support of the Duke of Anjou, Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon, one of several claimants to the French throne. But Charles Louis Edmond de Bourbon, the great grandson of a man who said he was the adult Louis XVII, insisted the ceremony was a sacrilege.

When dusk falls, the lights of Port Angeles, Wash., wink across the Strait of Juan de Fuca from Victoria's own spectacularly lighted provincial Parliament buildings and the landmark Fairmont Empress hotel. Victoria invites exploration with a lively and compact downtown, abundant parkland, miles of trails and what has been called the mildest climate in Canada. Taking a spin around the Tudor-style neighborhoods (a tribute to the city's English heritage) of suburban Oak Bay, cyclists can stop for picnic lunch near a towering totem pole (a symbol of the area's indigenous people) in Beacon Hill Park.

''For them, the system was about getting even -- 'I can't punish the ones who did this to me, but I can punish you' -- and that bothered me,'' Swift says.

The idea, she says, was to explore the interactions between several women and the bizarre, flamboyant clothing made of chicken skin that she made for them. ""I created the garments to look Victorian and feminine, with puffy sleeves, ruffles, and layers of fabric,"" she says, ""and therefore pictured them worn by older, queen-like women."" To find the perfect subjects, she placed an ad online and recruited through acting agencies, but found many by simply observing passersby on the streets of New York. (One woman was a former denizen of Andy Warhol's the Factory whom the photographer met in a Starbucks.) Yolacan began photographing her work simply to document it, but quickly realized that the documentation itself was strong enough to stand alone. Starting in September, prints from this portfolio will be exhibited in Yolacan's first solo show, at Silo, a new a gallery on the Lower East Side. Go to Slide Show ",2004-06-13T05:00:00+0000

About a third of all sexually active adults in Botswana and South Africa carry H.I.V., a rate nearly 10 times higher than almost anywhere in the world outside Africa.

Les Halles had long served Paris as its nutritional epicenter, in essence, its stomach. Zola wrote: ''Then there came three Brie cheeses displayed on round platters and looking like melancholy extinct moons. Two of them, very dry, were at the full; the third, in its second quarter, was melting away in a white cream.'' Yet Les Halles was far more than a marketplace, and when the demands of expansion and congestion forced the relocation of the market in the late 1960's, the historian Louis Chevalier somberly proclaimed, ''With Les Halles gone, Paris is gone.''",2004-06-13T05:00:00+0000

Tweedy's poems are uncapitalized, generally unpunctuated and adhere to the notion of poetry as a series of surprising images -- for example, ''knives and forks / perform over my bed / fiberglass insulation, / a migrating pink dream.'' Sometimes, as in ''When I Say My Heart'' and ''Prayer #4,'' this approach yields poems that are interesting, if not necessarily cohesive. On the whole, though, Tweedy's awkward and occasionally embarrassing collection proves that you can be in possession of a guitar, three chords and the truth -- and still write a lousy sestina.

''It's like buyin' a book called, like, y'know, America or something.'' It's not hard to buy a book about Johnny Cash, who died last September at 71. There have been countless biographies, and he wrote at least three books himself: two autobiographies and a novel called ''Man in White.'' This spring two lavishly illustrated large-format books about Cash have been released. The best is CASH (Crown, $29.95), by the editors of Rolling Stone, a mix of new material and terrific stuff from the magazine's archives, including a groovy and gripping chunk of new journalism by Ralph J. Gleason, published in 1969, about a Cash show in San Quentin. (''Let me tell you, baby,'' Gleason writes, ''approaching the huge concrete and steel structure of San Quentin, just approaching it defines the phrase bad vibes.'') The other book, CASH: An American Man (CMT/Pocket Books, $30), by Bill Miller, is basically an overstuffed scrapbook. On display here are things like Cash's Air Force uniform, even cancelled checks. Amid this pile of happy detritus is a photograph of a 1970's-era plastic container with Cash's grinning image on it. When Cash saw it, Miller reports, he rolled his eyes and said: ''You know you've made it when you're on a Slurpee cup.'' Dwight Garner",2004-06-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Shooting the Great and the Good,"Although he was a costume and set designer, a self-made dandy, an old-fashioned snob and a diarist, Cecil Beaton may have created his most significant legacy in his elegant and studied photographs. The handsome reproductions in BEATON PORTRAITS (Yale University, $50), by Terence Pepper, curator of photographs at the National Portrait Gallery in London, include a superbly androgynous Katharine Hepburn; Marlon Brando before his breakthrough in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' looking, improbably, like a British schoolboy with long tousled hair; Francis Bacon appearing every bit as alarming as a figure in one of his paintings. Here also is an irresistibly seductive -- and remarkably hirsute -- Yul Brynner. In an included essay, Peter Conrad, who teaches English at Oxford University, persuasively argues that although Beaton glorified his subjects, he also ''glimpsed a reality that belied the fiction he was helping to create.'' And he observes that when the social-climbing Beaton was permitted entry into the upper-crust world of Ascot -- the very place he would recreate so effectively with his splendid designs for both the stage and film versions of ''My Fair Lady'' -- ''his presence there was a symptom of the democratization he despised.''

It also commemorates the first day that James Joyce, Bloom's creator, ''walked out'' with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle. On Bloomsday, as it has been known for more than 50 years, Joyce diehards will have a chance to celebrate his great novel ''Ulysses'' in costume, recital and booze. They can retrace Bloom's footsteps to Davy Byrnes's ''moral pub'' or indulge in Bloom trivia by buying cakes of lemon soap, as Bloom did for his secret epistolary lover, Martha.",2004-06-13T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Hodges's new movie, ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead'' (opening on Friday), is just his ninth feature in 33 years, and even that total is a little misleading: he disowns ''A Prayer for the Dying'' (1987), which was taken away from him and recut by the studio, and ''Black Rainbow'' (1989) was never released theatrically in the United States. This sparseness of output should place him solidly in the maverick/perfectionist class of Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick, but a Mike Hodges film has never generated the frenzies of anticipation that a new Kubrick once did, or that a long-delayed Malick or Quentin Tarantino movie does now. In an age of hype and instant overexposure, it's almost easier to become a legend than to remain, as Mr. Hodges stubbornly has, a minor cult figure.

Scott Steinhardt, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole, said its role was ''solely to ensure the safe and timely transition of offenders to federal custody.'' But Martin Ficke, special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said those arrested were ''hard core criminals'' seized in a crackdown on deportable parolees.

The women's claims -- first reported on New York 1 News -- grew out of a confrontation about 10 p.m. on Fifth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, after the police had tried several times to clear the street, Mr. Kelly said. An amateur photographer's video appeared to show the officers using pepper spray, and two women told a television reporter that they were manhandled and threatened, off camera. Mr. Kelly said he reviewed the video Monday night. ''There was a confrontation,'' he acknowledged. But, he said, ''I didn't see any inappropriate activity on the part of the police. They're moving people back.'' Mr. Kelly said officers from the Internal Affairs Bureau had visited the scene. City Councilwoman Sara M. Gonzalez said after meeting with Mr. Kelly yesterday that she would arrange a second meeting with him and residents of the community. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also dismissed the allegations.

Cuomo of New York said yesterday that he had been hired by Lions Gate Films to help appeal a decision by the Motion Picture Association of America to give the new Michael Moore political documentary, ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' an R rating instead of PG-13. The ratings board said it had based its decision on the film's ''violent and disturbing images'' and strong language. The movie, which opens on June 25, gained wide attention after the Walt Disney Company refused to distribute it. A sharp critique of the Bush administration and its decision to go to war in Iraq, it later earned the top prize at the Cannes film festival. Lions Gate, an independent studio, agreed this month to distribute the movie. Mr. Cuomo, who said he supported Senator John Kerry's bid to unseat President Bush, said he had seen the film three times and was ''convinced that it should be viewed and reflected upon by as many Americans as possible.'' He said he did not believe the movie association's decision was politically motivated, but he added that ''there has been a tough political effort to keep this film from being viewed.''

The move reflected an expected drop in business after the busy summer travel season, the airline said. Delta plans to resume its regular schedules in October. Such a move is common among airlines, because business usually declines sharply after Labor Day. Delta, hit by financial problems, is conducting a top-to-bottom review of its operations, and has hired restructuring consultants, hoping to devise a turnaround plan by late summer. It has warned it might seek bankruptcy protection if it is unable to cut costs and win wage and benefit concessions from its pilots. Micheline Maynard (NYT)",2004-06-16T05:00:00+0000

James Joyce, age 22, would walk out that very night in Dublin with Nora Barnacle, whom he later wedded. ''Ulysses'' is set on that day -- Bloomsday, as it has come to be called -- in honor of Joyce's meeting Miss Barnacle. Many Joyceans have made of Bloomsday a literary Mardi Gras, an odyssey through Dublin using the points of Joyce's compass, a day to celebrate Irishness and the peculiar verbal fecundity of that nation. In a novel full of celebrated talkers, it is Bloom, Jew and Irishman, who hovers, voice and thought, over the proceedings. As one barroom patron in the novel says, show Bloom a straw on the floor and ''he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.''",2004-06-16T05:00:00+0000

The big ocean-going container ships, which run their engines while docked to power lights, lifts and other equipment, produce the greatest amount of harmful emissions. The next largest sources of pollution in the harbor are tugboats and commuter ferries. The report recommends that the government impose strict emissions standards for newly built ships while also offering programs to modernize existing vessels with anti-pollution devices to lower air pollution in the harbor and in neighborhoods near the water's edge.

After spending most of his youth working summers on the family dairy farm in Falls Village, CT, Michael graduated from Phillips Andover Academy in 1952. Following school, he served four years in the U.S. Navy, then attended Babson College where he received a BSBA (1959) and an MBA (1963).

Michael retired from Kidder in 1993. A lifelong traveler, Michael and his wife, Sarah, moved to France in 1994 to spend a year in Annecy.

After the test scores at Mr. Riccobono's East New York schools were rechecked, it turned out that they had risen during his last year. Mr. Riccobono sued for reinstatement and won, but the city appealed. Yesterday, a five-judge panel affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that Mr. Riccobono had not received due process before being fired.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BUTCHER, CHARLES","BUTCHER -- Charles. Busi nessman and philanthropist known for his generosity and passion for knowledge and justice, died at his home on June 12, 2004 after a long illness. At the time of his death, he lived in Boulder, CO, and maintained a family home in Maine. Charles Butcher was born in 1916 in Cambridge, MA, and attended Harvard University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Economics. He was a conscientious objector during World War II and, as a consequence, received what he called his ''postgraduate education'' in federal prison and work camps. He continued to live his values for the rest of his life. In 1951, after several years in the printing business, Charles Butcher joined the Butcher Company, a familyowned floor care products company in Massachusetts. He became CEO shortly thereafter. Over the next five decades, he developed the Butcher Company from a small regional firm into a large, successful, socially responsible company with international reach, 100 times its original size. A pioneer in thinking about socially responsible business practices, he was invited to lecture at business schools and consult with business leaders. When he sold the Butcher Company, then headquartered in Marlborough, MA, to Johnson Wax Professional in 2000, Charles Butcher and his wife, distributed $18 million of the sale proceeds to the company's 325 employees. He published a book, How to Succeed in Business by Giving Away Millions. A lifelong fascination with science led Charles Butcher, in 1965, to found the Lazy Eight, a network of scientists interested in cross - disciplinary ap proaches to technical problem-solving, education and issues of poverty. In 1973 he began working with Dr. Larry Gold in the lab of the Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology Department of the University of Colorado. In 1986, he was chairman of the board of Clonetics, a biotech start-up that gained international recognition for its genetic research; in 1991 he joined the board of NeXagen, a biomedical company. With Dr. Gold, he designed the Discovery Exchange to promote cooperation between academic scientists and business. In addition to his direction of the Butcher Company, his work with high-tech and biotech startups, and his own scientific research, Charles Butcher spent decades as an active and creative philanthropist. He dedicated his giving to encouraging and promoting civil liberties, -big-picturescientific thinking and creative cross-disciplinary research. In 2002, in recognition of his longstanding, continuous support for civil liberties and his leadership as a board member, the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado presented Charles Butcher its 50th Anniversary Champion of Liberty Award. Charles Butcher, with his wife, in 2002, contributed $1.1 million to the University of Colorado to fund the launch of the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology, which is using a multidisciplinary approach to unlock genomics secrets to improve the quality of life and health for all people. An energetic entrepreneur, a master sailor, and a generous friend and mentor, Charles Butcher was the father of eight children. His wife, the former Jane Weinberg, is a founder of the Women of the West Museum, the Co-Chair of the University of Colorado Conference on World Affairs and Co-Chair of Mother Jones magazine. Charles Butcher is survived by his wife, Jane, his children Catherine Butcher and husband Ben Pfohl, Susan Butcher and husband David Monson, Kimiko Butcher and husband Neil Grundy, Benjamin Butcher, Claudine Butcher and husband Michael Hannigan, Gina Lasky and husband David Lasky, and Andrew Butcher and grandchildren Ethan Pfohl, Naomi Pfohl, Tekla Monson, Chisana Monson, Charles Grundy and Rachel Grundy. His son, Charles Evan Butcher, predeceased him.

That year, he became the president of a nonprofit charitable organization based in Harlem called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, and he set out trying to improve the world, one poor child at a time. It was a bad moment to be poor in New York City. Harlem, especially, was suffering under the simultaneous plagues of crack cocaine, cheap guns and rampant homelessness, and Canada's main goal at Rheedlen, in those years, was to keep the children in his programs alive. The organization had an annual budget of $3 million, which it spent on a predictable array of services in Upper Manhattan: after-school programs, truancy prevention, anti-violence training for teenagers. The programs seemed to do a lot of good for the children who were enrolled in them, at least in part because of Canada's own level of devotion.

He loved going out at night, he hated going out at night. He loved women, he loved men. He loved working, he dreaded working. And the matter of his sexuality remains so strange and hidden, open sometimes, back enclosed again. He's constantly glittering, appearing briefly, clearly, and then going back in again in almost every way, including the fact that some of his short stories are so bad, for example, so clunky, so crude.

With the continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the army expects more than 1,000 soldiers to graduate in fiscal 2006, a fourfold increase over 2003. But it is the content of the instruction, more than the quantity of it, that is receiving the most attention in light of the scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison ""What we have done is put a spotlight at what took place at Abu Ghraib,"" said Major General James Marks, the outgoing commander of the Army Intelligence Center here.

Fifteen years ago, Metallica drank so much that it was referred to by fans as Alcoholica, and the band members all thought that was hilarious. But now things are different.

us,Political Landscapes,"The campaign stump, by its very nature, is a scripted and tightly managed affair. The overall effect -- the strategically selected backdrop, the fixed camera position, the obligatory pressed flesh -- is one of a highly manipulated and well-behaved space. But what if you were to pull back and reframe the campaign stump to include what lies just beyond? Not only would you see the TV trucks and flag-bearing cranes and other paraphernalia of the P.R. machinery; you would also see the uninterested passer-by, the surrounding traffic jam, the beginnings of the unruly everyday life that extends outside the campaign. The British photographer Simon Norfolk, a regular contributor to the magazine and the winner this year of the International Center of Photography's photojournalism award, embarked on this assignment, using a special large-format camera to capture, from a unique perspective and distance, the 2004 presidential race (including public appearances by the president, which are not technically campaign events). The images that he produced reward a different way of viewing the campaign, one that does not expect the photograph to deliver the candidate as the center of attention. Indeed, a viewer might linger over Norfolk's work before being able to locate the candidate. In these pictures, the unessential detail is everything, be it the sharpshooter with his binoculars perched on the rooftop; or someone lazing in the grass; or a Secret Service contingent; or the Washington press corps; or people gathering on the steps of a nearby building; or, outside a fund-raiser in Bal Harbor, Fla., a lone beachgoer fishing in the night surf.",2004-06-20T05:00:00+0000

In vain I explain to him that the Cubans left Angola ten years ago and that the rare few that stayed have become dentists on the Marginal. He insists. Almost gets angry. And now this former fighter for the war of independence, this party leader, who has become, with time, this little gentle-looking man, with the cautious and conciliatory manners, with impeccably coiffed white hair, launches into a strange speech in which his glorious past is mixed up with hallucinations of the present: a jumbled confusion of insurrection against the Portuguese; the war, almost immediately afterwards, against the Marxists of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), who are victorious and oust him from power; Sartre on Capri; Fanon, who was a friend of his; and then that dark story of the Cubans, his enemies from long ago, he is sure he sees them returning, on certain nights, like ghosts, to the city.

That's the case with Lee, the young, beautiful and angry narrator of Jardine Libaire's first novel, HERE KITTY KITTY (Little, Brown, $22.95). A Tribeca restaurant manager, Lee makes a late-morning Scotch, after snorting coke all night, seem whimsically glamorous. But Lee's charm is fading, and she knows it: ''Innocence was finite and could not be regenerated.'' Even her sugar-daddy French boyfriend, Yves, who ''secretly loved chaos,'' tells Lee to get it together. Inevitably, she bottoms out, but there are no easy epiphanies in this dark, tender book. (And it's not the typical single-girl story of guy trouble and job boredom either.) Libaire instead wisely explores her heroine's long and difficult struggle to take care of herself: to be sober, to sleep peacefully, to be alone. In the process, the author offers glittering descriptions of New York life, both its obstacles and its promise. Suzy Hansen",2004-06-20T05:00:00+0000

A month before, during the siege of Falluja by 4,500 United States marines, this same railway station was attacked by American helicopters after insurgents inside the station fired rocket-propelled grenades at Marine snipers nearby. But now things were very different. On May 1, as Falluja and the world braced for an all-out assault by the marines, the siege was suddenly called off. The marines announced they were pulling out and ceding control of the city to a new, all-Iraqi force. The man who engineered the deal was Muhammad Latif, a 66-year-old former Iraqi Army colonel from Baghdad. Latif promised the Americans that he could pacify Falluja with a corps of laid-off soldiers from Saddam Hussein's army. Some would be former members of the Republican Guard, the elite force responsible for the regime's darkest hours, and some would be drawn from the insurgents the Americans had been fighting -- a very different situation indeed.",2004-06-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The Harlem Project,"Back in 1990, Geoffrey Canada was just your average do-gooder. That year, he became the president of a nonprofit charitable organization based in Harlem called the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, and he set out trying to improve the world, one poor child at a time. It was a bad moment to be poor in New York City. Harlem, especially, was suffering under the simultaneous plagues of crack cocaine, cheap guns and rampant homelessness, and Canada's main goal at Rheedlen, in those years, was to keep the children in his programs alive. The organization had an annual budget of $3 million, which it spent on a predictable array of services in Upper Manhattan: after-school programs, truancy prevention, anti-violence training for teenagers. The programs seemed to do a lot of good for the children who were enrolled in them, at least in part because of Canada's own level of devotion. He was obsessed with his job, personally invested in the lives of the children he was helping and devastated when they ended up in prison or on drugs or shot dead on the street.

The biographer, Ross Miller, 58, is a professor of English and comparative literature at the University of Connecticut, an architecture critic and the author of several books, Mr. Roth's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, and a spokeswoman for the university said. Mr. Miller, a nephew of the playwright Arthur Miller, said he would write a definitive biography. It is not an authorized biography. ''One of the reasons this is not so daunting,'' Mr. Miller said, ''is that I knew Philip when I was young.'' The book will be published by Houghton Mifflin in 2009 or 2010, Mr. Miller said. He is also the editor of the Library of America's planned eight-volume edition of Mr. Roth's writings. Mr. Miller's book ''Free at Last: Why the Jews Discovered America'' is to be published by Houghton Mifflin in 2006.

us,THEATER: BYPASSING BROADWAY,"The producers of ''We Will Rock You,'' the West End musical built around the songs of the band Queen, have announced that they will bypass Broadway in favor of opening in Las Vegas, which until recently was not exactly known as a legitimate theater town. But that, of course, started to change last week when it was announced that the Tony Award-winning musical ''Avenue Q'' would forgo a national road tour in favor of opening in 2005 in a new $40 million theater in Las Vegas. The opening of ''We Will Rock You'' in Las Vegas may be less of a surprise because this rock musical features the type of large-scale spectacle that the city is famous for. When the show opened in London two years ago, it was roundly panned by critics, who mocked its futuristic plot about a group of rebels, the Bohemians, who are in search of a mythical guitar that was buried by the members of Queen themselves in the late 20th century. The show, whose producers include Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal and the Queen guitarist Brian May, above, and the drummer Roger Taylor, are to announce that it will begin its open-ended run on Aug. 16 at the Thtre des Arts, Paris Las Vegas.

My mother named me William Jefferson Blythe III after my father, William Jefferson Blythe Jr., one of nine children of a poor farmer in Sherman, Texas, who died when my father was seventeen. According to his sisters, my father always tried to take care of them, and he grew up to be a handsome, hardworking, fun-loving man. He met my mother at Tri- State Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1943, when she was training to be a nurse. Many times when I was growing up, I asked Mother to tell me the story of their meeting, courting, and marriage. He brought a date with some kind of medical emergency into the ward where she was working, and they talked and flirted while the other woman was being treated. On his way out of the hospital, he touched the finger on which she was wearing her boyfriend's ring and asked her if she was married. She stammered ""no""-she was single. The next day he sent the other woman flowers and her heart sank. Then he called Mother for a date, explaining that he always sent flowers when he ended a relationship. ",2004-06-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Electronics Prices Decline,"The prices of consumer electronics continued to fall this spring, according to a new report from NPD Intelect. Prices declined 2 percent across the board in April from March, NPD, a market researcher, said yesterday, with prices dropping for 19 of the 27 products it tracks. The company said the biggest drop in dollars was in plasma and rear-projection televisions, both of which fell about $40 over March prices. ''TV prices remain under pressure as new screen sizes, new distribution channels and new brands alter the playing field at the high end of the market,'' Stephen Baker, director of industry analysis at NPD, said in a statement. ''Falling prices for plasma, which have declined over $1,000 since last January, and rear-projection TV, have put stress on category pricing all the way down to the basic tube set.'' DVD recorder prices declined 9.9 percent. Prices of personal CD players dropped 7.2 percent. Desktop and notebook PC prices fell as well. Notebook prices leveled off from an increase in March, and desktop prices dropped 5 percent from the previous month -- the biggest one-month decrease since November. Desktop PC prices are the only category that has seen an increase in average selling prices since January 2003.",2004-06-25T05:00:00+0000

Congress, which spent so many years obsessed with how to look tough on crime, is currently considering legislation that would tackle two of the big factors behind the revolving-door phenomenon: the huge number of mentally ill people in prison, and the difficulty ex-convicts have in carving out new lives in the law-abiding world.",2004-06-26T05:00:00+0000

The test works with saliva or a drop of blood and, like a home pregnancy test, gives easy-to-read results in 20 minutes. An estimated 225,000 Americans are unaware that they are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and public health authorities believe that many have not been tested because they fear needles. Also, the department said, 8,000 infected people who come to public clinics to be tested each year do not return to get their results a week later. Donald G.

us,Good At His Job,"''I hate to paint portraits! . . . Youth can better stand the exactions of a personal kind that are inseparable from portraiture,'' John Singer Sargent (1856-1925) confided late in life to the artist Walter Tittle. The irony is that Sargent was the most celebrated portrait painter of his time, commanding the best clientele, prices and reviews. Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent averaged 17 monumental portraits a year, primarily of British aristocrats and arrivistes eager to promote their lineage or wealth; even after officially retiring from portraiture in 1907, he turned out some 20 more as he was continually prevailed upon by friends and prominent people, including Woodrow Wilson and John D. Rockefeller. JOHN SINGER SARGENT: The Later Portraits (Yale, $65), by Richard Ormond, an art historian, and Elaine Kilmurray, research director of the John Singer Sargent catalogue raisonn project, scrupulously plumbs the artist's last 25 years and interestingly does not attempt to cast him as a great modernist innovator but rather as a technically superb commercial artist who understood -- and ultimately tired of -- the demands of pleasing his patrons. If he was criticized by the avant-garde for being formulaic -- Sargent himself praised Whistler for never doing the same thing twice -- the authors exhibit that his best work brilliantly captures his sitters' physicality and temperament. In 1900, the critic Roger Fry wrote of Sargent: ''Such works must have an enduring interest to posterity simply as perfect records of the style and manners of a particular period.'' Hilarie M.

At once challenging and accessible -- full of wit, beauty and melodrama as well as novelty and provocation -- these were the kind of movies that seemed to open up a new world of possibility. Unprecedented as they may have appeared to North American viewers, they also seemed to gesture backward, toward a rich and thorny history. To watch them was to be seized by a giddy intuition: this is where movies are going.

Ice cream trucks that play jingles, dogs that bark too long, even loudly humming air-conditioners are targets of his latest proposed overhaul of the city's noise code. The public has been, in general, loud in its approval. That's why it seems odd that the mayor's hit list on racket-makers excludes what may be the most teeth-grindingly annoying of all: car alarms. The Bloomberg administration has been reluctant to put stringent limits on the alarms because they are seen as a deterrent to car theft. The number of cars stolen or broken into has indeed come down greatly in the last decade. But that's probably a result of the same improved police work that brought down crime in all other categories.",2004-06-27T05:00:00+0000

World renowned futurist, consumer trend analyst, captivating keynote speaker and strategic advisor to the Fortune 50 on issues of marketing and positioning. Carol died, unexpectedly, of a massive stroke on June 19, 2004, in Delray Beach, Florida, while visiting from her home, Brenguelven, in Landudec, France. Born in Columbus, Ohio on August 14, 1944 to John Edwin Farmer and the late Ruth Cooper Farmer, she is survived by her father and stepmother, Jeannine of Columbus. She graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana and spent her early business career with the strategic consulting firms, Management Horizons and The Doody Company in Columbus, and then as Executive Vice President, Marketing, for Lerner Stores and the retail divisions of American Can, both in New York. Her prominence and recognition grew in the mid - eighties when she opened her own firm, Carol Farmer Associates, first in New York City, then in Boca Raton, Florida and, in 1994 in France. Carol was actively involved in numerous management and retail-related organizations and served as a director of two NYSE listed companies ---The Sports Authority and Lowe's Corporation. She was respected for her unique angle of vision, one that translated complex social, economic, political and cultural issues into business solutions. In the early nineties, Carol launched trendtrax as an interactive video newsletter for senior management. Her latest body of work converged in the concept she termed, ''Second Wind,'' insights and analysis of how baby boomers are continuing to re-define the aging process. Carol was a voracious reader, a lifelong learner and an early adopter of the creative use of computer technology. She was loved deeply by a worldwide circle of friends who have come together this past week to express their grief and console one another via e-mail and telephone. Carol will be remembered for her infectious curiosity; her generosity to friends; her beloved Bedlington terriers; and her latest passions ---Brittany and combining her life-long skill in painting with photography, video and digitized imagery. Her remains will be cremated and her ashes scattered over the waters at Pte. du Brezelec in Brittany. Celebrations of the life of Carol Farmer will be held in both Columbus and New York City and will be announced at a later date.

us,Mirage in The Desert,"It has been a charged and burdened time -- the D-Day commemorations, the death of a president, the daily carnage in Iraq, the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison, a July 4 just over the horizon -- the sublime and the squalid, the decent and the desperate in American life so overlaid upon one another that it is hard to reconcile the high rhetoric of one moment with the terrible reality of the other. As Americans remembered the boys of Pointe du Hoc and the president who immortalized them, they had to read reports of government lawyers telling their superiors that ''the infliction of pain or suffering per se, whether it is physical or mental, is insufficient to amount to torture.'' The discordance between the high sentiments heard at President Reagan's funeral and the lawyers' attempts to justify the unjustifiable left you unable to determine whether the rhetoric of the funeral was a moment of spiritual reaffirmation or just an exercise in organized amnesia. The memoranda from White House counsel, and from Department of Justice and Department of Defense lawyers, gave new meaning to Robert Lowell's phrase ''savage servility.'' Their argument that ''the president's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign'' rendered the United States' obligations under the Torture Convention ''inapplicable'' to interrogations conducted pursuant to his command left you wondering if they had ever heard of the Nuremberg tribunal. You might have thought that after Justice Robert Jackson's great opening speech at the war crimes trials of Nazi leaders in Nuremberg, no American lawyer would ever dare to use obedience to superior authority as justification for inhuman acts of abuse. In the memos that filled the pages of our newspapers, there was more than servility. There was also a terrible forgetting.",2004-06-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Software: Siebel Accused Again Of Selective Disclosure,"Siebel Systems Inc., the world's largest maker of customer-service software, was sued a second time by securities regulators who say two executives violated a rule barring selective disclosure of news to favored investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission says in its suit that Kenneth A. Goldman, Siebel's chief financial officer, and Mark D. Hanson, who heads investor relations, told institutional investors last year that the company was performing better than it had publicly stated. Siebel, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., as well as Mr. Goldman and Mr. Hanson, were named as defendants. It is the second time that Siebel has run afoul of the agency's Regulation Fair Disclosure, which forbids companies to release news selectively. In November 2002, Siebel paid a $250,000 penalty to the S.E.C. for violating the rule at an invitation-only conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs in 2001. The new case was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Siebel said in a statement that no violation of Regulation FD occurred, and that it was ''prepared to pursue resolution of this matter'' through litigation. The S.E.C. said in the complaint that on April 30, 2003, Goldman ''made positive comments about the company's business activity levels and transaction pipeline.'' It added, ''These statements materially contrasted with negative public statements made by the company.'' Siebel shares fell 42 cents, to $10.59.",2004-06-30T05:00:00+0000

The State Supreme Judicial Court ruled in November that same-sex couples had the right to marry under the State Constitution. The Legislature approved a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in March. It must pass again next year and could be on the ballot as early as November 2006. The suit, which was dismissed by a federal judge last month, contends that only the governor and Legislature have the ability to change marriage law. The appeals court ruled that the high court's ruling ''does not plausibly'' threaten a republican form of government. The Liberty Counsel, which filed the suit on behalf of the former president of the Massachusetts Catholic League and 11 legislators, said it would appeal to the United States Supreme Court.

AT&T was fined for charging a $7.72 monthly long-distance fee to clients who had not signed up, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said yesterday on his Web site. An AT&T spokesman, Bob Nersesian, called the problem a billing error and said the company would not switch people without authorization. The settlement caps a six-month investigation that began after hundreds of complaints from consumers, Mr. Spitzer said. The error affected 200,000 to 300,000 AT&T customers nationwide and 800,000 nonclients, the company said. The company is processing refunds, and consumers do not need to do anything, Mr. Nersesian said. He declined to say how much AT&T will refund. On Jan. 1, AT&T started a $3.95 monthly charge for its basic state-to-state long-distance plan, Mr. Nersesian said.
