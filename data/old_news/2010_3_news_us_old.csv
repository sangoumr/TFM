Ms. Murphy, who has won two Tony Awards for best actress in a musical  for Passion (1994) and the 1996 revival of The King and I  will play the role of Mayor Cora Hoover Hooper, which was originally played by Angela Lansbury in her Broadway musical debut. This early Sondheim work was regarded at the time as experimental and absurdist, and both audience and critical reaction tended to be negative. Yet the musical, a satire of small-town life and politics led by the corrupt mayor, also became a cult favorite among some Sondheim fans and others.

Bronson (Luke Welch) spends some time explaining to his love interest that his entire life, including his decision to strap on a gun, has been a response to the humiliations visited on him because of his diminutive stature. Synopses of the movie on the Internet either do not mention this prominent aspect of the plot or touch on it only in passing, perhaps because it seems so much at odds with the figure Bronson cut (often semi-naked) in a series of famous movies  The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape, Hard Times, Chatos Land, Mr. Majestyk and, of course, in what sometimes seemed to be a series of innumerable and increasingly violent Death Wish movies.Bronson is by no means the only action star whose larger than life screen persona was or is at odds with his real-life statistics. (Just what those statistics are is often debated on Web sites where there may be a three-inch variation in the height assigned to a particular actor.) The pattern was set in the 1930s and 40s by Edward G. Robinson (Little Caesar), James Cagney, George Raft, Humphrey Bogart and Paul Muni  all small men who usually played tough and cruel.

Jay Lenos return to The Tonight Show on Monday was watched by about 6.6 million viewers, according to overnight Nielsen ratings, up about 25 percent from his average viewership in the first quarter of last year. David Lettermans Late Show on CBS was watched by 3.8 million, about average for his program. The Tonight Show was the No. 1 late-night offering when Mr. Leno, right, handed it over to Conan OBrien last spring. In the months that followed, the Late Show routinely beat Mr. OBriens Tonight in total viewers. In January, after NBC canceled Mr. Lenos 10 p.m. talk show and announced a plan to move him back to 11:35 p.m., Mr. OBrien left the network. Mr. Lenos Tonight Show return was heavily promoted during the Winter Olympics on NBC last month, but once the initial interest fades the real competition will begin, as NBC and CBS find out whether The Tonight Show can return to the No. 1 spot among total viewers  as if a certain redheaded comedian had never been there.",2010-03-02T22:10:13+0000

The play, to be directed by Mr. Rapp for the Off Broadway theater, is about a New York writer who travels to a small American town to defend one of his young-adult novels that has been banned by the school board, a confrontation that turns into a heated debate about religious beliefs and censorship. Mr. Crudup won the Tony for best featured actor in a play in 2007 for his performance as the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky in the first two parts of The Coast of Utopia. He had been nominated twice before for best actor in a play, for The Pillowman in 2005 and the revival of The Elephant Man in 2002.",2010-03-02T22:10:51+0000
us,Venus In Fur Eyes Broadway,"The producer Robert Fox is exploring transferring the Classic Stage Companys production of Venus in Fur to a Broadway theater, Mr. Fox said on Tuesday. The new play, by David Ives, received wide critical acclaim when it opened in January, especially for one of its stars, the newcomer Nina Arianda, who plays a somewhat mysterious actress who becomes caught up in a sexual psychodrama during an audition for a director (played by Wes Bentley, of the film American Beauty). Mr. Fox, the lead producer of God of Carnage and a lead producer of the new Broadway production A Behanding in Spokane, said he had begun talking to New York theater owners about a transfer. Chief among the factors for such a move, he said, would be the availability of a very intimate house for the two-character work. He did not specify which theaters he preferred and cautioned that no deal was in place, and that the timing would largely depend on a theater becoming available. The Off Broadway run of Venus in Fur, directed by Walter Bobbie (Chicago), has been extended twice and is now scheduled to end on March 28.",2010-03-02T22:11:09+0000

Critics say the program gives local law enforcement officials a bigger role in immigration enforcement, which is conducted by the federal government. The program, which began in late 2008, is now used in 10 California counties, including Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego. This is a common-sense approach: Everyone who gets arrested gets checked for immigration status, said Matt McCaffrey, a sheriffs captain. In this case, theyre already in the system for entering into the country illegally or for having a record. Separately, a United States district court judge will hold a hearing on Wednesday in Oakland on a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, accusing the Sonoma County Sheriffs Office of routinely holding Latinos longer than the maximum 72 hours for immigration detention.

Paul Johnson of Johnson Trading, a design gallery on Greenwich Street, just opened a show called Home in the Chrystie Street loft he calls, well, his home. The subject of the show is the self-taught 60-something outsider artist Robert Loughlin. Loughlin spent most of his life being a picker (or chineur), one of those people scouring flea markets looking for rare resalable gems among the rummage  always in the hopes of selling Andy Warhol a cookie jar, as the writer Irwin Warren put it in his foreword for the shows program. Johnson started out as a picker himself, and about 10 years ago he began buying pieces from the back of Loughlins pickup truck at the old Chelsea flea market. His collection now comprises more than 500 pieces, from chairs, canvases, record covers, advertising posters and other bizarre objects  ivory teeth and baby seats  all scribbled on with Loughlins Tom of Finland-esque signature smoking head, obsessively filling every single one of the lofts 4,500 square feet. To this day, Loughlin still peddles his pieces (for $300 and up) at the Chelsea flea market, but it is unlikely anybody will ever be able to accumulate a collection of similar size or quality as Johnsons (not to mention as elegantly hung by the decorator to the stars Ricky Clifton).

us,Flying Elephant on Broadway?,"Disney Theatrical Productions and Stephen Daldry, the Tony Award-wining director of Billy Elliot: The Musical, are developing an adaptation for the stage of the 1941 classic animated movie Dumbo, a Disney executive said on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Daldry approached Disney Theatrical several months ago with a concept for a Dumbo musical, and they are now in the very initial stages of shaping those ideas, according to the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the company does not comment on projects at such an early stage. No creative team  composers, book writers, designers, and so on  has been assembled, the executive said, but doing so would probably be the next step. Dumbo, of course, already comes with several songs from the movie, including Baby Mine  which was nominated for the Academy Award for best song  as well as Casey Junior and When I See An Elephant Fly. The film won the Oscar for best original score. It is too early to say when the musical, if ultimately realized, would come to Broadway, or if it would start out in London as Billy Elliot did (Mr. Daldry is British) or in another major theatrical city other than New York, the executive said. Lets put it this way, Dumbo will not be on Broadway in the 2010-11 season, because its simply in the very early stages, the executive said. The New York Post on Wednesday reported Disneys interest in developing Dumbo for the stage, though The Post said that Mr. Daldry had passed on the project because he and Disney could not come to terms.

Activision said that Jason West, the Infinity Ward president, and Vince Zampella, the studios chief executive, had both departed. In a statement and in a regulatory filing reported by Reuters, Activision said it was investigating breaches of contract and insubordination by two senior employees at Infinity Ward, but did not name the employees. The game publisher also said it was starting its own business unit to produce future Call of Duty titles, and that the decision was unrelated to the exits of Mr. West and Mr. Zampella. Infinity Ward, which released the original Call of Duty game in 2003, was acquired by Activision that same year. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which was released in November, became one of the best-selling games of all time, grossing an estimated $310 million in sales in its first day of release and selling more than 12 million copies over all.

us,Collecting Like Koons,"Not all of us can amass an art collection like Jeff Koons. The pop artist has works by Manet, Picasso and Poussin piled up, salon-style, on the walls of his Upper East Side home, not to mention an 1873 Courbet over his flat-screen television. But for those aspiring collectors working on a slightly smaller scale, the Guggenheim is the place to be tonight. The museum is auctioning off 200 works by artists, architects and designers from the exhibition ""Contemplating the Void: Interventions in the Guggenheim Museum."" The auction, a finale to the museum's 50th anniversary celebrations, will benefit the museum's exhibition programming. First preview the work and then take in a performance by Animal Collective, the artist Danny Perez and Transverse Temporal Gyrus, featuring original recorded music created specifically for this event. The late show at 9 p.m. is sold out but there are still tickets available for the early show at 4:30 p.m. The auction items will be sold online from March 4 through 18 at charitybuzz.com/guggenheim.",2010-03-04T02:49:25+0000
us,Gimme an H,"""It's easy to feel alive with possibility, or delusional, at the new Herms store for men, which welcomes wealth in all its glory and repugnance,"" writes Jon Caramanica. This store, which opened last month across Madison Avenue from the flagship, ""is a thoughtful balance of expert craftsmanship and luxury kitsch, a four-floor clubhouse that somehow manages the feel of a high-end department store."" Mr. Caramanica suggests picking a desired persona, say a disheveled and raffish Julian Schnabel or Robert Redford in ""Out of Africa,"" and making the fantasy a reality with a few choice pieces, like a rough linen-cotton blend blazer with soft suede beneath the collar. ""Soon I was writing scenes of my new life in my head, most ending with a quick nuzzle from Olatz as I come in the door at Palazzo Chupi, before we sneak upstairs for an assignation on her signature crest-appliqud Egyptian cotton sheets."" The store is filled with other aspirational items. ""Most dazzling is one of the store's showpieces, a chocolate leather baseball jacket perforated in an H pattern, wearable by rappers and Mediterranean tourists, but probably not you.""",2010-03-04T02:49:25+0000

Another is consolidating a maze of local, state and federal policies that treat the animals in different ways. Many Western states, for instance, classify bison as livestock and not wildlife, the report authors say, hampering how they can be managed in the wild. Heres the full report on restoring bison.

As a candidate, Barack Obama made a point of vowing to banish them from the White House. (This proved considerably harder to do than it was to say, mostly because it turns out that lobbyists in Washington are like Baathists in Baghdad; if you send them all home, there arent enough people left who know anything about running a government.) In the past year, though, antilobbyist fervor has grown even more intense, as hope for a new governing era has given way to frustration with a divided capital and a dysfunctional Congress.

But over all the show will remain intact, and the shows American design and construction team has built the sets for the Seoul production.

Becks London Underground map (1931-33) or Herbert Bayers World Geo-Graphic Atlas (1953), an exemplary marriage of information, art and design. But many maps are made only as art for arts sake.

Mr. Zugazagoitia (pronounced zoo-gah-zah-GOY-tee-a) will replace Marc F. Wilson, one of the nations longest-serving museum directors, who last year announced his decision to retire after 28 years and after shepherding a $385 million capital campaign to strengthen the museums endowment and transform its Beaux-Arts complex with a glass-block addition by the architect Steven Holl. Mr. Zugazagoitia, 46, has run El Museo for almost eight years, a period of sweeping change for a small institution founded in 1969 as a haven for Puerto Rican culture. It has expanded its mission to focus more generally on Latino and Latin American art and under Mr. Zugazagoitias leadership it has substantially increased its budget, endowment, donations and audience. The museum reopened last fall after its own makeover, a $35 million renovation that added a new facade and courtyard and modernized its galleries. Sarah F. Rowland, chairwoman of the Nelson-Atkins board, said that the museums search committee had chosen Mr. Zugazagoitia from a field of about a dozen finalists because his training and temperament are exactly what we had been looking for  his commitment to the arts is so broad.

The appeals court upheld the trial court in rejecting Mr. Cusslers claim that he was owed $8.6 million by Crusader. The ruling, which came on Wednesday from a three-judge panel, sent the dispute back to the lower court to determine who, if anyone, had actually prevailed in the case. That determination would affect the assignment of responsibility for legal costs. Mr. Cussler filed suit against Crusader in 2004, asserting that it had violated its contract with him in making a film based on his novel Sahara and its fictional hero Dirk Pitt.

The South African artist directed the company's production of Shostakovich's early opera ""The Nose,"" which opened on Friday, and his sets and videos that animate the staging ""received the heartiest bravos."" The choice of Mr. Kentridge is another example of how Peter Gelb, the company's general manager, has made it a priority to recruit directors from theater and film. ""With Mr. Kentridge, whose work can now be seen in an extensive exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Gelb has brought in a major visual artist. Stop-action animation and theatrical design are central to Mr. Kentridge's work, and he has unleashed his imagination on Shostakovich's bitterly satirical and breathless opera."" The music is intriguing, too: ""you are not likely to hear a more insightful, ornery and, when appropriate, achingly poignant account of Shostakovich's still-shocking score than the performance the conductor Valery Gergiev drew from the Met orchestra and chorus and the large cast: some 30 artists, singing about 80 solo roles.""

The Royale, which until recently was called the Roxy, is a 1,000-capacity space on Tremont Street with an open floor and a U-shaped balcony. Known to Boston clubgoers as a late-night dance haunt, the Royale will be outfitted for live music and have about 100 concerts a year, said Jim Glancy, a partner in the Bowery Presents. The Royale will be the companys first space outside the New York region. (It also helps run the Wellmont Theater in Montclair, N.J.) The Bowery will open a small office in Boston to run the Royale shows and book events for larger spaces. Its a fantastic market, Mr. Glancy said. The type of music we book totally lends itself to Boston. That music is mainly rock, but as at Webster Hall in New York the Royale will continue to put on its own dance events independent of the rock shows.

I knew Mindy would be able to come up with something a) the theater would be able to afford, b) that would look realistic and c) that I would be able to put on myself, Linney said.

Instead, EMI found out the hard way when Pink Floyd filed suit against the label in a dispute over how its online royalty payments and marketing costs for its music are calculated, Reuters reported. In a hearing at High Court in London on Tuesday, Robert Howe, a lawyer for Pink Floyd, said that a clause in the bands contract expressly prohibited the unbundling of its songs in any configuration other than how they were originally produced and released. Mr. Howe said that EMI believed this applies only to the physical product and doesnt apply online, adding that the argument makes no commercial sense. Pink Floyd first signed with EMI in the late 1960s, going on to record hit prog-rock albums like The Dark Side of the Moon and motivating the sale of millions of black light lamps and posters. The band more recently renegotiated its contract in the late 1990s, when online retailers like iTunes were still in their infancy.

Now she has turned her manual skills to making a dizzying array of dumplings. Unusual pastime, you say? Not for this Israel-born, Vienna-raised, New York-based artist who, after a well-received solo exhibition last year, decided to do something about her longing for food from Austria. A schnitzels throw from Schillers, her new cafe on Rivington Street is the perfect respite from early spring crowds.Since the heart of Kinskis Czech-Austrian menu is the humble dumpling, or kndel, served up savory or sweet, its a pleasant surprise to see that its not about the same protagonist gussied up in various disguises. The sweet-cheese kndel, for instance, is made of soft farmers cheese (not unlike ricotta) that has been steamed and rolled in spiced bread crumbs. The apricot and the nougat kndel, although similar on the outside, reveal their respective sweet centers with a gentle slice of a fork. Toward the savory end of the spectrum, the finger-thick strands of the schupfnudeln are in essence billowy, pan-fried gnocchi with rosemary and a touch of lemon.",2010-03-10T22:02:39+0000

Some new material, known as intake forms, collected by the centers sexual assault response team were discovered this week. The discovery comes after last years revelation that the center had 3,000 videotapes of medical exams of children who were alleged victims of assault. The videotapes have already led to the release of a man convicted earlier and have put other convictions at risk. An appellate court ruled two years ago that hospital examiners were part of the prosecution team and that the district attorneys office was responsible for making sure evidence was turned over to defendants. Im sure they were dismayed at the discovery, and Im glad to see they are jumping on it, said the public defender, Mary Greenwood.

For the next 100 years, most published dictionaries were concerned with helping the verbally unsophisticated (or at least the insecure) feel more comfortable with their verbal repertories. These early dictionaries were filled only with hard words and did not bother with defining cow or apple, reasoning that everyone knew what words like that meant. Instead they sought to explain to the uninitiated the meaning of terms like desticate (to cry like a rat) and antipelargy (the reciprocal love children have for their parents).",2010-03-11T21:53:18+0000

It was there, circa 1975, that the promoter Malcolm McLaren and the fashion visionary Vivienne Westwood transformed four juvenile delinquents who had been caught on numerous occasions pilfering overpriced T-shirts into the Sex Pistols.Thirty-five years on, the D.I.Y. iconography of underground music endures, so much so that the 200 vintage tees in Ripped  from acts like Gary Numan, Dead Kennedys, Talking Heads and Plasmatics  look oddly familiar, no doubt thanks to what the book calls the onset of ironic consumerism.",2010-03-12T16:20:57+0000

This novel, his fourth, gathers life greedily, hungrily, but with a certain stealth: Lee doesnt bolt it all down at once, as the refugee children in his story do. The Surrendered, his largest, most ambitious book, is about the horrors of war and the sorrows of survival, yet its manner is quiet, watchful, expectant, as if everyone, including Lee himself, were waiting to see what might accrue.",2010-03-12T16:51:27+0000

To fill the void above, Lee creates miniature upside-down interiors that he calls parallel worlds, placing them on domestic ceilings (on commission) and corporate offices (on the sly). Decorating ceilings was a common art form that somehow got lost through the reductionism of modernism, he says. The Lilliputian lairs are meticulously furnished with objects that tell a story about the room and its imaginary owner. One installation shows the apartment of a rocker, complete with a guitar, amp, microphone and Jimi Hendrix poster. Another, installed in a home with two small children, features a petit bourgeois living room with velvet sofas and tiny glass cabinets filled with strange furry objects made of cat hair.

Now consider that all these elements might somehow be connected, might represent different aspects of some giant whatsit that will eventually constitute the cultural face of our time in the eyes of the future. That is what David Shields proposes in Reality Hunger: A Manifesto. He further argues that what all those things have in common is that they express or fulfill a need for reality, a need that is not being met by the old and crumbling models of literature.

Nowhere, perhaps, is this contradiction more apparent than in the history of the Crusades. When the victorious knights of the First Crusade finally stood in Jerusalem, on July 15, 1099, they were, in the words of the chronicler William of Tyre, dripping with blood from head to foot. They had massacred the populace. But in the same breath, William praised the pious devotion . . . with which the pilgrims drew near to the holy places, the exultation of heart and happiness of spirit with which they kissed the memorials of the Lords sojourn on earth.

The ambitious event, which installed the work of more than 80 artists at sites throughout New Orleans, ended up badly over budget after the bills came due in 2008, owing more than $1 million more than it had raised. Late last month, its founding director, Dan Cameron, announced that the next iteration of the event, Prospect.2, would be postponed until the fall of 2011 from this November because of fund-raising shortfalls. The Times-Picayune reported that several directors who joined the biennials board in 2009 to help shore up the finances and raise money for Prospect.2, stepped down in February because of differences with Mr. Cameron over how the project should be managed. Two people with knowledge of the board resignations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, confirmed the basic account of the problems to The New York Times. The Times-Picayune reported that the biennials executive director, Barbara Motley, a theater owner who was hired last year to oversee the administrative side of the event so that Mr. Cameron could focus on selecting artists and helping them to realize their works, had also resigned. Ms. Motley told the newspaper that she believed in organizational charts and management protocols while Mr. Cameron was much more organic in his approach to management.Earlier this month the Contemporary Arts Center in New Orleans announced that it would not renew Mr. Camerons contract as its part-time visual arts director. The centers director said it needed someone to work full-time to oversee its art exhibitions.

An executive involved in the production, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss tour plans, said the producers had been mulling a national tour for months and lined up some great actors for the possible production. (The executive declined to name them.) While some theaters nationally were considering a Carnage tour for a spot in their 2010-11 subscription seasons, the producers decided that not enough theaters in major cities would be available for a tour that would need to last at least 26 weeks to make the show profitable. Instead, once Carnage closes on Broadway  it opened on March 22, 2009, and is running indefinitely  the play will probably be licensed to regional theaters that can then mount their own productions.",2010-03-12T23:23:05+0000

The government collapsed in February when the Labor Party quit the governing coalition over the continued Dutch military presence in Afghanistan.

A long cabinet debate prompted the left-of-center Labor Party to walk out, necessitating new elections. Under Mr. Cohen, the Labor Party hopes to regain ground and win enough votes to form the next government. ",2010-03-13T01:43:24+0000

Somehow those influences come out in his designs as unisex garments made from soft jersey fabric that practically snuggle with the body. My work is utilitarian, he says. Anyone can put it on, female or male, and everything is adjustable so you can tie it in a different way for a different body type. Clemenss signature line, as well as his diffusion range, Un.Der T, are available in downtown boutiques and will soon be sold on telfar.net.

us,When Hollywood Gets It Right,"Since my column today uses the release of Paul Greengrasss Green Zone as an occasion to complain about how Hollywood cant seem to capture the complexities and ironies of real-world politics, it seems worthwhile to mention a few recent exceptions to this rule. This will be a short list: Stephen Frears The Queen is on it, so is Alexander Paynes Election (yes, it takes place in a high school whats your point?), and so is the portrait of Baltimores mayoral politics on David Simons The Wire. (The character of Clarence Royce, the compromised incumbent, is a particularly good example of how a storyteller can be fair to a fundamentally unsympathetic figure.) David O. Russells great Three Kings doesnt feature any politicians, but it captures the tragic ironies of our involvement in Iraq with more clarity and sensitivity than any of the movies made about the second Gulf War. Neither Oliver Stones Nixon nor Mike Nichols Primary Colors are particularly successful movies, but both make a good-faith effort to portray polarizing figures from our recent past in shades of gray, rather than just black and white. (About the rest of Stones forays into political subjects, the less said the better.) And one of the reasons so many people praised  and overpraised  the political themes in The Dark Knight, I suspect, is that even an attempt at political ambiguity (and in a superhero movie, no less) seemed impressive, given how rarely Hollywood goes in for anything save caricature.",2010-03-15T17:09:09+0000

The university said on Monday that a new edition of the play, Double Falsehood, or the Distressed Lovers by Lewis Theobald, an 18th-century scholar and Shakespeare editor, would be published on March 22 as part of Ardens Third Series of Shakespeares works. Theobald had said the play was based on three lost Shakespeare texts, a contentious claim that may now be backed up by the work of Brean Hammond, a professor of modern English literature at Nottingham. In his book, also called Double Falsehood, Mr. Hammond says he has found evidence linking that play to Cardenio, a lost collaboration between Shakespeare and John Fletcher that was performed in 1613. Richard Proudfoot, general editor of the Arden Shakespeare, said in a statement that the inclusion of Double Falsehood is our most controversial decision. He added, That it represents in some form the otherwise lost play of Cardenio, by Fletcher and Shakespeare, is a sufficiently sustainable position to recommend publication in Arden 3 of Lewis Theobalds avowedly thorough 18th-century adaptation, thus making it accessible for the first time in 250 years.",2010-03-15T21:17:06+0000

The coin, above, which was struck soon after Caesars murder in 44 B.C., depicts on one side the head of Brutus, and on the other, two daggers and the hat of a freeman, a symbol of the conspirators belief in the Roman republic instead of the tyranny that Caesar represented to them.

Virtue becomes vice: attempts to save more actually make us poorer, in both the short and the long run. Prudence becomes folly: a stern determination to balance budgets and avoid any risk of inflation is the road to disaster.

Many of these structures (like a tree-house that soars 140 feet above the West Papuan rain forest) lie at the frontiers of the imagination, while others (like a shanty in Manila held together with urban waste) wed prefer to forget. The forthcoming book Buildings Without Architects (Rizzoli; $23) presents them all as works of grassroots ingenuity. Written by John May, who authored the official history of Greenpeace, the book pegs modish keywords like energy-efficient and sustainable to ancient buildings, most of which were made of stuff thats been around since prehistoric times: wood, reed, earth and clay.

us,The HBO Auteur,"It was a bright, warm, blue-skied December afternoon in Central City, New Orleans, and in this neighborhood of humble shotgun houses and overgrown empty lots, a convoy of white trucks and trailers idled incongruously while unmarked police cars blocked intersections nearby. On any other morning, a police presence would have meant more bad news: in a city that has one of the highest homicide rates in the United States, this neighborhood  roughly a mile from the French Quarter  has a murder rate that, in recent years, has hit quadruple that of the city as a whole. This morning, however, the 20 drivers, as well as 80 other crew members who hefted and humped a boggling array of gear at the tumbledown corner of Second Street and South Liberty, had anything but murder in mind: they were six hours into a day of filming the third episode of Treme, David Simons new HBO drama  co-created by the seasoned television writer and producer Eric Overmyer  which is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and will make its debut on April 11. The production was only two scenes into the six on the call sheet; at that pace, they were looking at a 15-hour marathon  yet another in the 11-day ultramarathon that shooting an hour of episodic television on location can demand. As the novelist George Pelecanos, a staff writer on Treme, told me of the years he spent on set as a writer-producer on The Wire, Simons breakthrough series: If you got out with a 12-hour day, that was the luckiest day of the series. Try doing that for seven months straight. Only young people can do it. You dont see many people in their 50s carrying around lights.",2010-03-17T14:11:20+0000

I think its a good thing that the countermajoritarian customs of the Senate, as adapted by the minority for a more ideological age, have made it very difficult to pass a sweeping overhaul of Americas de facto constitution. But I also think its appropriate that there exists, for an extremely determined but not-quite-super majority, mechanisms that allow legislators to overcome these hurdles and push a controversial piece of legislation through. Hard but not absolutely impossible seems like the right bar to set for a bill of this nature. I wish the Democrats had chosen a different path, but in the end, we live in a republic, not a direct democracy: If our elected representatives can really muster enough votes, within the rules, to pass health care legislation even after everything thats happened if they believe that strongly, in other words, that this is absolutely and without question the right policy for America then they have every right to go for it.

Christies was to have sold the painting in New York in November 2006 to benefit the foundation, but it was forced to withdraw it 24 hours before the auction after the collector Julius H. Schoeps filed a lawsuit saying that it had been forcibly sold by his great-uncle, Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, a Jewish banker in Berlin.

Ive been working on something grander-sounding and mid-Atlantic ever since.Accents can cause unusual problems for actors. First-class training doesnt necessarily instill the ability to master different voices; its a particular aptitude that comes more naturally to some than others. I adored Patti LuPones darkly funny performance as Mrs. Lovett in the recent Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd, but I have never before heard an Englishwoman of any class or period  fictional or otherwise  speaking with quite the same quirky intonations.

Mariana, as Hugo will discover, is a prostitute, while the house  known simply as the Residence  is a brothel catering to the Nazi occupiers.

We envy his powers of description, the way he transforms technically complex subjects into something readers can hold in their hand and examine at close range. And, perhaps above all else, we marvel at the pains he takes with structure, approaching his subject from oblique angles, slowly building tension, sometimes seeming to wander, but always propelling his narratives forward.",2010-03-18T16:57:02+0000

us,"Trust, Underwater","In 2004, newly married and having decided to embark on the next phase of adulthood, my wife and I bought a house. This was back in the delirious days of multiple offers and outlandish escalation clauses, when you had to bring your checkbook with you to an open house, just in case someone else tried to buy the place while you were poking around the attic. I called a mortgage broker somewhere in Florida, and she was thrilled to hear from me, practically breathless. I felt as if I were the 10,000th customer to come through line at the Safeway, my arrival heralded by streamers and sirens and all kinds of free stuff falling from the rafters. Did we want a five-year adjustable-rate loan or maybe even rates adjusted on a monthly basis? Why not just pay just the interest rather than the principal? Did we also need a bridge loan for a few months, to hold us over from one house to the next? How about a second trust''  that is, two mortgages instead of one  so we could put less money down, maybe even as little as 5 percent of the purchase price while avoiding the penalty of private mortgage insurance? We might as well open a home equity line of credit on top of the mortgage, she said, so we could borrow another six-figure sum with the tear of a perforated check. Countrywide, the nation's largest lender, would happily give us that free, and, hey, you never knew when you might decide to add a skylight over the kitchen, or maybe a stone turret.",2010-03-18T18:21:03+0000

And so begins What We Are, Peter Nathaniel Malaes first novel, with twofold irony: First, Pauls father is a Samoan immigrant, which, in this story, inoculates his son against cultural prejudice. Second, in 2006 immigration reform was largely about paths to United States citizenship for illegals, the assumption being that they wanted to stay. Not so much Paul. He is a first-generation American who lives in a country he cannot stand, and spends much of his time railing against everyone in it, himself included. One of this novels organizing tensions is how to reconcile misanthropy with a sense that taking a stand  for people, for values  can suffuse your life with meaning. For Paul, whose heritage is mixed, there is the added problem of how to straddle cultures while still forging an identity of his own. From Page 1, his biggest gripe is that he has no story, no position and, more worrisome, no heart. ",2010-03-18T19:10:09+0000

The Adventures of Ook and Gluk, Kung-Fu Cavemen From the Future, by Dav Pilkey, is the first in a four-book deal. In the graphic novel, written by the fictional characters George Beard and Harold Hutchins, Ook and Gluk are caveboys in Ohio in 500,001 B.C. who battle an evil corporation from the future and wind up in A.D. 2222.

While Captain Underpants will not appear in the first book, he will be in two of the four, Scholastic said. Tracy van Straaten, vice president for publicity at Scholastic, said the first book would have a printing of one million copies, joining 45 million copies in print of Mr. Pilkeys eight Captain Underpants books, featuring a superhero in briefs and a red cape.

Winnowed to pure, hardy quartz, the sediment moved with the gulfs currents and gathered into the necklace of narrow barrier islands that buffer Floridas Panhandle. Time and tides refined the sand into a soft, sun-bleached powder. By the 1830s, when a Yankee sea captain named Leonard Destin sailed down to the wilderness of the Florida Territory, he discovered beaches as dazzling and white as a fresh blanket of snow. The sight evidently impressed the captain, for his reaction  like that of so many migrants who followed  was to claim a piece of the shore. Destin landed, built a New England Colonial-style house and started a fishing business, becoming the first recorded white settler in the beach town that now bears his name.",2010-03-19T14:32:58+0000

Mr. Fusari, who has also worked on hit songs like Will Smiths Wild, Wild West and Destinys Childs Bootylicious, said in his suit that he was first introduced to the singer Stefani Germanotta in 2006, helping to guide her from a rock musician to a dance artist and nicknaming her Lady Gaga, from the Queen song Radio Ga Ga. He said he had received more than $600,000 from Lady Gaga but had not received his full share of song royalties, merchandising revenue and other fees.

She is stepping in for Anna Netrebko, who is ill, the Met said. Ms. Gheorghiu, the Romanian soprano, withdrew from the Mets Richard Eyre-directed production of Carmen amid marital problems with her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, who starred in that opera; she said last month in a statement that she wanted to be as prepared dramatically as I am musically for the production. But there is evidently no bad blood between her and the Met; Ms. Gheorghiu is currently rehearsing for its coming production of La Traviata, which opens on March 29, and will sing the role of Juliette in Gounods Romo et Juliette for the Mets 2010-11 season.",2010-03-19T15:21:42+0000

From washed-out landscapes to minimally lighted rooms, the Nordic locations in Dragon feel more lived in and rough edged  more realistic  than one typically finds in animation. This comes from the influence of an outsider, the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins. Best known for his work on A Beautiful Mind, The Shawshank Redemption and Coen brothers films, Mr. Deakins had little experience working in animation, save for some consulting on Wall-E. But as the co-directors of Dragon, Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders (Lilo & Stitch), were thinking of a way to distinguish their film from other animated work, they decided to bring in someone who could see light in a different way. Below Mr. Deakins, Mr. DeBlois and Mr. Sanders discuss how they achieved the films look. ",2010-03-19T21:19:58+0000

Still, for almost 40 straight years, the airlines female flight attendants (something called stewardesses) turned heads. In the 1940s, they did it with military-style overseas caps and spectator shoes; in the 50s, with futurist insignias and stiletto pumps; and in the 60s, with A-line topcoats, alligator-print boots, Chanel-inspired jackets with three-quarter-length sleeves and the Delberet, a pillbox hat designed for Delta by Mea Hanauer, a New York milliner. The 70s were all about coo-coo colors, bell-bottom pants, Slavic tunics and, weirdly, a yellow raincoat. And then in the 80s, Delta took a sartorial nosedive that it couldnt recover from until 2001.

Mr. Fusari said in his suit that he was first introduced to the singer Stefani Germanotta in 2006, helping to guide her from a rock musician to a dance artist and nicknaming her Lady Gaga. He said he had received more than $600,000 from Lady Gaga but had not received his full share of royalties and other fees.

In recent years Italy has signed similar accords with other American institutions, and archaeologists at Fridays presentation praised such restitutions as indicative of a cultural sea change that recognizes that archaeology is context, according to Malcolm Bell III, a professor at the University of Virginia who helped establish the provenance of the objects, which led to their return. In 1981 and 1982 the Met bought the silver hoard from the American dealer Robert Hecht for $2.74 million.

She is stepping in for Anna Netrebko, who is ill, the Met said. Ms. Gheorghiu, the Romanian soprano, withdrew from the Mets Richard Eyre-directed production of Carmen amid marital problems with her husband, the tenor Roberto Alagna, who starred in that opera; she said last month in a statement that she wanted to be as prepared dramatically as I am musically for the production. But there is evidently no bad blood between her and the Met; Ms. Gheorghiu is currently rehearsing for its coming production of La Traviata, which opens on March 29, and will sing the role of Juliette in Gounods Romo et Juliette for the Mets 2010-11 season.",2010-03-19T23:29:09+0000

(In addition to a recall in Japan earlier this year of Prius cars, Toyota has also recalled the Sai hybrid sedan, sold only in Japan; the Lexus HS250h hybrid, sold in Japan and elsewhere; and the plug-in Prius hybrid for similar braking problems. Those recalls affected some 475,000 cars; the recalls outside of Japan affected about eight million cars.)",2010-03-20T01:55:59+0000

us,Classical Music Station to Rely on Listeners,"KING-FM, a longtime classical music station in Seattle, announced on Tuesday that it would switch to a listener-supported public model in the summer of 2011. The board that oversees the station, which operates as part of a nonprofit organization, had been studying possible changes for a couple of years. The move continues a decade-long trend among classical stations. Last year, WQXR in New York and WCRB in Boston were sold to public radio operators. (WQXR was sold by The New York Times Company.) Besides KING-FM, there are only 18 commercial classical radio stations in the United States. Marc Hand, an industry consultant at Public Radio Capital, said classical stations tended to have older listeners than other formats; those listeners, he said, were less appealing to advertisers but more apt to be the kind of dedicated, passionate supporters who give money to public radio. I think this move really makes for a station thats more economically viable, he said.",2010-03-23T20:48:38+0000
us,The Supersizing of the Last Supper,"How far back should a study go to show that food portions have increased over time? Ten years? Fifty years? What about all the way back to the Last Supper? A new article in The International Journal of Obesity doesnt turn the clock back quite that far but looks at nearly a thousand years worth of paintings depicting the meal and concludes that the sizes of portions, plates and bread increased dramatically over those years. The study, conducted by two brothers  Brian Wansink, a professor of consumer behavior at Cornell and director of the schools Food and Brand Lab; and Craig Wansink, a professor of religious studies at Virginia Wesleyan College  looks at 52 Last Supper paintings made between about 1000 and 1800, including famous depictions by Leonardo (detail, above), Titian and El Greco. After the size of the food in the artworks was indexed against the average size of the disciples heads (which can vary from painting to painting), the study found that the main courses grew by 69 percent, the plates by 66 percent and the bread by 23 percent. The authors are careful to qualify what these findings mean. We can say that plates and the amounts grow in the paintings, Craig Wansink said on Tuesday in a telephone interview. Does that mean in terms of the actual culture and time that food itself increased? I dont think we have the social and historical data to back that up. But we do have the data to show that food took on increasing prominence.",2010-03-23T20:48:55+0000

Part of the plan includes changing how the state handles parolees, many of whom, at the moment, return to prison on technical violations, according to criminal system experts. California is the only state that places all prisoners on parole at release, but now hundreds of low-level offenders will be released without close supervision from their parole officers. The effort represents a seismic shift, said Joan Petersilia, a criminologist at Stanford Law School and a longtime scholar of the states prisons. The prison system costs the state $8 billion annually, about 11 percent of the state budget. [The New York Times]",2010-03-24T11:34:17+0000

On Tuesday Ms. Winfrey settled a defamation lawsuit filed by the former headmistress of a school she set up in South Africa, who had said that the talk show host had defamed her after a sex-abuse scandal there, Reuters reported. Nomvuho Mzamane ran the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa at its founding in 2007 but left after students there said they were being abused by another staff member. After Ms. Winfrey held a news conference and said that Ms. Mzamane had ignored the students complaints, Ms. Mzamane said Ms. Winfrey had defamed her and made it difficult for her to find another job. A statement from lawyers representing both women said thedispute had been settled peacefully to their mutual satisfaction and both women had withdrawn their complaints, according to Reuters. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A trial was scheduled to begin on Monday in federal court in Philadelphia, where Ms. Mzamane was living when she filed the suit.",2010-03-24T15:21:37+0000

(I also was excited to see the piece on Brunello Cucinelli; interesting business, with annual sales of more than $200 million, reports RebeccaMead, and I know a lot of women who like the clothes, expensive though they are. But I was bored reading about him.) One thing in the Polyvore piece that amused me was the description of the companys office, the atmosphere of tact and friendliness  unlike magazine offices which, as Ms. Jacobs noted, are widely perceived to be snake pits. But looking at clothes and brands and trends on a computer screen is a different experience, isnt it? Magazines are diva pits, flesh-and-blood places, and they are probably less so today than 10 or 20 years ago, and of course that outsized feeling and passion for clothes is what helps stir the imagination of designers and editors alike. I guess things are thinning out now, and not just magazine pages.

The Birmingham and Stoke-on-Trent museums will pay that money to Mr. Herbert and Fred Johnson, the farmer in whose field the hoard was found, having raised donations from around the world in a campaign that began in January.

The masques are an alternative universe: often, the play unfolds in the real world and the masques in the realm of the supernatural.

The British ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, told reporters that the new electoral laws in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, fall well short of what the international community expected in a free and fair process. Britain, which called the session, accused the military junta running the country of writing the laws specifically to make it difficult for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and a Nobel laureate, to participate. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, above, said this week that she opposed registering her party for the elections. Her comments came hours after Myanmars highest court refused to accept a lawsuit filed by the party that sought to revoke five new election laws. ",2010-03-25T03:50:31+0000

Both the waitress and Jan had disappeared, and Beard was the only person in the lobby. This was a long-forgotten experience from his school days, not only being late but feeling ignorant and incompetent and wretched, with everyone else mysteriously in the know, as though in league against him. Fatso Beard, always last, useless at team games. With that memory came added clumsiness and indecision. Although he was dressed in ski clothes of many layers, he was expected to climb inside this extra skin, even to wear his own boots inside another pair.

Salinger a little pomp and circumstance is understandable. On Sunday, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston will put on display a note from Salinger to Hemingway, written in 1946, that recounts a meeting between the authors and possibly hints at the coming publication of The Catcher in the Rye, The Associated Press reported. In the letter, a young Salinger writes to Dear Poppa that he is in a hospital in Nuremberg, Germany, and says the talks I had with you here were the only hopeful minutes of the whole business. There are flashes of Salingers wit throughout: he asks Hemingway how his latest novel is coming along and warns him not to option it to Hollywood. (Youre a rich guy, he writes. As Chairman of your many fan clubs, I know I speak for all the members when I say Down with Gary Cooper.) Salinger also writes that he has a very sensitive novel in mind, and I wont have the author called a jerk in 1950. (I am a jerk, he continues, but the wrong people musnt know it.)

Now, as he prepares for a May exhibition at Deitch Projects in New York, Mr. Fairey is planning to put up street art the polite way, by asking building owners. This is your chance to experience the art and be a part of the OBEY phenomenon, in addition to contributing to the enhancement of the urban landscape, said an announcement this week on Mr. Faireys Web site (obeygiant.com), referring to the name of his studio and his trademark posters. His crew is looking for sites in Manhattan and Brooklyn where owners would allow artwork to be pasted  work that, depending on the kind of material to which it is glued, could last for years. In the past, Mr. Fairey has received permission to paste in some locations in Boston, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. He might be leaving behind his illicit means for good, or he might just be keeping a low profile until his other legal trouble blows over: a civil lawsuit and a criminal investigation stemming from his use of an Associated Press photograph without permission to make his well-known Barack Obama Hope poster.",2010-03-26T21:47:25+0000

In a listing for Ticked-Off Trannies, a comedy by Israel Luna, the film is described as a campy homage to the exploitation films in which a group of transgender women are violently beaten and left for dead, but then the violated vixens turn deadly divas. That summary alone was enough to prompt many angry comments at the festivals Web site, tribecafilm.com. In a statement, GLAAD said, The film, its title and its marketing misrepresent the lives of transgender women and use grotesque, exploitative depictions of violence against transgender women. It urged its members to contact the festival and demand that the film be pulled. The festival responded in a statement: The filmmakers provided a copy of this film to GLAAD in February, and for weeks the organization had been supportive to the filmmakers. In fact, GLAAD representatives advised the films producer, director and cast on how to describe the film to its core constituency. The festival added that it looks forward to the films premiere next month.",2010-03-26T21:47:51+0000

Although Tarletons president, F. Dominic Dottavio, first defended the students right to perform a play he considered offensive, crude and irreverent, university officials changed course late Friday night, canceling the performance after receiving threatening calls and e-mail messages, according to The Star-Telegram.

Some Wall Street analysts expected opening-weekend sales of up to $60 million for this 3-D picture from DreamWorks Animation, on a par with the studios last release, Monsters vs. Aliens. A variety of factors may have dented How to Train Your Dragon, from a sudden glut of 3-D pictures to the decision last week by many theater chains to raise ticket prices. Animated titles also do better when they feature broad comedy, something this movie lacked. Still, positive reviews will likely help How to Train Your Dragon in the weeks ahead, when many children are out of school for spring break. Alice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Studios) was second with about $17.3 million for a new total of $293 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. The MGM comedy Hot Tub Time Machine was third with about $13.7 million, a so-so result considering the hefty promotional muscle the beleaguered studio put behind it. Sonys Bounty Hunter was fourth with about $12.4 million ($38.8 million total), and Diary of a Wimpy Kid (20th Century Fox) was fifth with about $10 million ($35.8 million total).",2010-03-28T22:20:47+0000

MCD said 55,000 tickets had been sold, it had paid $950,000 to book the stadium and it had already paid Prince $1.5 million.

He was a mischief-maker, an innocent, born in the jungle and lured into the strange world of humans,"" writes Edward Rothstein. ""But as the exhibition points out, at least outside of the books' frames, Curious George really did save the day, and more than once. In early September 1939, just after World War II began, the Reys  a husband-and-wife team of German Jews living in Paris  sought refuge at Chteau Feuga, an old castle owned by some friends in southern France. At such a time, Hans A. Rey wrote in a letter, 'it feels ridiculous to be thinking about children's books.' But that is what they were doing, prolifically, including a book about a monkey named Fifi, who later became known as Curious George.""

Instead, patients are entitled to a reasonable amount of the drug for their ailments, the court said in its January ruling. The ruling has resulted in a number of marijuana cases being dismissed; other trials ended in acquittals. Law enforcement agencies around the state are struggling with the aftermath of the ruling. Gray is not a good color for the law, said Gerald Benito, the Shasta County district attorney, who dismissed a case this month.

Cody, a Los Angeles resident (who in an earlier life was Brook Busey from Chicago), made her name with the Oscar-winning screenplay for Juno.

Cassidy supports the health care bill on moral grounds, but he has deep doubts about its fiscal sustainability. On this front, he makes two points that many right-of-center wonks have been hammering on for a while now. First, the individual mandate is a bit of a sham, and lots and lots of people will probably just pay the modest fine (or dodge it) until they get sick, at which point theyll show up demanding their guaranteed insurance policy, sending costs skyrocketing. Second, the subsidies for the individual market are so much more generous than the existing tax deduction for employer-provided health care that employers will have an enormous incentive to offload their employees onto the new exchanges:",2010-03-30T13:38:54+0000

us,Trailer to Change for Transgender Film,"The director of Ticked-Off Trannies With Knives, a movie planned for the Tribeca Film Festival that has set off a war of words before being screened there, said he would amend its trailer so it would not refer to real-life victims of violence. In an e-mail message, Israel Luna, who wrote and directed the film, said he was inspired to create the movie in part by the hate crimes against the trans community. He said he included references in his trailer to Angie Zapata, a transgender woman who was beaten to death in Colorado in 2008, and to Jorge Mercado, a gay teenager who was murdered in Puerto Rico in 2009, to give a disturbing reality to my film about transgender violence. After listening to some of the voices in the trans community, Mr. Luna said, Ive decided to remove those references from the trailer. A listing for the movie at tribecafilm.com had drawn angry comments, and the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation had sought the movies removal from the festival, saying, The film, its title and its marketing misrepresent the lives of transgender women and use grotesque, exploitative depictions of violence against transgender women.",2010-03-30T21:07:52+0000

Representatives for Jon Heder, below, the Napoleon Dynamite star, said he had left a new Comedy Central series that was about to go into production, one that sported a pedigree of prominent comic talents and for which the cable channel had the option to order as many as 100 episodes. Comedy Central announced last summer that it would make a comedy series that would star Mr. Heder and be produced by Gary Sanchez Productions, the company run by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. At that time the concept for the series was undecided; more recently, its co-stars Chris Parnell and Horatio Sanz said the show would feature Mr. Heder as a fallen financial whiz who returns to his hometown. On Monday night a publicist for Mr. Heder said in a statement: Comedy Central, Gary Sanchez Productions and Jon Heder have mutually decided to part ways over creative differences with the character. It is not known who is being considered to replace Mr. Heder if the channel proceeds with the show. Comedy Central did not immediately comment.",2010-03-30T21:08:06+0000

The restaurant, run by Jesse Schenker, features ""American food with Spanish flavors, cooked with French technique; small plates and high concept."" Start with snacks, like codfish fritters or the charcuterie plate or, say, the tte de cochon. Then move on to pork belly cooked with a sherry-laced caramel or ocean trout with a dressing of smoked bacon. ""The cooking at Recette is smart and imaginative, the food that results from it elegant and full of flavor. The wine list is deep and the service friendly and able, if sometimes overwhelmed. You may have to ask for water a couple of times. There will be the occasional crash of a dropped wineglass. It is casual, almost to a fault.

Thats not just because glasses are expensive, but also because in Mexico theyre often perceived as evidence of a handicap. In an attempt to address both problems, Ver Bien turned to the industrial designer Yves Bhar, who, as the creator of the One Laptop Per Child XO (the original $100 computer), has earned a reputation as a maker of inexpensive, attractive products for kids in the developing world. Bhar designed a set of split frames, which makes the glasses less costly to assemble in the field and lets kids customize them using a smorgasbord of color options. Theyre at the intersection of practicality and personal expression, Bhar says. With the help of Augen, the manufacturer, Ver Bien can keep the total cost  including an eye exam and shipping  at just $10. This year alone, it will give away 400,000 pairs. This is about using the very best not to make the most expensive product, Bhar says, but to make the most valuable product  and to make it efficiently. ",2010-03-31T14:45:38+0000

Alejandro Alcocer, a watch fanatic and design entrepreneur who has previously delved into skateboarding, catering and handbag design, followed the legend of a black watch supposedly released by Rolex in the late 1960s for the Royal British Army soldiers stationed in South Africa. It was thought that only 500 were made, but Rolex never confirmed their distribution and they became the holy grail of watch collecting. So Alcocer decided to make his own, with the help of a Pennsylvania-based company that had previously done contract work for the U.S. Army but had fallen on tough times. Aside from the dial and crystal, which remain in vintage original condition, the watches were transformed into matte black beauties using highly specialized chemical applications. Black is the new black, and Im feeling for the Rolex redux.",2010-03-31T17:00:33+0000

This action allows the extradition process to adapt to the U.S. proceedings, Folco Galli, the ministry spokesman, said.

On Tuesday the Los Angeles County district attorney, Stephen L. Cooley, joined deputies in opposing the latest appeal, which seeks among other things to have Mr. Polanski sentenced while he remains abroad.

It is the most measured and keenly perceptive analysis of how Wall Street careered off the tracks from its basic role in our society. Instead of being a vital engine for economic progress, Wall Street has spent the past two decades feathering its own nest at the expense of the entire country and beyond. A mighty pushback is necessary before our economy can right itself, but the concept of a transfer tax on frenetic trading-for-the-sake-of-trading is a weak solution. Such activities, which benefit only a few but have the potential for severe repercussions, must be isolated so only the players themselves take the risks, reap the rewards or take the hits directly.
