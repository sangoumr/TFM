He died at age 87 on March 28, 1998, at his home in Cornwall, Connecticut, where he and his family have lived since 1940. Mr. Hare grew up in Saint James, Long Island, New York, and in Lenox, Massachusetts; and New York City. He graduated from Groton School, class of 1929 and Yale University, class of 1933.In 1938 he married Mary Potter Sturges. She died in 1990. In February of 1996 he married Alida White Lessard. Mr. Hare was also instrumental in many planning and zoning issues in Cornwall. He was an environmentalist long before the environment became an issue. For example, he collected DDT residue samples from the brooks in Cornwall in the 1950's as part of a study that led to restrictions on its use. His long life is best summarized by his love of the land. It kept him continuously involved in conservation groups. He was a founder of the Housatonic Valley Association, and served it as a director and president for many years. In his work with the Association, he was a leader in the preservation of many tracts of land along the Housatonic, including, for example, several miles of the river's undeveloped west bank and the adjoining ridge from Cornwall to Kent. During his lifetime, Mr. Hare was a reporter, playwright, producer, poet, and painter. He wrote and directed plays for the famous Barter Theatre in Virginia during its heyday in the late 40's. He was a conscientious objector at a time when very few men were. He was deeply involved in the community of Cornwall, serving for many as a very well remembered Sunday School teacher, Deacon, and director of the Christmas Pageant in the First Churchof Christ Congregational in Cornwall. Mr. Hare is survived by his wife, Alida Hare; his 4 children, Meredith Burke of Ipswich, Massachussetts, Patrick Hare of Cornwall, Connecticut, Robert Hare of Kingston, New York, and Constance Hare of Montpelier, Vermont.

Mr. Johnson, a Fellow of the Royal College of Engineering, was born in London, England, August 5th, 1901. Following his graduation from Dulwich College, he went to India as a nineteen year-old engineer in the employ of Babcock & Wilcox, Ltd. Fourteen years later, he was responsible for all the company's interests in Asia and was based in Shanghai, China where he numbered among his friends such personalities as Herbert Hoover, Wallace Simpson, and Two-Gun Cohen, a general in the Chinese Nationalist Army. Mr. Johnson was an accomplished pianist, raconteur, and polo-player, and an enthusiastic race-horse owner. He was also a man of conviction and daring who, before his internment in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Shanghai in 1942, managed to sabotage Babcock & Wilcox power plants to prevent their being used in the Japanese war effort. During his 3- 1/2 years in the Japanese camp he served as the elected representative of his fellow prisoners in all dealings with their captors. Following the Communist takeover in 1949, Mr. Johnson successfully negotiated the release of all B&W employees who were held hostage by the Communists. In 1958, Mr. Johnson and his wife, Marjorie, returned to England, where they lived until Mrs. Johnson's death in 1966. In 1983, Mr. Johnson joined his only child, Cecilia, in New York where he led a full and active life until 1993, when he suffered a stroke. Even then he continued to display the virtues of an Aristotelian gentleman -courtesy, magnanimity, and courage. He and his daughter moved to New Mexico in 1995. Mr. Johnson's death is deeply mourned by his daughter, Cecilia, and her husband, Alexis Bespaloff.

A salon artist par excellence, he never got past the Old Masters he so sedulously studied in his youth. As the radical notions of realism swirled around him, he produced florid, old-style history, biblical and allegorical extravaganzas, most titillatingly ''The Birth of Venus'' in 1863. Now reposing at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, it depicts a luscious reclining nude attended by flying cherubs, so chastely rendered that it was bought by Napoleon III at that year's Salon.",1998-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Ambitious enough to include 750 special effects, Stephen Hopkins's version of the quaint, tinny black-and-white television show is often frenetic enough to suggest that all 750 are happening simultaneously.

But the funda-mental ideas of early modernism -- those of openness, lightness and the lack of applied ornamentation -- are as valid today as they were 60 years ago, a fact demonstrated by the architecture and design presented in this issue. Ranging from classically modern to cutting-edge contemporary, everything here exudes a calm, uncluttered order that is bathed in light. It also refutes the argument that modern design is cold, slick and untouchable. In these rooms, glass and steel gleam with jewel-like precision, wood reveals its sensual texture, and even concrete can seem warm. And whether their prevailing esthetic is highly machined or hand-hewn, these interiors are full of details that please the eye as well as the hand. But most important, these are places with personality -- after seeing them, you know as much about their owners as you do about their designers. In today's modern house, there is plenty of living room. Pilar Viladas",1998-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Archives of Innocence,"For centuries until the Nazis, Poland was the heart of Jewish life in Europe. More than 75 percent of American Jews, it is estimated, can trace at least one grandparent to somewhere in Poland as it existed before the German onslaught of 1939. Poland's Jews bore the brunt of the Holocaust. But a significant part of their history has survived in municipal and Jewish archives. JEWISH ROOTS IN POLAND: Pages from the Past and Archival Inventories (Roots to Roots Foundation / YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, $50), by Miriam Weiner, a co-editor of ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Genealogy,'' offers an authoritative guide to what records still exist and where they can be found. A town-by-town index to archives shows, for example, that in Lublin tax rolls go back to 1716 and Jewish community records to 1775. But there is far more than archival listings. There are hundreds of poignant photographs and old tinted postcards of scenes from the early years of the century, panoramas of aching nostalgia, given what we know about what was to come. A 1916 picture of a town square in Oswiecim, near what was to become the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, serves as a reminder that before such places became synonyms for horror, they were just places, with streets where people shopped and children played.

Dean and Karel McAllister, an assistant, designed a pair of jewel-like doors that separate the living area from the former bedroom, now the media room, while keeping the entire space visually open. The interlocking L-shaped doors are partially sandblasted on the media-room side, to serve as a screen for the wall-mounted video projection camera. The doors also enclose a stainless steel perch for the client's two parrots. With their here-but-not-here transparency and reflections of surrounding skyscrapers, the doors create what Dean calls ''the idea of volumes contained in a very thin wall.'' Clearly, the idea works.

Among them are Suki Sperakis, a blue-eyed Greek-American who fled the shackles of a boring life in suburban New Jersey, and Aaron Katz, a refugee from Manhattan who ditched his wife and a promising career in mergers and acquisitions to renovate a run-down guest house with his elderly father. It's clear from the start that Suki and Aaron are meant for each other, but standing in their way are a bunch of Russian crooks who are laundering money through a chain of T-shirt shops. It seems that Suki, who works for the local newspaper, has decided to investigate the gang's activities. And this means tangling with the creepy ringleader, Ivan Cherkassky, a paranoid with ''a doleful scooped-out face, pockmarked and lumpy, like what was left when a wedge of melon had been spooned.'' When Suki is marked for death after asking too many questions, Aaron comes to her rescue, aided by his comical father. Joining them is a Shames favorite, the retired Mafioso Bert (the Shirt) d'Ambrosia, who turns up with his ancient chihuahua to give father and son some valuable lessons in mob etiquette. Shames plays it all for laughs, managing at the same time to make his story's locale seem both suitably exotic and peculiarly charming.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Very Good For Nothing,"William, the firstborn of twin boys, has determined to spend the rest of his life making sure he will never be first again. In the course of Benjamin Anastas's fine, funny debut novel, AN UNDERACHIEVER'S DIARY (Dial, $15.95), William provides exquisitely detailed explanations of his strategies for falling short -- even backing them up with a vague attempt at scholarship. In clinging to the depths, William is aided most of all by the fact that his twin brother, Clive, can do no wrong; his destiny is to travel smoothly from success to success, impressing parents, teachers, therapists and girlfriends (although there turns out to be a small cloud of doubt about the last) through his incredible ease of accomplishment and the wealth of his potential. With such a paragon of achievement available for ready comparison, William doesn't have to try very hard to disappoint. Instead, he drifts rather gracefully -- it must be admitted -- down the plane of life until he reaches the zenith of underachievement: ''Having disappointed every expectation that my parents held for me, I had finally been cast out of their constructive thoughts.'' Imbued with a kind of half-serious mockery, William's account of his misadventures sometimes recalls Frederick Exley's masterpiece of the genre, ''A Fan's Notes.'' Similarly, Benjamin Anastas makes his protagonist a successful failure, happy to be written off, perhaps, but understanding his world pretty well: ''Life has been an experiment in trial and error, without any guiding principles . . . like prayer without a God to listen.''

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; He's Still Back Again,"In the heyday of both the singer and his country, Frank Sinatra was brash, talented and on top of the world. Plenty has been written about him over the years; his achievements and contradictions have been irresistible to authors as different as Kitty Kelley and E. B. White. Now comes a new picture book about the skinny kid from Hoboken, N.J., who became the Chairman of the Board, John Lahr's SINATRA: The Artist and the Man (Random House, $32.50). For true fans, the 100 black-and-white photographs are the book's biggest asset. Particularly in the behind-the-scenes photographs by Bob Willoughby and William Read Woodfield, these dramatic images give us a glimpse of the aura that attracted Presidents and bobby-soxers alike. Lahr's essay (a shorter version of which originally appeared in The New Yorker, where he is a drama critic) is an appreciation of Sinatra's gifts that does not shy from delving into the subject's raging dark side. Lahr quotes from many previous books and articles to construct his concise history, so the book's freshest contribution comes with his ability to articulate grand themes with a nice turn of phrase. Sinatra evoked a particularly American loneliness, Lahr writes, ''that of the soul adrift in its pursuit of the destiny of 'me,' and thrown back onto the solitude of its own restless heart.'' Unfortunately, every page of Lahr's text is overlaid with the word ''Sinatra'' in three-inch-high gray lettering -- a distracting and un-Sinatralike lapse of cool in an otherwise fairly swingin' book.

Chang, Chancellor George Bugliarello and the entire Polytechnic University community mourn the passing of Mildred Topp Othmer, beloved wife of the late Dr. Donald F. Othmer, after a long illness. Dr. Othmer, who passed away in 1995, was a longtime Polytechnic faculty member, co-author of the landmark KirkOthmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology and one of the nation's most influential and inventive chemical engineers. Mrs. Othmer, a member of the prominent Topp family of Omaha, NE, attended the University of Nebraska in the years when relatively few women earned four-year college degrees. After graduation, she taught English, economics and foreign languages in the Midwest before becoming a successful fashion buyer for her family's clothing outlet. Her flair for fashion and her skill in marketing helped turn the business into one of the region's most exclusive and fashionable women's clothing stores. Several years later, Mrs. Othmer struck new educational ground again when she came to New York and earned an MBA from Columbia University. Her marriage to Dr. Othmer in 1950 opened a new chapter in a life already marked by a spirit of adventure and accomplishment. She was her husband's friend and inspiration and constant traveling companion, accompanying him on numerous worldwide trips to locales as far away as Southeast Asia and South America. She also devoted many hours as an education consultant and community volunteer. She and Dr. Othmer were generous benefactors of Polytechnic University, and their names grace the libraries or buildings of the Brooklyn History Museum, the Long Island College Hospital, in Brooklyn, the American Chemical Society, in Washington, D.C., and the Chemical Heritage Foundation, in Philadelphia, PA.

Even worse, it turns out that there is not even a local ordinance that requires either side to conduct structural inspections to spot problems that are not visible to the eye.

This is the sort of story that makes dog people roll their eyes and cat people smile indulgently. And this is the sort of sensibility that explains why cat people have enabled the German-born photogapher Hans Silvester to make such a comfortable living. ASLEEP IN THE SUN (Chronicle, $29.95), the latest in a series of books documenting the feline good life as enjoyed in the Greek islands, may be his most attractive yet. Certainly it's his most comfortable. Think of it as a wordless primer in the art of the nap, a sequence of handsome images of cats mostly doing what they do best -- lying around with their eyes closed, looking more relaxed than we can ever hope to be. And more stylish. It's no slur on Silvester's talent to note that cats seem to have a knack for displaying themselves to their best advantage: consider, for example, the tabby he finds sprawled across the top of a trellis, one leg dangling just so, or the ginger-and-white cat lolling decoratively behind a curtain of ginger-colored fishing nets. Even the cat caught snoozing against the windshield of a car looks terribly clever rather than in imminent danger of becoming road kill. (And the blue of the car does contrast nicely with his fur.) ''For those who would learn to siesta well,'' Silvester writes in his introduction, ''I advise taking a cat as a teacher.'' All well and good, but remember one thing: any lessons will be offered in the cat's own good time. Alida Becker",1998-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Children's Books; Let's Go Fly a Kite,"Adults may differ about what makes a perfect day. But for a young child, it would surely be like the one Vera B. Williams creates for Evie in LUCKY SONG (Greenwillow, $15; ages 2 to 5). It's a slight, bright book with the color-saturated pictures and joyous spirit familiar to readers of such beloved earlier works as ''A Chair for My Mother'' and ''Scooter.'' For Evie, unaccountably, everything goes right: ''She wanted something new to wear and on the hook she found it. She wanted something new to play with, and her grandpa made it for her. She wanted to go out, and the door flew open.'' Everyone and everything respond to her every wish: ''She wanted to fly her kite, and the wind took it. When she shouted, 'Look how high!' her mother ran to look. When she wanted to go home for supper, her grandma had it ready. When she wanted her blanket, her sister wrapped it around her.'' It is just the opposite of those terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad days when children -- storybook or real -- are slighted, misunderstood and out of luck. But as Evie's day winds down, and the book comes to a close, Williams lets on that every tale of perfection is an incantation, a kind of wish-song. ''When she wanted a song, her father came and sang to her -- all about Evie, who flew her kite up with the clouds and the speedy planes,'' the ending goes. ''If you want to hear that song again, go back to the beginning.'' Tamar Lewin",1998-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; A Deep and Distant Time,"Throughout Anjana Appachana's first novel, we are reminded to pay careful attention to the voices of the women who speak in its pages -- Padma and her daughter, Mallika; Padma's sister, Shanta; her mother, Rukmini; and her confiding neighbors, Madhu and Anuradha. Each of the female characters in LISTENING NOW (Random House, $25) recounts her own version of Padma's ill-fated liaison with her college lover, Karan, and its bitter consequences. Thirteen years after his disappearance, Karan remains a haunting, riddling figure in the lives of Padma and their daughter. ''In that deep and distant time,'' Mallika recalls, ''there lived in my house my permanently stricken mother, my mother's vivacious, laughing sister, and my absent father, whose presence in our house was shaped by my grieving mother's awful silence. Our house was like a well, holding his absence and her silence, and within those waters, my story began.'' In an eloquent interweaving of perspectives, Appachana's novel revisits the wrenching episodes at the heart of Padma's ''awful silence'' before erupting in ''the unrelenting heat of one revelation, and then another, and yet another.'' Blending emotional depth with elements of melodrama reminiscent of popular Indian films, Appachana succeeds in drawing us deep into this complex vision of shattered happiness and withered dreams. At the same time, she convincingly portrays the strains on women in modern India -- confined by their extended families, diminished and betrayed by the men they look to for security. Ultimately, the reader is compelled, like Karan, to lean in close and truly hear Padma's sad, assailing voice -- and, in the process, discover how cruelly both their lives have been misshapen.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Can't Dance, and Doesn't Have To","Walter McCloud, the protagonist of Jane Hamilton's third novel, THE SHORT HISTORY OF A PRINCE (Random House, $23), loves the ballet, and as a teen-ager in suburban Chicago he dreams of starring as the prince in a production of ''The Nutcracker'' or ''Swan Lake.'' However, the ballet does not love clumsy, nearly flat-footed Walter, so his devotion turns into an extra source of adolescent humiliation. With intelligence and empathy -- and drawing on rich veins of irony -- Hamilton tells the story of Walter's search to define his talents and defy the meaning of his all-too-appropriate name (which, the Oxford English Dictionary tells him, means ''to move or go unsteadily; to totter, stumble''). Thus the novel deftly alternates between two sections of narrative, set during two crucial years in his life. The first introduces us to 15-year-old Walter in Illinois in 1972, coming to grips with his homosexuality, his lack of dancing skills and the fact that his confident, all-American brother is dying of cancer. The second, which begins in September 1995, reveals 38-year-old Walter as a witty, warmhearted man full of regret for having spent his early adulthood pursuing ''the pleasures consigned to youth'' in Manhattan's gay community -- and full of determination to reorder his life by taking a job teaching high school English in a farm town near his family's summer home. By subtly amassing a wealth of emotional detail from these very different periods in Walter's life, Hamilton summons up his compassion, his devotion to his family and his gifts as a connoisseur, all of which are displayed in a finale that is at once surprising and redemptive.

Born Oct. 18, 1920 in Rockford, IL, son of Girolamo & Angela. His youth was spent in Brendola, Italy and returned to Rockford in 1928 through Ellis Island. After his retirement in 1980 from the City of Rockford with 34 years of service, he spent most of his time in Italy, and in New York City where his daughter Janet lives. Emeric was a U.S. Army World War II hero landing in Normandy and was interviewed by WABC-TV in 1995 for carrying out his battle with cancer like a military operation, ''he just wouldn't give up.'' When he was hit with a piece of shrapnel in France he didn't fall down, he just kept on fighting for which he received the Purple Heart and many other medals. Emeric said, ''You were taught to outfox your enemy, that is what I did in the war and that is what I'll do with my cancer.'' The family would like to thank the doctors who believed in Emeric's valiant fight and to not give up on him because of a terminal illness & to those he convinced he was a warrior with every comeback defying the odds. The battle ended 2 years beyond the statistics; his spirit won and lives on. Emeric's legacy in battling cancer are in the following: ''We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight in the landing grounds, we shall never surrender''. (Churchill, 1940).

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Bug-Eyed Monsters and Nearly Naked Women,"Remington Schuyler, Charles B. Falls, Wesley Neff, George Rozen and Walter M. Baumhofer are comparatively unknown in the annals of commercial art. Yet they were prolific cover artists for magazines like Argosy, The Shadow, Mystery Adventure, Weird Tales and Thrills of the Jungle. Although these pulp magazines were not as respectable as The Saturday Evening Post, as a genre they claimed an even larger total circulation. Scores of pulp titles were published monthly, and whether the theme was romance, adventure, war, intrigue, science fiction, the wild West or sports, the hyperrealistic cover paintings were more provocative and titillating than any others on the newsstands. As Frank M. Robinson and Lawrence Davidson show in their lush PULP CULTURE: The Art of Fiction Magazines (Collectors Press, $39.95), the genre had masters who were capable of creating great artwork. Granted, certain cliches were often repeated -- scantily clad women, heroic men, evil villains, horrific monsters -- but the art was totally convincing. It takes considerable imagination to create a fresh image every month on the same theme, and the masters of pulp art met the challenge. My favorites are covers for All Detective Magazine, showing the metamorphosis of a man into a cobra (its fangs are knives), and Spicy-Adventure Stories, in which a sultry pinup, her already minimal garb torn to shreds, heroically fires a heavy machine gun at an evil enemy. With more than 300 full-color examples, there is something for everyone in this comprehensive collection of a virtually forgotten American popular art. Steven Heller",1998-04-26T05:00:00+0000
