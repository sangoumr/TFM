Baseball and the Cold War is an uneven and muddled work, perhaps grandly conceived but badly executed, though it would be nice to think that perhaps Mr. Senzel may someday again take a turn at the literary bat and produce more than a scratch single. Mr. Senzel's comment on more conventional baseball books is applicable, to some tiny degree, to the FordMantle offering as ghosted by old pro Joseph Durso: The ghostwritten autobiographies of aging baseball players are, in one sense, all the same. These players have a need for money and recognition, the two things that came most easily in their playing days. But when the time for memoirs comes, so does the knowledge that whatever their efforts, they can never recapture what they have lost. And so these autobiographies begin in disappointment, frustration, and bitterness. The motivation is to expose professional baseball to its adoring fans as the agony, pain, insecurity, and bewilderment that it is. And, having done that in the first chapter, the author runs out of bad memories and is forced to turn to pleasant memories and anecdotes in order to complete his own story. In doing so, he brings himself to a state where he confesses that he loves baseball and always has, whether or not baseball loves him, and that he would do it all over again in exactly the same way, the",1977-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Warhol's Descent Into Gore,"At the start of the next century it may well be possible to look back on these years of the 1970's and identify this very particular periodif not as the turning point from the Old Movie to the New, then as the time when New Movies began to supplement Old in such number that it wasn't always easy to tell them apart. The situation is disorienting. To experience some current movies is to go scuba-diving in murky water. Which way is up?This, I think, has as much to do with the various degrees of turn-off we all feel in relation to certain films as with whether or not the films are really any good. Robert Altman's ""3 Women"" is very much a New Movie, but its dreamlike form makes that self-evident. We don't expect to be told everything. Weespecially if we have admired Altman's work in the pastare prepared to make all sorts of adjustments when looking at one of his films, which we aren't when, say, we watch a rather absurd little horror film like Larry Cohen's ""It's Alive"" (about a murderous newborn child), which is also a New Movie.It says something about the movies' traditional role as a mass entertainment medium (which, of course, is no longer true) that so many people who have peacefully and sometimes enthusiastically accepted experiments in drama, fiction and painting, refuse to allow filmmakers to seek new forms of expression. That could be because the new movie forms of expression don't look so flamboyantly new. If they did, there would be a lot less trouble. Nobody is running old socks through the projector and calling it art. New Movies look like Old Movies but they aren't providing the same kind of release.There is also a lot of reverse snobbism involved in the way New Movies are watched by people who would rather die than say anything nice about Andrew Wyeth. Movies aren't supposed to be different from what they were when we were kids. This is the sort of person who goes to see ""Rocky"" and loves it just because it is schlocky. The other-half goes to see it and loves it because it is a slice of romanticized real-life.These thoughts are partially inspired by ""Andy Warhol's Bad,"" the latest film to come out of the Warhol Factory and certainly a New Movie though not exactly a supreme example. Like all Warhol films, especially ""Trash"" and ""The Chelsea Girls,"" ""Bad"" means to bewilder the audience by presenting, without moral comment and with a certain amount of glee, a picture of an absolutely rotten society. In this case the absolutely rotten society is the household of a well-upholstered, bleached-blonde Queens housewife, a Mrs. Aiken (Carroll Baker) who, in addition to removing unwanted hair (650 hairs an hour) from customers who come to her dining room-clinic, also runs a local Murder, Inc.Mrs. Aiken is less malicious than supremely acquisitive. Because her husband is ineffectual, she does what she has to do to make ends meet as a member of the great consumer society. She acts as the booking agent for a string of operativesmostly ill-tempered young women  who are prepared to carry out such contracts as the murder of unpleasant babies and autistic children and the maiming of other beings (including a dog) and who, simply out of boredom, may spend an off evening burning down a movie theater.""Bad"" is a New Movie but it is a less pure New Movie than the earlier Warhols in that it contains a hint of sentimentality and there is little doubt what we are meant to feel about what is happening on the screen, even when it's not easy to watch the gory details. ""Bad"" is a conscious send-up of America-TheAbsurd, a satire, but its own fondness for bad taste forces the audience to come to some adjustment to it, to find a way to accommodate its piled-on vulgarities. It is this insistence that we come to it, rather than the other way around, that is one of the distinguishing features of the New Movie, which is more truly avant-garde than any 80 hours of films that experiment with abstract images, superimposition of images, associative images and single-frame editing.The difficulty with the New Movie is that we still tend to bring to every film the same set of expectations and demands we carried with us when we went to see ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""North By Northwest,"" ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Potemkin."" That would seem a perfectly reasonable thing to do, since we're still sitting in the same old theater seats, looking at the same old theater screen from the same old point of view. Yet we aren't always walking out of the theater with the same old feelings. Something most unsettling is taking place.In such Rainer Werner Fassbinder films as ""Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven,"" ""Chinese Roulette"" and ""The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant,"" there is often a complete lack of psychological background. Fassbinder couldn't care less about how his characters get to be the way they areI suspect he'd say that to attempt to explain would be to oversimplify and thus to mislead, which is not the purpose of his films. All that we can know about a Fassbinder character is revealed on the screen in the course of the contemporary action but because the contemporary action is not always clear, we have to step in and make our own assumptions. We can, and there's nothing wrong in that but it may be a waste of time. In Fassbinder's films people, place, time and event are so thoroughly fused that we simply cannot isolate and analyze characters in any conventional way, any more than we can criticize a piece of non-representational sculpture in terms of whether or not it physically resembles its model. Freud is not dead for the New Moviemaker, but someone like Fassbinder sees a totality that involves a great deal more than character explanation.Strictly speaking, the New Movies aren't new. Luis Bunuel has been making them since 1928. Sometimes, as in ""Un Chien Andalou"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,"" they have been surreal, but quite as frequently they've been as straightforward as ""Tristana."" Bunuel's films have the fantastic clarity of a landscape lit by a bolt of lightning. We see more detail than we can immediately understandand more than he cares to waste his time and ours by explaining. There's seldom any music on the soundtrack of a Bunuel film to tell us whether we should laugh, cry, be furious or shocked. The delight in a Bunuel film is that we may feel all those emotions in a succession of splitseconds. Movies like that don't quickly pass from the mind.Another difficulty with the New Movie is that it doesn't present us with any obvious point of identification. Sometimes there's no one with whom we can sympathize, which, as a rule of thumb, is not great box office, though Stanley Kubrick has brought off such successful New Movies as ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" The success of these films, I suspect, lies in their ""spectacle""the mind-boggling visions of space in ""2001"" and the wittily grotesque projection of the-way-we-are-now into the future of ""Clockwork.""Without their spectacle the Kubrick films would probably be intolerable for many people. Audiences accustomed to Old Movies equate the dispassion of ""A Clockwork Orange"" with a conviction that Kubrick himself takes no moral stand on the events depicted. He does, of course, but he doesn't announce it. He refuses to make things easy for us. He doesn't footnote his movies with reassuring messages. Instead, he insults our sense of order by showing a system of rewards and punishments that is totally confused. There is no Clark Gable or even a Steve McQueen to act as our surrogate in ""A Clockwork Orange""no one we immediately recognize and whose popular identity establishes our relation to the film. We watch the New Movie at a distance, on our own. It's no coincidence, I think, that there has been an increasing number of New Movies since the decline of the old star system. New Movies deal in the unfamiliar.Many horror films are New Movies, including the dreadful ""The Omen,"" if only because they require audiences to swallow nonsense that they'd reject in the light of day. But people who go to horror films are prepared to make adjustmentsto stand comfortably ouside the filmas the price of thrills. Horror movies are spectacles, too.Fellini's ""Casanova"" is a New Movie and ""Amarcord,"" which is awash in sentiment of the most appealing kind, is Old. There's no doubt about how one is supposed to feel about the characters of Fellini's recollected youth, but ""Casanova"" is as cold as ice. Temperature is not necessarily a surefire way of determining the difference between New and Old Movies, but it is an indicator. The New Movie tends to be cool, distant, without reproach. It says, ""This is the way it looks. How do you feel about it?"" and then it leaves you on your own. It is suspicious of answers. Bergman's films are Old in the best sense, and they are Old even when they are ambiguous. They are full of unmistakable emotionslove, sorrow, longing, dread, confusion.Wim Wenders's screen adaptation of Peter Handke's ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" is a quintessential New Movie, being a vivid film equivalent of the kind of New Novel written by Handke in Germany and Alain Robbe-Grillet and Marguerite Duras in France. Both Robbe-Grillet and Duras have made their own New Movies but they've been unendurably boring. Duras (""Nathalie Granger"" and ""India Song"") refuses to give us enough information of any kind to excite our interest, while Robbe-Grillet (""L'Immortelle"" displays a fondness for fashion-magazine photography and pretty images that have the effect of denying any emotions whatsoever. While his writing is clean, his movies are full of purple prose.""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" is a stunningly straightforward story of a man cutting himself loose from his society, going over the edge into lunacy the way the rest of us take off on a summer vacation. Methodically, Wenders uses no tricks. We recognize the world in which his hero travels. It is so ordinary that for about the first third of the movie we wonder what is up, at which point we begin to notice that although we recognize the world of the goalie, it's not all that ordinary. Everything is a bit too precise. We are aware of noises we wouldn't usually hear. At times the landscape seems uninhabited, then suddenly full of menacing strangers. There are portents of disaster everywhere, sometimes in the hysterical way children play when they're excited.The manner in which Wenders draws us into the goalie's mind (without one subjective camera movement) is so remarkable that the film rivets us, though to this day I'm not sure why or what it all means. It's too easy to call it a study in alienation. The film and the responses it prompts are more mysterious than that. The New Movie need not be gloomy. I think an argument can be made to the effect that all of Woody Allen's comedies from ""Take the Money and Run"" through ""Love and Death"" are New Movies, while his new movie, the marvelously affecting ""Annie Hall,"" is Old. A lot of people who had trouble finding a handle for the ""early"" Woodythe out-and-out ratare discovering him for the first time in ""Annie Hall,"" which is the first time he's presented himself as a character of intelligence and feeling.New Movies are neither better nor worse than Old. They are different. They ask us to look at the screen with skepticism instead of expecting to be lulled into euphoria or having our prejudices (good and bad) reaffirmed. Sometimes New Movies aren't worth the effort. Sometimes, though, as in films like ""Mother Kusters"" or Terrence Malick's ""Badlands"" or Woody Allen's ""Bananas,"" the experience is to remind us that movies have only scratched the surface of their possibilities.",1977-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Class Struggle on the Plains of Patagonia,"THE HISTORY of Hector Olivera's 1974 Argentine film, ""Rebellion in Patagonia,"" is almost as full of reversals in fortune, followed by success, followed by other setbacks, as the tumultuous social history it documents.The film, which opened yesterday at the Thalia and Jean Renoir Cinema on a double-bill with ""Union Maids,"" is about the series of bloody strikes that marked the first attempts to organize by urban and rural workers in the southernmost province of Argentina in the early 1920's.Those attempts succeeded, failed, succeeded, and ultimately were decisively destroyed by the government. The Argentine Army imposed a sort of order-by-execution that has since become a way of life for the huge, potentially rich, underpopulated country that stretches from the subtropics almost to the Antarctic.""Rebellion in Patagonia"" takes a long view of history but when it was ready for release in 1974, at the time the presidency of Juan Pern was turning more and more to the right, the military men thought it advisable that the film be shelved. When, after a lot of controversy, the movie finally was released in Buenos Aires, it became a hit and then went on to be honored at film festivals in Berlin and Taormina.Since then, several of its principal actors, their lives threatened by the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance, a very busy, aggressive, right-wing vigilante group, have taken up residence abroad. The furies that motivated the action in the filmthe historic schisms between the Argentine right and leftlive on.To use the terms right and left implies that the disagreements that separated Argentinians after World War I were politically more sophisticated than they really were.It was the haves versus the have-nots, the wealthy landowners allied with city interests against the rural and urban workers. Though each group had many members who were not Argentinians, each liked to warn against the influences of ""foreigners"" in the ranks of their enemies. In a land populated by immigrants, there's nothing lower than the late arrival.""Rebellion in Patagonia"" covers a great deal of ground in the sweeping style of the muralist, opening with the assassination of an Army colonel in Buenos Aires in 1923 and then going back several years to describe the events leading up to that assassination.Most of the action takes place on the broad plains of Patagonia, one of the most beautiful, most spooky landscapes on earth. It was there that a coalition of Communists and anarchists had successfully organized the workers on the sheep farms. When the landowners later refuse to honor their agreements, new strikes break out and the Army chief, once sympathetic to populist cause, sets out to break the movement in a campaign that's estimated to have taken the lives of 3,000 workers.The film is a collection of vignettes, richly detailed with the sort of character and incident that recall nostalgically but without sentimentality the sense of high purpose of early trade-unionism. The movie has a great fondness for these seminal labor fighters, including a young Spanish activist (Luis Brandoni) who is also a realist, and a fine old German idealist (Pepe Soriano) who puts his life on the line for his beliefs.It's not all black versus white, though. Mr. Olivera defines divisions within the ranks of both sides, sometimes tragically and often wittily, as in an early trade-union meeting when the success of a strike is celebrated by the Communists with a rousing anthem while their nonpoliticized Chilean compatriots look on aghast. They haven't yet been taught that politics can be expressed in song.",1977-05-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Civil Wrongs in Canada,"""Les Orders,"" written and directed by Michel Brault, is an angry, beautifully acted French-Canadian film basedlike those of Costa-Gavrason an actual event. The time is October 1970, shortly after the kidnapping of a British-diplomat and a provincial cabinet minister by an urban guerrilla group calling itself the Quebec Liberation Front. The Canadian Government subsequently suspended civil liberties in Quebec arrested 450 people, few of whom apparently had anything to do want the kidnapping, and held them without charge, some for as long as several months.'Les Ordres"" is not about French-Canadian liberation, though it clearly finds the English to be villains. Rather it's about the terrifying speed with which democratic processes can be liquidated and even more about the psychological effects of imprisonment.The film follows the case histories of five persons who had peripheral associations to politics  a union representative and his wife, a physician, an unemployed laborer and a social worker. Although only one man is tortured, by being made to endure what turns out to be a mock-execution, each of the victims is effectively traumatized through humiliation, fear and loss of identity.These scenes are harowing to watch, but one suspects that the director has loaded his dice. Would such treatment be condoned if the victim was known to be guilty? That question isn't answered, but because the characters in ""Les Ordres"" are presented as innocent, one wonders, whether the film's humanitarianism has its limits.Mr. Brault, who was the cameraman for Claude Jutra's ""Mon Oncle Antoine"" and ""Kamouraska,"" is immensely good with his actors, none of whom is known to me, but he hasn't been able to resist some of the less interesting stylistic affectations of the day.These include the arbitrary switching back and forth between color and black and white, overlapping sound and terribly tedious, phony interludes in which the narrative is interrupted to have the actors talk about their roles.

Seattle used to be notable chiefly for Boeing airplanes and some interesting women in its past (the pioneer Mercer girls inspired the TV series, Here Come the Brides; Alice B. Toklas, Mary McCarthy, Frances Farmer and Gypsy Rose Lee lived here; in 1926, Bertha K. Landes was the first woman elected mayor of a major American city).

One appearance on national television gobbles up the act. Fresh items are demanded. The cycle is relentless. There's a builtin escalation of expectations.

us,'Black and White in Color' Focuses Less on War Than Leadership,"The setting is the dry, hot savannah of West Africa in late 1914. The inhabitants of a small French trading post in the interior live in easy alliance with the members of a tiny German garrison a few miles away. They don't fraternize exactly, but they get along in their separate spheres of boredom.The German sergeant spends his days seeing that his handful of black troops maintains military routine. The French sergeant, though, lazes about, drinks wine with the French shopkeepers and their wives and gossips about the peculiar geologist who shares their existence, but never seems to be a part of it. The young Frenchman is different from them, meaning he's educated.This somnolent peace is destroyed with the arrival of an old Paris newspaper with the word of the outbreak of war. ""Who with?"" asks one Frenchman. ""Germany."" ""That's strange,"" says the first. ""I would have thought it would be with England."" The small crew of boozing, foolish French patriots, with the spiritual support of their two resident priests, decides to march on the German fort for the greater glory of France.Their war begins cheerfully with a picnic lunch attended by the ladies, who have come along to watch the tricolor raised over the German fort. Instead, they see their troops (about two dozen hastily impressed, disinterested blacks who carry their guns on their heads) vanquished by a single machine gun.This is the beginning of ""Black and White in Color"" and it is not terribly promising. There's hardly a clich overlooked by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the director, as he sets his scene for yet another film on the senselessness of war. The Germans are bears for discipline. The French are hysterical, convivial. The priests are fat-bellied and venal and the blacks infinitely patient with the idiosyncracies of the civilized.But stick with ""Black and White in Color"" a little longer. What starts as a broad, obvious, rather pious comedy peopled by musical-comedy types turns into something much more complex as it goes along. It's less about the senselessness of war (a movie that is pro-war on principle might be more easy to become excited about) than it is about the way extraordinary times and circumstances can create leaders.The central figure of the film is Hubert, the French geologist (Jacques Spiesser), the soft-spoken, self-assured, almost pretty young man who, after unsuccessfully trying to stop the original attack against the German fort, becomes the acknowledged commander of the desperate Frenchmen. The way Hubert takes charge is comic and mysterious. He is decisive, blunt, polite, cruel, high-handed and distant. Like De Gaulle, he always behaves properly, but he doesn't tolerate fools.As the young man finds his character, so does the movie. In an excellent scene in the midst of the crisis, after Hubert has bulldozed his compatriots into some form of order, the young man makes his first official appearance (at a review of the French ""troops"") with his stunning-looking, ever-mute but extremely haughty black mistress on his arm. There's nothing for these cowed, petit-bourgeois French shopkeepers to do but bow and curtsy to the consort.The performances also improve immensely as the film moves on. At the beginning, Jean Carmet and Jacques Dufilho as, respectively, the lazy sergeant and the hysterical shopkeeper (a sort of spin-off of the characters played by Louis De Eunes), are numbingly predictable, but later, as supporting characters, they become very funny. Mr. Spiesser is fine as the assertive young leader. It's a performance that reveals itself so quietly that it's not until the film is almost over that one understands what's happeningand because I'm not allowed to reveal the ending, I can only say that the final sequence of the film makes everything that's gone before worth attending to.""Black and White in Color,"" which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, was awarded the Oscar as the best foreign-language film this year as the entry from the Ivory Coast, where the movie was shot. There's been some flak about this because the film's executive producer is Swiss and its director, writers and most of the cast are French. In winning the Oscar, it had to beat both ""Seven Beauties"" and ""Cousin, Cousine,"" which says less about the quality of the winner than the peculiar rules by which the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vote in this category.""Black and White in Color,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some minor nudity and a few vulgar expressions that, in subtitles, look like the sort of graffiti one might see scribbled in much larger print on any New York bus or subway car.",1977-05-09T05:00:00+0000

It's like sifting Coney Island sand for pennies. You work all day to come up with a backache.""Cross of Iron"" is Mr. Peckinpah's least interesting, least personal film in years, a hysterically elaborate, made-in-Yugoslavia war spectacle, the work of international financiers and a multinational cast, most of whom are supposed to be Germans although they sound like delegates to an international PEN convention.The film, which opened at Loews State 2, the Orpheum and other theaters yesterday, is about a small detachment of German troops on the collapsing Russian front in 1943. There's the gracious German colonel, played by James Mason, who is English; the stiff-backed Prussian captain, played by Maximilian Schell, who is Swiss; the rugged German corporal, played by James Coburn, who is from Nebraska, and the German enlisted men who are played by real Germans.Although throughout the film the artillery barrages are nonstop, the rations are meager, and disease is everywhere, the worst thing these soldiers endure is a speech contagion. Whenever Mr. Schell or the German actors have a scene with the English or American actors, the accents of the English and Americans go suddenly Teutonic as if in the siege of belligerent consonants.There's not a decent performance in the entire film, something for which the director must be held accountable, along with the people who provided the screenplay. This is nothing much more than a frame for the special effects and a slight story about the antagonism between the brave, disillusioned corporal (a Good German) and the aristocratic Prussian (the Bad German). It may be of historical interest to note that there's only one Nazi in the movie and although he's not nice, it's the Prussian who's the villain.Mr. Peckinpah's continuing concern for the corruptibility of children is something, given the once-over-lightly treatment behind the opening credits, which detail the rise and fall of the Nazi war machine, while the rest of the movie is virtually a parody of his machismo themes. ""A man is generally what he feels himself to be,"" says Mr. Coburn at one point, but these characters don't have a convincing feeling among them.I can't believe that the director ever had his heart in this project, which, from the beginning, looks to have been prepared for the benefit of the people who set off explosives. However, the battle footage is so peculiarly cut into the narrative that you often don't know who is doing what to whom. The visual effect, especially when bodies, buildings and vehicles are blown up in slow motion, becomes as Abstractly Expressionistic as a Jackson Pollock. The blood is thicker than water.

us,Screen: Spain Is the Star,"LUIS (Jos Luis Lopez Vazquez) is an unmarried, middle-aged, Barcelona businessman. He's soft-spoken and has the manner of someone who keeps to the background. Perhaps he's self-conscious about his lack of hair and about the oval face that recalls the faces of clowns who are meant to seem most comic when they are most sad, though Luis is not a comic character. He's self-contained and intelligent, the sort of man, you feel, who has made a satisfactory adjustment to life by scaling down his dreams to fit an overnight bag.At the beginning of Carlos Saura's fine, sorrowful and poignant Spanish film, ""Cousin Anglica,"" Luis is taking the bones of his long-dead mother from Barcelona to her family's crypt in southern Spain, where Luis grew up with his Falangist relatives while his father was fighting for the Republican cause.""Cousin Anglica,"" which opened yesterday at the D.W. Griffith Theater, is a voyage into the past quite unlike any other I've ever seen in a movie, both because Spain's recent history is so particular and because of Mr. Saura's way of always dealing with memory so that it becomes an extension of the immediate present.""Cousin Anglica"" is not simply about Luis's childhood before and during the civil war. It's about Luis's recollections of his childhood as he renews contacts with his family, especially with his cousin Anglica, the sweet, pigtailed little girl he once loved and who has grown into a handsome, rather ordinary woman whose disappointments frighten him.Mr. Saura doesn't use conventional flashbacks, which are as isolated from time and feeling as postcard pictures are removed from a tourist's actual experiences. When Luis recalls scenes from his childhood, he walks into them as the middle-aged man he is, a theatrical device that works in films much more effectively than I might have imagined.En route once again to his relatives, the tearful Luis is comforted by his mother and father. There is nothing exceptional about this scene except that when we see the middle-age, cardigan-wearing Luis being soothed by parents younger than he is we are suddenly presented not only with a memory of the past but with everything that's accrued in the intervening yearswith fear, anger and humiliation, but, also with the sense of loss that has haunted his maturity.The older Luis sits in his schoolroom listening to a priest tell a horror story about a little classmate, killed in an air raid, who may or may not be eternally damned depending on whether or not the boy had ""given in to temptation"" the morning he was killed. No wonder Luis never married.The recollected scenes of tentative courtship between Luis and the young Anglica, played by a beautiful, dark-haired actress named Mara Clara Fernandez are both intensely moving and slightly perverse, being simultaneously a remembrance of not-quite-forgotten intimacies and a description of where Luis is now, a contemporary Spaniard whose scars remain raw, if unseen. He's a Humbert Humbert with no will to act, without even a fantasy life.Jos Luis Lopez Vazquez is super as Luis, apparently cheerful, self-contained and settled, though forever disconnected from the kind of family life he remembers with such mixed feelings.Spain, though, is the real subject of the film, and at the time it was released there  1974  ""Cousin Anglica"" caused quite a stir with its references to the war, Spanish Catholicism and the possible nobility of at least some members of the Republican cause. Even if it's difficult for someone not familiar with the subtleties of Spanish life to get all of these references, the movie is extraordinarily compelling, an invitation into a world until recently closed, but whose vitality has remained undiminished.",1977-05-13T05:00:00+0000

And now, instead of the Reds having escaped from the inning, the Cardinals were ahead, 41. When the inning finally ended, the Cardinals had an 81 lead and the Reds would lose another game, Before last night's opener of the weekend series with the San Francisco Giants in Cincinnati, the Reds had lost 17 games and won only 12 games this season, hardly a record for the twotime World Series champions to cherish.

That him, somebody said, that's the fighter. Nearby a lady stared in disbelief. That's the fighter? she said. I thought that was a rock star, I thought he was looking for his guitar. Sometime tomorrow night Alfredo Evangelista is expected to he looking for his equilibrium. Alfredo Evangelista is what is known in boxing as an opponent, meaning a poor soul who has virtually no chance to win, a Rocky in real life. Imported from Spain despite having been outpointed by Lorenzo Zanon of Italy in his last bout, Alfredo Evangelista is also an offering, meaning the 22yearold lamb who will be sacrificed so that Muhammad Ali and the promoter, Don King, and the ABC television network, can provide primetime violence for perhaps 40 million viewers. Don't blame Ali; he fights everybody, he's entitled to a tuneup. Don't blame the promoters; they simply put the show together.

us,"'Looking Up,' Sober Tale Of a Family's Ambitions","As the first feature-film producing effort of Linda Yellen and Karen Rosenberg, ""Looking Up"" bears a stamp of maturity not normally associated with a pair of 27-year-olds. Their dramatization of the relationships of members of a middle-class New York Jewish family leaves the nagging impression of a dizzying succession of people caught up in a variety of troubles. But, despite its disturbing realties, ""Looking Up,"" which had its premiere yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, projects its sincerity with heartfelt emotion and a seemingly autobiographical remembrance of things present and past.In essence, Jonathan Platnick's script focuses on three generations of the family, particularly on Rose Lander, her two sisters, their husbands, children and their grandparents. More directly, it concentrates on their anxiety-ridden, largely unsuccessful drives for the better (i.e. richer) life in such authentic surroundings as, say, Washington Heights or Forest Hills.Practically all of the clan is involved in a frantic dash for the golden end of the rainbow while planning a diamond anniversary party for the grandparents. Rose is desperately striving for the fast-food franchise that will free her husband, Manny, from his failing seltzer business as she worries about her daughters and grandchildren, copes with grandma's geriatric fantasies, constantly shops and works part time in an envious cousin's luncheonette.Her sister, Libby, is also defeated as her plans for her daughter's marriage to a rich suitor are shattered when her husband is indicted in a real estate flim-flam. It also happens that Rose's married daughter has turned into a pill-popping psychiatric case. And Rose also discovers that her husband had sired Libby's child.""Looking Up,"" however, does live up to its title when the sisters join to face the future bravely as they gather at that party in one of those pseudo-elegant palaces where you can get a swan sculptured out of chicken liver with the hors d'oeuvres. ""We'll do the best we can,"" says Becky the spinster sister, if we can just hold on.""Despite the plot's soap-opera overtones, Miss Yellen, who directed with an eye for visual movement and character delineation, and the large castmostly drawn from local stage and television ranksmanage to avoid many of the sudsy banalities of the genre.Some of the roles are too broadly played, but quite a few of the principals score with natural portrayals. Marilyn Chris is a truly impressive and poignant figure as the undaunted Rose, either as a canny supermarket shopper or as the tigerish leader of her brood. Jacqueline Brookes is properly self-reliant as the realist Becky; Naomi Riseman is fine as the bumbling grandma, as are a serious Dick Shawn as Rose's inadequate, if devoted, husband and Doris Belack and Neva Small, as the beleaguered Libby and her problematic daughter.Many of the parts of ""Looking Up"" are greater than the whole, but its sobering, specialized drama rings as true as its real street scenes.""Looking Up"" received a PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") rating probably because of some explicit dialogue and a near-nude scene, neither of which should be especially traumatic for young viewers.",1977-05-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Fassbinder, in 'Jail Bait,' Explores Danger of Women Through Girl, 14","""Jail Bait"" is the intentionally slangy English rendering of the original German title of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1972 German film, ""Wildwechsel"" (literally, ""Wild Game""), a melodrama that mixes the tacky with the sublime in much the same way that its soundtrack switches back and forth between early 1960's-sounding pop records full of loudly proclaimed laments for that week's lost love, and the music of Beethoven.""Jail Bait,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker as part of the theater's continuing Fassbinder festival, is Mr. Fassbinder's ""La Peau Douce,"" a close-up examination of the sort of event that might make a two-or three-paragraph item in the local newspaper.In ""La Peau Douce,"" Franois Truffaut found evidence of poetic misalliance in a banal murder story. Mr. Fassbinder finds fury in the shape of a mindless Erinyes who destroys because she's peeved. ""Jail Bait"" touches on a number of other things, but misogyny is the dominant theme. Beware, it says. The danger presented by women is not symbolicit's real, lethal and wanton and, in this case, it's named Hanni.Hanni (Eva Mattes) is an astonishingly well-developed 14-year-old, as full-breasted and round-hipped as a Rubens model with a fondness for ice cream and Cokes. She wears her hair in braids, frolics unselfconsciously with her truck-driver father and would appear to be the perfect child in a household where no room is without its crucifix or picture of Jesus, Mary or one of the saints.One day after school Hanni allows herself to be picked up by Franz (Harry Baer), the sort of 19-year-old who has been told too often that he looks like James Dean. Harry wears his well pomaded hair in an artfully teased pompadour, favors studded jeans and drives a motorcycle. That afternoon in a haybarn, Franz deflowers Hanni with a good deal less fuss than he'd anticipated. When he mentions this, she shrugs and points out that if it hadn't been him, it would have had to be someone else. ""Why are you getting dressed?"" he says. ""Why not?"" is the reply. ""There's nothing else to do.""""Jail Bait"" is ""The Blue Angel"" without the hysterics of Jannings and the mystery of Dietrich. It's a tragedy for the soft-drink, fast-food, drive-in generationcryptic and almost as cold as Hanni, who, having once been responsible for Franz's being sent to jail (for impairing the morals of a minor), immediately takes up with him again on his release.Franz, of course, is no great brain, though he swaggers as he thinks a man should. As written, and as played (gently) by Mr. Baer he's no match for the rapacious Hanni. When she suggests that their only recourse is to murder her father, he finally agrees. He tells himselfperhaps vaguely remembering a movie he's seenthat ""it's men's work.""From this outline you might think that ""Jail Bait"" is less political than such other Fassbinder films as ""Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven,"" ""Fox,"" ""The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant"" and ""Ali,"" but its quite as concerned as those films with the uses of power and the quality of life in bisected, postwar Germany.It's also obsessed with a particularly adolescent fantasy about the difference between men and women. At one point Hanni, a role played by Miss Mattes with staggering self-assurance, kids Franz about the possibility of her father's catching them and castrating the younger man. ""Then,"" she says, ""you'd be just like me.""When Hanni's father first learns of his daughter's seduction, he cries out for the death penalty, which, Hanni's mother notes, has been abolished since the fall of the Nazis. ""That,"" says the father, ""was a regime. Now all we have is a government."" He's the kind of fellow who says he doesn't believe in murdering Jews but adds. ""Better to gas 100,000 Jews than to have a pig like that messing around with my daughter.""""Jail Bait,"" though it is beautifully and, intelligently controlled, is not an easy film to like. It certainly doesn't lift the spirits in any conventional way. It does contain moments of real pathosunusual in a Fassbinder film  in those scenes involving Hanni's mother, a role acted with desperate sadness by Ruth Drexel. However, the film's fascination lies not in any particular character or event but in the meanness of the total drama that Mr. Fassbinder sets before us. It's as blunt and simply drawn as a cartoon. The times, he says, deserve no more.",1977-05-16T05:00:00+0000

When he led the vastly underrated New York Jets to their 16to7 victory over Baltimore in the 1969 Super Bowl, he gave all of us, not just sports fans, one of the pure moments of joy in the city's recent emotional history. (His performance, it was said at the time, proved that his talent was as big as his mouth.) But he was just as audacious off the field. When he signed with the Jets in 1965 for the then stunning salary of $387,000 a year, he broke ground for the present era of bigmoney celebrities. When he flaunted a moustache and long hair, he set the style for a generation of mod athletes. Who else would have dared wear white football shoes? Who else would have given television endorsements to pantyhose? Even in defeat, as the brilliant years faded and he suffered repeated injury, Joe Willie White Shoes was a center of interest; the condition of Namath's Knees joined the Groundhog's Shadow as a famous seasonal imponderable. But now, at 34, he has sensedand accepteda new opportunity. Next season, he will play for the Los Angeles Rams, one of the more highly regarded professional football teams.

us,Screen: Von Sternberg's Coda,"THE ""RECONSTRUCTED"" version of Josef von Sternberg's ""The Saga of Anatahan,"" which opened yesterday at the Thalia Theater, is virtually a one-film retrospective of that great, idiosyncratic, often off-putting director's work. The film, in a fine new print, has been put together from footage that was originally released here in 1954and reviewed in The New York Times on May 18, 1954, as ""Ana-Ta-Han""with supplemental nude footage that von Sternberg cut into the first version in 1958.The amount of care and money that have gone into this reconstruction is testimony to the success of the keepers of the von Sternberg legacy. When he died in 1969, the reputation of the director appeared to be based entirely on the seven films he had made with Marlene Dietrich, beginning with ""The Blue Angel."" Mostly forgotten were ""Underworld"" (1927) and ""The Docks of New York"" (1928), and seldom ever mentioned was ""Anatahan,"" which was his last production, though ""Jet Pilot,"" begun in 1949, was not released until 1957.""Anatahan"" is not a film to use as an introduction to the von Sternberg work. One can snicker at the pomposities of its voice-over narration, written and spoken by the director, which recalls the conventions of silent movies, but even this narration, as much as visual style, constitutes a kind of coda to the von Sternberg career.The film, which the director made in Japan with an entirely Japanese cast and crew, must have been supremely satisfying to the director's ego, even if he was obviously somewhat short of studio space. Von Sternberg wrote, directed and photographed the film and speaks the only dialogue that can be understood.The story is about a group of Japanese sailors and one woman who are marooned on a Pacific island for something like five years after World War II.How this little society, dominated by one female, goes to pieces is depicted in what amounts to a series of virtually actionless tableaux. The melodrama is as passionless as a parable. Instead of being erotic, the film is obsessed by the idea of eroticism.It's not easy to accept Akemi Negishi as a femme fatale. She is sweetly pretty and rather chubby-kneed, and when she does a seductive, hip-swinging dance that is meant to drive the men out of their minds with desire, she looks more like a preteen practicing an awkward hula. We do see, however, von Sternberg's obsession with a concept of sexual desire as a destructive force.The obsession is reflected in the romantically highlighted black-and-white photography, as well as in the tightness of the space in which he had to work. Except for stock footage of the sea, there's hardly a long shot in the film. The marooned sailors and their queen bee are locked as much into the medium-shot frame as they are on their island. There are some sequences that are bound to prompt giggles from newcomers to von Sternberg, but there are others that immediately evoke some of the best work ever done by this great motion-picture stylist.The effect of the film is simultaneously sad, beautiful and a bit outrageous. Only von Sternberg would think to insert an opening-credit card informing us that the film had been produced entirely in ""a studio constructed for this purpose in Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan."" He was a fellow who needed the proper vibrations.""The Saga of Anatahan,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some discreet female nudity photographed with the sort of impersonal prettiness one used to see on pinup calendars.",1977-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Cria!' Film on Childhood,"CHILDHOOD CAN BE a most terrifying time. One must constantly observe the proscriptions of a primitive system of cause and effect that can be questioned only by the reckless or the ignorant. Squash a spider and it will rain. Step on a crack, break your mother's back. Sleep in the light of a new moon and you may never wake up. There is power in the knowledge of these things, as well as awful responsibility. One must be vigilant. One has to be alert for signs.Such a child is Ana (Ana Torrent), the 9-year-old heroine of Carlos Saura's beautifully acted, haunting Spanish movie, ""Cria!"" about a childhood so packed with trauma that one can scarcely believe that this acutely sensitive child will ever grow up to be the apparently composed, articulate woman that Geraldine Chaplin plays.In his 1973 film, ""Cousin Angelica,"" which opened here last week, Mr. Saura looked back on a Civil War childhood from the position of a middle-aged man forever stuck on the dead-center of his memories. ""Cria!"" is more ambitious but, without the focal point of a strongly defined present, it lacks the cumulative impact of the earlier movie.Its dreamlike reality is fragile. As it cuts among three time periodsAna at 9, Ana a few years earlier at the time of the death of her mother (also played by Miss Chaplin), and snippets of the grown-up Anaone begins to wonder whether the movie is much more than an outline for another movie. One wants more than mood and memory, though that may be asking for more than Mr. Saura ever intended.He's quoted as having said he conceived ""Cria!"" after seeing Miss Torrent in Victor Erice's ""The Spirit of the Beehive,"" which is easily understood. This extraordinary little girl, with large dark eyes and the grave manner of someone who has been given the secrets of the universe, is childhod not as it ever was, but as adults remember it.The childhood that Mr. Saura imposes on Ana is enough to have crushed even someone who's gone through a successful Freudian analysis, much less someone of Ana's age and temperament. She watches her mother diepainfullyof cancer and blames her philandering father. Using a substance that her mother has told her is poison (but actually may be no more than bicarbonate of soda), Ana doses her father's glass of milk and shoulders the responsibility of his death while he's in the act of making love to his best friend's wife.It's one thing, I suspect, for a child like Ana to fantasize about murder and even to accept responsibility for a murder obtained through charms or prayers, but it's quite another kind of drama when you have a little girl running around and believing that she's knocking off people with poison. Mr. Saura stacks the cards against Ana. Unlike her two sisters, she has an uncanny knack for walking into rooms at the wrong time. She's more than vigilant. She's emotionally accident-prone.Though ""Cria!"" seems arbitrarily and artificially structured, individual sequences are remarkably fineAna's attempts to make contact with her mute, paralyzed grandmother, her longing memories of her mother's combing her hair, her matter-of-fact questioning of the maid about what a woman's breasts look like, and a scene in which Ana and her two sisters become giddy and dance rock to a rock recording.""Cria!"" is a movie of marvelous moments and two superb performances, by Miss Torrent and by Miss Chaplin, who has never before in a film that I've seen so thoroughly realized herself as an actress. She's awfully good in the otherwise messy ""Welcome to L.A.,"" but she's excellent in ""Cria!""""Cria!"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a sequence in which Ana comes upon Freud's primal scene (most delicately suggested), something that may well terrify more adults than children who see the movie.",1977-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Vampire In Fassbinderland,"TENDERNESS of the Wolves,"" which opened yesterday at the Jean Renoir Cinema, follows ""Jail Bait"" as the second movie this week to come out of the Rainer Werner Fassbinder film factory, where, it seems, they make movies in their lunch breaks while making movies.""Tenderness of the Wolves"" was produced in 1973 by Mr. Fassbinder and directed by Ulli Lommel, the actor who was most recently seen as the wife's lover in ""Chinese Roulette"" and will be seen again soon in another Fassbinder film, ""Effie Briest,"" when it opens as part of the Fassbinder festival at the New Yorker Theater. This sudden surfacing within a short time of so many films directed by Mr. Fassbinder, or associated with him, carries with it both rewards and punishments.The situation would be intolerable were the young German director and his colleagues less talented, but it's difficult in any case. Just because one admires them, one tends to expect each new film to be something of a revelation, and when it isn't, one is inclined to draw back a bit, to re-examine earlier reactions, to find fault.People with such gifts aren't allowed to have fun, which is pretty much what ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" seems to be doing, though if you are familiar with the Fassbinder mode, the fun is of a particularly chilly sort.""Tenderness of the Wolves,"" written by Kurt Raab, who also plays the leading role, is the gospel according to Mr. Fassbinder about Peter Kurten, the Dsseldorf mass murderer whose crimes inspired Fritz Lang's 1931 classic, ""M.""Kurten, here named Haarmann and played by Mr. Raab, lives in an unidentified German city in the late 1940's. A sneak thief, forger and occasional fence, Haarmann has as his principal source of income dealings in blackmarket meat, which may or may not be leftovers from his victims, mostly destitute young men whom he takes home to fondle and then to drink. Haarmann, you see, is a vampire.Mr. Lommel regards the activities of Haarmann as he moves about the citypicking up his victims, acting as a police informer, attending convivial dinners at the neighborhood pub (with the main course usually supplied by him)with a deadly cool that, in the Fassbinder troupe, passes for humor.Haarmann's neighbors treat him as a harmless eccentric with a taste for boys. True, he's something of a sightgag, with his totally bald head, odd clothes and manic expression, but as any one of the local hookers or pimps or black marketeers would say, nobody's perfect. Only one person, an irritable, nosey woman (Margit Carstensen), who lives just downstairs, has the courage of her suspicions when she starts counting the number of young men who go upstairs and the number of brown paper parcels that come down.""Tenderness of the Wolves"" may be about the least erotic vampire movie ever made, which is, I suspect, the intention of Mr. Lommel and his associates. The movie deals in sleazinessphysical and emotionalof such intensity that second-rateness becomes virtually the subject of the film as well as its style. This is not to say the film is sloppy.It is beautifully and enthusiastically performed and it doesn't contain a single superfluous or redundant camera movement. Like Mr. Fassbinder's own early films, ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" is cryptic, tough-talking and swaggering in the manner of someone who means to shock his elders. Like the early Warhol work, ""Tenderness of the Wolves"" seems to be sending up everyone and everything, but, unlike the Warhol movies, it takes filmmakingthe possibilities of the disciplinewith complete seriousness, which becomes the redeeming factor in Fassbinder films, even when the subjects are off-putting.In addition to Mr. Raab, an exceedingly witty actor, and Miss Carstensen, the Fassbinder regulars who appear in the film include Brigitte Mira as the tough, cheery proprietor of the local pub, Ingrid Caven as a hard-luck hooker and Mr. Fassbinder as a smalltime crook. Wearing a loud pin-stripe suit and seeming to be 100 pounds heavier than usual, Mr. Fassbinder scowls through his scenes as if he thought of himself as a young Orson Welles.

us,Screen: Burt Reynolds Plays King Of Road in Motor Mayhem Tale,"WHENEVER the weather starts to turn warm and Americans begin to take to the roads and drive-ins again, the Hollywood assembly line disgorges another series of movies that employ cars as stars.In the case of the latest example, ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, the advertising and publicity would have it that the principal performers are Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jackie Gleason and Jerry Reed.But that is misleading. This is a movie for audiences capable of slavering over a Pontiac Trans Am, 18-wheel tractor-trailer rigs, dismembered police cruisers and motorcycles. It is also for moviegoers likely to use one hand to pound arm rests with sheer zest of a race against time involving 400 cases of Coors beer and the other hand to smite thighs with glee at what happens when a couple of good old boys and a passel of pursuing redneck sheriffs and state troopers match alleged wits.And just in the event that there is somebody out there incapable of recognizing the difference between a 6.6 liter Trans Am and a Hudson Terraplane or a new Peterbilt rig and a decrepit Reo truck, there is sufficient use of C.B. radios to let everyone know that while ""Smokey and the Bandit"" may not be a very original motor-mayhem movie, it is at least a new one.Mr. Reynolds, playing Bandit, a driver of legendary skill, takes on an $80,000 bet that requires him to race 1,800 miles from Georgia to Texas and back in a span of 28 hours, returning with the aforementioned beer. Bandit commandeers his friend Cledus (Jerry Reed) to drive his rig while he takes the wheel of the Trans Am to act as the blocker, or diversionary force, when Smokeythe lawturns up.All proceeds smoothly until the homebound trip, when Bandit picks up a runaway bride-to-be (Sally Field), touching off interstate pursuit by her prospective father-in-law, an outraged Texas sheriff named Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), who is accompanied by the bridegroom-to-be, his hulking nincompoop of a son (Mike Henry).With Mr. Reynolds playing it cool and Mr. Gleason doing his burns and investing the film with a certain raunchy humor, the rest is up to the vehicles. And they don't do anything that hasn't been seen before.The movie carries a PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") rating. Despite its regional settings and characters, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" abounds with scatology, profanity and obscenity neither uncommon to the streets of New York nor unknown to most of its inhabitants from the age of 2 onward, or unspoken by most of them at one time or another.",1977-05-20T05:00:00+0000

This puts them closer to characters in a novel than to orthodox sculptures, which must make their impact by stance and gesture aione. Miss Anthony operates at both extremes of our human span. She is good with very old men, and she is good with girls who have yet to come to terms with life. She is good at how people look when they are all by themselves, and she is also good (see The Trustees and Parlor Maids, the Secret) at how they look when they are hatching some kind of plot together.

us,Ali's Latest Victory Is 'The Greatest',"""The Greatest,"" the screen biography of Muhammad Ali, a.k.a. Cassius Clay, is a charming curio of a sort Hollywood doesn't seem to make much any more. It's a movie about a real-life personality who plays himself in reconstructions of those events that brought him to success's pinnacle, which, in turn, prompted movie producers to want to make this movie about him.As serious fiction, it's product merchandising such as T-shirts, bumper stickers and personality posters. Yet once you get beyond the embarrassingly simple-minded introductory sequences, ""The Greatest"" is winning entertainment. I suspect this is because Muhammad Ali, unlike Audie Murphy (""Beyond Glory"") and Douglas (Wrong Way) Corrigan (""The Flying Irishman""), to name two others who replayed their lives in film, has spent the last 15 or 20 years shaping a public personality big enough to fill a movie screen. ""The Greatest,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters, glosses over a lot of rocky material and smoothes the rough edges of one of the most fascinating careers in boxing history, but this, too, is the way of such movies. One of the pleasures of ""The Greatest"" is in not getting bogged down in details not easily explained by a piety.The film, written by Ring Lardner Jr. and directed by Tom Gries (who died shortly after the completion of producton), is old-fashioned, upbeat movie-making with a marvelous personality at its center. You might call Muhammad Ali a natural actor, but that would be to deny his wit, sensibility, drive, ability, enthusiasm, poise and common sense, all of which are the conscious achievements of an ambitious man who has known exactly what he has wanted for a long time.Part of the fun of watching ""The Greatest"" is in being in on another Ali victory, and in being aware that he himself has such a clear perspective of what he has been up to in defining his career as much through public relations as determination, belief and talent. The film itself is an extension of that public-relations sense. It opens with the young Cassius Claynicely played by Phillip (Chip) McAllister  returning home to Louisville from Rome with an Olympic medal to face obligatory discrimination, thus to acquire the inspiration to go on to his success as a professional fighter.At the point he turns pro, Muhammad Ali takes over his own role in what amounts to a rsum of the published facts of his lifehis friendship with Malcolm X and conversion to the Muslim religion, his successes in the ring and then ostracism after he refused induction into the Army, followed by his victory before the Supreme Court and his victory over George Foreman in the title fight in Zaire.The fight sequences (actual footage) are cannily placed within the film to build to the climatic bout with Foreman. The facts of the champ's private life are treated much in the manner of a ""Dick and Jane"" story, but so ingenuously that it's difficult to complain about the disappearance of Malcolm X (James Earl Jones) without comment halfway through the movie, or about the apparent elimination of one entire first marriage.I say apparent because I don't know that much about the champ's love life. I wouldn't have realized that Annazette Chase, who plays the Muslim girl he marries in the film, was not his first wife without having read the program notes in which her role is described as that of ""Ali's controversial second wife, Belinda."" Why she is controversial is not explained by the film. Could it be because she has since been replaced?The huge supporting cast includes a lot of fine actors doing little more than bits, though Robert Duvall stands out as one of Ali's earlier backers and Roger E. Mosley is very funny as Sonny Liston in the film's most uproarious sequence when Ali sets out to insult the humorless Liston into a title bout. Ernest Borgnine and John Marley are staunch as, respectively, the champ's trainer, Angelo Dundee, and his doctor, Ferdie Pacheco.""The Greatest,"" though, is entirely Muhammad Ali's. His presence dominates the screen and turns a rather ordinary, one-in-a-million success story into a first-rate piece of popular Americana.""The Greatest,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), includes some vulgar language, but is otherwise as nicely mannered as a high-school play.",1977-05-21T05:00:00+0000

My grandparents moved just about every other fall, going from one farm to another almost as often as we moved from house to house in town. My father's father was a sharecropper. He would contract with a landowner to farm on shares, fiftyfifty, by the year. When his disappointing crop was gathered, they would pack their few belongings in the wagon and hitch the team to it and move a few miles, always in a radius around the tiny settlement of Lone Star, to another place which, next fall, would prove just as unyielding. To the end, going blind with cataracts and feeling his way with his feet in the furrows, my grandfather clung to his dream of gathering a good enough crop for a couple of years in succession to make a down payment on a place of his own and work for himself. Instead, the gathering of his crop and its sale, the one time of the year when he held cash money in his hand, often left him in debt to the owner of the crossroads store for what he had advanced them to keep alive on.",1977-05-22T05:00:00+0000

The reason: On today's jet plpnes the weight of the cargo is less of a problem than the space it occupies. The effect of the new regulations, international airline officials estimate, will be to increase the amount of belongings a passenger can take along free by about 10 percent. Some countries, however, including the South American nations and Mexico, will continue to apply the weight system: 44 pounds per person in economy class and 66 pounds in first class.",1977-05-22T05:00:00+0000

us,New Italian Film 'We All Loved...' Paced by Outrage and High Spirits,"""We All Loved Each Other So Much"" is the forgettably awkward title of Ettore Scola's wise, reflective Italian comedy that examines 30 years of recent Italian social history in terms of the friendship of three men and the one woman each man has loved at one time or another. It's the sort of thing for which European film makers, especially Italian, have a special feeling, while Americans have none whatsoever, if only because American producers are made uneasy by movies that are about friendship and that attempt to cover so much time.""We All Loved Each Other So Much,"" which opened yesterday at the Beekman, is full of fondness, rue, outrage and high spirits. It is alsosurprising for an Italian filmpacked with the kind of movie references that French filmmakers like, and it is dedicated to the late Vittorio DeSica, whose ""Bicycle Thief"" plays a prominent part in the picture.The three men, who have become friends as leftist partisans near the end of the Nazi occupation of Italy, are Giovanni, a lawyer (Vittorio Gassman). Antonio (Nino Manfredi), who begins his postwar career as a hospital orderly (and remains one for the rest of his life, and Nico (Stefano Satta Flores), a politically committed movie nut who doesn't hesitate to abandon his wife and child to go off to Rome after a disagreement over the merits of ""The Bicycle Thief.""The woman who moves in and out of their lives is Luciana (Stefania Sandrelli), an aspiring actress, the high point of whose career (and one of the high points of the film) comes when she is cast as an extra in ""La Dolce Vita."" The scene that Mr. Scola recreates is the preparation for Anita Ekberg's walk through the Trevi fountain, complete with Marcello Mastrcianni actually sitting on the sidelines as Federico Fellini directs (and receives a tribute from a policeman who says, ""I've always admired your films, Mr. Rossellini"").The film's principal storyline has to do with the decline and fall of the lawyer, Giovanni, into successful opportunism, a role that Mr. Gassman has played before, but which he does with immense gallantry and humor as he goes from youth to middle-age. Also extremely good are Aldo Fabrizi, as the crooked industrialist who becomes Giovanni's father-in-law, and Giovanna Ralli as the fat, bird-brained rich girl whom Giovanni marries and transforms into a chic, bored woman who comes to identify herselffatallywith the women in Antonioni movies.Mr. Scola, who has been represented here both as a writer (""Il Sorpasso"") and director (""Made in Italy,"" ""The Pizza Triangle,"" among others), employs a comic style that is effective for being loose, allowing him to introduce real people as themselves, to parody ""Strange Interlude's"" spoken interior thoughts, to go from slapstick to satire and then to drama of genuine feelings.At its best, the film combines a number of different emotions at once, as when the film-obsessed Nico attempts to teach Luciana the fundamentals of Sergei Eisenstein's theory of montage on Rome's Spanish Steps, all the while seducing her.Though the film is very funny at moments, the dominant mood is a sense of loss, but even here the film makes its point in a backhanded way. ""We wanted to change the world, but the world changed us,"" says Antonio, the aging hospital orderly. Yet Mr. Scola recognizes this as the windy clich of someone given to self-dramatization. After 30 years the three friends are more worn, more tired, more experienced than they were as young men, but neither the world nor time has changed them in any essential ways. That's the bitter truth.",1977-05-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Animals on the Rampage,"DAY OF THE ANIMALS,"" which opened yesterday at Loews State II, the UA East Side and RKO 86th Street Twin I theaters, is ""The Birds"" recycled by an equal-opportunity employer with an eye more on shock than suspense.So when the participants in a trek of fools into the Western high country come under attack, they have more than talons and beaks to fear. Wolves, mountain lions, bears and packs of dogs are stalking and savaging them, as well as the birds; and in more civilized areas, rats run amok and poisonous snakes slither in sinuous multitudes in abandoned cars and trucks.Why all this unseemly behavior? Well, ""Day of the Animals"" is a movie speculating about what could happen if the ozone layer protecting the earth were diminished because of mankind's use of aerosol sprays. And it decides that this would give rise to a mutant virus that would turn animals into mankillers.Naturally, we are told, this phenomenon would manifest itself initially in the high country, where Steve Buckner (Christopher George) and Daniel Santee (Michael Ansara) are leading a no-weapons, no-food wilderness tour. Among the participants are a megalomaniacal advertising executive, a television newswoman, a science professor, a divorced mother and her son, a football player dying of cancer and a couple trying to patch up their marriage.""Day of the Animals"" offers pretty scenery, and some repulsive animal attacks. Despite its putative concern for the environment, it is calculated more to incite terror than to inspire restraint.This film has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). Animal and human savagery, the latter in the form of an attempted rape, are apparently the reasons.",1977-05-26T05:00:00+0000

us,'Star Wars' A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny.,"""STAR WARS,"" George Lucas's first film since his terrifically successful ""American Grafiti,"" is the movie that the teen-agers in ""American Graffiti"" would have broken their necks to see. It's also the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure.""Star Wars,"" which opened yesterday at the Astor Plaza, Orpheum and other theaters, is the most elaborate, most expensive, most beautiful movie serial ever made. It's both an apotheosis of ""Flash Gordon"" serials and a witty critique that makes associations with a variety of literature that is nothing if not eclectic: ""Quo Vadis?"", ""Buck Rogers,"" ""Ivanhoe,"" ""Superman,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew,"" the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table.All of these works, of course, had earlier left their marks on the kind of science-fiction comic strips that Mr. Lucas, the writer as well as director of ""Star Wars,"" here remembers with affection of such cheerfulness that he avoids facetiousness. The way definitely not to approach ""Star Wars,"" though, is to expect a film of cosmic implications or to footnote it with so many references that one anticipates it as if it were a literary duty. It's fun and funny.The time, according to the opening credit card, is ""a long time ago"" and the setting ""a galaxy far far away,"" which gives Mr. Lucas and his associates total freedom to come up with their own landscapes, housing, vehicles, weapons, religion, politics  all of which are variations on the familiar.When the film opens, dark times have fallen upon the galactal empire once ruled, we are given to believe, from a kind of space-age Camelot. Against these evil tyrants there is, in progress, a rebellion led by a certain Princess Leia Organa, a pretty round-faced young woman of old-fashioned pluck who, before you can catch your breath, has been captured by the guardians of the empire. Their object is to retrieve some secret plans that can be the empire's undoing.That's about all the plot that anyone of voting age should be required to keep track of. The story of ""Star Wars"" could be written on the head of a pin and still leave room for the Bible. It is, rather, a breathless succession of escapes, pursuits, dangerous missions, unexpected encounters, with each one ending in some kind of defeat until the final one.These adventures involve, among others, an ever-optimistic young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who is innocent without being nave; Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a free-booting freelance, space-ship captain who goes where he can make the most money, and an old mystic named Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), one of the last of the Old Guard, a fellow in possession of what's called ""the force,"" a mixture of what appears to be ESP and early Christian faith.Accompanying these three as they set out to liberate the princess and restore justice to the empire are a pair of Laurel-and-Hardyish robots. The thin one, who looks like a sort of brass woodman, talks in the polished phrases of a valet (""I'm adroit but I'm not very knowledgeable""), while the squat one, shaped like a portable washing machine, who is the one with the knowledge, simply squeaks and blinks his lights. They are the year's best new comedy team.In opposition to these good guys are the imperial forces led by someone called the Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his executive assistant, Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse), a former student of Ben Kenobi who elected to leave heaven sometime before to join the evil ones.The true stars of ""Star Wars"" are John Barry, who was responsible for the production design, and the people who were responsible for the incredible special effectsspace ships, explosions of stars, space battles, hand-to-hand combat with what appear to be lethal neon swords. I have a particular fondness for the look of the interior of a gigantic satellite called the Death Star, a place full of the kind of waste space one finds today only in old Fifth Avenue mansions and public libraries.There's also a very funny sequence in a low-life bar on a remote planet, a frontierlike establishment where they serve customers who look like turtles, apes, pythons and various amalgams of same, but draw the line at robots. Says the bartender piously: ""We don't serve their kind here.""It's difficult to judge the performances in a film like this. I suspect that much of the time the actors had to perform with special effects that were later added in the laboratory. Yet everyone treats his material with the proper combination of solemnity and good humor that avoids condescension. One of Mr. Lucas's particular achievements is the manner in which he is able to recall the tackiness of the old comic strips and serials he loves without making a movie that is, itself, tacky. ""Star Wars"" is good enough to convince the most skeptical 8-year-old sci-fi buff, who is the toughest critic.""Star Wars,"" which has been rated PG ""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains a lot of explosive action, and not a bit of truly disturbing violence.",1977-05-26T05:00:00+0000

When the guests laugh, even his wife giggles.To the world at large Hirayama seems as flexible and resourceful as the nation that turned the military defeat of World War II into economic victory. At home, though, he's still a rigid 19th-century tyrant.""Equinox Flower,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, is about Hirayama's desperate attempts to thwart his liberated daughter, Setsuko (Ineko Arima), from making just the sort of love match that he has encouraged when the daughter was not his own. Hirayama at first refuses to allow any marriage at all. He resorts to comically transparent stratagems to find out the worst about the young man, who is revealed to be without blemish.When Hirayama's wife (Kinuyo Tanaka) points outvery delicatelythat her husband is not being consistent, he explodes that this has to do with parental love and, besides, inconsistencies are the way of the world. It's a witty scene and a very moving one.""Equinox Flower""a particularly inscrutable title even for this great Japanese directoris one of Ozu's least dark comedies, which is not to say that it's carefree, but, rather, that it's gentle and amused in the way that it acknowledges time's passage, the changing of values and the adjustments that must be made between generations.Hirayama is as charming a character as Ozu has ever given usintelligent, thoughtful, sensitive, impatient with pretense, practical, a good friend and a dutiful parent, and, when it comes to his own children, a total hypocrite. His defense of traditional values, which Ozu again and again saw in terms of the relations between fathers and daughters (""Late Spring,"" ""Autumn Afternoon,"" ""End of Summer""), is doomed from the start, yet there is in ""Equinox Flower"" less a sense of defeat than in any of the other films.""Equinox Flower"" is uncharacteristically buoyant, as in a crucial sequence when his daughter Setsuko's best friend tricks the father into giving his consent to Setsuko's marriage. The trick is farcical, though its implications are genuinely dramatic, creating the mixture of contradictory emotions that make Ozu's meticulously observed family dramas unique in film literature.The performers are flawless, including Chishu Ryu, the leading player in a number of other Ozu works who here plays a supporting role, that of Hirayama's best friend, a gentle man completely baffled when his own daughter moves out of her home to live with her lover. But even this father and daughter are reconciled by the end. Neither understands the other, yet there is acceptance, which is Ozu's way.One word about the print being shown at the Cinema Studio: ""Equinox Flower"" was Ozu's first color film, which makes the drearily purplish cast of this print so disappointing. Ozu used color with the same discipline that he devoted to all other aspects of filmmaking, though it's impossible to tell here.",1977-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Democratic politicians are chipping away at each other behind the scenes with much more vehemence than they used to dare. But the nation's Second City still worksor at least that part of it most visitors see. For as former Senator Paul Douglas often said, Chicago is a town with a Queen Anne Front and a Mary Anne Back. Along the 24 miles of Chicago's East Sidethe clean and wellkept shores of Lake Michiganthere remain some of the most appealing and eyecatching urban sections in the United States. But ten blocks west, Chicago becomes a smallscale, bluecollar city of modest two and fourfamily apartments, and beyond them are some of the nation's worst slums. It is a husky, vibrant community, and still poet Carl Sandburg's City of the Big Shoulders, the nation's Freight Handler, the Tool maker, Stacker of Wheat. (The grain dealers put on one of the liveliest shows in town every weekday from 9:30 A.M. to 1:15 P.M. at the Chicago Board of Trade. Trading can be watched free from the visitors gallery.) Except for a needless and foolhardy step into the slums, a traveler will find Chicago after dark safer than many large cities and certainly more alive, along its lakefront, than most of them.",1977-05-29T05:00:00+0000
