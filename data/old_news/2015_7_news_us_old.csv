(Encore) A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Craig Sheffer portrays the writer Norman Maclean as a quiet young man, and Brad Pitt (above right, with Mr. Sheffer) is Paul, his wilder, more magnetic brother in this adaptation of Mr. Macleans 1976 autobiographical story about the sons of a Presbyterian minister coming of age in Montana between Prohibition and the Great Depression  and finding expression for their emotions through fly-fishing. These are men for whom the physical is inseparably entwined with the spiritual, men for whom both aspects of life are best appreciated knee-deep in a rushing river on a glorious day, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times about this visually stunning film, for which Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for best cinematography. Between the novellas well-known first sentence (In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing) and its elegiac last line (I am haunted by waters), A River Runs Through It circled gracefully among the landmarks of Mr. Macleans early years without violating the distant perfection of those memories. It is easy to recognize Robert Redfords reverent film version of this beautifully spare novella as a labor of love, she added. The same thoughts embraced by Mr. Maclean  of family and history, of the unbridgeable distances between men, of a wild natural landscape as a pathway to spiritual grace  are ably reflected on the screen.",2015-07-01T05:00:05+0000

He said that while he wasnt in an open marriage, his wife knew how he felt, and they were negotiating some arrangement that might allow him to pursue his feelings if they were shared. I was attracted to him but made it clear that I wouldnt have an affair in secret and that I had no desire to cause a rift between him and his wife (whom I didnt know as well but liked). At one point we saw a movie together, and we continued talking at work; were adjunct professors at the same university. It quickly became clear that his wife took a far more traditional view of their marriage, and although I thought I was being fairly responsible, I was pilloried by his wife, by her friends and by a close friend of mine for encouraging his attraction. I was told that I had no girl code, that I was antifeminist, that you just dont do that to other women. Is a woman who has chosen not to marry really responsible for acting as a custodian of another womans marriage? My behavior may have been self-serving, thoughtless or any number of things, but I dont believe it was ethically objectionable, at least not on the grounds that were presented.

Judging by that metric, the Brooklyn Museum should be the coolest place on the planet for sneakerheads with The Rise of Sneaker Culture, which opens July 10 and runs through Oct. 4. The show will include not only rare examples of prized shoes, like the original Nike Air Force 1 (a pristine 1983 pair can command $1,500), but also more than a centurys worth of footwear that united the casual, the athletic and the artful in a way that has become ubiquitous worldwide. One of the oldest existing running shoes, from the 1860s, will be featured, along with 1920s Keds. But the shows main attraction will be examples of the shoes that meshed with hip-hop, the graffiti scene and basketball subculture beginning in the 1970s to lay what Mr. Garcia calls the foundation for all the madness.

Sanders, soloists; Douglas Kinney Frost, conductor; Harlem String Quartet(Cantaloupe Music)Mysticism and entertainment make strange bedfellows. But Mr. Langs chamber opera, based on a one-page story by Ambrose Pierce about a slave owner who vanishes into thin air while crossing a field in pre-Civil War Alabama, manages to combine pathos, satire and meditation to strangely addictive effect. Together with the librettist Mac Wellman, Mr. Lang mines the story for all its weird urgency and wonder. The music, performed by a fine roster of singers and actors against a now sparse, now seething instrumental accompaniment shows this composer at his most inventive. (Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim)FIAMMA DEL BELCANTODiana Damrau, soprano; Gianandrea Noseda, conductor; Orchestra Teatro Regio Torino(Erato)Ms. Damrau has made her mark in a range of Italian repertory, and has been impressive at the Metropolitan Opera in recent years in works including La Traviata and La Sonnambula. On this disc she has assembled some of her favorite Italian roles from the bel canto, verismo and Verdi repertory. The selections include roles that have become her trademarks, including Violetta from Traviata, as well as parts she has yet to perform on stage, like Nedda in Pagliacci. In all the arias, Ms. Damraus impeccable technique and emotional commitment yield alluring results.

As Nathaniel Popper points out in his new book, Digital Gold, which tracks the roller-coaster ride of the digital currency called Bitcoin, its not surprising that part of its appeal to its devotees is that it could enable the creation of that new world, a libertarian utopia. Bitcoins  which are created, or mined, via complex computer algorithms, and are stored in digital wallets  offer privacy: Although every transaction is recorded, the users are identified only by wallet IDs, which are difficult, if not impossible, to track back to their owners. Theoretically, Bitcoins also allow users to avoid any fees or meddling by a middleman like a bank, because buyers and sellers can deal directly with one another. At its grandest, Bitcoin promises freedom from the clunkiness of cash, from the dominance of central banks and from technology that allows us to be tracked, even by our own governments. On a more prosaic level, why shouldnt money be as vulnerable to technological disruption as, say, music?",2015-07-02T13:42:14+0000

And yet despite the inclusion of a few foundation-rattling standouts, even the best punk records ultimately leave the listener under the spell of undiminishing sameness. The same goes for Kerets collections. Not that Keret is completely to blame; his genre is the parable, and if it werent for the demands of the market, these stories would be individually packaged rather than bound in books. The best of Kerets stories, Surprise Egg, say, from his 2006 collection The Nimrod Flipout, explode with distortion. In the case of that particular story, theres also an actual explosion  a suicide bomb  and the storys power lies in the immediacy of its ending: a bomb-widowed husband dreams of the foot of his dead wife slowly stroking his face. Keret forgoes easy moralizing and refuses to politicize the personal or to offer an obvious message. When Keret, who is Israeli and writes in Hebrew, first appeared in English, he was hailed as a savior of short stories from the dour realism of Raymond Carver, and a liberator of Israeli fiction from the big-picture density of writers like David Grossman. His stories were unapologetically absurd and libidinous, and if they werent all winners, then at least there was something refreshing in Kerets imaginative conceits.",2015-07-02T13:43:50+0000

The book paints a fairly tawdry picture of Madisons years as Hugh Hefners girlfriend  or, more accurately, as the No.1 girlfriend in a volatile harem rife with infighting, sexual competition and petty jealousies over money and favors.

Hef has accused Madison of rewriting history, a claim she shrugged off in a recent interview with The Associated Press: He doesnt have any mental or emotional power over me anymore, she said. Hes somebody that I look back on as somebody who treated me really poorly, who I tried to convince myself was a great person but I dont think is.

That word summons this vision, says Cabanas editor in chief, Martina Mondadori. Not only big and grand rooms, but that corner, that detail, that object that makes a room feel unique and yet personal. Next week, fans of the publication will have the chance to bring its eclectic sensibility home when the magazine debuts its first-ever pop-up store at the entrance of the MiArt fair taking place in Milan during Salone del Mobile, and an online companion sale at 1stdibs.com. Mondadori hand-selected each of the antique and contemporary objects on offer, including gilded decorative panels by Tennant and Tennant (Stella Tennants design project with her sister Isabel); antique decanters similar to a set found at Marella Agnellis house in Marrakesh; and ikat cushions by Rifat Ozbek.

(Starz) GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) A motley crew of baddies, led by the armed professional scavenger Peter Quill (Chris Pratt, above), joins forces to stop a crazed warrior from taking over the universe in James Gunns interstellar western, based on the Marvel Comics characters. The cast includes Zoe Saldana as Gamora, a green, mean killing machine; Dave Bautista as the brute Drax; Glenn Close as a space-age Hillary Rodham Clinton; Bradley Cooper as the voice of the raccoon Rocket; and Vin Diesel as a gorgeous tree called Groot, who nibbles his own tender sprouts. Oh, yes  and a blue orb that has incited the mayhem in the first place. That theres a palpable directorial sensibility in Guardians of the Galaxy, along with other signs of genuine life, helps separate this latest Marvel cash grab from a lot of off-the-rack movie cartoons, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Here, a pulse, wit, beauty and a real sensibility have been slipped into the fray, alongside the clockwork guffaws, kabooms and splats. She added: The story may be confusing and generic by turns, but if you shake off the bonds of narrative coherency its liberating letting the weird words  Yondu, Necrocraft, Sakkaran  just slide right past you, much like the zigzagging, exploding 3-D spaceships.

If destruction of the Sardomene is really meant to goad Italy into declaring war, Germany could not have chosen anything better calculated to move Italian public opinion. Among the harrowing details of the sinking of this ship without notice, is the fact that two seamen were shot by the crew of the submarine as they were attempting to swim ashore.

An Information Ministry announcement said Col. Boumedienne would make an important address to the nation tomorrow  his first since the military coup. Tomorrow is the third anniversary of Algerias independence of France. It has been widely reported that he was engaged in talks with two of Mr. Ben Bellas political opponents, Ferhat Abbas and Rabah Bitat, to serve in the presidency to a figurehead capacity, leaving him free to run the government from his old post as defense minister. These talks apparently collapsed. Meanwhile the council banned all independence anniversary parades and mass meetings tomorrow, apparently to guard against any possible demonstrations in favor of Mr. Ben Bella.

Many went straight to their deaths, including about 870,000 Jews murdered on arrival and without registration at Auschwitz; others endured a slower annihilation, reduced to what Hannah Arendt called ghastly marionettes with human faces. Millions more were killed in other ways, but there were also survivors, and at the end of KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps, his monumental study of the SS camps, Nikolaus Wachsmann focuses on one. His name is Moritz Choinowski, a Polish-born Jew detained by the Gestapo in 1939 in the German town of Magdeburg. By the time of his liberation on April 29, 1945, Choinowski has survived Buchenwald, Auschwitz, a slowly growing German camp called Gross-Rosen and finally Dachau, as well as the nightmarish forms of transportation between them.

Many a promiscuous spouse has been allowed room to roam as long as his or her dalliances arent flaunted. I remember reading an interview with Magic Johnsons wife, Cookie, in this very newspaper in May 1996, five years after he was told he had been infected with H.I.V. When she came to Los Angeles to visit, he always respected me, she said. Its not that I thought he was a saint. But I didnt know what was happening, and I preferred it that way. If a marriage is sufficiently loving (as the Johnsons apparently still is) or satisfying or economically advantageous, maybe it isnt worth blowing up if the person being betrayed is given the opportunity to turn a blind eye.",2015-07-07T09:00:18+0000

us,What Are the Limits of Religious Liberty?,"I cant. Its against my religion. Americans tend to handle religious objections with care, personally and politically. When a guest says, for example, that he cant eat the food being served because its not kosher or halal, the host usually hastens to find an alternative. And when people resist following a law on the basis of faith, the government and the courts may try to accommodate them. Its an American legacy that dates back to before the founding, when some of the original colonies were set up as havens for religious dissenters. Under the banner of belief, Quakers and Mennonites in the 18th century won the right not to join state militias. The first conscientious objectors were religious objectors, and from there, the category expanded to include moral opponents of war. The same pattern holds for home-schoolers. It was an Amish father, not a hippie mother, who first got the Supreme Courts permission to take his children out of school in 1972, based on his religious commitment to life aloof from the world, as the justices respectfully put it.",2015-07-07T11:00:05+0000

In 1926, he won the United States National Championship wearing the same shirt but with its sleeves cut short: a daring evolutionary step toward an archetype of sportswear. In 1933, Lacoste went into business with a knitwear manufacturer to mass-produce la chemise Lacoste, a short-sleeved pullover with a turndown collar, three buttons on its placket and a breathable piqu-cotton body. Ads extolled its suitability not just for le tennis and le golf but also for la plage (the beach): not just for athletic exertion but for general leisure.

That complex and compelling opera was finally given its premiere in Santa Fe in 2010. This recording offers his 2012 vespers cantata, Hesperus Is Phosphorus, performed by the Philadelphia forces that commissioned it: the Crossing, the superb contemporary-music vocal ensemble, and Network for New Music. The title plays on the belief of the early Greeks that Phosphorus was the morning star, and Hesperus the evening one, before they realized that the two were one celestial body, Venus. The inventive text draws together writings by David Eagleman, Wallace Stevens, Richard Feynman, Wallace Shawn and others. Mr. Spratlans pungently modern language comes through continually in this intricate 65-minute score. Still, he sets words for clarity, often in long stretches of spiky block chords.

(Americans get all finicky when it comes to the graphic nature of my erotic scenes, she has said. They prefer to leave a lot of it up to the imagination: more Barbie doll sexlessness, less Anas Nin eroticism.) But with The Little Paris Bookshop, new at No. 16 on the hardcover fiction list, George has her first bona fide international hit, the tale of a lovelorn bookseller who peddles his wares from a barge on the Seine and sees his calling as one part matchmaker, one part witch doctor. There are books that are suitable for a million people, others for only a hundred, he explains. There are even remedies  I mean books  that were written for one person only. The novels success has introduced George, happily, to the world of international publishing, as she describes at some length on her website: The captains and navigators in publishing are women! From agents to list managers, women negotiate with other women on everything from money and content to sales, she writes. The agents and publishers always sign their first names to their emails: Vanessa, Cecile, Mirjam. From New York to Paris, they write: Best regards/Yours, Christine, Rowan, Anna, Hedda, Elise. They discuss money with the cold clarity of a glass of vodka. No dancing around the issue as is so often the case in Germany. Whats even more cathartic, though, is the praise Ive received from Cecile, Rowan, Anna, Hedda and Christine. No praise for my work has ever been as profuse and sincere as the compliments Ive received from these foreign publishers in Paris, New York, Rome, Amsterdam and Riga. First they bought my book, then they wrote me long letters explaining what they liked about it. I suspect the reluctance to compliment authors and their novels is a typically German phenomenon. What if it makes the author too expensive? Or if the accolades go to her head? Or if she becomes, somehow, too difficult to work with? Nonsense! Bring on the praise, my dear German book people!

Curtis Hanson and Michael Apted shared the directing duties on this film, based on a true story that begins in 1987 and is lent authenticity by the real surfers Greg Long, Peter Mel and Zach Wormhoudt. When the movie works, its buoyancy can be infectious and persuasive, particularly in the surfing scenes and in the mesmerizing shots of the heaving, churning ocean and waves, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The film, she added, invites you to gaze into this watery abyss, to ponder its mysteries as well as those of the swimmer whose image brackets the movie and evokes John F.

But this summer, Niele Toroni, a Swiss painter born in Muralto (the Italian-speaking border region nestled in the high peaks of Locarno), lands at the Swiss Institute for his first-ever solo institutional show in New York. At 78, Toroni has formed an everlasting bond to repetition, and abides by a pact he made in 1967 proclaiming autonomy, or painting free of representation. His Travail-Peinture method never wavers: He makes strokes with a number 50 paintbrush at 30-centimeter intervals. Toroni is a marquee name in the French minimalist BMPT group (Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Michel Parmentier, Toroni), and his faithfulness to conceptualism is particularly Zen. The painter, who has resided in Paris since 1959, is often asked why he is doing the same thing, explains Clment Delpine, the assistant curator of Swiss Institute, in a video premiering exclusively here at T. You have to understand that in his mind hes not doing the same thing. It varies in shape, width, varies depending the pressure.

Here, old-school stalwarts mingle with artsy young people, helping to create a city that serves as a canvas for the kind of urban dreams that more crowded and expensive cities cant foster.

The phlegmatic Dutchman, who takes his time making up his mind and who thought everything would continue normal despite the presence of German troops, is slowly coming to the conclusion that German protection of his neutrality is not exactly a blessing. There were immediate repercussions of this spontaneous outburst of anti-German feeling. Although the defenseless Dutch knew better than to actively oppose German occupation, they have shown a decidedly menacing attitude toward members of the local Nazi organization.

As the book writer and charismatic original Off Broadway star, he created something that seemed distinctly his. That the role of Hedwig, the German transgender rock singer, has been capably filled and even reinvented, most smashingly by Neil Patrick Harris in the current Broadway production, takes nothing away from Mr. Mitchell. If anything, it means hes created a prime musical theater showcase for any man or woman (Ally Sheedy once played the part) willing to strut, pose and belt while wearing fishnet stockings. Replacing Darren Criss, who kicked up a bit of controversy improvising and then apologizing for a joke about Bruce Jenner, the latest performer is Taye Diggs, the first African-American to play the role in New York. Mr. Diggs  who starred in the original Rent and filled in earlier on long-running Broadway hits, including Wicked and Chicago  has charm to burn, the kind that has lit up many movie scenes.

Meanwhile, a real-life spy story has climbed onto the hardcover nonfiction list: The Billion Dollar Spy, by the journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author David E. Hoffman, is new at No. 13. Hoffmans book traces the Cold War exploits of Adolf Tolkachev, a Soviet military engineer who for years passed secrets to the C.I.A.

And he did this for years. One way the book brings its subject to life, as Scott Shane noted in his review for The New York Timess daily Arts section, is through the detail that Tolkachev asked his American handlers to pass along rock n roll for his teenage son, including Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the Beatles. My son, as many of his contemporaries in school, has a passion for Western music, he explained in one letter. I too, in spite of my age, like to listen to this music.",2015-07-17T16:25:41+0000

The man, Anthony Lord, 35, faces murder and kidnapping charges. Mr. Lord is also suspected of starting a barn fire, stealing weapons and two vehicles, assaulting one person and leading officers on a chase. The authorities did not have a motive. Mr. Lord is a registered sex offender in Maine. The Bangor Daily News reported that he had been convicted of theft and domestic violence assault, among other charges. Lt. Sean Hashey of the Maine State Police said the sequence began Thursday night with a fire at a barn in Benedicta. Early Friday, a man was beaten in nearby Silver Ridge Township, and his truck and weapons were stolen. Later, Kyle Hewitt, 22, was shot dead and Kim Irish, 55, was wounded at the residence where the barn burned. Mr. Lord, the police said, left the scene with Ms. Irishs daughter, Brittany Irish, 22. Another man, Carlton Eddy, who drove by the scene, was shot in the shoulder. Police later received a call about a shooting at a woodlot in Lee, about 40 miles south of Benedicta. Kevin Tozier, 58, was killed and Clayton McCarthy, 54, was injured there. A truck was stolen from that scene, and officers searching for it found Mr. Lord and Ms. Irish at his relatives home in Houlton. ",2015-07-18T01:22:14+0000

Everybody remembers Artemus Wards story of the prisoner who one day had a happy thought  that of opening the window and walking out. Now that the Pope has had the happy thought of opening the gates of the Vatican and driving through the streets, the Cardinals who have insisted that he was a prisoner will not be pleased to have their legend so completely contradicted, for nothing could show more plainly that, for the present at least, their influence is no longer dominant.

us,Iraq: Toll Rises in Market Bombing," The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a bombing in eastern Iraq, and officials on Saturday said that the death toll had risen to 100 people, with 20 more missing. The bomb tore through a marketplace on Friday in Khan Bani Saad, above, a mostly Shiite town in Diyala Province. It also wounded at least 133 people, the police said, and destroyed several buildings. Government troops and Shiite militias months ago wrested back parts of the province from the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In a statement taking responsibility for the blast, ISIS, which has often singled out Shiites as targets, declared that the attack was revenge for what it called a massacre of Sunnis in the town of Hawija farther north. The statement may have been referring to an episode in March, during a battle that eventually drove ISIS from Tikrit. Residents of Hawija reported at the time that dozens of ISIS fighters had been killed by their commanders for trying to flee the battlefield. ISIS, which follows an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam, views Shiites as apostates and has often targeted Shiite civilians. Its statement declared that it used three tons of explosives to kill and injure more than 180 apostates. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said that ISIS was targeting civilians in revenge for recent government advances. ",2015-07-18T23:58:26+0000
us,China: 2 Relatives of a Tibetan Monk Who Died in Prison Have Been Arrested," The authorities in southwest China have reportedly detained two relatives of a prominent Tibetan monk whose unexplained death in prison set off protests that left dozens injured after it was announced on Monday. According to Students for a Free Tibet, an overseas advocacy group, the police on Friday detained the sister and niece of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, 65, a widely revered monk and community leader who was serving a life sentence on terrorism and separatism charges. Human rights advocates contend that the allegations against him were politically motivated. He died in a prison near Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, under circumstances that the authorities have yet to explain. On Thursday, prison officials, brushing aside the pleas of family members and supporters, cremated his body rather than allow them to carry out traditional Buddhist funeral rites. Witnesses say the relatives, Dolkar Lhamo, 52, and her daughter, Nyima Lhamo, 25, were detained in Chengdu on Friday, according to Padma Dolma, campaigns director for Students for a Free Tibet. Dolkar Lhamo and another sister were among nearly 100 Tibetans who staged a sit-in outside the building in Chengdu where Tenzin Delek was thought to have been imprisoned for the 13 years before he died.

Failure to pay the E.C.B. would have forced the bank to cut off emergency funding for Greek banks, causing them and the Greek economy to collapse. The debt payments represent a step back from the precipice of a eurozone exit for Greece, but the government led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras must cope this week with the political turmoil caused by his decision to accept unpleasant conditions set by eurozone creditors in return for financial aid.

In a statement, he said the correspondents Iranian lawyer, Leila Ahsan, had been told that after three hearings in Tehran over the past two months, the fourth was likely to be the last, although no date has been set. Mr. Rezaian faces up to 20 years in prison on charges that include espionage. He has asserted his innocence since his arrest last July 22, and Ms. Ahsan has said there is no evidence to support the charges. Mr. Baron, who has denounced the prosecution as ludicrous, said in the statement that it is long past time for the Iranian authorities to bring this process to an end. Mr. Rezaian is one of at least three Americans held in Iran, an issue that has become more pressing to their relatives and supporters since an international deal on the countrys disputed nuclear activities was reached last week, potentially easing the estranged relations between Washington and Tehran. Also on Monday, the Committee to Protect Journalists, a press advocacy group, published a letter  to Sadeq Larijani, the head of Irans judiciary, asking him to ensure that this case is resolved immediately.

The use of invalid addresses is an indicator of potential fraud, the investigators said in a report to Congress. The Medicare agency revised its screening procedures last year and weakened its internal controls, making it easier for some potentially ineligible providers and suppliers to qualify for Medicare payments, the report said. Medicare officials said they had revoked billing privileges for almost 28,000 providers and suppliers in the last few years. ",2015-07-22T02:05:36+0000

us,Inside the List,"Not O.K.: Ta-Nehisi Coatess new book, Between the World and Me  an incantatory essay about being black in America, framed as a letter to his teenage son  enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No.1. Like another recent best seller, Claudia Rankines Citizen, the book burns with moral intelligence about the daily humiliations and degradations confronting black people, and refuses the easy consolations of hope and uplift. Early on, Coates addresses his sons despair over the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Mo. I didnt comfort you, he writes, because I thought it would be wrong to comfort you. I did not tell you that it would be O.K., because I have never believed it would be O.K. What I told you is what your grandparents tried to tell me: that this is your country, that this is your world, that this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it. I tell you now that the question of how one should live within a black body, within a country lost in the Dream, is the question of my life, and the pursuit of this question, I have found, ultimately answers itself. (The dream at issue is of course the American dream, which Coates points out depends on a vision of innocence that willfully ignores the American sins of slavery and institutional racism.) Some commentators have taken Coates to task for emphasizing social and historical frameworks more than personal choice and responsibility, but a recent profile in New York magazine leaves no question where he stands on that debate. Coates noticed the good people on the wrong side of history, the reporter Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes, suggesting that individual virtue was a weak counterweight to the pathologies of states. Had he been alive and had means, he tweeted, I would have owned slaves too.",2015-07-24T15:53:17+0000

In April, about 300 American troops arrived in Ukraine to train Ukrainian national guard troops, who fall under the Interior Ministry. As that mission winds down, the new trainers will arrive to work with Defense Ministry troops near Ukraines border with Poland. The additional training brings the amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to $244 million, Mr. Toner said. ",2015-07-25T01:56:18+0000

Rosamund Pike is Jane, Elizabeths older sister and the belle of the ball. But because Ms. Knightley is, in a word, a knockout, the balance has shifted, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times. Her radiance so suffuses the film that its foolish to imagine Elizabeth would be anyones second choice.

What he did, he said of Trump, was he fired up the crazies. In the annals of political deprecation, McCains charge of rallying the crazies was not terribly inspired. It was a far cry from, say, Teddy Roosevelts remark that William McKinley has the backbone of a chocolate clair or Winston Churchills description of Clement Attlee, the British prime minister, as a sheep in sheeps clothing. This was not even a Top 5 effort by McCain, who will sometimes refer to reporters as Trotskyites (often with affection) and last year dismissed protesters who interrupted a Senate hearing as lowlife scum (without affection). McCain is not so much a put-down artist as he is gifted at caricaturing entire sectors and viewpoints by way of dismissing them  in this case the border hawks who turned out for Trump.",2015-07-27T08:59:10+0000

us,"The Complete Stories, by Clarice Lispector","Theres a whiff of madness in the fiction of Clarice Lispector. The Complete Stories of the great Brazilian writer, edited by Benjamin Moser and sensitively translated by Katrina Dodson, is a dangerous book to read quickly or casually because its so consistently delirious. Sentence by sentence, page by page, Lispector is exhilaratingly, arrestingly strange, but her perceptions come so fast, veer so wildly between the mundane and the metaphysical, that after a while you dont know where you are, either in the book or in the world. Coherence, I dont want it anymore, a character in one of her stories thinks. Coherence is mutilation. I want disorder. That character, a 37-year-old woman in melancholy flight from her husband or lover, has this revelation too: It was a lie to say you could only have one thought at a time: She had many thoughts that intersected and were multiple. Especially in the 1970s, in the last decade of Lispectors life, when that story (The Departure of the Train) and two of her best, most challenging novels  gua Viva and The Hour of the Star  were written, she was trying to get all her own intersecting, helplessly multiplying thoughts on the page. She failed, of course, but failed beautifully. Her willed disorder is heroic.",2015-07-27T09:00:04+0000

us,U.N. Council to Vote on Creating Tribunal On Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight," The United Nations Security Council scheduled a vote for Wednesday on a draft resolution that would create a tribunal to prosecute those found responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The jetliner carried 298 people, all of whom were killed. It is believed to have been destroyed by a surface-to-air missile fired from territory controlled by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia, which has expressed strong opposition to a prosecution tribunal, is widely expected to use its veto power as a permanent Security Council member to block the resolution, drafted by Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. Conflicts over how to hold those behind the disaster accountable have raised tensions between Russia and the Netherlands. Most of the Flight 17 victims were Dutch, and the Netherlands has been leading an international inquiry into the cause of the downing. ",2015-07-29T02:06:00+0000

(FX Movie Channel) HEREAFTER (2010) Clint Eastwood imagines what happens after people die by braiding together three stories, each involving a collision between the living and the dead. In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who receives messages from the deceased loved ones of anyone he touches, chooses a life of obscurity instead of exploiting his gift. In London, a boy feels the presence of his twin, whose death has left him adrift. (The brothers are played by George and Frankie McLaren.) And in Paris, Marie Lelay (Ccile de France), who nearly died in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, is convinced she has seen a metaphysical reality the world is determined to ignore. Persuasion is not really the point, though if anyone could make me believe in ghosts, it would be Clint Eastwood, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. What does seem new  newly strange, newly beautiful  is what Hereafter makes of the here and now. It is a curious movie in both senses of the word: an unusual experience and an open-ended inquiry into something nobody can really claim to understand.

Multiple teenagers parked their cars in the alley, which is expressly forbidden by posted signs, and engaged in underage drinking. The mother was approached and essentially told us that we should talk to her child because she has been ineffective. This summer, although the cars are no longer in the alleyway, the partying has resumed: Our trash can was filled with beer cans this morning so that the parent would not be aware. I think this is an accident waiting to happen. The police have taken reports, but the behavior is unchanged. What would you do?

The exhibition convenes more than 50 ancient bronzes from the Mediterranean region dating from the fourth century B.C. to the first century A.D.

Wilders delicate, profound work follows the story of an American family over 90 years through periodic visits to Christmas dinners at the household table. Wilder, an astute music lover, readily adapted his play into a libretto for Hindemith, cutting the text considerably and providing some new rhymed lyrics for extended vocal pieces. Though well received, Hindemiths opera, completed in 1961, has become a rarity. The conductor Leon Botstein came to the rescue in 2014 when he conducted a fine cast and the American Symphony Orchestra in a beguiling staged production at Alice Tully Hall. (This fascinating program preceded the opera with a performance of the Wilder play by a strong cast of actors, using the same set.) Bridge Records has now released a live recording of the performance. We hear the highs and lows of the Bayard family discussed over Christmas dinners, starting from the first at the familys new house, when the matriarchal Mother Bayard beams as her son, who runs the family firm, slices turkey alongside his cheerful wife. Cousins come and go; children are born and have children of their own; one son dies in war; a child dies in infancy; an unmarried cousin comes to live; social mores and customs change. Its a special opera, and this performance sounds as good as I remembered it to be. (Anthony Tommasini)",2015-07-29T20:30:49+0000

Pimps fighting with drug dealers and johns. Man has gun. Hurry. The message came from a neighbor 10 blocks away, on St. Louis Street, and was sent through a venture Torres started four days earlier: a private police patrol that could be summoned via mobile app. Torres, who made a vast fortune as the founder of SDT Waste & Debris Services, a sanitation company that cleaned up much of New Orleans in the years following Hurricane Katrina, spent $380,000 to fund the enterprise after a crime wave put Quarter residents on edge for the better part of a year. Between November and January, there were more than 60 robberies in the neighborhood, and the crimes became increasingly brazen, including a vicious stabbing and a spate of random beatings. It became a personal issue for Torres on Dec. 17, when his 8,000-square-foot home was burglarized; three weeks later, the bar next door was held up by two masked gunmen. Torress crowdsourcing approach to crime, conceived throughout February and March, was the impulsive byproduct of his belief that the New Orleans Police Department, which has shrunk by around 500 officers since Hurricane Katrina, was no longer able to protect even the neighborhood less than a square mile in size that contained the citys most valuable real estate.",2015-07-30T10:59:18+0000

Back in those days, the two leading networks covered the conventions live from beginning to end. (Can you imagine?) Instead of comprehensiveness, ABC went for provocation and at least the illusion of intellectual heft, hiring Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr. to conduct a series of debates during the Republican circus in Miami and the subsequent Democratic debacle in Chicago. Best of Enemies, Robert Gordon and Morgan Nevilles lively new documentary, an accessible assemblage of archival footage and talking-head analysis, mines the Buckley-Vidal skirmishes for nuggets of historical insight.",2015-07-31T00:22:05+0000

Mark Ruffalo plays Marks brother, Dave, himself a gifted wrestler, who is disinclined to join the crusade. Vanessa Redgrave is Johns disapproving mother, who finds the sport beneath the familys station. Beautifully acted and impeccably mounted, it is light on historical details and heavy on atmosphere, character and chintz, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama, which earned Oscar nominations for Mr. Carell, Mr. Ruffalo and Mr. Miller; its screenwriters, E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman; and Bill Corso and Dennis Liddiard, the men behind Mr. Carells large prosthetic nose. Some of the best scenes in the movie are of the brothers, including an early one in which they train in their old gym, hitting and grasping in a pantomime of aggression and affection, the crowns of their heads touching like the antlers of young stags testing each other, Mr. Scott added. Its rare to see such physical male intimacy on screen, especially among men not bonded by war. And its in the depictions of this intimacy, in its tangle of bodies and desires  the images of John squirming on top of and below other men say more than any of his pitiful speeches  that Foxcatcher rises to the occasion of real tragedy.",2015-07-31T05:00:03+0000

us,Inside the List,"The Waves: As a war reporter and international correspondent for The New Yorker, William Finnegan has long been celebrated for his sober examinations of the worlds hot spots  going back to 1986, all of his books have been editors choice picks in the Book Review, including dispatches from apartheid-era South Africa, civil-war-torn Mozambique and poverty-stricken America. None of those books became best sellers. But his latest, the surfing memoir Barbarian Days, ends Finnegans dry spell at last, landing on the hardcover nonfiction list at No.5. I was kind of nervous about coming out of the closet as a surfer, Finnegan told The National Post in Canada last month. I mean, I was a political reporter and writing a lot of political opinion pieces for The New Yorker, and I had a kind of reluctance to expose this part of my life and have a bunch of people say, What do you know? Youre just a dumb surfer. Once he started, though, he couldnt stop. Its easy for me to write about the act of surfing. I find it endlessly interesting, he said. The trick is to make it interesting to readers who couldnt care less. This columnist might be the kind of reader he means  Im not a surfer, dumb or otherwise, although friends in California once coaxed me onto a board for 20 seconds. But I do kayak, and I recognize the giddy obsession Finnegan brings to his sport. In that sense, Barbarian Days offers the same heedless pleasure as any addiction memoir before the reckoning; it is, as Alice Gregory writes in The New York Review of Books, an utterly convincing study in the joy of treating seriously an unserious thing.",2015-07-31T15:19:55+0000

His friends were desirous, he said, of paying to him in his lifetime the honors due for the dead. The Prince declared that he was becoming reconciled to his lot. Everything had been carried out with such attention to legal form that he could not dream of protesting. He took a keen pleasure in his present life as a country nobleman. Harking back to the subject of Socialism, the Prince declared that in his opinion a bloody cataclysm was impending in Germany in the near future and that the later repressive measures were undertaken the bloodier would be its solution.

The crew got into the ships boats and rowed about for several hours before being rescued by a British steamer. Two of the crew died on board the rescuing steamer. The Iberian had a gross tonnage of 5,223, and was built at Sunderland in 1900. Only a month ago the Armenian of the same line was torpedoed and sunk off the Scillies. She, too, was shelled as a preliminary, and a number of men were killed, among them being sixteen Americans. Six more Lowestoft trawlers, the Coriander, Fitzgerald, Quest, Athena, Achieve and Strive were torpedoed and sunk by submarines to-day. Nearly all of the crew were saved.
