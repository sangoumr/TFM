Jackson led Ohio State (11-0) with 20 points, and Treg Lee had 12 and Brown added 11. Iowa (11-2), which had won 10 games in a row, was led by Acie Earl and James Moses with 16 points each. (AP) Michigan State 85, Michigan 70: Steve Smith scored 24 points and Matt Steigenga added 20 as the No. 25 Spartans opened defense of their Big Ten championship. It was the third consecutive game in which Smith and Steigenga have both scored 20 or more for Michigan State (8-3 over all, 1-0 in the Big Ten). The victory was No. 250 at Michigan State for Jud Heathcote who is 250-173 in his 15 years as coach of the Spartans. (AP) North Carolina 108, Cornell 64: Rick Fox scored 19 points as the No. 7 Tar Heels (10-1) jumped to a quick lead on Cornell with its 3-point shooting, then used its quickness and size advantage to score a lopsided victory. The Tar Heels (10-1), who won their 10th game in a row, played at Cornell (6-3) because it is Coach Dean Smith's custom to set up homecoming-type games for his seniors. This game was played for the benefit of the senior point guard King Rice, who played high school basketball in Binghamton, 30 miles southeast of Ithaca. (AP) TENNIS Courier Advances in Australia Jim Courier of the United States kept cool in sweltering conditions yesterday to beat Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands in the second round of the Australian hardcourt championship in Adelaide.

The unseeded Savchenko earned a quarterfinal meeting with fifth-seeded Sabine Appelmans of Belgium, who beat Shaun Stafford of the United States, 6-4, 6-3. (AP) Yugoslavia Defeats United States: Yugoslavia swept both singles matches against the United States yesterday to win the Hopman Cup team competition in Perth, Australia. Monica Seles started with a 6-1, 6-1 romp over Zina Garrison, and Goran Prpic beat David Wheaton, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, making the score 2-0 with only the mixed doubles remaining. (AP) N.H.L. Hull Lifts Blues Brett Hull scored his league-leading 39th goal in 40 games on a deflection with six minutes left as St. Louis defeated the Quebec Nordiques, 8-7, at home to end a losing streak at three games. (AP) North Stars 3, Maple Leafs 3: Doug Shedden, whose tripping penalty led to Minnesota's go-ahead goal early in the third period, tipped in Dave Reid's shot with 4:20 left to force a tie. (AP) Bruins 8, Canucks 3: Ken Hodge stole the puck at the Boston blue line and skated in alone for a short-handed goal that broke a 3-3 tie. The Canucks have a 3-34-3 record at Boston Garden.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BRADOVICH. By William Herrick. (New Directions, $18.95.) In many ways, William Herrick's 10th novel conforms to the Pop Fiction Code. Stephen Bradovich, a craggy, widowed football player turned sculptor, lives in a city that purports to be New York but feels, with its cozy neighborliness and broad boulevards, like a dream. Here the hero is pursued by a supernaturally effective enemy called ""The Authority."" But instead of being the homage to Franz Kafka that the author clearly intended, the novel equally suggests Judith Krantz, featuring the sort of writing in which meals are described to the last crumb, yet logic evaporates at will. (Thwarted when he tries to book his escape at a travel agency or by phone, our hero never thinks simply to get in a bus, train or taxi, to rent a car or take himself directly to an airport.) Although it's a suspense novel, ""Bradovich"" is not intended to be commercial fiction; its dropped names are not those of brands beloved by Best-Selling Authors but those adored in our universities. And Mr. Herrick's pages are peppered with philosophizing about Life's Meaning and paeans to Great Art. So the really scary thing about this book is not the depredations capriciously wreaked by ""The Authority,"" not the whipping, incest, bestiality, rape, mutilation and kinky sex that keep popping up, not death and its injustice, but rather the fact that New Directions, a house renowned for publishing writers like Jorge Luis Borges, Delmore Schwartz, Kay Boyle, Tennessee Williams and Jean Cocteau, is now offering thinking readers novels as meretricious as this one.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

Sixteen years after Marie Luise Kaschnitz's death at the age of 73, the fiction of this prolific German poet, novelist and essayist is beginning to be more widely available in English. ""Circe's Mountain"" contains a dozen short stories chosen by their competent translator, Lisel Mueller, to reflect the writer's versatility. Several are set in Italy, where Kaschnitz lived for many years, while the others are rooted in the Germany of World War II and the succeeding decades. Some are brief mood pieces, as piercing and insubstantial as a stranger's gaze, while others deal in the fantastic or tell conventional stories, albeit always allusively. Two stories, including the title one, are explicitly autobiographical widow's tales. In ""The Landslide,"" a German couple, for no particular reason, postpone signing a long-term rental contract for an Italian villa that is fated to be demolished by a landslide. In ""X Day,"" a German mother describes her vision of the day -- an ordinary day like any other -- when the world will finally be annihilated. In ""Lupines,"" a timid young Jewish woman escapes from a Nazi deportation train, leaving behind her suddenly passive older sister. Although she finds a safe hiding place with the Aryan brother-in-law she loves, his resentment and her guilt ultimately drive her to suicide. In these stories, life is inevitably banal, unavoidably terrifying. One placid day succeeds another, but this placidity is misleading. Either the worst has already happened but is unacknowledged, chillingly engulfed by the daily rounds, or the worst is yet to come. Kaschnitz' voice is bleak, insistent and filled with integrity.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

Kern: 'Sitting Pretty'","Judy Blazer, Paige O'Hara, Roberta Peters, Davis Gaines, Jason Graae and Merwin Goldsmith; Princess Theater Ensemble conducted by John McGlinn.

One might sooner have expected new recordings of Jerome Kern's later experimental musicals like ""Music in the Air"" and ""The Cat and the Fiddle"" (and such recordings are still urgently needed), but this highly successful presentation of a 1924 show is welcome nonetheless. While the plot is standard stuff (mismatched couples, a lost inheritance), the musical style is somewhat unexpected: Kern repeatedly stresses a wistful strain of yearning in his remarkably delicate score -- so subdued that its orchestra's rhythmic propulsion comes not from piano or drums, but from harp. John McGlinn and his expert orchestra and chorus bring its distinctive atmosphere persuasively to life.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"WATER BABY: The Story of Alvin. By Victoria A. Kaharl. (Oxford University, $21.95.) This is a fascinating history of Alvin, the world's first deep-diving submarine. The three-person craft, which opened the ocean depths to exploration in the mid-1960's, has shown scientists strange and previously unknown worlds and in the process helped alter our understanding of planet Earth. ""Water Baby,"" by the science writer Victoria A. Kaharl, is, however, much more than a story about a titanium sphere with a curious name. It is also about the men and women who, during dives so deep it takes hours to surface, must trust that Alvin will protect them from thousands of pounds of pressure on each square inch of the hull. There is heroism as well as humor: stories of pilots jockeying the craft free from fissures more than 8,000 feet down, for example, and a running account of the motley crew of Alvin's mother ship, including a man nicknamed Bare Bear who slept in his bunk with a teddy bear. The best parts of ""Water Baby"" are the vivid descriptions of trips to the sea floor. Early in its career, Alvin had shown scientists that the deep ocean was not barren, as had been believed, but was teeming with life. However, even veterans of deep diving were surprised at the lushness of marine oases at the bottom of the Pacific, which they viewed in the mid-70's, courtesy of Alvin. ""Water Baby"" does bog down in places, but the information overkill is clearly the result of the author's extensive research and love for the subject. In the end, Ms. Kaharl's enthusiasm proves to be irresistible.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

Set in postpunk Los Angeles in 1985, ""Life After Death"" introduces us to a dozen or two young ""scenesters,"" disaffected types with names like Cruella, Vex, Honor, Zelda and Nestor, who hang out in seedy clubs, fall easily into bed with one another and fall just as easily in love -- for whatever that's worth. (""You know I love you more than life,"" says one of the characters to his girlfriend. ""Big deal!"" she replies. ""A whole lot that means!"") The multitudinous characters in this collection of interconnected stories are differentiated only by the color they dye their hair (black, magenta or platinum), their drug of choice (heroin, alcohol, caffeine) and the movie or rock star with whom they're obsessed (Marilyn Monroe, David Bowie or, as no fewer than 10 of them are, Sid Vicious). None of the scenesters are wealthy, few have jobs, and yet somehow most of them manage to pick up and fly to London on the spur of the moment for ""All Sids Day, the anniversary of the punk-rocker's everything but deliberate suicide."" Even if their lives have no meaning, their attempts at self-examination only go about as far as that of Sharlott, who ""often feels things as a result of something else, something indirect, like a shadow."" Unlike other chroniclers of seamy underbellies -- William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski, for instance -- Susan Compo hasn't succeeded in using language to pull her fiction up out of mere banality. Instead of evoking Los Angeles in a way that might resonate thematically, she often resorts to standard shorthand descriptions. Ms. Compo, a Los Angeles writer, can be witty and colorful at times.

The chairman of the black studies department, Oba T'Shaka, accused the university of trying to undermine his department by putting Dr. Smith's course under the aegis of the political science department. Professor T'Shaka argued that Professor Smith's course substantially duplicated a course that had been taught in the black studies department for 19 years, and some student protesters urged a boycott of the Smith class. But Dr. Smith argued that black politics courses should be part of every political science program. As the semester ended last month, each side could claim a victory of sorts. The course was still there but its enrollment had dwindled from 45 students, 35 of them black, to 5 students, all of them white.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

Artist in Progress","LANDSCAPE: MEMORY. By Matthew Stadler. (Scribner's, $19.95.) The year is 1915. Nine years after the great earthquake, San Francisco is hosting a world's fair, Model T's and trench warfare have captured the popular imagination and the hero of Matthew Stadler's first novel is coming of age. ""Landscape: Memory"" is a portrait of the artist as a painfully sensitive young man, a richly impressionistic tale told in the form of a private journal and illustrated with Mr. Stadler's renditions of the narrator's painting-in-progress. Young Maxwell Kosegarten is a survivor of the great 1906 earthquake. He and his best friend, Duncan, brought together by the disaster, now spend their days exploring a changed San Francisco. They trace the quake's path along the coast, wander through the glittering fair at night and puzzle over their own shared recollections of the past. The process of memory is Max's true fascination: he struggles to fix dynamic events and impressions in his journal just as he yearns to capture a changing landscape in paint. The book remains a bit sketchy and disorienting until Max succeeds in bringing the reader closer to his private world. But the outside world is always interesting, as Mr. Stadler subtly weaves accurate historical details into Max's accounts of his daily experiences. This vivid narrative scene-painting brings a lost era to life, encompassing the thrill of a first automobile ride, the increasing horror of news from the European front and a child's terror as the earth rips apart. Max's memory of the earthquake unfolds late in the book, but it finally allows us to enter his emotional landscape, even as human figures begin to appear in his painting. When Duncan comes closer too, becoming lover as well as friend, the stage is set for passion and tragedy. ""Landscape: Memory"" is an unusual and impressive debut, a book that takes both a young man and his city through pain toward maturity.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Woolfs Under Glass,"Vanessa Bell once said that the subject matter of photography should be a little absurd. By this, Bell may have been thinking of her great-aunt, the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, ""who posed her sitters in a 'high-art' mode, and whose aim was not merely to 'take' photographs but to immortalize those dragooned into posing for her,"" writes Frances Spalding in her brief, discerning foreword to BLOOMSBURY REFLECTIONS (Norton, $39.95), a collection of photographs of the friends and descendants of the Bloomsbury group. Likewise, Bell would have appreciated the photographer Alen MacWeeney's slightly absurd -- though exceptionally beautiful -- photographic portraits. Each, despite its appearance of spontaneity, has been composed with great artifice. Each of his pictures is a collage of allusions, a reference to the past, while at the same time a frozen moment revealing something essential about the sitter's character. To this end he makes use not just of color and light, but of the furniture, decorative objects and paintings of Bloomsbury. Among the book's most memorable photos, in fact, are his eerily evocative shots of such Bloomsbury haunts as Monk's House, where Virginia Woolf did much of her writing, and Charleston, the country home of Clive and Vanessa Bell. Unfortunately, while the photographs draw us in, the text, which largely consists of a brief reminiscence of Bloomsbury by each sitter, is far less absorbing. Even readers who normally subscribe to the cult of Bloomsbury will question the value of such banal revelations as that of Cecil Woolf, who recalls seeing his Uncle Leonard pick up a piece of chocolate from the floor of a theater and ""pop it in his mouth,"" or Henrietta Garnett, who remembers that her grandmother Vanessa Bell was so frugal that she served ""dessert at lunch, but none at dinner."" The problem with most of these pieces, written by Sue Allison, a reporter at Life magazine, is that the speakers are of a different generation from the principals of Bloomsbury. With the exception of Quentin Bell, who speaks engagingly of life at Charleston, their memories are at best fragmentary, at worst too subjective to be revealing. Fortunately, Mr. MacWeeney's strangely canny photographs work independently of the text. While ""Bloomsbury Reflections"" reveals little of the actual stories behind these often guarded faces, it is a stunning visual record of what was once the spirit of Bloomsbury.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Where Mortals Fear to Tread,"ANGELS: An Endangered Species. By Malcolm Godwin. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) Angels are all around us -- in movies (""Angels With Dirty Faces""), sports (California Angels), even law enforcement (Guardian Angels). Angels figure in our most rarefied worship and in everyday figures of speech. They appear in many guises, from ancient bringers of glad tidings to modern comic-book heroes who appear in the nick of time to rescue good and defeat evil. Artists have been known to spend lifetimes creating substantial representations of these insubstantial beings. But are angels merely figments of our collective imaginations, inspired by legend and fostered by religion? That is a question not easily answered without serious study of the delightful ""Angels: An Endangered Species."" Malcolm Godwin begins by discussing such cloud-shaking matters as just how seraphim are distinct from cherubim, who are in turn quite separate from archangels. Understanding this heavenly hierarchy creates an important foundation for our knowledge of the more advanced material concerning these winged messengers. But winged messengers from whom, what or where? The author, a British artist and lecturer, presents cases in which encounter and speculation in some way transform those who have been witness to angelic presences. If angels are real, could they appear in other forms -- as unidentified flying objects, for instance? And if real, how do they fly? Are those dainty, feathered shoulder appendages aerodynamically adequate? Just what did Ezekiel see in that fiery chariot, up in the air? Could the legends of the lost continent of Mu be based on fact? Obviously, the questions surrounding these issues require further study by angelic scholars. Tongue parked firmly in cheek, Mr. Godwin takes us through the intricacies of modern angelology and a good deal of our own history, using text, charts, drawings and glorious illustrations. As to whether angels are real or not, endangered or not, Mr. Godwin leaves that up to his readers to discover in this heavenly book.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIARY/December 30-January 4,"THE ECONOMY The Trouble With Private Bank Insurance Questionable loans, nervous depositors, pliant public officials, a depleted insurance fund -- the collapse of Heritage Loan and Investment Company in Providence, R.I., at first glance seems familiar. The likely involvement of organized crime provides a dash of local color. But instead of sticking around to blame his troubles on regulators, Joseph Mollicone Jr., the bank's president, vanished. He had made $13 million in what investigators describe as fraudulent loans to himself. An investigation caused a run on deposits, draining the private fund that insures 45 banks and credit unions. The state's Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun, declared a bank emergency on Tuesday, shutting the affected institutions. Many will reopen with Federal insurance, but depositors at the weakest might lose their money. Will the story end in Rhode Island? Probably not, said Bert Ely, a financial institutions consultant. With private insurance programs for banks and credit unions elsewhere, he said, ""One serious hit that isn't quickly and convincingly dealt with can bring the whole plan down."" Some other states are likely to require privately insured institutions to switch to Federal coverage, resulting in depositor losses or state bailouts for those too shaky to qualify. Putting a Good Spin on Bad News Higher unemployment is good news of sorts when it is still lower than economists had expected. The rate rose two-tenths of 1 percent in December to the highest level since mid-1987. Non-agricultural payrolls fell by 76,000, but the decline was less than a third the drop in November. William C. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said that even these figures overstate the economy's weakness, since hours worked in December rose six-tenths of 1 percent. ""The report makes you more comfortable that the production cutbacks happened quickly enough in October and November so that further big cutbacks may not prove necessary,"" he said. A record 5.9 percent plunge in November factory orders was worse than economists expected, but no great surprise after news of low orders for durable goods. Dinkins, the Optimist First Donald J. Trump came up with his forecast for Atlantic City casinos. Then Robert Campeau and his New York deal-makers issued their outlook for retailing. Last week the Dinkins administration raised its 1991 earnings estimate for the York City's pension fund to 9 percent, more optimistic than about 9 in 10 of the nation's other cities. New York City's hopefulness certainly doesn't spring from its 1990 record, when forecasted earnings of 8.25 percent actually came in at just eight-tenths of 1 percent. More likely, the city's optimism comes from its need to reduce pension contributions and come up with millions, quickly, to finance 5 percent raises for workers under contracts reached last week. At this rate, Yankee management, come April, is bound to predict a pennant. A Skeptical Eye at Christie's For conservative valuation and fiscal prudence in New York, look instead to Christie's. The auction house prepared for the sale this week of the Ferdinand E. and Isabella Marcos collection of Old Master paintings by scrutinizing several pieces. Seven of the Marcos Canalettos were busted down to the Circle of Canaletto. What was a Giovanni Bellini in Manila, valued at perhaps $1 million, is School of Bellini in New York, worth a tenth as much. Several million dollars worth of English silver is for sale, too; no doubts, apparently, about whether copper lurks underneath. In Brief For the first time since 1979, American semiconductor makers gained in 1990 against the Japanese. Their share of the worldwide market rose to 36.5 percent from 34.9 percent. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether the makers of infant formula colluded to raise prices. The prospect of Middle East peace talks pushed oil prices down to $24.90 a barrel, the lowest since the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. There Goes the Prime The nation's major banks lowered their loan rates last week for the customers they still consider unquestionably credit worthy. The prime rate, a benchmark for many other loans, fell half a percentage point, to 9 1/2 percent, the first decline in a year. COMPANIES",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BEFORE THE STORM: Memories of My Youth in Old Prussia. By Marion, Countess Donhoff. Translated by Jean Steinberg. (Knopf, $22.95.) The way Marion Donhoff grew up is probably as foreign to most Americans as life in a novel by Goethe; it was certainly as romantic. The Countess, who is now the publisher of the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit, was the youngest daughter of an East Prussian family whose genealogical tree branched back to the Knights of the Teutonic Order, and she had the run of a castle and grounds visitors called ""more beautiful than Versailles."" Indeed, with the disappearance of East Prussia -- at the end of World War II, its castles were leveled and its land ceded to Poland -- the kind of childhood Countess Donhoff had has become something foreign to everyone. Whence the interest of ""Before the Storm"": it documents in knowing detail a semifeudal world most of us have glimpsed only in movies and caricatures, a world of kindly, paternalistic aristocrats and their class-conscious servants. ""The cook would never have sat down to eat with the kitchen maids, nor the housekeeper with the housemaids,"" she writes; ""the cook and the housekeeper ate in a separate room at a table to which only my mother's maid . . . [ was ] admitted."" The tone of these memoirs, ably translated by Jean Steinberg, is unabashedly nostalgic, even, at times, defensive; the Countess's parents entertained lavishly, she tells us, but they lived austerely, and the children always rode third class. Countess Donhoff, however, is not sentimental. She frankly acknowledges the anti-Semitism of her parents' class, although, she explains, they also hated the Nazis. But the most powerful part of this book narrates her 1945 flight westward before the Red Army and the utter collapse of all she knew. ""The end of East Prussia,"" she writes, ""had come down to this: three dying soldiers trying to drag themselves across the Nogat bridge . . . and a woman on horseback, whose ancestors had come from the west into the wilderness east of this river six hundred years ago, riding back to the west -- six hundred years of history wiped out.""",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

All of us create for ourselves private pantheons inhabited by people we have never met but who nevertheless have left indelible impressions. Many of them live as vividly for us as people we encounter in daily life. The novelist Paul West shares with us his personal register of celebrities in ""Portable People,"" a sly and witty updating of Aubrey's ""Brief Lives."" His 82 subjects range from Keats to Marlene Dietrich, Rodin to Chris Evert, Count Basie to Nabokov. His selections include artists, scientists, writers, musicians, athletes, statesmen, actors and a generous sprinkling of aviators. The archest of the lot present the subject speaking to us in the first person (Colette reflecting orgiastically on food, for one, or Richard Nixon on his Chinese hosts). The strongest contain memorable epigrams. Here, for example, is West on Evonne Goolagong: ""Listen to her name: a puddle with a chime in it."" And on Chris Evert: ""Taut and tight-lipped mistress of the baseline, she is the all-American golden girl become the champion of monotony."" Mr. West is most incisive about subjects that he takes most seriously: Simone Weil or Maurice Maeterlinck, Edith Sitwell or Samuel Beckett -- who, says Mr. West, ""became a Frenchman so as to have no home to go to.""

A common criticism of today's musical theater is that emphasis is placed on spectacle above all else. One acid crack hurled now is that the audience leaves the theater humming the scenery. But in post-World War II America, when theatergoers left a Lerner and Loewe musical there was no question what was on their minds and lips: the fairy-tale stories and witty lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner and the beautiful music of Fritz Loewe. In ""Inventing Champagne,"" Gene Lees reminds us of the phenomenal impact of the creators of the musicals ""Brigadoon,"" ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot."" Mr. Lees, the author of ""Oscar Peterson"" and ""Singers and the Song,"" is in his element writing of the horrific rehearsals and openings of ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Camelot."" Prior to its New York opening, ""Camelot"" played in Toronto. Not only did the show run four and a half hours there, but Lerner entered the hospital with a bleeding ulcer, soon to be followed by the show's director, Moss Hart, who suffered his second coronary thrombosis. Despite Lerner and Loewe's professional and personal problems (Lerner was married eight times and was addicted to drugs), their musicals were what America saw, listened to and talked about. They, along with a handful of other librettists, lyricists and composers, helped define American popular culture.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

The Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency responsible for disposing of the properties that have gone into default as a result of the savings-and-loan crisis, will provide information on properties for sale through a toll-free number, 1 (800) 431-0600. You may also get lists of certain types of properties -- such as one-family homes -- in certain states or regions for $5 for the first 50 listings and 10 cents for each additional listing. A new list is now being prepared. Illegal Terrace Planters Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a building coverted to a co-op about two years ago. The apartment has a wrap terrace. When I moved in 17 years ago there were brick planters on each corner of the terrace. The building's management tells me that these planters are in violation of the city's Building Code and is holding me responsible for removing them. I have a floor plan showing that the planters were installed when the terrace was built. Am I now responsible for removing them? . . . Edward Vecchione, Manhhattan Answer: No. As a tenant of the apartment, you are not responsible for maintenance of the terrace or its structural features. ""The tenant would have no right, responsibility or duty concerning the planters,"" said David L. Smith, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters. ""The violation is the responsiblity of the landlord. Transferring Co-op Shares Question: My son died suddenly without a will. He was not married and had no children or siblings. I was appointed administrator of his estate. I believe he would have wanted to leave his co-op apartment to his roommate and would want me to transfer shares to her from the estate. But a board member says that this may cloud the title and has suggested that the shares be transferred first to me and then to her. I am concerned about being liable for charges, like gift taxes. Is this two-step process necessary? . . . Samuel Lee, Fair Lawn, N.J. Answer: Not according to Mark A. Goldsmith, a lawyer with the firm of Herrick, Feinstein who specializes in real estate tax matters. Mr. Goldsmith said that as the beneficiary, you would be considered the owner of the apartment and would be making a gift to the roommate no matter if the shares were transferred to you first or directly from the estate.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

The seemingly irrevocable break with tonal music, with its hierarchy of pitches, its modulations and gravitations from key to key, was a long time coming, though it can be dated conveniently from Schoenberg's invention of the 12-tone system in the early 20's. The codification of atonality, however, was not simply one more step in an evolutionary process. In effect, it threw composers into unknown waters and held their heads under. A few survived to build academic careers, teaching the new orthodoxy. Many others, as they sank from view, could at least find solace in the belief that by abandoning tonality they were taking part in a necessary historical development.",1991-01-06T05:00:00+0000

As in other erstwhile monarchies, the duties of his office have been largely reduced to pomp and circumstance. To make matters worse Drottningholm Castle, where he lives with his family, only gets two television channels -- and, this being Sweden, both are noncommercial public stations. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that the King would like to broaden his video horizons by installing a satellite dish antenna to pick up foreign broadcasts. But it seems not even that modest wish is within his circumscribed powers. Swedish cultural authorities decided an antenna would look tacky and detract from the appearance of the 18th-century castle, an important tourist attraction. Installing an underground cable would cost $175,000, too much a strain for the royal treasury to withstand. The King's spokeswoman, Elisabeth Tarras-Wahlberg, said the price was ""not realistic.""",1991-01-13T05:00:00+0000

Denzel Washington plays Bleek Gilliam, a straight-arrow, middle-class jazz musician. Though rich photography presents a sleek, handsome surface, Spike Lee's film has no inner life and, worse, little of the director's originality. Playing the trumpet or making love, Bleek performs with mechanical, macho self-absorption. Ultimately, the film is ""more Hollywood than Spike Lee and much the worse for it."" (Caryn James) Young Guns II 1990. CBS/Fox. $92.98. 1:45. CC. PG-13. Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is more gun-toting cutup than true desperado in Geoff Murphy's sequel about the Kid's split with the sheriff Pat Garrett. Billy's gang of post-adolescent heartthrobs (Kiefer Sutherland and Christian Slater, among others) are ""geared far more carefully to today's teen-age audiences than to the folklore of the Old West."" (Janet Maslin) The Adventures of Ford Fairlane 1990. CBS/Fox. $92.98. 1:40. CC. R. Andrew Dice Clay is a leering, leather-clad rock-and-roll detective in a film designed to showcase his one-liners, primarily sex-ed jokes at the third-grade level. ""The person most likely to be entertained by 'The Adventures of Ford Fairlane' need not be made aware of the film's existence. He's already on the screen."" (Maslin) Delta Force 2 1990. Media. $89.98. 1:40. CC. R. Chuck Norris takes on a South American drug lord in a swiftly paced film with good pyrotechnics and a moderately exciting final chase. While there's nothing too original about any of that, the star's behavior is something of a departure. ""Out of all the invincible heroes who fight their way through American action movies, Mr. Norris sweats and growls the least."" (Stephen Holden) Speaking Parts 1987. Fox Lorber. $79.95. 1:26. No rating. Video monitors preside eerily over practically every move as three strangers gradually begin to interact with one another in undramatic yet mesmerizing ways. Sleek, somber and technology-mad, Atom Egoyan's film has a chilly high-tech cachet, creating a ""perfectly controlled environment in which even the tiniest gestures harness their own shallowness by appearing to take on great import."" (Maslin) The Lemon Sisters 1990. HBO. $92.99. 1:33. CC. PG-13. Bound by old loyalty and shared vapidity, three lifelong friends (Diane Keaton, Kathryn Grody and Carol Kane) face life in Atlantic City.

Now, for the first time, it appears, a hospital is preparing to ask the courts for permission to let a patient die against the wishes of the next of kin. The patient, 87-year-old Helga Wanglie, has lain with severe brain damage, unresponsive and tied to life support systems in Minnesota's Hennepin County Medical Center for eight months. Her husband, Oliver, does not dispute that she will never get better, but he insists on all efforts to keep her from getting worse. The doctors say that since they can do nothing to improve Mrs. Wanglie's life, they should cease to do anything. The doctors got the county commission's approval last week to take the matter to court. ""This hospital has the technology to keep 50 Helga Wanglies alive for an indefinite period,"" said Dr. Michael B. Belzer, the medical director.

Joyce was, in his own words, ""a small man, prone to alcoholism""; Ellmann was a moderate drinker and a rather bulky man, with a balding brow and a flat Midwestern accent that years of dining at High Table with murmurous Oxford dons had failed to mitigate. Maybe it was his effortless fidelity to his own nature that made him such a shrewd interpreter of others. Ellmann treated his subjects -- William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Oscar Wilde -- with a benign, avuncular tolerance. He noted, and forgave, their failings.

us,Headliners; Criminal's Justice,"Richard Demarest was sentenced to a Colorado state prison for murder, but nobody said he was stupid. Having become a passable jailhouse lawyer while doing his time, Mr. Demarest took immediate note of the Government's failure to compensate him in 1989, when he spent 10 days traveling to and from and testifying in a Denver Federal court, where he was called as a defense witness in a criminal trial. Federal law requires the payment of a fee, currently $30 a day, to any witness appearing in any Federal court. The law does not exclude Federal prisoners, but Federal policy did. So Mr. Demarest, working without legal assistance, took the matter to court. Last week, the United States Supreme Court found in his favor. The letter of the law was unambiguous, said Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and it could not be assumed that ""the payment of witness fees is so bizarre that Congress could not have intended it."" Mr. Demarest, who has 12 years to serve before he is eligible for parole, will get $300 in fees.",1991-01-13T05:00:00+0000

But as these cars age, especially if they are poorly maintained, they become dirtier. In areas where monitoring is lax, these dirty cars can emit between 100 and 500 grams of carbon monoxide a mile. To spot them -- and get them fixed or off the road -- the Clean Air Act requires what is called ""on-road emissions monitoring."" To do this, Donald H. Stedman, a professor of chemistry at the University of Denver, has designed and built a prototype remote-emissions monitoring system. The system takes a second or less to measure the level of emissions from the tail pipe of a passing car. The system works like an infrared spectrascope. A parallel beam of infrared light is focused at a mirror across a road. The beam travels through the plume of exhaust gases, bounces off the mirror and returns to the device. The car's exhaust gases alter the wavelength of the light in a measurable way. When the infrared light re-enters the device, it hits a spinning mirror that focuses it on a series of detectors that can tell which gases are present and in what quantities. The device can be connected to a video camera to record the license number of each car tested.",1991-01-13T05:00:00+0000

In THE SHUBERTS OF BROADWAY: A History Drawn From the Collections of the Shubert Archive (Oxford University, $35), Brooks McNamara, a professor of performance studies at New York University and director of the Shubert Archive, provides a detailed if somewhat bland history of the brothers and their phenomenal impact on the theater. Discarding their Yiddish, inventing middle initials, streamlining their personal histories (matters of age, birth order and place of origin were altered to suit), these sons of a peddler were brilliant entrepreneurs who saw opportunities for profit in the American passion for stage entertainment. Generously illustrated with photographs from the Shubert Archive, the book brims with lore about these colorful, ruthless and enigmatic brothers, as well as with details of the spectacular rise and subsequent ignominious decline of their immense theater empire. But Mr. McNamara's respectful, gee-whiz, only-in-America approach does not do justice to his subjects. Still, ""The Shuberts of Broadway,"" an insider's authorized history, offers much in the way of information and memorabilia, and readers eager to know something of the three men whose name has become synonymous with Broadway today might find it right up their alley.",1991-01-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary/December 6-11,"THE ECONOMY Baker and Aziz Send the Markets Spinning Minutes before 2 P.M. on Wednesday, Brian Tagler of Shearson Lehman Brothers was trading oil for $23.85 a barrel. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had been meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The moment Mr. Tagler heard Mr. Baker say on television, ""Regrettably . . . ,"" the trader was on the phone to the commodity pit. Buy orders had pushed the price to $31 -- the quickest rise he had ever seen. Economists are somewhat more stable in their sentiments, occasionally holding them for a whole week. Their consensus by the weekend was that if the United States fights and wins quickly and tidily, oil prices would fall and the economy would benefit. ""I understand the mood swings, but people are exaggerating,"" said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. ""There is a worldwide glut of oil against a backdrop of weak demand."" But if there is a protracted war, many economists say, the budget deficit would widen, and oil prices and interest rates would rise. ""The uncertainty will have a debilitating effect,"" said Richard B. Berner, a Salomon Brothers economist. ""People will hold back from making long-term commitments."" Even a last-minute settlement will not be enough to overcome recession, economists say, since growth was slowing before Iraqi troops set foot in Kuwait. Again, Sweat Doesn't Pay Will the returns on labor rebound and surpass the returns on wealth in the 1990's? From 1984 to 1988, the wealthiest gained in net worth, while everyone else stagnated, the Census Bureau reported last week. The less affluent depend mostly on their wages, which in the 1980's barely kept pace with inflation. Stocks and bonds, meanwhile, enjoyed strong returns. Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, doubts that investments will continue soaring. But wages will rise as labor supplies tighten, he says. ""The headlines of one decade go into the trash bin of the new decade,"" he said. For investors, ""The decade hasn't started off very well, has it?"" Wholesale Comfort The wholesale inflation news for December was comforting at every stop in the production chain. For finished goods, prices fell six-tenths of 1 percent overall; they only rose three-tenths of a point excluding food and energy. Prices for intermediate and crude goods, earlier in the production process, also fell. Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley said the report leaves the Federal Reserve plenty of room to stoke the economy. ""The fundamentals are as constructive for inflation as they have been at any point in the onset of the last few recessions,"" he said. The annual gain, 5.6 percent, was the highest since 1981, but a mild 3.5 percent core rate. An Uptown Jazz Market Where sopranos now screech, saxaphones will squeal and coo. Lincoln Center has launched a jazz department with a $1 million annual budget. The marketing problem for Rob Gibson, the department's chief: How to create an uptown audience, week after week, for music usually heard in downtown clubs. His answers include children's concerts, master classes and small, informal theaters in the center. One possibility is a tribute to Sun Ra, the band leader whose fans can verify his claimed birth in outer space. But judging by what works best at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gibson might better raise his top ticket prices to $115, require black tie on opening nights and drag dozens of shield-bearing supernumeraries on stage. Banking Forecast: Rain At times last week, L. William Seidman's spirits improved to merely gloomy. Otherwise, he was downright dismal. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned the Senate Banking Committee that more major bank failures were likely if the recession persists past mid-year.

Tocchet has 13 points in his last 10 games. The victory, Philadelphia's second in its last seven games, snapped a seven-game (0-4-3) streak without a victory for the Flyers. Pittsburgh was 12-4 in its previous 16 games with Tom Barrasso, the Pittsburgh goaltender, allowing only four goals in the previous three. Dale Kushner, Kjell Samuelsson and Mike Ricci had the other Philadelphia goals. Bob Errey, Phil Bourque, Paul Coffey and Gord Roberts scored for Pittsburgh. Philadelphia, 20-0-2 when scoring four or more goals, has beaten Pittsburgh in three of four meetings this season. Pittsburgh came into the game as the league's top-scoring team.

Coffey made it 4-3 when he beat Peeters on a power play at the 9:25, making him the highest-scoring defenseman in Pittsburgh history with 344 points.

us,For Children,"My family skated on a ripply pond -- made that way by the wind blowing in from Long Island Sound -- every winter. And though ice-skating rinks in New York City may not be bumpy or ringed with weeping willows, they do offer dramatic and picturesque venues for skaters of all skills. There are indoor rinks, cool enough to require rejuvenating sips of hot chocolate. And there are outdoor rinks, open to any weather, though heavy rain often keeps even stalwart skaters home. Here is a rundown on privately owned rinks, as well as those run by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, to try out now that it's the heart of winter. All offer skate rentals, starting with size 8, which, according to one rink manager, is a child's size 6 in shoes. Most rinks suggest that only children from age 3 and up attempt the ice. But, as Chopin Berry, a park supervisor, suggested, try to pad children's knees and hands; maybe they should even wear helmets. Keep in mind, too, that holiday hours are not included here, and that many rinks are open this Monday (Martin Luther King Jr. Day), with special schedules.

But with relative wealth, they also discovered political corruption, which led in 1989 to the first suspension of a tribal leader by the tribal council. Since then, the Navajo, who with 219,000 members are America's largest Indian tribe, have worked to reshape their government along more democratic lines. Last week, they inaugurated their first elected tribal president, Peterson Zah, a 62-year-old education consultant who has been active in tribal politics.

It was the second successful title defense for Andries, whose record is now 39-8-2. Waters is 13-2-1. (AP) Skiing Kronberger Increases Her Lead: Petra Kronberger of Austria reached the midpoint of the women's World Cup season with a huge lead in the overall competition by completing a weekend sweep with a victory in the super-G yesterday at Meribel, France. It was Kronberger's third consecutive victory and eighth in 16 races. She has 276 points in 16 races as she bids to win the overall title for a second year in a row. Carol Merle of France is second with 92 points. Kronberger had almost a half-second on the field yesterday as she clocked a time of 1 minute 20.99 seconds. Michaela Gerg of Germany, at 1:21.48, edged Merle, at 1:21.49, for second. (AP) Golf Cook in Lead Alone: John Cook, who insists his comeback from career-threatening wrist surgery won't be complete until he wins again, took sole control of the lead after the third round of the Hawaiian Open in Honolulu. Cook, who was tied with Scott Simpson after the second round, shot a 69 in blustery winds yesterday. He completed three rounds at 17-under 199 on the Waialae Country Club course, which played much tougher with the return of the breezes. With one round to go in the chase for a $198,000 first prize, Cook held a two-stroke advantage over Gil Morgan, who remained close with a last-hole eagle-3. That eagle completed a 69 and got him through 54 holes at 201. (AP) Two-Stroke Lead for Sheehan: Patty Sheehan, the defending champion, shot a one-under-par 70 yesterday to take a two-stroke lead over Judy Dickinson after two rounds of the Jamaica Classic at Montego Bay. Sheehan, a stroke down when play began, was at four-under 138 after two tours of the 6,202-yard Tryall Golf and Beach Club course. While the first-round leader, Sarah McGuire, was sliding back in the field with a 76, Dickinson, with a 68, and Caroline Keggi, who shot 67, made moves to the top of the leader board. They were only two players able to break 70. Dickinson was at 140, one shot ahead of Keggi. (AP) College Football Hollingsworth Stars: Gary Hollingsworth, the Alabama quarterback, engineered three first-quarter scoring drives yesterday that gave his A.F.C. team a lead it never relinquished in a 38-28 victory over the N.F.C. in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. The game matched college seniors on teams coached by Jim Mora of the New Orleans Saints, a member of the National Footbal League's National Conference, and Marty Schottenheimer of the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Conference. Hollingsworth threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to L.S.U.'s Harvey Williams late in the opening period after his passing set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Penn State's Gary Brown. (AP) East Over West in Hula Bowl: The Michigan connection of John Langeloh and Jarrod Bunch provided the East with three field goals and a touchdown in a 23-10 victory over the West in the Hula Bowl in Honolulu yesterday. Langeloh, a kicker from Michigan State, tied a Hula Bowl record with field goals of 31, 42 and 22 yards. He was selected the game's most valuable offensive player. Bunch, a Michigan running back, twisted and broke tackles to score a second-quarter touchdown.

Hoping to end a wave of violence directed against anti-drug forces, the Government has offered traffickers who surrender and plead guilty to one crime a promise of light sentences and a guarantee that they will not be extradited to the United States. Officials said that Mr. Ochoa's surrender demonstrated the program's value. But one student of drug politics, Ambler Moss, the former American Ambassador to Panama, had his doubts.

us,Dropping By Mao's Home,"ONLY 15 years and 50 ideologies ago, it was the most popular excursion in China. Every Red Guard's idea of militant tourism was paying a visit to Shaoshan, the birthplace and boyhood home of Chairman Mao Zedong. This farmhouse deep in the countryside of Hunan Province served to confirm the plebian roots of the Chinese revolution and its No. 1 peasant. Train lines were extended specifically to accommodate the hordes who made this pilgrimage to the holiest of revolutionary shrines. ""Paving the highway all the way to Mao's house was a great expense to the province,"" says the driver of the taxi for which I've opted. His tone suggests little nostalgia for reading the little red book instead of his meter -- though he has to admit that most of the local trade died off with the Chairman himself. When I look out across the rice paddies, I can almost see the robust, ruddy-cheeked zealots in their green caps and red armbands, marching arm in arm with Mao's quotations in one hand and a steamed bun in the other.

us,Business Diary/January 13-18,"WAR IN THE GULF Why Can't America Make a VCR to Match Its F-117? Radar-jamming F4-G Wild Weasels carrying antiradiation missiles disrupted Iraqi defenses Wednesday night. As F-117 stealth fighters led the attack, the skies were initially all theirs. The first reports indicated that America's technological superiority was manifest. So why can't the United States make the world's best VCR's? Or subcompact cars? Scholars say the nation's military sophistication at best leaves its economic competitiveness unharmed. ""Defense needs are not the same as civilian needs in most industries,"" said Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School in his recent book. Defense products can sometimes serve other ends; the first military jet transport evolved into the Boeing 707. But sometimes, he said, military contracts merely blunt healthy business competition. Paul Kennedy, a Yale historian, goes further, saying that the nation's military responsibilities are eroding its economic advantages. ""Rome fell; Babylon fell; Scarsdale's turn will come,"" he said. Only the week before last, the Pentagon canceled a $57 billion program to build a new Navy attack plane when the ultimate cost appeared far greater than Scarsdale and the rest of the nation can afford. Traders in Battle American traders were as awesomely prepared as the military for war in the Middle East: all set for a furious aerial battle, the destruction of Saudi oil refineries and panic buying of oil. They had pored over tables showing that when war breaks out, investors dump stocks. And so, when American jets flew virtually unopposed Wednesday night and the Saudis initially escaped with damage to a single storage tank, traders were able to change course faster than F-15's. On Thursday, the Dow climbed 114.60 points on heavy volume, the second-best day ever. Oil futures dropped by more than $10 a barrel in a day, then, on Friday, fell by $2.19, to $19.25. And yet, the euphoria may prove fleeting; William H. Donaldson, the New York Stock Exchange Chairman, warned investors against acting in haste.",1991-01-20T05:00:00+0000

As a composer and arranger, Ms. Akiyoshi is fearless because she unhesitatingly goes after textures that are traditionally beautiful and luxuriant, using flutes and clarinets to invoke a pastoral serenity that might seem trite in some hands. But like many modernists who came to artistic maturity in the 1950's, Ms. Akiyoshi has a notion that music should be more than entertainment. Though the basic idiom she uses is deep in the big-band tradition, her vocabulary often includes odd dissonant clusters that act rhetorically, short bursts of sound seemingly meant to teach an audience that conventional lack of consonance can have value as well.",1991-01-20T05:00:00+0000

A THREAT FROM IRAQ Charging that civilians had been bombed beyond a ""minimum of human standards,"" Iraq threatened to disperse ""more than 20"" human shields. President Bush and British officials expressed outrage, saying such a move would violate the Geneva Conventions. WAR LOSSES: THE PENTAGON'S REPORT ALLIED FORCES Troops: Twenty-five airmen were listed as missing after their planes went down, with 23 of them believed to have been taken prisoner. Iraq claimed to hold ""more than 20."" Aircraft: Seventeen aircraft were reported lost as of yesterday, 10 them American, four British, one Italian, one Saudi and one Kuwaiti. The Iraqis claimed they have shot down 160 allied planes. The allies say 14 of the lost aircraft were downed in aerial combat and the other three crashed in accidents. IRAQI FORCES Troops: Forty-five soldiers were killed in action, 40 of them in Kuwait and five earlier in raids on off-shore Kuwaiti oil platforms. Twenty-three othes were taken prisoner during the raids. There were no estimates of military or civilian casualties in aerial bombardments. Iraq listed 31 soldiers as killed in action.

They got a helping of it tonight when Kevin Miller scored twice and had an assist in a 4-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Northlands Coliseum. It was the first victory for the Rangers in four games and only their second in seven. Miller had six shots on goal. He also his a goalpost and slid head first into the net on another attmpt. ""I was due,"" Miller said. ""Lately I've been getting all kinds of chances. It's not just me. With a scorer like Bernie out, everybody's got to pick it up."" Tonight's three periods were dramatically different. The first featured open skating and even play and ended with a 1-1 tie. Joe Cirella, recently acquired from Quebec, scored for the Rangers; Steve Smith for Edmonton. The second period was dominated by the Rangers, who emerged with a 3-1 lead on goals by Miller and Kris King. In the third, the Oilers opened by severely testing Mike Richter. He held them off until Miller increased the lead to 4-1 with his second of the game, on a breakaway from center ice. Edmonton's Smith scored with a two-man advantage late in the game. Glenn Anderson's goal with 15 seconds left ended the scoring. The Rangers have four days before their next game, but Coach Roger Neilson has planned what he calls a ""mini training camp"" near a resort in Banff, Alberta, with double-sessions scheduled for Sunday and Monday. Richter said the successful effort may have improved the team's chances for other recreation at Banff. ""Maybe we just saved a lung or two on this team,"" he said. Tie Domi of New York, back from the minor leagues, played sparingly but did what he was brought up to do: fight. In the first period, Domi challenged Dave Brown and lost in a rapid exchange of punches. In the second, Domi squared off with Jeff Beukeboom. He came into the game with 272 penalty minutes this season in both major and minor-league action. Adam Graves of Edmonton and Randy Moller of New York were ejected for fighting after officials had broken up the second Domi altercation. Before the game, the availability of Brian Leetch had been in doubt. The Rangers' defenseman and leading scorer sprained his right ankle during Tuesday night's 3-2 loss to the Islanders.

""The quantities used are enormous and the refinery capacity is elsewhere,"" said Robert G. Neumann, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The situation is worse in Iraq, which has banned fuel sales to civilians. And in Kuwait, the Iraqis set wellheads and refineries on fire last week.

If she owns an etiquette book at all, chances are it's stashed in a drawer. In her book, wedding rules are meant to be bent. Who says a bride has to wear white? Weddings are the stuff of dreams, and bridal fantasies come in all shapes and colors. A sleek pink minidress or bright blue ruffled pants may suit your style better than the usual fairy-princess confection. Why commit to the standard solitaire and gold band? A simpler, one-ring affair -- perhaps an antique or a modern, sculptural band -- may fit your finger better. And who needs to settle for the watercress-sandwich solution to reception fare? An ethnic buffet with Cuban or Jamaican food may say a lot more about a couple's culinary sophistication. All this originality doesn't mean that people have fallen out of love with the wedding tradition itself. Far from it. Weddings factor into our lives -- and bank accounts, alas -- as much as they ever have.

In the first section, which lists the seemingly innumerable pianists who have dazzled or importuned audiences since the beginnings of the modern piano in the 18th century, David Dubal, the music director of WNCN, a radio station in New York, concentrates less on the performers' biographies than on the elusive matter of their interpretive methods and styles. All the giants, as well as scores of lesser meteors, are here. But although Mr. Dubal is an erudite and insightful critic, the entries, with their cascades of adjectival evaluation (Josef Lhevinne is ""inherently musical, aristocratic, and possessed of poise and balance""; Sviatoslav Richter the ""most mercurial, intellectual, exasperating, and profound of all Soviet pianists""), read like reviews rendered frustratingly vague by being detached from their enlivening occasion.

Last month, her grandson, a former Wall Street lawyer named Alexander C. Sanger, was elected president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of New York City. ""With all her success, my grandmother left some unfinished business, and I intend to finish it,"" he said. This year the United States Supreme Court will rule on a challenge to regulations barring groups that receive Federal family-planning money from discussing abortion with their clients.

us,Tech Notes; An Extra Nudge for Toxic Waste,"A process under development at the Batelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, may offer a novel way to remove contaminated ground water from under the nation's dumps and landfills. The process, employed for several years to dry out coal but not yet tested in this application, uses electrical and acoustical energy to cause toxic liquids to migrate toward a drainpipe where they can be extracted by a pump. But over time, the migration stops as the residue left behind solidifies into ""filtercake."" ""That is when the acoustical shock is applied,"" said Satya Chauchan, director of separation technology at Batelle. The ultrasonic shock disturbs the molecules of the filtercake and causes the migration of the contaminated material to recommence. As envisioned, a single cathode will be ringed with anodes placed around the dump site. The toxic liquids will migrate to the center as low-voltage electricity travels through the ground.",1991-01-27T05:00:00+0000

In the book, a physics and biology student from England, living among Berlin's radical fringe in the 1920's and 1930's, falls in love with a German Jew. Einstein and Wittgenstein make cameo appearances in the novel, which explores genetics, the atomic bomb, linguistic philosophy and the rise of Fascism. ""I am so used to being the dark horse that I was quite reconciled to ending my days as one,"" said the author, who has been described as liberal, soft-spoken and unlike his father in many other ways.

Mrs. Baker is not a screamer."" Neither are many of the roughly 350 other estimable ladies in Jane Robinson's WAYWARD WOMEN: A Guide to Women Travellers (Oxford University, $29.95). And neither, unfortunately, are they as well known as their male counterparts. Ms. Robinson, a British bibliographer, set out to correct this situation by producing a reference guide to ""all the first-hand travel accounts ever written by women"" and published in the English language. But then, luckily for the reader, she committed what she charmingly calls ""the bibliographer's cardinal sin"" -- she started to read the books themselves. The result is a less comprehensive but far more engaging work, an annotated ramble through a surprisingly large chunk of history in the company of ancient pilgrims (the fourth-century abbess Etheria, who, lacking a Baedeker, merely used her Bible to map a route through the Holy Land), modern daredevils (the Hon. Mrs. Victor Bruce, the first woman known to be charged with speeding, who was still test-driving for the Ford Motor Company at the age of 78) and eternal eccentrics (Margaret Fountaine, a parson's daughter whose ""three great passions"" were ""travel, butterflies, and Unsuitable Attachments""). Ms. Robinson not only introduces us to such tempting (and often out of print) titles as ""On Sledge and Horseback to Outcast Siberian Lepers,"" ""Unprotected Females in Norway"" and ""To Lake Tanganyika in a Bath Chair""; she also steers us wittily away from bores like Charlotte Cameron (""the patron saint of cruise liners"") and Mrs. Theodore F. Hughes (a late 19th-century visitor to the Orient who ""grew maudlin and weak on a diet of chicken and oysters""). Any dedicated reader of travel books is bound to have a few quibbles with her selections (Lola Montez and Florence Nightingale, but no Sybille Bedford?), although sheer gratitude for discoveries like ""An English Girl's First Impressions of Burmah"" by Beth Ellis (""one of the funniest travel books ever written"") is likely to win out.",1991-01-27T05:00:00+0000

HUSSEIN GRANTS INTERVIEW In an interview with Peter Arnett of the Cable News Network, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said that ""if Iraq uses oil for self-defense,"" it was justified. The journalist also quoted Mr. Hussein as saying that Iran was offering sanctuary to the Iraqi planes in a gesture of Muslim solidarity. STOPPING THE OIL SPILL U.S. and Saudi officials said the flow of crude from offshore Kuwaiti sources was virtually halted by the weekend's precision bombing. But they said the slick left by some 11 million barrels of spilled oil still threatened ecological disaster. WAR LOSSES ALLIED FORCES Troops: The Pentagon listed 21 American casualties as of yesterday, consisting of seven wounded and 14 missing or taken prisoner, a fate shared by 12 allied airmen. Aircraft: The loss of a Harrier jet of the Marine Corps brought the number of American aircraft shot down to 11 in 12 days of raids on Iraqi targets. Seven allied aircraft also were lost. IRAQI FORCES Troops: There was no current information on military casualties. Iraq informed the United Nations yesterday that at least 324 civilians died in air raids, 416 more were wounded and religious and cultural institutions were destroyed or damaged as well. Many of the casualties occurred Jan. 21, when bombs struck two towns south of Baghdad, Iraq said.
