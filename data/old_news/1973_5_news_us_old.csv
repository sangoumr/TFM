He makes pornography seem like any old plumbing, violence like lovemaking, innocence like evil, and guilt like child's play. He wheels out all the latest fashionable complaints about America--her racism, her gift for destroying language, her technological greed and selfishness--and makes them seem fresh, funny, outrageous, hateful, and lovable, all at the same time. He draws pictures, for God's sake--simple, rough, yet surprisingly seductive sketches of everything from Volkswagens to electric chairs. He weaves into his plot a dozen or so glorious synopses of Vonnegut stories one almost wishes were fleshed out into whole books. He very nearly levitates. Yet--astonishingly--this fiction is also a factual announcement of his intention to give up fiction. And what mars the book is that one believes the fiction, but not the facts.

us,Screen: 'You're Lying',"Whatever their subjects, the feature films of Vilgot Sjoman""I Am Curious (Yellow),"" I Am Curious (Blue)""tend to share a common form: the not-exactly documentary. In ""You're Lying,"" which was made in 1969 and opened this week at the First Avenue Screening Room, the form persists, though with changes. ""You're Lying"" begins as a straight documentary about the Swedish penal system, becomes a fictionalized documentary about a young man who is not rehabilitated in Swedish prisons, and ends as a psychological study about what seems almost a symbiotic relationship between a prisoner and the imprisonment he cannot quite bring himself to escape.As a documentary, ""You're Lying"" intends to expose Swedish prisons. Much of this may be lost on American audiences, for whom the lot of the Swedish prisonerconsiderable privacy, personal freedom, leave privileges, etc.will probably look like summer camp.The prisoner in question is Lasse (Stig Engstrom), a would-be artist, a would-be writer, a well-developed alcholic who steals a bit to keep in booze. Lasse is the special concern of Bjorn (Borge Ahlstedt), a young art teacher who respects Lasse's talent, who writes newspaper pieces protesting his imprisonment and who tries to provide for him when he does win parole. But he is beyond providing for, and he breaks parole and returns to jail, leaving behind him broken promises, personal abuse and bitter memories. The indictment of the prison system has turned into an indictment of a man for whom there is, in a sense, no imprisonment absolute enough to satisfy him.Though the later parts of ""You're Lying"" are much more interesting than the earlier parts, Sjoman is so deadly earnest about everything in his movie (and about his own involvement as a film maker) that he treats the drama as if it were an illustrative annex to the documentary. This is manifestly unfair.Sjoman has shot ""You're Lying"" largely in close-up. Indeed, he is the kind of director who cannot achieve distance without suggesting alienationand though this may be right for his subject, it is a real limitation in the experience of seeing the film. This is too bad, because ""You're Lying,"" possibly despite its intentions, is a work of some integrity.",1973-05-05T05:00:00+0000

He decided whom and what the President should see, and so helped to determine how Nixon thought and what he decided. Like Adams, Haldeman functioned with such bloodless, hardeyed efficiency and shielded his boss from so much unpleasantness, that he earned trust and respect from most of those within the White House and enmity and contempt from many of those outside. Like Adams, he was called the second most powerful man in Washington. And like Adams, who was forced from office by his acceptance, in return for small favors, of a vicua coat, a $2,400 Oriental rug and $3,000 in free hotel rooms from a Boston textile tycoon, Haldeman's career came to an abrupt halt in the midst a major scandal.

Like his death itself, this event was momentous, for with it Picasso joined the ranks of those outstanding estheticians of the art of Western painting Delacroix, Constable, Fromentin, Van Gogh who were themselves all painters. Of this group only Fromentin produced a book, The Old Masters of Belgium and Holland, of which Flaubert remarked that it constituted a new literary form. Picasso gives a simple reason why the others held back: But say it with brushes and paint. Constable gave another. I would write a book, but I recollect the saying, O that mine enemy would write a book! Nevertheless it is in the journals of Delacroix, the letters of Constable and Van Gogh, Fromentin's book, and now Picasso's mots that the art of painting is most genuinely illuminated. Meyer Schapiro claimed that among the painters who wrote about art only Fromentin gave his thoughts a decided literary form. But the letter has long been recognized as a fecund department of literature; the epistolary style, as T.S. Eliot called it, puts the reader immediately in close connection with the writer like no otherwhat have so many scholars of Shakespeare's sonnets done, but search in vain for precisely that which would have been revealed in those hypothetical letters mankind would love to read?",1973-05-06T05:00:00+0000

Whether or not this great Japanese director knew he was dying of cancer while he was making the film, ""An Autumn Afternoon"" is such a completely realized example of the Ozu art that it seems impossible he did not intend it to be a kind of testament.What Ozu left us is not a style of film-making. That style is so unmistakable that anyone who dared imitate it would risk exile to a faculty position at an obscure institution for film education. He left something a good deal more important, an appreciation of the possibilities of all films.Although Ozu's films are realistic  they're usually about relationships within upper middle-class families  they evoke emotions not only through identification but also through methods more commonly associated with music and other nonrepresentational forms of art, through rhythms and patterns that express the essence of things.Ozu's titles are impossible to keep straight, and one should take care not to confuse ""An Autumn Afternoon"" with ""Late Spring,"" which he made in 1949 and which was released here last midsummer (July).Both films, however, are about aging widowers hanging on to only daughters who have reached marriageable age. There is possibility for even further confusion since Ozu's favorite actor, the lean, handsome, deliberate Chishu Ryu, plays the father in each film.Though the films overlap to important ways, ""An Autumn Afternoon"" is more benignly contemplative and more beautiful than the earlier work. And never for a minute does one mix up its awareness of man's lonely state with anything on the order of pity.Like all of the late Ozu films, ""An Autumn Afternoon"" is about the accommodations we make, not necessarily to get ahead in the world but simply to get along in it with a certain amount of dignity intact. For the aging Chishu Ryu, this is the acknowledgement that his 24-year-old daughter is not indeed, the mere child he has called her, but a woman who must live her own life apart from him. For the daughter, it is the acknowledgement that she has lost the man she wanted to marry and must settle for someone else.Ozu treats these matters coolly, without sentimentality, keeping them at the middle distance at which he photographs them. Yet Ozu's middle distance allows for a kind of metaphorical deep focus. The images are full of odd and disturbing details that often have a kind of delayed-action effect.When, near the end, we see the daughter, a sweet, spirited, very 20th-century girl, dressed in her elaborate, traditional wedding costume, it seems, at first, that Ozu is indulging himself: the very prettiness of the bridal dress conveys a sense of impending damage. Nothing that fragile can survive. Yet Ozu's characters are not fragile. They do survive, and often with a good deal of humor.In one of the nicest sequences iin the film, Ryu, a former naval officer, runs into the man who had been his chief petty officer during the war. They get drunk together and the man, now plump and not entirely dissatisfied with his life as a mechanic, allows himself to speculate on what would have happened had Japan won the war: ""We'd be in New Yorkthe-real thingand the blue-eyed ones would be wearing wigs and chewing gum while plucking their samisens!""In ""An Autumn Afternoon,"" the old culture is giving wayas old Ryu isto time and inevitable change. Ryu's elder son and his wife are scrambling for refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, golf clubs and white leather handbags. There's nothing particularly cheering about that, but it is possible, Ozu seems to suggest, to face these changes without despair. Despair would not just be bad form. It would guarantee defeat that might otherwise be held at bay.""An Autumn Afternoon,"" which was shown for one performance at the first New York Film Festival in 1963, is a profoundly simple, profoundly moving film.",1973-05-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Last Ten Days':Guinness Plays Hitler in Bunker Episode The Cast,"""Adolf,"" Eva Braun says to Hitler at one point during their last 10 days in the Berlin bunker, ""you really are the most incredible person. . . .""The film is called ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days,"" and it seems to be factually correct in all major matters. H. R. Trevor-Roper, the British historian and author (""The Last Days of Hitler""), has given it his seal of approval. As a historial re-enactment, however, ""Hitler"" is about as exciting as a high-minded, parent-approved comic book about the adventures of James Watt and his steam engine.It's only when the screenplay makes its little stabs at what I take to be fiction that it becomes at all interesting and, quite often, dimly funny. As when Eva, just before biting her cyanide capsule, becomes upset because it is apparent that Adolf doesn't give a hang about what happens to the citizens of Berlin, then being laid low by the advancing Soviet Army.""Maybe I never knew you,"" she says with a tear in her eye. It's the sort of realization that in a cartoon would be indicated by the appearance of a light bulb over her head.It is possible that Eva did have such second thoughts. She was in love with Hitler but she wasn't the world's biggest brain. Yet the quality of the speculation in ""Hitler"" is not worthy of what we know and feel about the subject. The speculation is small and routine. It is as if Ennio de Concini, the Italian director who also wrote the Italian screenplay with Maria Pia Fusco and Wolfgang Reinhardt (son of Max), which was then adapted into English by Ivan Moffat, had set out to transform the banality of evil into a film style.The rise of the Third Reich is one of the most fascinating stories of all time, and its collapse one of the most thoroughly satisfying, supplying, as it does, the fundamental dramatic needs for irrevocable revenge and retribution. The written accounts of these eventsby Shirer, Speer, Trevor-Roper, Toland and othersnever cease to fascinate, even when the prose gets as gummy as a Sunday supplement's. It is curious, then, that a fairly serious-minded film should be so superfluous.One principal reason seems to be that no film can possibly present the accumulation of details and facts that make something like Shirer's ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" so riveting. It can present only a pictorial view of things and a selection of details.In ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days,"" it is almost impossible to keep the people straight, with the exception of Adolf Alec Guinness), Eva (Doris Kunstmann) and maybe the Goebbelses. The film doesn't seem to have been directed, or acted, as much as cast, in the waxworks sense. Actors play individual characters not because they are actors but because they resemble the people in life.Sometimes, however, they look very wrong. Adolfo Celi looks awfully Italian as General Krebs. Guinness looks right as Hitler, and that's about allbut then Hitler may be an impossible role. Almost anything even a good actor does with such a role risks prompting a certain amount of unintended hilarity. (There are times when Guinness's Hitler reminded me most of Jack Benny.) Those of us who knew Hitler from contemporary newsreels could, I suspect, respond only to a completely fictional character, not one pictured, as Guinness is, in a supposedly objective way. Miss Kunstmann is more successful, probably because we know less of Eva, and most of the other people are news pictures and studio portraits that have come to vogue life.The film covers the period from April 20 through May 1, 1945, and takes place mostly in the bunker under the Chancellery. For anyone unfamiliar with how Hitler got there, the film supplies a sort of ""the story to date"" outline of Hitler's rise and World II behind the opening credits.",1973-05-10T05:00:00+0000

The bunkers were bulldozed over. The prairie winds were smoothing down the dusty soil over a new grave up on the hill.And the first of the 250 displaced residents began to trickle cautiously back, hours after 120 Indian militants ended their 70day occupation of this historic hamlet.But the damage to private property here was so great and the personal shock so stunning that almost as quickly as the unbelieving residents saw what had been done, they vowed to leave.And tonight, the village of Wounded Knee seemed well on the way to becoming a ghost town.The trading post was a mass of burnt metal and cinders. Trash, dirty clothes and garbage were strewn about. The museum was vandalized. The bridge on the road to Porcupine was destroyed. The paved roads were rutted by the tracks of armored personnel carriers. Bullet holes were everywhere.No ElectricityYards were dug up and the foundations were breached by a network of tunnels and bunkers. There was no telephone service or electricity or water.Hungry and diseased dogs either followed the residents or hid meekly in dark closets. The carcasses of dogs and cattle were scattered throughout the town.We worked so hard for everything, said Mrs. Emma Lansberry, who is 69 years old, and we lost it all. When you're old, you know, you have more to lose. We just don't feel it's worth staying any more.She was standing with her husband, Orville, who is pastor of the Church of God here. The ruins of their home and garage smoldered at their feet. Both structures burned Monday night. And the Lansberrys were returning for the first time since they sneaked from their home the night of Feb. 27 as about 300 members of the American Indian Movement and their supporters seized the town, firing guns and beating drums.Washing Machine BurnedThat was my new washing machine, Mrs. Lansberry said, pointing to a blackened mass. The couple, who lived as missionaries in Chile for 26 years without incident, also lost their only photograph of their only child, a daughter who died when she was 21.Well, dear, Mrs. Lansberry said as she took her husband's arm, we still have each other.Down the town's street Jim and Jan Czywczynski were sifting through the wreckage of their trading post. Last night as darkness fell Mr. Czywczynski said, It's a total loss. I don't know what we're going to do. Maybe I'll know in the morning.Today he knew. We're not coming back, he said, we won't rebuild. We'll try for damages, try to sell and start all over someplace else.At the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church on the hill, the insurgents original headquarters, bullet holes pocked the walls. Spent shell casing littered the floor. Militant Indian slogans and obscene graffiti were painted on the wall. There were bullet holes in statues of Joseph and Mary.Margaret Red Eagle was born in Wounded Knee. Until February she lived here with her husband and children in their new home. But when she eagerly returned this morning, she cried quietly in a bedroom.Her house had been totally redecorated. All her furniture was gone and someone else's had been moved in. Indian paintings were hung on the wall and someone had replaced her curtains.Utensils StolenHer dishes and utensils were gone. The children's toys had disappeared along with a sewing machine, which Mrs. Red Eagle needs to replace the family's stolen clothing supply.This morning she started to clean one room, then quit. I'm getting out of here, she said. They said they wouldn't bother the Oglala people. I don't know why they did this to us.Late today the family left to live in Porcupine, nine miles away.Her nextdoor neighbors, the Red Elk family, did not return at all. They had heard what happened.Since the electricity and water supply were cut in February, their house was used as a toilet.Across the Manderson Road in Cecilia Little Moon's house the floor was ankledeep in trash, play money, ripped mattresses, soiled underwear and books.Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation combed the area today, taking pictures and noting such things as the license numbers of outofstate abandoned, burnedout cars.There was no damage estimate yet for Wounded Knee, but Federal officials said the Government's expense during the occupation by members of the American Indian Movement and its supporters were about $5million.",1973-05-10T05:00:00+0000

But in a surprising finale to the hourlong concert, Mr. Flexner was invited to the podium to direct The Seuffert Band in The Stars and Stripes Forever. It was a first for Mr. Flexner and for the band. Quite an experience, said the historian, who doesn't read music. Several hundred onlookers, shoppers and tourists strolling 42d Street heard the program, which included Dixieland tunes and selections from Pagliacci sung by Sung Kil Kim, a Korean baritone, as well as a performance by the New York City Police Department's Pipe Band of the Emerald Society. Without the research department, Mr. Flexner said later jokingly, I wouldn't have been anything. It was a pleasure to help. Good weather permitting, the Bowery will sponsor its second concert next Wednesday, on the steps of the library, Fifth Avenue at 41st Street.

Michael is head over heels in love with Max (Max Delys), a street hustler who looks like a French version of Joe Dallesandro. Michael, however, is fond of Jane (Jane Forth), a self-described American high-school dropout who has come to Paris to model with her best friend Donna (Donna Jordan), who would sort of like to marry Michael so they could legally adopt Max.This is a film unafraid to ask questions. Will Michael find happiness with Max? (No.) Will Max find satisfaction with Jane? (Not really, since Jane says she gets more excited buying make-up.) Is this sort of thing funny? (Only intermittently.)Were there fewer demands for one's attention, ""L'Amour"" might be worth sitting through for the occasional comic moments, such as Michael's big renunciation scene with Max (""I'm growing older, Max. . . .""), which leaves Michael so shaken that all he can do is crochet. Michael, however, is but a poor, hairy substitute for Sylvia Miles, who handles this sort of comedy better. There is also a nice title song, sweetly sung from time to time by Cass Elliot, and a rather pretty scene where everyone roller skates around the Palais de Chaillot. It looks like a high-fashion layout gone a bit looney.These things simply are not funny or important enough to compete with late-night talk shows, a new album by the Carpenters, the Watergate scandal, kung-fu movies, dining at Blimpie's, and a number-one best seller by Jacqueline Susann.

us,Screen: 'The Offence' at the Festival,"Sidney Lumet's new film, ""The Offence,"" takes place in a suburb of London, not an old suburb but one of those barren new suburbs still in the process of development, where lawns fade into scrubby fields that don't give one a feeling of space as much as emptiness, of vacant lots awaiting overnight transformation into bleak, middle-income housing blocks.The time (probably winter) and the place perfectly reflect the unacknowledged despair contained in almost every frame of this harrowing story, which seems to be about the search for a man who's been luring little schoolgirls into culverts and then raping them.""Seems"" is the proper word because, about halfway through, one becomes aware that the film is not about a manhunt. Rather it is a psychological striptease, about a tough, hard-drinking, hard-headed detective.For some time before the start of the film, Detective Johnson (Sean Connery) has been cracking up, remembering (even if against his better will) the way that suicides have looked when he has found them, the way a murdered child's arm dangled through the slats of a crib, the awkward position of a woman who had been tied to a bed and tortured to death. Other men put these things out of their minds. Johnson cherishes them.As it progresses, ""The Offence,"" for all its elaborate setting of scene and for all its introduction of subsidiary characters (beautifully played by Trevor Howard and Vivien Merchant, among others), sort of gets smaller and smaller, instead of bigger. The entire film, it turns out, exists for a single sequence, a brutal station-house confrontation between the detective and his prime suspect (Ian Bannen), between a lower-class psychotic and a middle-class neurotic, between a closet sadist and an admitted masochist. In a sense, they are lovers, made for each other.It's highly theatrical  perhaps just a little too highly theatrical for the more or less realistic context  but it's been staged by Lumet for maximum effect. The revelations explode predictably, like the ingredients of a 24-hour cold capsule, but the dramatic impact is real while one is watching it. Connery and Bannen are so fine, and the feelings prompted so intense, that I wouldn't be at all surprised if the sequence could stand on its own, as if it were a one-act play. Everything that has gone before seems to have been so much vamping for time.Some of the things that have gone before also tend to detract from this climax. Since it's so clear to the audience that Detective Johnson has long since come apart, it's difficult to understand why the men who work with him haven't recognized the fact. That may be splitting hairs. ""The Offence"" has one big, carefully worked out, dramatic moment, which is more than most movies have these days.",1973-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Harrad Experiment' Opens at Baronet,"If I can believe the promotional material floating around, almost all the adults in North America who read anything have read Robert H. Rimmer's novel ""The Harrad Experiment."" The remaining half-dozen of you need only know that it concerns a special Eastern college, Harrad, where a super-bright group of special students live in a co-ed dorm with the express purpose of sharing meaningful sexual experiences.The book came out in 1966, and it was supposed to be prophetic. To an extent it was prophetic. Many Eastern college students do live in co-ed dorms now. The last group I heard of (college to be nameless), the girls were complaining that the boys had retreated to one part of the dorm and were plotting some nineteen-seventies version of panty raids.Nothing like that happens in the book; all the students are much too busy discovering themselves and exploring the miracle (I think I've got the prose right) of one another. Nothing like that happens in the movie that has just been made from the novel either; the students are all too busy working out lasting monogamous relationships. Despite the splendid opportunities offered, Ted Post's ""The Harrad Experiment"" isn't even soft-core pornography; it is something more like soap opera with a little frontal nudity. This is the kind of movie in which never does flesh touch flesh without a choir of dulcet strings on the soundtrack to sanctify the meeting.But into any bowl of mush a little sweetener may fall. The goodness in this case comes not from the students  a handsome though unexciting lot  but from their mentors, the kindly pipe-sucking, Nietszche-quoting Dr. Tenhausen (James Whitmore), and his lovely wife, Margaret (Tippi Hedren). Whether jointly conducting their class in human values, protecting academic standards (""Thank God, you screened Valerie Latrobe! I shudder to think what she might have done to Harrad. And she did so well on the writtens . . .""), or advising students of the need to disrobe for the 7:30 yoga seminarthey are the spirit that guides the school. They are so uncommonly, solemnly, unintentionally funny that they almost justify seeing ""The Harrad Experiment,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater.",1973-05-12T05:00:00+0000

On the hill he placed the house, a series of three pavilions, the largest housing the living room and flanked on either side by the bedroom wing and the kitchendining room wing. All around the perimeter, Platner built fieldstone terraces some with insets of flower beds that surround the house in its own miniature park. The concept is similar to a chateau in the Loire valley, the architect says, but on a smaller scale. There is even a pond, scooped out and fed by a spring in the hillside, that catches the house in reflection (vignette, left). Platner resisted the trend to sculptural geometric architecture for his family's home.

By the passage of time, much time, and the longings of many people. If that is so, how, wonders the author of Once in the Saddle, could the world have created around the cowboy a seemingly deathless myth, when the cowboy's actual earthly chapter spanned a period of only 30 years? And that only a short hundred years ago? The first herd of cattle went up the trail from Texas in 1866, the last in 1896. Out of that brief period came the eternals of the myth: heroes by Owen Wister, romance by Zane Grey, action by Street & Smith, glamour by Hollywood, and songs by almost everyone.",1973-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Approached this way, the Frenchman's religiously inspired works become part of a scholastic effort to explain the universe to us.

She had no trouble in persuading John Alexander to take on the title role. It helped that the tenor had never sung it before, but he also has worked with Miss Caldwell in the past and enjoyed it, he likes to sing in French and he relishes the challenge of a new part. He has no objection that she is restoring the opening Fontainebleau scene, giving him more to sing and making a long opera longer, or that she has, unearthed a duet no one elSe seems to know about for Carlo and King Philip to add to Act IV.",1973-05-13T05:00:00+0000

He outhustled the dog for it and returned it to the owner as the eagerness of a small boy shone all over this human retriever. I can use this better than the dog, said little Bobby. Keep it then, son, said the man. And that is how the Riggs career was formally, if oddly, launched. It carried to championships at Wimbledon land Forest Hills.

us,Film: 'Dirty Little Billy':Legend of Gunslinging Kid Explored in Film The Cast,"Credit the team headed by Stan Dragoti, the television commercials director who is making his movie bow with ""Dirty Little Billy,"" with giving us a realistically raw view of the beginnings of the Billy the Kid legend. Unfortunately, Billy, floundering in a search for roots in sleazy, muddy Coffeyville, Kan., and the vicious or callous unwashed types he's involved with remain largely vague, unresolved figures brawling and killing on a primitive landscape.Billy, who is portrayed by Michael J. Pollard in smiling, almost witless fashion, revolts against the hard farm life forced on him by his stepfather. Thereafter he's befriended by the town badman, Richard Evans. Lee Purcell, as Evans's prostitute girlfriend, initiates Billy into one aspect of manhood. Eventually, Coffeyville's puritanical element, led by Charles Aidman  who, for unexplained reasons, is dallying with Billy's motherdrives Billy and his pal out of town after gunning down the hapless Miss Purcell.Our callow hero, once inept with guns, uses them with bloody effect to protect his friend in a final shootout with a gang of thieving renegades. And, one may assume, Billy the Dessperado now emerges full-blown as he happily packs his six-shooters and trudges off into the sunset with his mentor.The look of an authentic period and place is captured in the dirt, sloppy roads, rickety buildings and tattered itinerants who never owned fancy 10-gallon hats, spurs or chaps. And the unremitting struggle for survival is also starkly spotlighted, especially in a couple of brutal fights staged without glorification of the principals.""Dirty Little Billy"" projects an unvarnished picture of the Old West, even if the contributions of the script and the dour Charles Aidman, the misused Lee Purcell and the rough Richard Evans are unconvincing. And one is inclined to agree with a confused Billy when he asks, ""What's all this rushing about for?""",1973-05-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Red Smith,"BALTIMORE. May 20While the sovereign Secretariat lorded it over the American racing scene yesterday, his most persistent rival of last year was mounting a challenge that could result in a classic confrontation three weeks hence. Network television cameras and the biggest outpouring of horseplayers in Maryland history had eyes only for Pimlico, where Secretariat demolished the field in the 98th Preakness Stakes. But meanwhile, back in Elmont, L. L, a pert and plucky little colt named Stop the Music was ripping off the fastest mile ever run at Belmont Park by horse or scalded cat. If Stop the Music doesn't pick up the gauntlet and Pancho Martin doesn't cool off, the New York Racing Association may have to offer trading stamps to drum up opposition for Secretariat in the Belmont. The big colt's smashing victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness have convinced most horsemen that to oppose his final bid for the Triple Crown would be a waste of their own stock.",1973-05-21T05:00:00+0000

His latest novel consists, for the most part, of a clutch of dogeared dogmatisms about writing and it reads as if believes them. Though Tom Metfield averages 30,000 year from his book, nobody, even in these inflationary times, would give a penny for his thoughts.

At Barnegat, Meyer's Yacht Basin reports sea bass and ling being caught by bottomfishing boats offshore. Scattered stripped bass are about, but more are being taken in the bay than in the inlet or ocean. A few small bluefish have been reported. The evercooperative tilefish, for those who enjoy a long trip and deepwater fishing, are available. At Seaside Park, N.

us,The Screen: 'Emperor of the North Pole' Arrives:Marvin Heads Cast of Stiffs and Tramps The Cast Action Melodrama Has Hobo Jungle Plot,"Robert Aldrich's ""Emperor of the North Pole"" is a fine, elaborately staged action melodrama set mostly on the freight trains and in the hobo jungles of the American Northwest during the Great Depression.It's about bindle stiffs and tramps and a psychotic trainman named. The Shack, a man who keeps order with a chain in one hand and a hammer in the other, thus becoming known, not surprisingly, as ""the meanest conductor alive."" To those of you who have always thought of conductors as a docile breedtheir worst fault being an occasional inaudibility when coming into East Hampton (or was that Amagansett?)the film will be an expos not without its silly moments. I admit I found it most entertaining.""Emperor of the North Pole"" is a king-of-the-hill movie. It sees all life in terms of physical self-assertion, in terms of beating the other guy, not because there is anything valuable to win, but rather because if you don't win you lose, and when you lose, you're nothing. Absolute zero. It is a game a lot of small boys play all their lives. It is also one that's been overloaded with metaphysical associations in fiction romanticizing mountain climbing, bull fighting, boxing and big-game hunting, but never, as far as I can remember, the bumming of freights.Christopher Knopf, who wrote the original screenplay, is not without his impulses to set ""Emperor of the North Pole"" in a larger, more meaningful context, but usually he resists them. More important, he has created almost perfect action-movie characters, people who can't bore us with their earlier histories because they don't have any. They exist solely within the time and the action of the film itself. When it stops, they vanish, but we have had a sensational ride.With his last film, ""Ulzana's Raid,"" and this new one, Aldrich clinches a claim to being the best director of this kind of film now at work. This is not because he plays down to a lower class of film but because he takes it seriously enough to get splendid performances from his actors and to stage the action sequences with a dizzying vividness and accuracy. Compare the technical proficiency of the various fights that Aldrich has staged here, a lot of them aboard moving freight cars, with the lethargic, dumbly bloody gunfights in Sam Peckinpah's ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid."" It's no contest.Boiled down to its irreducible minimum, which is not difficult, the story of ""Emperor of the North Pole"" is about the vow of A-No. 1 (Lee Marvin), a jaunty, aging hobo, acknowledged by his peers to be the champion of champions, to ride the freight captained (or conductored) by The Shack (Ernest Borgnine), from somewhere or other to Eugene, Ore. Nobody has ever successfully freeloaded. The Shack's train and, indeed, even before the title credits, we are treated to the sight of one of The Shack's hobo victims.The suspense of the film (which is so hugely violent that its PG rating is a mystery), is unrelenting and the performances first-rate, including that of Keith Carradine, a son of John, as a loudmouth kid to whom Marvin tries to teach the rules of the road. The only ludicrous thing in the film is a song sung behind the credits. It tells us, if my notes do not deceive me, that ""a train's not a man, and a man's not a train, for a man can do things a train never can.""",1973-05-25T05:00:00+0000

us,This Is Cinerama-Or Is It?:This Is Cinerama-Or Is It?,"""THIS IS CINERAMA,"" the first feature program in what was once a giant, three-negative film process, has returned to New York where it originally opened Sept. 30, 1952, becoming such an immediate box-office hit that it made Wall Street investors careless with their money and prompted Hollywood technicians, who hadn't been very busy since receiving sound, to take another look at what God (and His representatives on earth) had wrought.However, the film that is now playing at the Ziegfeld Theater is not quite the same ""This Is Cinerama"" that caused the sensation at the Broadway Theater 20 years ago. The program itself is the same  including the roller coaster ride, the snatch of a performance of Handel's ""Messiah"" by the Long Island Choral Society, the sight-seeing in Edinburgh, Venice and Cypress Gardens, and the climactic air tour of the United States, all, more or less chaperoned by Lowell Thomas (on screen and soundtrack) in a fashion that lays more stress on the cheeriness of existence in Mr. Thomas's America than on real facts. ""Crater Lake, Mr. Thomas exclaims ??? Cinerama plane flies over the deepest lake in North America. ""Its bottom has never been found!"" (Its bottom must have been found by somebody since the Encyclopedia Britannica says Crater Lake, Ore., is 1,932 ??? shabbier. Cinerama has been perfected until it's become something less than it first was in the early 1950s, when lots of people expected it to revolutionize movies. After all that original hubbub, which prompted the introduction of now-almost-forgotten processes like CinemaScope and VistaVision, movies are somewhat better visually and aurally, and they are certainly wider, but that's about all.The original Cinerama process, invented by Fred Waller and first used by the United States armed forces to instruct aerial gunners during World War II, involved the use of three interlocking projectors projecting three separate 35-mm film strips onto a deeply curved screen covering an arc of 146 degrees. As long as the process made use of three different negatives, the resulting picture was always slightly marred by lines where the images overlapped, and by a color imbalance among the three images, but it provided a brilliance of image definition never matched before or since, as well as a remarkable sense of audience participation because of the effect on our peripheral vision.This Cinerama process was a gimmick, and a marvelous gimmick, one that returned movies to what they are by that original definition: movies. Movies needn't always be movies. They can also be films, film or, at their intellectually fanciest, cinema, but movies also are important, not as literature, but as vicarious thrills, allowing us to experience sensations that we can otherwise safely experience only in dreams.""This Is Cinerama"" and the four subsequent Cinerama features released through 1958 were all basically journalism of a sort that would look square even in the pages of the National Geographic. As travelogues, however, they were superb. When we flew into Cairo in ""Seven Wonders of the World"" (1956), we saw Cairo as we'd never be able to see it on a commercial flight (unless we were in the pilot's cabin) and certainly not as we'd see it in a conventional film.In one panoramic sweep of amazing clarity, we saw not a blur of a portion of a city, but the relationship of the entire city to the Nile, to the pyramids at Giza, to the great desert itself, which just suddenly begins were the irrigated green ends.In these three-panel Cinerama films, we landed jet fighters aboard aircraft carriers, shot rapids in India, and bobsledded down Alps in Switzerland. They were immense fun even when Mr. Thomas might be droning on about ""the sublime mysteries"" of one Asian temple or another, or preparing us for a ""great scoop,"" the Milan Opera's presentation of the triumphal march from ""Aida"" (which turns out to look a good deal like the opening of New York's Festival of San Gennaro with a slightly oriental flavor).The three-panel Cinerama films were expensive to shoot and expensive to show, and the two attempts to make conventional narrative films in the process""The Wonderful World of The Brothers Grimm"" (1962) and ""How The West Was Won"" (1963) quickly proved that three panels were two too many, and that the huge screen had the effect of inhibiting a narrative instead of enhancing it.After a certain amount of work, Cinerama came up with a single-negative process, in fact a single-strip, 70-mm process, which is better, more flexible for story-telling, but never can compete with the definition and clarity of the pictures provided by three 35-mm images locked together.The version of ""This Is Cinerama"" at the Ziegfeld currently is the original three-negatives printed down to fit into a 70-mm frame. The lines (which never really bothered me) are still there, but the picture and color quality have deteriorated to such an extent that the movie sometimes doesn't look as clear as an ordinary 35-mm picture. Indeed, at the presentation I attended last week, even that portion of the film in which Mr. Thomas is introduced in 35-mm black-and-white looks to have been shot about the same time as those portions of ""The Great Train Robbery"" he shows us. It also seems as if a certain amount of important pictorial information at either side of the screen has been chopped off. Equally important (or disappointing) was the quality of the sound in much of the presentation.One of the most innovative aspects of the original Cinerama show was its introduction of seven-track magnetic sound (""we call it'stereophonic sound,'"" Mr. Thomas says portentously, and the long-stereo-oriented audience at the Ziegfeld laughs). There are speakers in the auditorium at the Ziegfeld, but the quality of sound reproduction behind the screen sometimes seemed surprisingly tinny.There were other unintentional laughs at the performance I saw. Early in the film, Mr. Thomas tries to explain persistence-of-vision. ""If it were not possible,"" he says, ""the movie you are looking at would only be a blur."" Which, at that point, it was.The passage of time has not been kind to Mr. Thomas's narration. When the Cinerama plane flies over Washington and he says something patriotic about the Pentagon, the audience boos. It then cheers wildly when he introduces the concluding section of the film with the once-innocent line: ""Now for a climax! A culmination!""A lower order of fakery has replaced the beautiful illusion of the original presentation. The Ziegfeld has no real curtains to mask the screen, and instead projects the image of a curtain on the screen at the beginning of the show and between the acts.Even with these imperfections, especially the poor picture quality, the show does offer a greater sense of audience participation (if you sit in the center of the orchestra) than you'll probably get in most other movies these days. At the end of the show's first half, just after the Milan Opera's presentation of the march from ""Aida,"" when the word ""Intermission"" was flashed on the screen, a woman sitting in front of me turned to her husband and asked: ""Is that for them or us?""",1973-05-27T05:00:00+0000

Without them, they achieved a lightfilled house, rimmed by decks and opened to the outdoors with wide windows.

The long deck faces south to the ocean and looks over a grassy plateau where the Lowensteins play volleyball and badminton.
