Ricci played in his first game since breaking his right index finger in the season opener at Boston on Oct. 6. He tapped a rebound of Tony Horacek's shot past Jon Casey to gave Philadelphia a 3-0 advantage 3 minutes 6 seconds into the second period. (AP) Bruins 3, Blues 2: Cam Neely scored an unassisted goal at 3:14 of overtime as Boston, playing at home, ended St. Louis's seven-game unbeaten streak. Neely, who gave Boston a 2-1 lead with his sixth goal in the second period, knocked a St. Louis skater off the puck in the Boston zone, setting up a 2-on-1 breakaway. Using Bob Carpenter as a decoy, Neely held the puck and then sent a 15-foot wrist shot past Curtis Joseph. The victory extended Boston's unbeaten streak to four games. Brett Hull scored his 16th goal of the season for St. Louis. (AP) Red Wings 5, Maple Leafs 4: Johan Garpenlov of Detroit scored two goals and Steve Yzerman added the 300th of his eight-year career last night in Detroit.

Sandy Alomar Jr. of the Cleveland Indians got the other hit for the United States team. The Japanese went ahead with a three-run third against Dennis Boyd of Montreal. Cecil Fielder, who returned to Japan as a hero after becoming the first major leaguer in 13 years to hit 50 homers, went 0 for 3, including two strikeouts. Fielder played for Hanshin in 1989. (AP) N.H.L. Capitals Surprise Kings, 4-3 Michael Pivonka's goal early in the final period last night broke a tie and gave Washington its first victory over Los Angeles at the Capital Centre since 1987. Pivonka broke a 3-3 tie with 16 minutes 21 seconds to play when he skated into the Kings' zone, used the defenseman Marty McSorely as a screen and beat Kelly Hrudey with a 50-foot slap shot for his fourth goal of the season and second game-winner in three games. Washington won its third in a row and beat the Kings at home for the first time in four games since a 10-3 victory on Dec. 6, 1987. Los Angeles, which lost to the Rangers on Wednesday night, has lost consecutive games for the first time this season. (AP) GOLF Brown Leads in L.P.G.A. Event Nancy Brown shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday to take a two-shot lead after the first round of the Mazda Japan Classic in Hanno, Japan, the final L.P.G.A. Tour event of the season.

us,An Iff and a Butt,"the Water Genie told Haroun about the Ocean of the Streams of Story, and even though he was full of a sense of hopelessness and failure the magic of the Ocean began to have an effect on Haroun. He looked into the water and saw that it was made up of a thousand thousand thousand and one different currents, each one a different color, weaving in and out of one another like a liquid tapestry of breathtaking complexity; and Iff explained that these were the Streams of Story, that each colored strand represented and contained a single tale. Different parts of the Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was in fact the biggest library in the universe. And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join up with other stories and so become yet other stories; so that unlike a library of books, the Ocean of the Streams of Story was much more than a storeroom of yarns.

The first thing to know is what your interest rate is. The average rate is 18.8 percent a year, but lower rates are available. Last year, total bank-card spending was about $216 billion, or alomost half of all credit-card spending. If you do not pay off the balance each month, it's wise to know some things about your credit agreement that bans tend not to publicize. Grace Period: Time between purchase and end of billing cycle when interest is not charged. If the previous balance is carried over, there is no grace period, and you will have to pay interest. Interest Rates: Fixed rates can be increased with little notice. Check every statement for the rate being charged. Rates often rise when credit-card accounts are sold to antoher bank, increasingly common these days. Cash Advance: There is no grace period, and interest is calculated immediately. There is a growing trend among banks to add a fee for each transaction as well.",1990-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"WALTZING IN THE ATTIC. By P. B. Parris. (Doubleday, $18.95.) P. B. Parris's first novel spans 60 years in the life of Hannah Meier, a woman so oppressed she bears more resemblance to the mice skittering across the attic floor than she does to the young girl who once waltzed in front of its mirrors. Living under the iron thumb of her dogmatic father, then of her erratic brother and illegitimate sons, Hannah finally cracks. One senses a better novel lurking in this saga of a rural Nebraska family ruled by Bible-thumping patriarchs whose hypocrisy is topped only by their ignorance. But in the hands of a clumsy first-person narrator -- Hannah herself -- the material rarely rises above the level of bad television. There are certainly enough florid plot twists to fuel a mini-series: a car wreck that paralyzes the narrator's sister and kills her boyfriend, an incestuous rape and a baby born during a tornado, no less. What finally trips Hannah's wire is the sight of her brother and sons sitting glassy-eyed in front of a pornographic videotape. And her actions trigger the sort of blood bath we now find almost daily in the morning newspapers. In the final pages of ""Waltzing in the Attic,"" spent in the crazy labyrinth of Hannah's mind, the novel loses its pedestrian quality and approaches art. But by now it's too late.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

In his first novel, ""The Lover of History,"" 28-year-old Jonathan Dee has much to say, as well as a story to tell. Conjuring up a vividly evoked Manhattan where ""yellow taxis darted in and out of each other's company like fish,"" Mr. Dee constructs a cat's cradle of connections out of three characters' relationships to one other, to their personal histories and to events unfolding in the world around them. Diane Kendall and her roommate, Robert Warner (always referred to by their last names), live a cold existence where ""eating alone seemed the norm."" Although they've occupied a thinly partitioned bedroom for two years, they barely know each other. Kendall hates her job as an engineer at an all-news radio station and grows weary of her lover Julian's lack of ambition to move beyond singing advertising jingles. Then the American Secretary of State is assassinated in the tiny island nation of Colozan and the United States declares war -- and the murder and its formulaic reportage in the media become catalysts for varying degrees of growth in each character. Julian, the innocuous charmer who signs petitions without reading them, grows least. Kendall, however, sees links between her alienation from her personal history and her estrangement from the larger currents of life; she recognizes that ""the source of things might be found outside herself"" and starts edging beyond Julian's sphere. Most intriguing is the high-minded if sanctimonious Warner, the lover of history of the title, a teacher who urges his pampered prep-school students to see their role in and responsibility for the larger world, yet is himself adrift in time and place. Some of Mr. Dee's pre-Iraq political gambits now seem obsolete, but more often they prove prophetic.

The haute literati may have been agog when Joni Evans was replaced last week by Harold Evans, no relation, as publisher at Random, but Miss Evans insisted it was simply a matter of finally getting what she wanted after three years. And that is to head a smaller unit within the company that will publish books under her own imprint. Mr. Evans, too, may be getting something special -- besides one of the premiere jobs in publishing. In 1982, he left The Times of London, where he had been a legendary editor for 14 years, after repeated conflicts with the paper's publisher, Rupert Murdoch. As Random House publisher one one of his first big projects will be Mr. Murdoch's memoirs, which the publisher recently acquired. He said he was already sending Mr. Murdoch a letter saying, in part, ""The wheel of fortune makes me your publisher as you used to be mine.

In ""PowerShift,"" as in his earlier books ""Future Shock"" and ""The Third Wave,"" the provocative social thinker Alvin Toffler urges us to contemplate, anticipate and act upon the extraordinary economic, social and political changes we face at the end of the 20th century. Mr. Toffler sees wide-ranging connections among the many separate events taking place in all these spheres. Thus the breakup of the Communist bloc, Michael Milken's exploitation of junk bonds and the increasing influence and sophistication of computer networks are all only symptoms of a larger ""powershift"" throughout the world. Bit by bit, in nations and in giant corporations alike, Mr. Toffler argues, the vast stores of information generated and made widely available by computer technology and by the mass media have taken power away from the centralized few at the top and given more to consumers, voters, workers and small businessmen. This has coincided with the growth of what Mr. Toffler calls our ""super-symbolic"" economy, one that is primarily based not on the production of goods but on the creation and dissemination of information, images and ideas. ""PowerShift"" is dense with jargon and buzz words: ""For the new fact is that, as nations make the transition toward the advanced, super-symbolic economy, they need more horizontal self-regulation and less top-down control."" And as is almost inevitable with an attempt at so sweeping a synthesis, some readers may grow uncomfortable with Mr. Toffler's relentless barrage of generalizations. These flaws should not overshadow his larger contribution, however. By placing the accelerated changes of our current information age in the larger perspective of history, Mr. Toffler helps us to face the future with less wariness and more understanding.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

That's the message of ""Keeper of the Gate,"" a behind-the-scenes saga written by Selwa Roosevelt, the Reagan Administration's chief of protocol. Wearing certain colors, serving certain foods or beverages, proffering certain gifts, sitting a certain way would be sufficient to set off an international incident, she tells us. To work in protocol also requires forbearance (in a fit of pique, England's Prince Phillip slammed the door of an armored car in Mrs. Roosevelt's face), diplomacy (Mrs. Roosevelt managed to charm the Moroccan protocol chief, who was insulted that the United States was offering only five limousines for a state visit) and an economy-sized sense of humor. The stories Mrs. Roosevelt tells are frequently funny and revealing. That's what's good about this book. The problem is that Mrs. Roosevelt comes across as self-righteous (""I believed in the shining City on the Hill -- and when [Ronald Reagan] asked me to join his administration, I was grateful and ready to do my small bit to illuminate the American dream""), patronizing (""My protocol officers preferred the black African visitors above all others. With only a few exceptions the Africans were the kindest, the most gentle and compassionate. They . . . looked to my staff for guidance about everything""), and overly hostile toward Israel (""Terrorism was introduced into the Middle East,"" she writes, ""as an instrument of national liberation by none other than the Israelis themselves"").",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

It is a problem that, for all his verbal cleverness, Liebling never entirely solves."" One is tempted to reply that, in fact, A. J. Liebling is the only boxing writer who ever worked his way around this contradiction. The reason -- as readers of ""A Neutral Corner,"" a collection of Liebling's previously uncollected boxing essays edited by Fred Warner and James Barbour, who teach English at the University of New Mexico, are quick to discover -- is that he was a great journalist. Unlike the celebrated boxing writers of today, Liebling went to a prize fight to report it, not experience it. Ms. Oates, Norman Mailer and others who cover only an occasional heavyweight championship fight always seem to be groping for the meaning of boxing; Liebling found meaning in boxing. Of course Liebling, who died in 1963, was fortunate enough to have lived in the last era when there were enough good fighters around to sustain interest in boxing more than once every two or three years. Not that he was all that taken with the era that inspired his best boxing pieces: ""Nineteen-fifty was no Golden Age of boxing, but, compared to 1960, it was at least gold-plated."" (But then, as he himself cautioned, ""the exact period at which it was better . . . varies in direct ratio with the age of the fellow talking about it."") Liebling managed to find just enough gold, and, like Pauline Kael writing about bad movies, when his subjects were dull he turned lead into gold.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

A MAINE SUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM","I CANNOT GET YOU CLOSE ENOUGH: Three Novellas. By Ellen Gilchrist. (Little, Brown, $19.95.) There must be a family tree pinned up on the wall in Ellen Gilchrist's study. It's exceedingly leggy, outlining how all the characters she has been writing about for the last 10 years are related -- and it's covered with kudzu, of course, since Ms. Gilchrist (who won the National Book Award in 1984 for her short-story collection ""Victory Over Japan"") is an aged-in-the-oak Southerner, indeed a former poet laureate of Mississippi. In writing the three novellas that compose ""I Cannot Get You Close Enough,"" she shook that tree and out fell various members of the Hand clan from Charlotte, N.C., like the writer Anna Hand and Daniel, her darling, drunken brother, both of whom appeared in ""The Anna Papers."" ""I Cannot Get You Close Enough"" updates that earlier novel and fills in its ellipses. Still, it's something more beguiling than yet another series of chapters in a family saga; it's an invention that's pure Gilchrist, a screwball fugue on the theme of love, loosely patterned after ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" It has its own Helena and Hermia -- Daniel's two difficult teen-age daughters, the fair Jessie and the half-Cherokee Olivia -- and its amorous fairy queen, reincarnated as crazy cousin Crystal Manning from New Orleans. With other familiar Gilchrist characters, they venture out of Dixie to spend a summer in Maine (taking in a production of Shakespeare's comedy along the way). On New England's rocky coast the fairy love dust flies, while the rusticators also endure marriage wars, a missing-child scare, boyfriend poaching and a surprise pregnancy. Some of Ms. Gilchrist's characters seem at first a little stereotypical, but it is this writer's way to wrestle down cliches, giving them eccentric contours, spontaneity and pathos. And always she takes the long, comic view of her characters' frailties, for only through the chaos they create, she seems to suggest, do family trees writhe toward the light.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Bechtle of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, found the special circumstances that warrant an exception: impeachment and disbarment proceedings, Judge Bechtle said, would be ""long, humiliating and burdensome"" and ""substantial punishment"" in themselves. So he gave Judge Aguilar six months in prison, 1,000 hours of community service and $2,000 in fines. Defense lawyers, who plan to appeal the conviction, said Judge Aguilar was nonetheless ""thrilled"" with the sentence; they had argued for leniency on the ground that he did not received any money or other benefits.

It was only the beginning of the difficult years for Mary Wilson of the Supremes. The year was 1970. Florence Ballard had been fired from the trio; Diana Ross, the lead singer, performed her final concert with the group before pursuing a solo career, and Ms. Wilson was soon to discover that only $100,000, not hundreds of thousands, had actually been placed in her account by her record company. In ""Supreme Faith,"" Ms. Wilson's sequel to her memoir ""Dreamgirl,"" she gives a broader behind-the-scenes look not only at the popular singing group but also at Berry Gordy's record empire, Motown, which in the 1960's recorded many of America's top black artists. The story she tells, with Patricia Romanowski, her collaborator on ""Dreamgirl,"" is not a pretty one. Corruption, financial mismanagement and favoritism were commonplace under Mr. Gordy's reign, Ms. Wilson charges. Unfortunately, much of ""Supreme Faith"" reads like a vendetta against Berry Gordy, Motown and particularly Diana Ross. (Miss Ross is mentioned 20 times in the preface alone.) Devout Supremes fans will be more fascinated by the chapters devoted to Ms. Wilson's private life, her love affairs with Steve McQueen and Flip Wilson, her marriage to an abusive husband, her children and her solo career. These sections are a quick and entertaining read. But when it comes to settling old scores, perhaps Ms. Wilson should have taken the advice of that old Supremes hit and stopped in the name of love.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

He'll share a racy joke, grumble about the state of the world, make faces at solemn moments, gripe and snicker at signs that he's not getting any younger. For their second album, ""Vol. 3"" (Warner Brothers 26324; all three formats), the Traveling Wilburys have forged a collective persona a lot like that uncle. From the youngest Wilbury, 37-year-old Tom Petty, to the oldest, 49-year-old Bob Dylan, they're ready to lead rock into an unseemly middle age.

us,The Camera Does Lie,"In February 1982, National Geographic published a cover photo of the Great Pyramids of Giza, one of which had been repositioned by means of a new computer graphics technology. The earth moved in the world of photography. Although photographs had been altered in various ways almost from the beginning, the degree of manipulation possible had increased dramatically. One could efficiently add, subtract or move parts of a photographic image without leaving any evidence. Fred Ritchin, in his illustrated book of essays, IN OUR OWN IMAGE. The Coming Revolution in Photography: How Computer Technology Is Changing Our View of the World (Aperture, Paper, $15.95), explains how this technology works and speculates on the ways it will evolve; its implications for photography and, in particular, for photojournalism concern him deeply. Mr. Ritchin, a former director of photography for The New York Times Magazine and the founding director of the photojournalism program at the International Center for Photography, makes it clear that the ethical and esthetic issues involved affect all of us. If we can no longer rely on photography as our witness of time and place, he writes, then what we perceive as reality is suddenly malleable. Mr. Ritchin sees potential harm -- an almost infinite capacity for deception -- in the use of these technologies, as well as a great opportunity for the renewal of a medium that he feels has lost much of its power in recent years. Mr. Ritchin brings to his discussion a passionate interest in the social role of photography -- which, he says, should challenge our easy assumptions about the world by reflecting its complexity and richness.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Nance, a lawyer and a former airline pilot, has made something of a career cataloguing the flood of changes that airline deregulation has brought to the industry and the traveling public. His first book, ""Splash of Colors,"" depicted the bankruptcy of Braniff Airlines. ""Blind Trust,"" Mr. Nance's best-selling second book, argued that deregulation has led to an erosion of safety margins. Now, in his first novel, Mr. Nance offers a behind-the-scenes look at the political jockeying that follows the crash of an airliner on a rain-soaked runway in Kansas City, Mo. In particular, he dissects the workings of the National Transportation Safety Board, the independent Government agency that, he suggests, is not so independent after all. Politically hungry officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Force and the fictional North America Airlines all try to sway the board's investigation. ""Final Approach"" is at its best as a gripping aeronautical whodunit. But the book seems overly ambitious, with a cumbersome plot that includes the possible assassination of a Congressman (a diversion Mr. Nance never fully resolves), a military cover-up and no fewer than two intra-office love affairs. The result is a sometimes turbulent read. Mr. Nance has gone to considerable pains to be technically accurate, and the novel occasionally bogs down in the fine points of flight-control systems or Federal rules that govern flying. But for the most part, ""Final Approach"" goes down smoothly, leaving readers something to chew on next time they board an airplane.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

A professional waterproofing contractor said it would cost us $9,500 to waterproof the house.

us,A Narco-Military State,"IN THE TIME OF THE TYRANTS. Panama: 1968-1990. By R. M. Koster and Guillermo Sanchez. (Norton, $22.95.) Latin American armies have earned an evil reputation in the 20th century by corrupting the soldier's traditional role of protector into that of oppressor. Panama, though never an exemplary democracy, came relatively late to this unhappy situation. In 1968, its colonels engineered a coup d'etat that placed one military leader or another in control for the next 21 years. R. M. Koster, an American who teaches English at Florida State University's Panama Canal branch, and Guillermo Sanchez, a Panamanian journalist and the premier columnist of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, have joined forces to write a scathing history of these two decades of humiliation and corruption that is full of enough scoundrels, fools and genuine heroes to stock an old-time melodrama -- Omar Torrijos, for example, whose blend of charisma and radical slogans charmed Fidel Castro, the domestic Communists and naive intellectuals like Graham Greene, while his moderate actions reassured the United States. The authors, however, see in Torrijos the roots of the disasters that followed his accidental death in 1981, disasters such as the ascent of Manuel Noriega, whose limitless greed resulted in Panama being turned into a narco-military state. Opponents like Hugo Spadafora, who threatened Noriega's control, were murdered, preferably through torture; nearly everyone else was bought off. Looming over this catastrophe was, of course, the Colossus of the North, the United States, whose fears of instability and subversion led to a policy marked by callous stupidity, the end result of which was last December's invasion. ""In the Time of the Tyrants"" must read much as Mr. Sanchez' columns did: sarcastic, angry, witty, erudite and full of rumor, innuendo, insights and genuine news. It is by turns entertaining and horrifying, but always provocative.",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"FAR AFIELD. By Susanna Kaysen. (Vintage Contemporaries, Paper, $9.95.) After losing his suitcase en route from Harvard, Jonathan Brand arrives in the Faroe Islands with little more than a thick sweater, a notebook and his romantic ideals. He has planned a yearlong anthropological study of this remote region of the North Atlantic and cheerfully expects a cultural adventure -- a notion that is soon punctured when he settles in a tiny fishing community where everyday life is ""composed of hundreds of unpleasant tasks."" Overwhelmed by the desolate and rain-swept landscape, suspicious inhabitants and terrible food, Jonathan sinks into sullenness and lethargy. But as the taciturn villagers begin to accept him and teach him their rituals, Jonathan begins to realize that he is the most curious social specimen in the place. Once he shelves sentimentality and sees humanity as something to participate in, not to examine, his initiation into real life begins. ""Far Afield"" thus comes to the none too remarkable conclusions that the simplest of cultures are often the most complex and that the line between observer and observed is sometimes blurred. Susanna Kaysen, the author of a previous novel, ""Asa, as I Knew Him,"" deserves praise for her confident and polished prose. Her artistry, however, cannot compensate for a drab main character and a dull plot. For an anthropologist, Jonathan has scant curiosity about other peoples or cultures, and through his eyes the alien landscape in which this story is so intrinsically rooted fails to come fully to life. We are left feeling that the novel, like the sea gulls Jonathan sees bobbing over the ocean, travels ""long distances to get precisely nowhere.""",1990-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,I Shot 10 Presidents,"For just about a half century, George Tames behind the lens of a camera has been a fixture in Washington. That rarissima avis , a native Washingtonian, he was born to Greek immigrant parents and grew up in the shadow of the Capitol. Government and those who run it were an early and constant source of fascination. Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Tames household hero, was the first President to be a subject (""I didn't know whether to light a candle, kiss his ring, or chant the Kyrie Eleison,"" Mr. Tames writes). Mr. Tames had an easy way with his subjects, and was close enough so that he could catch asides and offhand remarks that the political leaders would not have made if reporters were within earshot. EYE ON WASHINGTON: The Presidents Who've Known Me (HarperCollins, $35) is a kaleidoscope of pictures made with cameras and with words, rich in detail and anecdote. In a time when Presidents enjoyed a closer rapport with the press than their present-day handlers will allow, Mr. Tames, who spent 40 years in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, could put them at their ease and make great photos. One, showing a solitary John F. Kennedy hunched over his desk during the Cuban missile crisis, says more about the burdens of office than thousands of photos of men in dark suits holding meetings. Another, depicting Richard M. Nixon in golf togs putting his socks on at Burning Tree Country Club, captures self-conscious informality to a fare-thee-well.

But Mr. Watkins, having compiled what the courts later recognized as an outstanding military career, didn't want to go, at least not before he put in the 20 years that would make him eligible for a pension. In 1984, the Army succeeded in denying him the right to re-enlist and Mr. Watkins has been fighting to get back in uniform since then. Last week the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that since the Army had ""affirmatively misrepresented"" to Mr. Watkins that his homosexuality would not be a bar to re-enlistment, it had to take him back.

Think of them as sort of a psyche-specific gift guide. Your mother-in-law, for example, may have characteristics that you find, well, animal. It doesn't mean that she's a beast, rather that she's particularly animate, or has a thing for pets. If so, a faux-jaguar-print scarf or a pair of buggy earrings would do nicely for her. If your significant other is into plant life, then look in the vegetable designation for vials of frankincense and myrrh. The mineral category is the most tactile group, so if you've got a touchy-feely buddy, you might consider something as prosaic as a bit of pumice stone or as silken as a pair of gold satin gloves. The gift ideas on these pages offer a range of possibilities, with lots of room for thought. They're not such a bad way to play the Christmas guessing game, especially if you're on the receiving end.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ELVIS DON'T LIKE FOOTBALL: The Life and Raucous Times of the NFL's Most Outspoken Coach. By Jerry Glanville and J. David Miller. (Macmillan, $18.95.) Jerry Glanville, formerly the head coach of the Houston Oilers and now with the Atlanta Falcons, has been over the course of his career a controversial figure who fancies himself something of a rebel. His book, ""Elvis Don't Like Football,"" is dedicated to ""Jerry Jeff Walker, Kris Kristofferson and John Cougar Mellencamp, the last true rebels of our time."" Like many self-proclaimed rebels, Mr. Glanville, perhaps best known for his cloyingly precious habit of leaving tickets at the box office for deceased notables like Elvis Presley and James Dean, complains that he is misunderstood. For example, his football teams don't play dirty, they just play tough. With the help of J. David Miller, a contributing editor of Sport magazine, Mr. Glanville has produced what amounts to little more than an apologia for his professional life, as well as a comfortable perch from which he can snipe at his detractors; most notably, he settles scores against other coaches, including Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Sam Wyche of the Cleveland Browns, who once proclaimed that Glanville's teams ""are the dumbest, most stupid, undisciplined teams we've ever played."" Others who come in for the Glanville chop block include sportswriters and broadcasters and assorted aides and players who were either disloyal to Mr. Granville or did not measure up to his code of ethics. On those rare occasions when he does stoop to discuss football philosophy, he often shoots himself in the foot. ""Defenses get beat by mental errors. I don't believe you win a game with cerebral ideas. Your players have to know what they're doing. They have to react, not think."" Say what? For the most part this is a rambling, sophomoric, self-indulgent book marked by feeble and tasteless attempts at humor, such as his description of one of his nonunion players during the strike of 1987 as ""so fat he would've turned queer for a chocolate sundae."" Curiously missing from this book is any mention of the Oiler quarterback Warren Moon, who most certainly had something to do with the success of the team while Mr. Glanville was at the helm. Or did he? In any case, it is hard to imagine who the audience for this book would be, other than Atlanta Falcon fans who might want a peek into the future of their team.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The richness of daily life in rural County Kerry in the 1950's is evoked in exquisite detail in this first novel by Michael Bowler, a Kerry native himself. Mr. Bowler captures well the acute sensitivities of his narrator, an adolescent whose failed attempt, at age 10, to run away with tinkers in a horse-drawn caravan does little to staunch his melancholy and his sense of longing for life beyond the emigration-bled village of Cahirciveen. Young Michael's best friend is Johnny Coffey, the tinker's son, a slow-witted child who suffers endless cruelties at the hands of the priest who teaches the boys' form in the local primary school. ""A big country footballer who taught like he played football -- by fear and favour,"" the teacher ""would murder the spirit of a child,"" notes Michael, who observes that, unlike himself, the teacher's pet student is called ""by his first name along with any other boy whose father had clean hands."" With rituals of dailiness, time passes, ""slow as a wet week."" Michael's Mam, who often sits by the window after second Mass on Sundays, ""having a peep,"" is forever serving up meals of bread and eggs and potatoes; his father, with whom, after a violent episode, the son barely speaks, reads the paper after tea ""under the bulb."" The limited experience and the cautions that abound in rural village life are unfurled in large and small moments, as when Michael is called ""an obliging boy"" by a neighbor for whom he does errands and the family looks ""obliging"" up in a dictionary, ""in case it had two meanings."" Mr. Bowler is a dab hand when it comes to the turn of a phrase, rendering with precision what has been said, just so, while at the same time evoking all that goes without saying.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

By Louis A. Frank with Patrick Huyghe. (Birch Lane, $21.95.) ""I live on the plains of Iowa, drive a pick-up truck, and build instruments for satellites that study the Earth,"" Louis A. Frank, a professor of physics at the University of Iowa, begins his story. ""I am conservative in the way I dress, in the way I lead my life, in the people I vote for, and in the way I do science."" ""The Big Splash,"" written with Patrick Huyghe, the author of ""Glowing Birds,"" tells how a respected physicist became a heretic and was pilloried by the establishment. In 1982 Mr. Frank discovered mysterious dark spots on satellite photographs of the atmosphere; he eventually concluded that the earth was being bombarded by small comets at the amazing rate of 20 times a minute, or 10 million times a year. (The spots were clouds of water vapor left as the comets, 100-ton house-sized blocks of ice, burned up in the atmosphere.) Among other things, that would be enough comets, over history, to account for all the water on earth. If Mr. Frank was right, grumbled one scientist, ""we would have to burn half the contents of the libraries in the physical sciences."" Mr. Frank's publication of his discovery led to three grueling years of warfare in the pages of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. His account has a wounded, ingenuous air; one famous scientist after another takes him on and, according to Mr. Frank, misses the point. When an astronomer finally photographs the supposed comets streaking across the sky, the evidence is disallowed. This is a savage tale of how science works, but lacking the other side of the story the reader has no way to decide whether Louis A. Frank is a martyr to truth or just bullheaded -- or both.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

There is a hint of pretentiousness about books on whole nations that are titled with a ""the"" -- as in ""The Germans"" or ""The Russians."" But let us see -- does the author deliver? David Marsh, chief German correspondent of the London Financial Times, has updated the 1989 British edition of his book, ""The Germans,"" with some cutting and pasting to bring us beyond the fall of the Berlin wall, the collapse of the Communist system in East Germany and the express-train rush toward unification of the two German states. His thesis is that ""Germany's destiny will shape the future of Europe"" either to the Continent's benefit or to its risk. So far, so good, although I think one could argue with equal force that Europe's destiny will shape the future of Germany, as it has increasingly in recent decades. But to propose to inform readers about the nation and then largely or completely ignore the women of Germany, the writers of Germany, the film makers of Germany and even some of the major postwar politicians like Herbert Wehner or Theodor Heuss who played central roles in shaping modern Germany is to leave yawning gaps. ""The Germans"" is further marred by sloppy and turgid writing, awkward usages like ""ecumenicalism"" -- to describe the role of a church in northern Germany -- and an excess of material taken over unrevised from the previous edition that is now obsolete or irrelevant. On the plus side, Mr. Marsh has dealt at some length with the still unresolved problem of German national identity, which is the core of understanding this strange people, and with demography -- the peculiarity of a declining birth rate for the Germans themselves and the burgeoning of foreign-born people in their midst, now exceeding 5 million in what was West Germany. The best material in this book may be the lengthy quotations the author has assembled in the course of numerous interviews with politicians, bankers and some less extraordinary Germans. They at least give a sense of how contemporary Germans think about themselves and their world. Mr. Marsh is far less eloquent than his subjects.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The misunderstanding is simple, persistent and discouragingly familiar: this country's welfare system is a mess, an incoherent jumble of programs that are undesirable, unaffordable and ungovernable. But the reputation is unearned, and ""America's Misunderstood Welfare State"" explains why. The authors -- Theodore R. Marmor, a professor of public policy and management at Yale University; Jerry L. Mashaw, a law professor at Yale, and Philip L. Harvey, a New York lawyer -- blame what they call ""undisciplined rhetoric"" in part for the problem. For example, Americans expect a program extravagantly labeled a War on Poverty to end poverty. That the poor are still with us is taken as a failure not just of particular programs but of welfare itself.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"IF I EVER GET BACK TO GEORGIA, I'M GONNA NAIL MY FEET TO THE GROUND. By Lewis Grizzard. (Villard, $17.95.) Surprise! When Lewis Grizzard drops the bra-snapping, chest-thumping good ol' boy routine, which he does after the first chapter, he's a good, entertaining storyteller. ""If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground"" is an account of Mr. Grizzard's boyhood, how he got into the newspaper business and his career as a columnist. Being a newspaperman and being a columnist are two different things, and his explanation of the difference is clear and funny. Mr. Grizzard's passion for the newspaper business and his humor are at equal strength throughout. However, the author, whose numerous previous best sellers include ""Chili Dawgs Always Bark at Night,"" acknowledges an inability to stick to the point; he begins a second anecdote in the middle of the first, and by the time he gets back to the first the reader has lost track of which one was which. And a good newspaperman always checks his facts; Mr. Grizzard should know, having spent three years as sports editor at The Chicago Sun-Times, that Lincoln Avenue is not the city's only slanted street, and he also should have checked and discovered that it was Gladys Knight, not Aretha Franklin, who sang ""Midnight Train to Georgia."" Over all, though, this book is good, entertaining reading.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The occasion was Mr. Bennett's resignation as Director of National Drug Control Policy, a post in which his policies were frequently criticized by Congressional Democrats. Mr. Bennett denied reports that he was leaving because he was ""bored, moping about lack of media attention, sulking about not being in the Cabinet, in a snit with John Sununu and being stampeded out of town."" And to the end, he swapped jabs with his detractors. Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who heads a panel on drug abuse, said Administration drug policy had been ""a colossal failure."" Mr. Bennett called Mr. Rangel ""a gasbag.""",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

The Oak Ridge group believes that using microwaves as a heat source is more efficient because it requires no heat exchanging devices or oven and involves no moving parts that require maintenance. Microwaves heat materials by vibrating the bonds between atoms, causing friction. In the project, radioactive sludge is concentrated and heated by steam inside a cylindrical tank. Blades spread the sludge into a fine slurry, which is fed into a drum and bombarded with high-frequency, high-power microwaves. This heats the slurry to 120 degrees centigrade for drying and then to 300 degrees. By keeping the molten slurry below 350 degrees, gasification does not take place. When the slurry cools, the waste assumes a crystalline-solid form that can be sealed inside the drum and taken to a waste disposal site.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

""Had I known, as a young man, that someday I would want to write my autobiography, I assure you that I would have gone out of my way to have at least two or three great love affairs."" Imagine those words delivered in Jack Benny's distinctively dry voice and you have some idea of the charm of ""Sunday Nights at Seven."" Unfortunately, this is not Jack Benny's autobiography, at least not entirely; it is an odd and rather disjointed literary hybrid in which the great comedian's own memories alternate with those of his daughter, Joan. Ms. Benny explains in her introduction that her father's words are excerpted from a manuscript of almost 400 pages that she discovered in 1984, a decade after his death. What she does not explain is why she has published only a fraction of that manuscript, fleshing out the book with her own reminiscences. Whenever the words are Jack Benny's, which is about half the time, ""Sunday Nights at Seven"" (the title refers to the time slot of his classic radio show) is a delightful book. His passages may be a bit short on depth and on details of his personal life, but they are long on warmth and wit, and they are full of perceptive -- and refreshingly immodest -- observations about the art and craft of comedy (""It has many times been written that I am a master of timing. I would agree to some extent. I am a master of my kind of timing""). His daughter, not being a brilliant comedian -- or, for that matter, much of a writer -- provides a far more prosaic and less insightful slant on things. She has a few good stories to tell, some of them funny and some of them touching. But she has very little to say about her father, or about growing up in Hollywood, that has not been said before.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Cleveland, which won for the third time in its last four games, trailed by 29-24 early in the second quarter after Charles Barkley completed a 3-point play. The Cavaliers ran off the next 11 points and were fired up when the 6-foot-10-inch Nance jumped high near the basket and stuffed a layup attempt by the 7-7 Bol. Craig Ehlo hit two 3-point shots during the 18-4 spurt, which put Cleveland ahead by 42-33. Philadelphia got no closer than 4 points after that. The 76ers were short-handed because Johnny Dawkins is out with a knee injury and Bob Thornton was traded to Minnesota earlier in the day. (AP) Heat 120, Pacers 105: Kevin Edwards scored 13 of his 30 points and Sherman Douglas contributed 7 of his 14 assists in the third quarter for Miami, which was playing at home. Leading by 58-56 at halftime, the Heat scored the first 11 points of the second half, 5 by Edwards, and took a 69-56 advantage 4:10 into the third period. Indiana cut the gap to 6 points early in the fourth quarter, but a 14-4 Miami surge made it 104-88. (AP) N.H.L. Sabres 4, Capitals 2: Clint Malarchuk, making his first start against his former teammates, stopped 27 shots as Buffalo ended Washington's five-game winning streak. Malarchuk, undefeated in his last five appearances, was traded by the Capitals in March 1989. Buffalo, 6-1-1 in its last eight games, took a 1-0 lead in the first period at the Capital Centre in Landover, Md., when Benoit Hogue scored his sixth goal of the season. Mike Ridley tied the score for the Capitals, who at 10-8 are off to the best start in their 17-year history, on a power-play goal against the league's best penalty-killing unit. The Sabres made it 2-1 less than five minutes later on Uwe Krupp's goal on the rebound of a shot by Mikko Makela. Pierre Turgeon scored his 11th goal for a 3-1 lead with 1:17 remaining in the period. (AP) Penguins 3, Bruins 3: John Cullen steered Zarley Zalapski's pass into the net with 5:20 remaining in the third period last night to give Pittsburgh the tie in Boston. Ken Hodge set up three goals for Boston, including Cam Neely's ninth, as the Bruins improved their record to 5-2-1 over the last eight games. Both Hodge and Neely had a hand in first-period goals by Bob Carpenter that gave the Bruins a 2-0 lead. Andy Moog had 30 saves for Boston, including a stop on Mark Recchi's breakaway in overtime. Tom Barrasso faced 38 shots in the Pittsburgh goal. (AP) Tennis Chang Rallies to Gain Final: Michael Chang, the defending champion, scored another great escape yesterday by rallying from a four-game deficit in the last set to reach the final of the Wembley indoor tournament in England. Chang defeated Christian Bergstrom, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, and will face Jakob Hlasek in the final. Hlasek, the 1988 Wembley champion, scored a 7-6, 6-2 semifinal victory over Diego Nargiso, who pulled a stomach muscle in the second set.

Mayotte beat Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3. Cherkasov defeated Udo Riglewski of Germany, 6-1, 7-6. (AP) Baseball Wild Pitch Gives U.S. Victory: Ken Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners scored the tie-breaking run on a wild pitch in the eighth inning as a major league all-star team defeated Japan, 3-2, yesterday in the seventh game of an eight-game series in Tokyo. The victory was only the second for the major leaguers, who lost the first four games and played a 6-6 tie with the Japanese on Friday. (AP) Golf First Victory for Peoples: David Peoples, who led every round, collected his first victory as a professional yesterday in the Kapalua International tournament in Hawaii. Closing with a round of five-under-par 66, Peoples finished at 264, 20 under par and five shots better than Davis Love 3d. (AP) Horse Racing Scan Takes the Remsen: Under weather conditions that made any determination of raw ability suspect, Scan showed the professionalism, if not the overwhelming talent, of a horse at the top of his class yesterday in the Grade II $177,600 Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct. The 2-year-old took a slight lead in the stretch, was overtaken but rallied in the final strides to pass Subordinated Debt and win by a nose. Scan ran the mile and an eighth through gusty winds over an inundated track listed as sloppy in 1:52.55 to earn $106,560 for his owner, William Haggin Perry. He paid $3.80 for $2 to win. Scan broke well under Jerry Bailey and settled three wide between Kyle's Our Man and Subordinated Debt round the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch. Those three stayed a length off the moderate pace set by Fire in Ice before the front-runner yielded around the far turn. Scan held a narrow lead in midstretch before Subordinated Debt stuck his head in front at the sixteenth pole. But Scan came back to regain the lead yards from the finish.",1990-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Finley, of the California Angels, struck out five and walked three. Johnson relieved and struck out four and walked two. (AP) N.B.A. Blazers 138, Clippers 107: Clyde Drexler scored 17 of his 23 points in the first half and Kevin Duckworth added 22 as Portland remained the league's only undefeated team (5-0) with a victory over the Los Angeles Clippers last night. Duckworth scored 14 points in the third period, hitting six of eight shots from the field, as Portland extended its lead to 105-76.(AP) Rockets 110, Jazz 90: Akeem Olajuwon had 31 points and 21 rebounds and scored 7 points during a 21-2 run that carried the Houston Rockets to a victory over the Utah Jazz last night. Utah took advantage of a 2-for-16 shooting slump by Houston to take a 79-78 lead with 8:27 remaining in the game. But the Rockets regained the lead for good on their next possession with a 3-point play by Otis Thorpe that touched off the 21-2 spurt.(AP)",1990-11-12T05:00:00+0000

Christian Laettner scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds last night in Durham, N.C., to lead Duke to a 87-74 victory over Marquette in the opening round of the Big Apple National Invitation Tournament. The Blue Devils, who lost to the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game last season, will play host to Boston College tomorrow night. Boston College beat Memphis State, 82-78, in a first-round game in Boston. The Eagles overcame a 16-point halftime deficit. (AP) Oklahoma 95, New Orleans 65: In another Big Apple N.I.T. game in Norman, Okla., Oklahoma used a 16-0 run early in the first half to take control against New Orleans. Terrence Mullins started the spurt with a 3-pointer and four other players scored during the four-minute streak, which gave the Sooners a 21-4 lead. Mullins finished with 16 points, one of six Sooners in double figures. Oklahoma has no full-time starters back from a year ago, when it finished the regular season ranked No. 1. The Sooners will travel to Fayetteville, Ark., for a second-round game against Arkansas. The Razorbacks defeated Vanderbilt, 107-70. Vanderbilt won the post-season N.I.T. last season. (AP) Arizona 122, Austin Peay 80: Chris Mills led Arizona's balanced scoring with 17 points as the Wildcats overwhelmed Austin Peay with a 59-point first half and cruised to a 122-80 first-round N.I.T. victory in Tucson. Arizona, which won its 48th straight home game, will play host to East Tennessee State tomorrow night in a second-round game. East Tennessee State beat Brigham Young, 83-80. (AP) N.B.A. Bird Scores 45 One night after his lowest point total in four years, Larry Bird scored 45 points at Boston Garden last night and the Celtics survived a late Charlotte comeback for a 135-126 victory. A 116-101 lead with 7 minutes 35 seconds remaining dropped to 122-117 with 4:21 to play on Rex Chapman's driving layup. Boston's Kevin Gamble then made two free throws and the Hornets came no closer than 5 points the rest of the way. Bird, who had 5 points in a 119-91 loss at Milwaukee on Tuesday night, added 8 assists, 8 rebounds and 5 blocks last night against the Hornets. While the Celtics were coming off their worst game of the season, the Hornets had their best game Tuesday night, a 120-105 victory over Washington. But they remained without a victory in nine games against Boston in their three-year history. On Nov. 12, 1986, Bird had 2 points in nine minutes against Milwaukee before being ejected. His 5 points Tuesday night were the fewest in a game in which he was available the entire 48 minutes since he was scoreless against Golden State on Jan. 3, 1981. (AP) 76ers 112, Hawks 104: Charles Barkley scored 34 points and grabbed 13 rebounds as Philadelphia turned back a late rally at the Spectrum. Philadelphia took its biggest lead of the game, 98-89, on a layup by Rick Mahorn with 5:56 to play. The Hawks then went on a 9-2 spurt, closing to 100-98 on a driving layup by Dominique Wilkins at the 3:24 mark. But Barkley made a 3-point play, and after John Battle connected on a jumper, Barkley added a turnaround shot with 1:47 remaining. Atlanta's Moses Malone hit a jumper 18 seconds later but one free throw by Mahorn and two by Barkley gave the 76ers a 108-102 lead with 32 seconds left. The Hawks played without Glenn Rivers, a starting guard who has a groin injury. The 76ers again dressed only 10 players. Johnny Dawkins is out for the season with a knee injury and Bob Thornton was traded over the weekend. (AP) Cavaliers 113, Pacers 95: Danny Ferry hit two quick baskets and passed to Craig Ehlo for a third during a 24-5 run in the second quarter as Cleveland built a 22-point first-half lead and coasted to the victory. The Cavaliers, who had seven players score in double figures, won their third straight game and their fifth in the last six, improving their home record to 3-0. Indiana lost its third straight and has lost 14 of its last 15 in Richfield, Ohio. Vern Fleming, an Indiana guard bothered by a virus, ended his team-record streak of 133 consecutive starts but came off the bench to score 15 points. (AP) Heat 105, Mavericks 93: Miami, playing at home, gained its first victory ever over Dallas after eight losses. Rony Seikaly had 30 points and 21 rebounds and Bimbo Coles sparked a decisive fourth-quarter spurt. (AP) N.H.L. Leafs Beat Capitals, 5-3 Dave Reid score a short-handed goal in the first period last night and added the clincher in the third as Toronto, playing at home, hung on to hand Washington its third straight loss. Toronto won a second straight game for the first time this season. (AP) Penguins 6, Jets 4: Phil Bourque scored a pair of goals to lead Pittsburgh in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Winnipeg lost despite outshooting the Penguins by 46-20. (AP) Whalers 3, Boston 1: In Hartford, Yvon Corriveau, Ron Francis and Dean Evason scored within 1:48 of the third period for the Whalers. Doug Crossman, a defenseman the Whalers acquired Tuesday from the Islanders, had an assist on Evason's goal. (AP) Blackhawks 3, Red Wings 2: In Detroit, power-play goals by Michel Goulet and Frantisek Kucera lifted Chicago past St. Louis into first place in the Norris Division.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PORGY AND BESS: The Story of an American Classic. By Hollis Alpert. (Knopf, $35.) ""Porgy and Bess"" was the result of a uniquely American ethnic mix: music by the son of a Russian-Jewish immigrant, George Gershwin; story by a white Southern aristocrat, DuBose Heyward; direction by an Armenian refugee, Rouben Mamoulian; and a story about the descendants of African slaves. As Hollis Alpert recounts in ""The Life and Times of Porgy and Bess,"" Gershwin made a deliberate attempt to marry elements of jazz and blues to traditional European opera. The black performers in the 1935 production, most of them classically trained singers with advanced degrees, felt little kinship with the characters they portrayed. Some critics made fun of the opera's stylistic pretensions; Virgil Thompson called it ""crooked folklore and halfway opera."" Its racial attitudes and strange hybrid form -- something between a Broadway musical and grand opera -- would continue to attract criticism, but subsequent productions have validated the opera's stature. In this engrossing cultural history, illustrated by rarely-seen photos, Mr. Alpert takes us behind the curtain to an elegant evening at Gershwin's, on a tour of Charleston, S.C.'s slums to find the original Catfish Row, and through the exciting auditions and laborious rearrangement of scenes necessitated by each new production. Bringing to life the genius of a unique collaboration, Mr. Alpert, a film critic whose previous books include a biography of the Barrymores, invites us to witness the birth and development of an indigenous musical art.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BIG TIME. By Phil Berger. (Dryad Press/Jefferson Street Press/Taylor Publishing, $15.95.) In the early 1950's, college basketball was shaken by a point-shaving scandal. One of the most talented players of the era was Columbia University's Jack Molinas, a brilliant man compelled to live life on the edge. Drafted by the Fort Wayne Pistons of the National Basketball Association, he played in only 29 games before being banished from the league for placing bets on his own team. Several years later, after becoming a lawyer, he was convicted for his role in another college point-fixing scheme. After his release from prison, Molinas drifted into some shady deals and was eventually shot to death as he and a girlfriend sunbathed in his backyard in the Hollywood Hills. It is upon the life of Jack Molinas that the sportswriter Phil Berger has based his latest novel. Jake Cardoza is a kid from the Bronx who uses his brains as well as his enormous athletic ability to hoist himself out of the slums. Unfortunately, he's got the obligatory tragic flaw: a need to circumvent the rules. While others get caught in a college point-shaving conspiracy of which he is a part, Cardoza lucks out and winds up in the N.B.A., playing for a fictional team called the Rockbridge Stars. Naturally, character equaling destiny, Cardoza soon succumbs to his baser instincts, and therein lies this tale. Mr. Berger, who reports on boxing for The New York Times, knows his subject well and goes to great lengths to give the reader a sense of his story's time and place. Sometimes, however, he tries too hard; the early parts of the novel, for example, are overloaded with brand names and landmarks, an excess of detail that becomes wearisome, even irritating. In addition, Mr. Berger has set a difficult task for himself by trying to weave a fictional story that's more interesting than the real one on which it is based. Although he makes a valiant effort, in the end he isn't quite up to it. Instead, ""Big Time"" serves to whet the appetite for a book on the genuine article, rather than a pale imitation.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

As it happens, the rematch will be in Frankfurt today, when Edberg and Agassi will play for the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour World Championship. In the semifinals yesterday, Agassi beat Boris Becker, 6-2, 6-4, and Edberg defeated Ivan Lendl, 6-4, 6-2. Agassi, who has been polishing his serve ever since Pete Sampras taught him a lesson in the final of the United States Open in September, was master of today's match from start to finish. He wavered only momentarily, late in the second set, when Becker survived three match points. Becker saved the first one at 3-5, 30-40, and eventually won the game. He saved two more when Agassi was serving at 5-4, 40-15 and 40-30. At deuce, Becker's attempted drop volley failed to clear the net, and this time Agassi made good with a forehand winner. The Edberg-Lendl match was equally one-sided. After sealing the first set, Edberg immediately broke Lendl's serve in the first game of the second set. Golf U.S. Extends Lead: Beth Daniel and Betsy King defeated the European pair of Laura Davies and Alison Nicholas yesterday as the United States team extended its lead to 6-2 after two days in the Solheim Cup competition in Orlando, Fla.

The United States team won three of four matches at the Lake Nona Club after Daniel and King defeated Davies and Nicholas, 4 and 3, by making five birdies on the first six holes on the back nine. (AP) Mize Leads by Three Strokes: A controversial ruling gave the defending champion, Larry Mize, a three-shot lead yesterday after three rounds of the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Miyazaki, Japan. Mize finished at 203 after a third-round 69, but he saw his lead rise from one shot to three when Larry Nelson fell out of second place after losing a 40-minute argument with rules officials over what he believed to be an imbedded ball. Nelson dropped back into third at 207 and left Naomichi Ozaki of Japan at 206 after a five-under-par 67. (AP) Soccer UConn and North Carolina in Final: Connecticut tied the game on a goal by Britton Arico with five seconds to go in regulation time, then won on penalty kicks, 4-3, in overtime yesterday, upsetting top-ranked Santa Clara, 2-1, in the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. women's Division I tournament in Chapel Hill, N.C. The loss was the first this season for Santa Clara, which won 18 times and tied once. In the final today, Connecticut (15-7-1) will face North Carolina at home.

An Excuse to Stare","""The camera was the armor I needed, it shielded my timidity, gave me an excuse to stare. . . . Everywhere I go I carry these lead weights, my cameras. Maybe I'd float without anchors,"" writes Sylvia Plachy in her introduction to a collection of her photographs, SYLVIA PLACHY'S UNGUIDED TOUR (Aperture, $39.95). Ms. Plachy, a longtime staff photographer at The Village Voice, at her best displays wit, irony, innocence and just the right amount of gravity -- for example, her shots of polar bears diving in a New York City zoo, or of an elderly couple, looking forever young, blowing soap bubbles in the back seat of a car. Her fine portraits include a shot of a debauched-looking Rainer Werner Fassbinder, the film director; another conveying the mischief and magic of the singer Tom Waits, and a touching photograph of the great photographer Andre Kertesz. There are many images of Hungary, Ms. Plachy's homeland; perhaps the most resonant depicts two soldiers dancing in the street. And three photographs -- of a statue in Montparnasse Cemetery, of the dancer Mary Overlie and of a naked child playing in a Nicaraguan courtyard -- form a strikingly beautiful meditation on the human figure. ""When you are smuggled out of a Stalinist country in the bottom of a farm cart, covered with corn, at age thirteen, you have the sense that the worst has already happened,"" Guy Trebay, a senior editor at The Voice, writes in an afterword. ""The important thing is to get the shot."" This book is evidence that Sylvia Plachy is an indefatigable, gifted and compassionate chronicler.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

In the community of Rio Seco, Calif. -- where the ambitions of young people fade into the blankness of drugs and murderous Los Angeles street gangs, where the older generation that came from the Deep South laughs knowingly at its children's attempts to get out -- defiance is clung to like a life raft. The junk collectors, nursing-home cooks, beauticians and gardeners who live here are white America's black laborers, people who may never have visited Hollywood or the beach but stick it out because California is home. For Shawan, the young protagonist in the last story of this remarkable collection, being able to turn on and off the music on her portable radio becomes the one control she has over her life. Her best friend has been senselessly murdered by the gangs, and her hope, not to mention the money she has saved from her job as a telephone operator, has dwindled as she tries to meet the needs of her pregnant sister. ""I ain't nobody's 'mine,' "" she says, rebuffing an amorous pursuer. Guided by the fine hand of Susan Straight, Shawan and the other survivors of this harsh yet durable landscape recount their personal trials over the period of several months. These characters include not only ""old timeys"" like Red Man, who is so absorbed in earning his backbreaking living that he can't envision a better way for his family, but also the second generation, young men like Nacho who, worn down by white harassment elsewhere, is pulled irresistibly back to Rio Seco to take up the same work his father did. ""Aquaboogie,"" which won this year's Milkweed National Fiction Prize, is a love story in fragments, a tale of an unrelenting struggle to preserve tenderness for friends and loved ones against the brutalities of the outside world, a book by a writer whose love for her characters infuses her work with the dignity and urgency they so clearly deserve.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

""It was June 1984,"" he writes, ""and I had just been forced to file for bankruptcy. The newspapers were saying that I had lost eight million dollars and that much of it had gone up my nose. . . . My band, Fleetwood Mac, once one of the biggest groups in the world, hadn't played together in two years."" In ""Fleetwood,"" a blithe, slapdash memoir written with Stephen Davis, the author of ""Hammer of the Gods,"" Mr. Fleetwood makes the rock musician's life seem cliched and ho-hum: he needed to play music, he made too much money, he took too many drugs. Fleetwood Mac, begun in England in the summer of 1967, has undergone several incarnations over the last two decades in both its music and its personnel. However, the most significant change came in 1975, when Mr. Fleetwood hired the singer-songwriters Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. This edition of the band -- ""more powerful than ever,"" Mr. Fleetwood writes -- would produce a string of best-selling albums. The downside was that the band began to abuse cocaine. ""Until then, Fleetwood Mac hadn't had much experience with this Andean rocket fuel,"" he writes. ""Now we discovered that a toot now and then relieved the boredom of long hours in the studio with little nourishment."" Mr. Fleetwood, the band's manager as well as its drummer, says he felt compelled to get the other members to carry on with their work. After he recouped his financial losses in 1985, Mr. Fleetwood and the band gave it one more go, and in 1987 they released one last hit album before Mr. Buckingham left. Mr. Fleetwood has since recast the band yet again and looks forward to more life on the road. ""I'll keep playing forever,"" he writes. ""I'm going to be an eighty-year-old rocker, and they'll have to take me out and shoot me to get me to stop.""",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Genn said he would retire in January even though two and one-half years remain on his contract. As a result of Mr. Genn's testimony last year, the board was suspended and 50 paraprofessionals, one principal and one assistant principal were dismissed. And now someone has been spreading false rumors about him, he said. All in all, he added, ""I'm tense and worried that I've made a lot of enemies, that people whose toes have been stepped on will come at me in one way or another."" But at least one member of the suspended board praised him. Said Thomas A. Gebert, ""What Genn did was unbelievably courageous.""",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"RELATIVE DISTANCES. By Victoria Jenkins. (Peregrine Smith/Gibbs Smith, $15.95.) Lost in urban and suburban anomie, many readers might find it hard to imagine a contemporary setting for good old-fashioned tragedy. But Victoria Jenkins has found such a place in the isolated new West, on the cattle ranches of Wyoming. Thirty-five-year-old Myra Wells, ambitious to recapture the sense of possibilities she recalls from her youth, sets the plot's dominoes in motion by returning to the region where she grew up and married early. There her cousin and first love, Arlen Dyer, has patched together a large ranch, with debts to match. Her son, Tom, whom she left behind long ago, and Arlen's son, Neal, work together as Arlen's ranch hands. As winter slowly yields to spring and summer, Myra turns not to Arlen but to Neal for solace and new life. And in the process, Arlen's need to dominate his son clashes with Neal's need for freedom, with grim results. Although its plot hinges on a parent in love with a child's best friend, ""Relative Distances"" feels considerably less manipulative than it sounds. This is largely due to Ms. Jenkins's careful, attentive prose, which is grounded in everyday details yet portrays the characters' hopes and memories with sympathy and even lyricism. It's sometimes hard to understand why these people are so obsessed with one another; Myra, in particular, hardly seems as distant and unattainable as both Arlen and Neal think she is. But if these particular fixations aren't convincing to the reader, the characters' fateful submissions to them are. These people might not talk a lot, but they sure do feel. And they still know how to shoot straight.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

The Battle of Chickamauga, which took place Sept. 19 and 20, 1863, roughly eight miles below Chattanooga, was one of the bloodiest engagements of the Civil War. There were 2,268 Confederate soldiers killed, and 1,656 from the Union. (The total of dead, wounded and missing at Chickamauga came to around 34,000, enough to populate a fair-sized town.) Tactically, it was a Southern victory, but in the costly victory (and in not pursuing their enemy when they had him whipped) the death knell of the Southern Rebellion was sounded. As Gen. D. H. Hill of the Confederacy said afterward: ""It seems to me that the elan of the Southern soldier was never seen after Chickamauga; the brilliant dash which had distinguished him was gone forever. He fought stoutly to the last, but after Chickamauga, with the sullenness of despair, and without the enthusiasm of hope. That 'barren victory' sealed the fate of the Southern Confederacy.""",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Home Row Inc.'s answer is to turn the ""J"" key into a pointing device, activated by pressing the computer's control key. In effect, the key becomes a miniature joystick that can move in any direction. The cursor's speed is determined by how hard the key is pressed. The left hand can press the F, D, and S keys to give the commands on the traditional mouse buttons. Home Row, based in Clackamas, Oreg., has licensed its technology to a number of computer makers.

""Lovingly Georgia"" is more than the complete correspondence between Georgia O'Keeffe and Anita Pollitzer, a friend and fellow artist with whom O'Keeffe exchanged letters for 53 years. It is also the story of a friendship broken after years of affinity and trust. O'Keeffe and Pollitzer met at Columbia University in 1914. Over the next several years, as O'Keeffe took teaching jobs in Virginia, South Carolina and Texas, the two corresponded almost weekly. Lonely and at times depressed, O'Keeffe found in Pollitzer's exuberant letters a link to the world she had left behind. Pollitzer sent books, photographs, art supplies and the latest avant-garde magazines, shared her thoughts on writers and critics, and described plays, art exhibits and lectures she had seen. O'Keeffe was equally expressive, though her letters spoke not of social events or of art ideas but of the huge Texas sky or a lightning storm at night on the prairie. She wrote of her daily schedule, of being lost in her work, unsure of her sanity. In Pollitzer she found not only a sympathetic ear but also an ardent supporter, critic and agent. O'Keeffe periodically sent Pollitzer rolls of drawings, to which she responded with unabashed enthusiasm. ""It screams like a maniac & runs around like a dog chasing his tail,"" she exclaimed of one picture. ""They've gotten past the personal stage into the big sort of emotions that are common to big people,"" she wrote of other works. Both women thought that the most important place to show art was at Alfred Stieglitz' gallery. Without telling her friend, Pollitzer took O'Keeffe's drawings to Stieglitz, whose now legendary response, ""Finally a woman on paper,"" would change O'Keeffe's life. Stieglitz showed O'Keeffe's work and later married her. In 1950, with O'Keeffe's approval, Pollitzer began work on a biography. As the last of the letters in ""Lovingly, Georgia"" shows, the project came to a bad end after 18 years. (The book, edited by Clive Giboire -- who is also the editor of this volume -- was posthumously published in 1988 as ""A Woman on Paper: Georgia O'Keeffe."") ""I cannot approve it . . . in any way,"" wrote O'Keeffe. ""It is a very sentimental way you like to imagine me,"" she observed. ""It reads as if we . . . didn't understand one another at all."" Yet to judge from the depth and candor of these fascinating letters, O'Keeffe's disavowal seems not only cruel but a denial of the rapport these two women so obviously shared.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE. By Jean M. Auel (Crown, $24.95.) Prehistory buffs may be the only readers who'll have fun with Jean M. Auel's latest epic, ""The Plains of Passage."" In this fourth installment of the Earth's Children series, the adventure begun in ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" continues, with Ayla of the Mamutoi and Jondalar of the Zelandonii undertaking a long and tortuous journey on horseback across the wind-swept grasslands of Ice Age Europe in search of Jondalar's kin. Will the two travelers ever reach the camp of the Zelandonii and, if they do, will Jondalar's fellow clansmen recognize him after so long an absence? These questions haunt Jondalar and Ayla throughout the novel, but a more pressing challenge is posed by the natural world that surrounds them, which sets a host of dangers in their path. Although Ms. Auel's descriptions of this world are fairly uninspired, the steamy love scenes between Ayla and Jondalar afford some compensation. Yet these interludes are few and far between, and it's unlikely that all but the most devoted readers will follow them to the book's end. Prehistory buffs with any savvy will also find Ms. Auel's feminist portrayal of the blond, blue-eyed Ayla somewhat hard to swallow. Here is a multilingual woman who, among other talents, is clever enough to invent a contraceptive, in an era when human reproductive capabilities were apparently still a mystery to mankind. Such skills may enhance Ayla's status in the novel -- but among readers they're apt to raise a few eyebrows.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

VANDENBROECK South Otselic, N.Y. Dr. John H.

us,Taking a Hammer To a Faberge Egg,"To the Editor: The issue of benefiting AIDS charities aside, as I read Stephen Holden's essay about Cole Porter among the rockers [ ""Why Cole Porter Prevails -- Be It Pop, Rock or Even Rap,"" Oct. 21 ] , words like vandalism and desecration came to mind. But neither serves any purpose. The story of how a group of thoroughly inappropriate individuals has gone to Cole Porter's oeuvre as if with a hammer to a Faberge egg under the impression its contents would make a good omelet has to be read in its entirety to be believed. The cliche about spinning in one's grave cannot be resisted in this case. Cole Porter, like most other composers and lyric writers, didn't take kindly to tampering, and he once made his objections very clear in a telegram to Frank Sinatra concerning the latter's rendition of ""The Lady Is a Tramp."" How quaint Mr. Sinatra's substitution of ""broads"" for ""girls"" appears after one has read Mr. Holden's article. Beyond this, Mr. Holden should read the lyrics to ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" again. It doesn't contain ""erotic excitement as the ultimate pleasure"" in any greater degree than that found in any one of hundreds of other songs by other composers, an enormous percentage of which were melodically and lyrically dazzling, charming, witty and enchanting -- and certainly doesn't come even close to where the Gershwin-DeSylva ""Do It Again"" takes things. ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" never gets into bed, and talks of being ""out on a quiet spree"" and ""fighting vainly the old ennui"" and of the adored object providing that ""kick"" merely by ""standing there."" Anarchy, to use Mr. Holden's word, was the last thing an elitist like Cole Porter would idealize. It is equally nonsensical to attribute ""spoon-moon-June romanticism"" in a ""prudish age"" to such as the Gershwins or Rodgers and Hart. As to the issue of prudishness in general, we are really talking about the failure of a good many people to distinguish between prudishness and what is merely a matter of good taste and true sophistication.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE DWARFS. By Harold Pinter. (Grove Weidenfeld, $17.95.) It comes as little surprise to discover that Harold Pinter's only novel is composed almost entirely of dialogue. ""The Dwarfs"" was completed in the early 1950's, before Mr. Pinter wrote any of his plays, before he established himself as one of the most influential voices of his generation. The delayed appearance of ""The Dwarfs"" is certainly a literary event. Nevertheless, it's easy to see why the novel has taken over 30 years to arrive, and why Mr. Pinter himself told The Paris Review in 1967 that it was ""not good enough to be published, really."" While some of the original material has evidently been cut and rearranged, what remains can be ferociously vague at times and woefully sophomoric at others. To be sure, a calculated ambiguity combined with a wealth of non sequiturs and a dearth of action emerge as powerful aspects of Mr. Pinter's theater of menace, and scholars will enjoy finding signs of his later work in this preliminary exercise. But such techniques do not make for a compelling novel. (Nor did they succeed, as Mr. Pinter also once acknowledged, when he based a play on ""The Dwarfs"" in 1960.) The story, if it can be called that, hovers around four characters. Pete, the catalyst, is a reluctant moralist given to internal musings a la Joyce and Beckett. He apparently works in some kind of an office, perhaps involved with ""literary research."" Though we learn that Virginia is a teacher, that Mark is an actor and a Lothario, and that Len works in an industrial setting, such information is outside Mr. Pinter's existential concerns. In its relentlessly dialectical unfolding, ""The Dwarfs"" aims to capture nothing less than ""this whole bloody racket"" called life. As the novel progresses, Mr. Pinter's characters might be accused of simply evaporating -- if they'd ever come into focus in the first place. Throughout, they remain blurry figures, four characters in search of the playwright Mr. Pinter would become, and in need of actors to embody the inflated ideas they represent.",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

If she drank, it was all night and the whole bottle; if she swore, it was a good long stream of obscenities; if she loved, it was not wisely but too well. If she got mad, well, watch out for the bric-a-brac; Gardner once beaned a persistent but never-to-be-satisfied suitor, Howard Hughes, with a heavy bronze ball. Born in a tiny dot of a North Carolina town, the would-be secretary wound up in Hollywood ""green as a spring tobacco leaf"" when someone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer spotted her picture in the window of a photography studio. Gardner had little confidence in her intellect and even less in her talent. ""I was never an actress -- none of us kids at Metro were,"" she says. ""We were just good to look at."" As for stardom, ""it gave me everything I never wanted."" Gardner doesn't hold much back. ""Ava: My Story,"" which was compiled from tape recordings made before her death in January 1990, describes her drunken and amatory excesses, her abortions, the battering she took at the hands of George C. Scott, the failures of her three marriages -- and the failures of her husbands. Artie Shaw had ""a penchant for self-improvement -- ",1990-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,A New Twist To Untwist,"A golf club manufacturer in Freeport, L.I., has developed a new line of woods that eschew the traditional curved club head for one with its back cut out. The line, Cavity Back Woods, is designed to twist less in hitting than conventional woods. Nassau Investment Casting Company introduced the woods last spring. The Cavity Back Woods were used on the Senior PGA Tour this year. Bill Forbes, a technical adviser for the United States Golf Association, said the manufacturer has not asked the association to approve the new design. ""I doubt we would disapprove it,"" said Forbes, noting that its shape does not appear to violate tournament rules. The difference in weighting between a regular wood and one with the C-section in the back removed is likely to be minimal, he said.",1990-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Negotiations on membership, including United States and Canadian participation, produced agreement to hold a preparatory conference in Helsinki in January 1973. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, commonly known as C.S.C.E., formally began on July 3, 1973, in Helsinki with a meeting of 35 foreign ministers and a proposal by Andrei A. Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister, for a new charter of relations among all European states and an East-West meeting by the end of that year to end what remained of the cold war. On Aug. 1, 1975, 35 heads of states and representatives of powers, principalities and the Vatican held such a conference in Helsinki and signed a Final Act that has since become known as the Helsinki Accords. THE HELSINKI ACCORDS The final declaration included pledges on the inviolability of frontiers, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and freer and wider dissemination of information, as well as a vow to ""respect each other's right freely to choose and develop its political, social and economic and cultural systems."" The members agreed on notification of military maneuvers of more than 25,000 troops within about 150 miles of any border. MEMBERS Austria Belgium Britain Bulgaria Canada Cyprus Czechoslolvakie Denmark Finland France Germany* Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Liechtenstein Luxembourg Malta Monaco The Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Romania San Marino Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey Soviet Union United States The Vatican Yugoslavia *East and West Germany were original members. OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS Treaty on reducing conventional forces in Europe, which will be signed in Paris on Monday. Negotiations on this treaty, involving the then 23 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact began in Vienna in April 1989, superseding fruitless talks that the two blocs began in January 1973. ""Helsinki Groups"" set up in the Soviet Union and other Easters European countries to press Communist governments to fulfill their human rights pledges. These organizations, like Charter 77 in Czechoslovakie, became rallying points for the political opposition and formed the core of the democratic movements that are now in power in Eastern Europe. Agreements on movement of people and ideas. In Madrid in 1983, detailed agreements were signed by conference members. Other arms agreements: Members agreed to the principle of on-site inspection and other ""confidence-building measures"" in Stockholm in 1986. Agreement on the right to peaceful assembly: Agreement was reached in Copenhagen in June. Other rights in the agreement included freedom of associates and demonstration, the right to own and enjoy property, the right to effective remedies against violations of human rights and condemnation of anti-Semitism.

Corbin then missed a shot in the lane and Felton Spencer missed a tip-in before Corbin guided home the winning basket. Tony Campbell scored 28 points and Sam Mitchell 26 as the Timberwolves ended a three-game losing streak. Rolando Blackman led Dallas with 32 points and Derek Harper had 17. (AP) N.H.L. Blues Snap Back Against Jets Gino Cavallini scored the tie-breaking goal with 5:47 left in the third period as the Blues defeated the Winnipeg Jets, 4-2, last night in St. Louis for their seventh victory in eight games.

(AP) HOCKEY Red Wing Rookie Scores 4 Goals Johan Garpenlo scored four goals last night and Tim Cheveldae stopped a penalty shot as the Detroit Red Wings beat the Boston Bruins, 5-3, in Detroit. Garpenlo, a rookie who joined the Red Wings in the off season after four years in Sweden, snapped a 2-2 tie 5 minutes 36 seconds into the second period when he converted Marc Habscheid's rebound. That gave him his first N.H.L. hat trick, and 28 seconds later he got his fourth goal of the game. (AP) Leach Gets 2 Goals in 10 Seconds: Steve Leach scored twice in 10 seconds as the Washington Capitals tallied three goals in 21 seconds of the first period in a 7-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins in Landover, Md. Leach entered the Washington record book by breaking the mark of two goals in 11 seconds, set by Dennis Maruk in 1982. The three goals in 21 seconds set a club record and was just one second short of the National Hockey League mark for the fastest three goals, held by the Boston Bruins, who did it in 1971. The Capitals held a 5-1 lead after the opening period, then coasted to their third consecutive victory. (AP) Whalers 4, Bruins 2: Ron Francis and Pat Verbeek of Hartford took advantage of overlapping five-minute penalties in the third period to score two goals apiece and lead the Whalers to victory in Boston. Cam Neely was hit with a five-minute match penalty for high-sticking the Whalers' Randy Lavouceur at 5:34, and John Carter drew a five-minute major for slashing Ulf Samuelsson at 7:28 to set up Hartford's decisive power-play situation.

us,Guidepost; Figuring What C.D.'s Pay,"The advertised yield on bank certificates of deposit with maturities of less than one year is often stated in terms that assume the investment will remain on deposit for a full year. But that is not much help if you want to calculate the amount of interest paid just for the period the money will be in the bank. When you want to know how much money your investment will yield at maturity, here is a simple five-step formula to help you figure the interest that short-term certificates will pay. This example uses a typical three-month rate of 7 percent, yielding 7.25 percent if the money were to remain on deposit for 12 months. Step 1: Subtract the interest rate from the yield: 7 - 7.25 = 0.25 Step 2: Divide by 12 the number of months the certificate will be on deposit: 3 / 12 = 0.25 Step 3: Multiply the answers from Step 1 and Step 2 by each other: 0.25 x 0.25 = 0.0625 Step 4: Add the answer from Step 3 to the interest rate: 0.0625 + 7 = 7.0625 Step 5: Multiply the answers from Step 4 and Step 2 by eachother: 7.0625 x 0.25 = 1.76. This means that the interest rate for three months is 1.76 percent, paying $17.60 on an investment of $1,000. Source: Steven J.

us,IN SHORT/SMALL PRESSES: NONFICTION,"NORDI'S GIFT. By Clyde Rice. (Breitenbush Books, $21.95.) Is man meant to spend life with only one mate? Can a literate person satisfy his intellect through the exhilaration of outdoor physical labor? Clyde Rice tussles with these questions throughout ""Nordi's Gift,"" the sequel to his first volume of autobiography, ""A Heaven in the Eye."" In this volume, the author, now 87 years old, recounts his experiences from 1934 to 1955, and his vivacious writing conveys the passion and immediacy of his younger years. Mr. Rice revels in jobs that demand muscle -- he chopped and sold cordwood, repaired ships, built a boat and fished for tuna, opened a lumber mill. The book's most enthralling passages are devoted to the author's family. His strong voice and remarkable memory combine to produce finely wrought portraits of his wife, Nordi, and her niece, Virginia, with whom Mr. Rice fell in love. Readers may wonder about and even condemn some of the author's decisions. He divorced Nordi to marry Virginia; Nordi later lived with the new couple. (If that sounds strange, imagine working on and off, as Mr. Rice did, for a stepmother who despises you and a father easily swayed by his spouse.) As a social history of the American Northwest (Mr. Rice is a native of Oregon), ""Nordi's Gift"" makes for engrossing reading -- with one caveat. Adept with an ax, Mr. Rice cuts trees more easily than he cuts through prose. Too many technical descriptions of logging and shipbuilding impede his story.

us,The Breakfast Egg,"I HEAR VOICES. By Paul Ableman. (McPherson, Cloth, $18; Paper, $10.) Paul Ableman, an esteemed British playwright and critic, originally published this arresting and brilliant travesty 30 years ago. His first novel (Mr. Ableman has published four more since), ""I Hear Voices"" originally appeared on the list of the Olympia Press, the Paris house that first brought out ""Lolita"" and ""Naked Lunch."" It may be read as one long wake-up call -- the protagonist never entirely makes it out of bed. The delivery of his breakfast egg is a recurrent set piece, and would be a symbol in a less explosive exercise. But Mr. Ableman must constantly break his eggs, fragment his abbreviated roundabout world. His unnamed narrator -- who, one quickly suspects, is a schizophrenic -- tumbles through a series of encounters that flare with offhand intensity, including a number of party scenes that seem startlingly canny about social give and take, despite their strangeness. Along the way, poetic tangents fly off in every direction: ""There were far reports and others that leapt from brain to brain so that the sunset was pricked with doubt and signaled a spectrum of confused acknowledgement."" Is this in fact the mind of a madman? There are scenes that suggest psychiatric counseling, but whatever grasp on reality they might offer is laughingly undone by the narrator's phantoms and leitmotifs. Mr. Ableman's best effect is a breathtaking precision about states of mind, played off against a hilarious vagueness about physical reality. His unchaptered slice of dream (occasionally reminiscent of Donald Barthelme) is another example of the wild freedoms embraced by European fiction since 1945, freedoms still only fitfully understood on this side of the Atlantic.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Constance Urdang, the author of five previous novellas as well as five books of verse, clearly displays a poet's sensitivity and depth of feeling in these two wonderfully crafted novellas. Leaning stylistically toward the experimental (though not tilting as far as the avant-garde), Ms. Urdang's crisp, angular prose explores the complexities of both loneliness and intimate relationships. ""The Woman Who Read Novels,"" which is set in New York City, wanders between the past and present experiences of an elderly woman named Ruby, whose broken engagement to her cousin, Leo, has shadowed her life since she was barely past her teens. Alive with sadness, this novella depicts the chilling figure of a soul isolated and in despair. In contrast, the second novella -- titled, somewhat ironically, ""Peacetime"" -- presents the stories of several baby boomers who, while nostalgic for the 1960's and their idealized days as student activists, find their present-day marriages and close friendships enveloped in a fog of incompetence, violence and dread. Whereas ""The Woman Who Read Novels"" ends on a clearly pessimistic note, the very sense of failure felt by the characters in ""Peacetime,"" their struggle to make satisfying contact with others, propel them forward in a heroic attempt to find, and define, the meaning of their lives.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary/November 18-23,"COMPANIES Milken's Exile From the World That Milken Built He spent tens of millions on his defense, and his lawyers were the very best. But on Wednesday, Michael R. Milken, the most powerful financier of his time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, to be followed by 3 years of community service. It was the toughest sentence by far for anyone caught in Wall Street's recent scandals, from a judge familiar with the financial community's ways. Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood gave up a lucrative partnership in a New York law firm, specializing in antitrust law, for the relatively modest pay of the bench. She offered Mr. Milken the prospect of a milder sentence if he helped prosecutors snare others, but he is banned from the securities industry for life. Some mourn Mr. Milken's exile, saying that the collapse of the ""junk bond"" market since he left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. proves how indispensable he is. But how much are those bonds truly worth if their value depends on the fate of one firm and one man? Accountants Go Under Laventhol & Horwath ultimately couldn't even balance its own books. The nation's seventh-largest accounting firm asked for bankruptcy protection from creditors on Wednesday -- apparently the largest such filing by a professional services firm. The firm had a negative net worth of $6.9 million as of Oct. 13. It also faces lawsuits seeking nearly $2 billion over its handling of such clients as the P.T.L. ministry and its favorable feasibility studies for real estate projects that would have needed divine intervention to succeed. Those trying to collect from Laventhol at this point might do just as well directing their prayers to Jim and Tammy. Bad Mortgages at Citicorp How can a bank lose by pumping out plenty of mortgages when the housing market is strong? As long as borrowers provide a fat down payment, why bother pawing through piles of their financial records? Citicorp's latest experience is providing some answers. The company said mortgages delinquent 90 days or more or in foreclosure have risen from 3 to 3.6 percent of dollar volume during the third quarter. Falling home prices, especially in the Northeast, are partly to blame, but Arthur P. Soter, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, also points to relaxed lending criteria. The surprise is that it happened at Citicorp, the nation's largest home lender. ""This is not some mad dash for growth by an inexperienced, wet-behind-the-ears player,"" Mr. Soter said. Citicorp has decided to take more care in verifying applicants' income and down-payment sources. But more loans might go sour. As Mr. Soter said, ""Problems related to real estate tend to have a fairly long tail."" Move Over, Wayne Gretzky The sports world's probable greatest money-earner was laid to rest in an oak coffin a week ago at age 29 in Canada, where he was bred. Northern Dancer's achievements only began with his victories in the 1964 Kentucky Derby -- a track record -- and the Preakness. At stud, he enriched his thoroughbred breed with foals, including 123 stakes winners, that won more than $26 million. His descendants included more than 1,000 stakes winners. Bidding by European breeders and Arab sheiks for his royal bloodline pushed prices for his yearlings past $10 million, and his stud fee to $1 million. ""He was a national hero in Canada, along with Wayne Gretzky,"" the hockey star, said Bernard McCormack, general manager of Winfields Farm near Toronto, where Northern Dancer rests.

Forstmann Little & Company and Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company are having some initial success in raising new buyout funds of $1 billion to $2 billion. CBS Plot Thickens Maybe CBS should consult a script doctor to straighten out its tortured plot. The network is in the awkward position of telling affiliates about its weaknesses and advertisers about its strengths. CBS executives said last week that they expect a loss this quarter, and they asked affiliated stations to swallow a 20 percent, $30 million cut in payments to carry CBS shows. Instead of planning the usual three-day bash for affiliates in Los Angeles next year, with parties, invitations to spouses and walk-ons by network stars, CBS will hold a sober day-and-a-half meeting in New York in June just for station managers. Laurence A. Tisch, president of CBS, said increased competition for viewers and advertisers is ""changing the fundamental economics of network television."" CBS is boasting to advertisers, meanwhile, that it will remain the best way to reach a huge audience, with spots on ""60 Minutes"" likely to have as many viewers as a blanket campaign on cable networks.

us,Nature's Vigilantes,"ECO-WARRIORS: Understanding the Radical Environmental Movement. By Rik Scarce. (Noble Press, Paper, $11.95.) The direct-action wing of the environmental movement has garnered both widespread praise and opprobrium. An overwhelming groundswell of support transformed Greenpeace from a daring but ragtag band of eco-guerrillas into the largest environmental organization in the world in barely over a decade. Yet last spring's bombing incident in Oakland, Calif., involving two organizers of the group Earth First! exposed an underlying bias in the news media. Despite strong evidence to the contrary, many reporters unquestioningly accepted police and Federal Bureau of Investigation charges that the two activists had themselves planted the device. In ""Eco-Warriors"" the journalist Rik Scarce examines the controversial world of radical environmentalism, providing a sympathetic and fascinating look inside the hearts and minds of those who would meld Gandhi with King Ludd. Much of the book is devoted to Earth First!, the best known of the dozen or so direct-action groups now operating around the world. Mr. Scarce charts the rise of the group, from its founding in 1980 by a quintet of wilderness advocates fed up with Secretary of the Interior James Watt's prodevelopment ""sagebrush rebellion"" and the increasing bureaucratization of the country's leading conservation groups. The author also details the arguments over tactics, strategies and goals that have begun to splinter the group, arguments reminiscent of those that divided the New Left. In addition, the blow-by-blow accounts of assorted acts of sabotage in defense of the environment by the Sea Shepherds and animal liberationists make intriguing, if sometimes disturbing, reading.

Growing friction with a restive faction of the Joffrey board climaxed earlier this year, when Mr. Arpino threw up his hands and walked away from the company, taking his ballets with him. Then many of the board members resigned, as did the company's executive director, and it was disclosed that the Joffrey was in deep financial difficulty. Since then, Mr. Arpino has come back and, with the help of a corporate consultant, has made substantial progress in straightening out the company's finances. And bookings are accumulating for performances celebrating the company's 35th anniversary next year. ""I've devoted practically all my time to making the company fiscally stable,"" Mr. Arpino said.

Some in the intelligence community were surprised, viewing Mr. Twetten as a throwback to the freewheeling days when the agency blithely manipulated governments and plotted assassinations. He declines to be photographed and even some close relatives had no idea what he did until Bob Woodward, the Washington Post reporter, mentioned him in his 1987 C.I.A. expose, ""Veil."" Mr. Twetten is generally praised for his handling of tricky assignments in the past, but some former C.I.A. officials hint that they will be keeping a wary eye on him.

(Paragon House, $19.95.) This odd little memoir of Djuna Barnes (1892-1982) has its curiosities and its charms. At once admiring of and admonitory toward its subject, the book serves as a loopy chronicle of the three-year friendship that developed between the aging, infirm and still piously eccentric poet and novelist and Hank O'Neal, a record producer and writer, who got to know Barnes after being asked to look in on her by their mutual friend, the photographer Berenice Abbott. Mr. O'Neal met Barnes late in 1978; by then the creator of the highly stylized novel ""Nightwood"" had been in virtual hiding in a one-room Greenwich Village apartment for nearly 40 years. Mr. O'Neal served as confidant, accountant, literary executor and errand boy to ""an extraordinarily bright woman who lived in a time warp."" Barnes, nearly 90, told him: ""Don't think for a minute this is the real Djuna Barnes. The real Djuna Barnes is dead."" What emerges from "" 'Life Is Painful, Nasty & Short . . . In My Case It Has Only Been Painful & Nasty' "" is a portrait of the writer in her final decline: proud, bowed and -- as Mr. O'Neal and others before him who had befriended her were forced to conclude -- insufferable.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

At a time when many American cities are desperately trying to coax a little street life into their downtowns and waterfronts, New York fortunately possesses a sound, popular walking environment.

us,Scary Monsters and Super Freaks,"THE LOOK OF HORROR: Scary Moments From Scary Movies. By Jonathan Sternfield. (Courage Books/Running Press, $14.98.) Covering a genre of movies that runs from ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" to ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" ""The Look of Horror"" is a compressed history that is long on images and short on words, a well-illustrated, smartly written recap of some of the more frightening moments in movie history -- and the faces that make those moments memorable. This is a fan's book and never pretends to be a groundbreaking study of horror films. No long-winded theories or footnotes about What It All Means, just page after page of the bright, fantastic visions from the classics we know so well (and some we may have forgotten). Jonathan Sternfield, a freelance writer and photographer, breaks his study into different sections, covering aliens, creatures, ghosts and the demons among us -- the bad seeds, the ordinary people who can be the most terrifying monsters around. The author wisely keeps his opinions short, crisp and to the point. His text amounts to plot summaries and critical commentaries on the quality of the films. What animates this book are the photos of these scary monsters and super freaks. Mr. Sternfield has some interesting inclusions: in a book rife with werewolves, blobs and tarantulas the size of 747's, for example, he has included ""Fatal Attraction"" as a horror film for a new generation. We cover the gamut here, from monsters alien and otherwise to seemingly innocent demonic devices (the car in John Carpenter's ""Christine,"" the red-headed doll in ""Child's Play""). Mr. Sternfield delivers what he promises and does it in a loose, readable style. And the coffeetable format makes it effective; the pictures are large and lurid -- the better to frighten you with, my dear.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT/SMALL PRESSES: FICTION,"FALL QUARTER. By Weldon Kees. Edited by James Reidel. (Story Line Press, $18.95.) Written in 1941, this only surviving novel by the gifted poet, short-story writer and painter Weldon Kees, who disappeared mysteriously in 1955 at the age of 41, has finally been rescued from oblivion. Rejected as unsuitable for wartime publication, the book pillories the vapidity of 1930's small-town mid-America. Part academic farce, part sardonic social criticism, it details the initiation of prim, ambitious William Clay, age 25, newly a Master of Arts in English literature, into the sorry ways of college teaching. In a deadpan ironic tone, Kees sets Clay up for a collision with rude reality. An expert on the vowel sounds in the poetry of Richard Crashaw, Clay anticipates the good life of the mind. His foolish dreams collapse in this often funny, sometimes preposterous work. Using screwball-comedy techniques, Kees assembles grotesques to shatter Clay's illusions. He teaches composition to students with ""the vacant faces of those who know nothing and want to know nothing."" His colleagues are mediocre bores, diligent pedants and wizened eccentrics. The department live wire (soon dismissed) has survived two years by swigging whisky, the ""life giver"" for many of the drab town's stupefied inhabitants. Corruption abounds. The costly defective floors in Needham Hall (purchased from a trustee) smell as though ""something had died in the place."" The failing grade of a lazy dolt (a trustee's son) is changed. Clay, smitten, pursues the local femme fatale, a giddy radio chanteuse, and the ludicrous chase to bed her and wed her provides the book its plot. Merciless, labored at times, ""Fall Quarter"" surrealistically evokes the nightmare of disappointed lives. It could have been written yesterday, alas.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT/SMALL PRESSES: NONFICTION,"A DARLING OF THE TWENTIES. By Madge Bellamy. (Vestal, Paper, $19.95.) Although her name is now generally unknown, Madge Bellamy was a star of the silent screen. While most of her 57 movies may have been mediocre, and many remain hard to locate or lost forever, a handful possess cult interest, such as ""Lorna Doone"" or ""The Iron Horse,"" which was directed by John Ford. (At the height of her popularity, fans could purchase a ""Lorna Doone"" cape and a Madge Bellamy cap.) Though she tried to shed an ingenue image and to negotiate the transition into talking pictures, Bellamy never really accomplished either. In her lavishly illustrated memoir, ""A Darling of the Twenties,"" completed before her death in January (when she was probably 90 years old), Bellamy wants desperately to understand and explain what she calls her ""Cinderella story in reverse."" But in trying to account for a crucial moment when she turned down the lead in ""The Trial of Mary Dugan,"" Bellamy exclaims, ""Why did I do this? A thousand sleepless nights haven't solved the puzzle for me."" In one embarrassing passage after the other, Bellamy betrays the naivete that apparently retarded both her career and her personal development. She says more than once, ""I wish that I had gone to a psychiatrist, but I never did."" Bellamy lived out most of the second half of her pathetic life ""in abject poverty"" with her ""stage and screen identity undisclosed,"" and she last captured headlines for a few days in 1943, when she took a gun to a longtime companion, the lumber magnate A. Stanwood Murphy, after he abruptly married another woman. As the film historian Kevin Brownlow writes in his introduction, this poignant autobiography is ""the dramatic and touching case history"" of one of Hollywood's ""victims."" Whatever else it has to tell us about the shabby methods of the silent film industry, it inadvertently demonstrates that the firmament is fickle and that some stars are a lot less immortal than they may at first appear.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT/SMALL PRESSES: FICTION,"AFTER THE BOMBS. By Arturo Arias. Translated by Asa Zatz. (Curbstone, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $10.95.) True to its title, the Guatemalan writer Arturo Arias's horrific, satirical first novel tells the story of a boy's youth in Guatemala City in the aftermath of the American-backed 1954 coup that toppled the civilian Government and initiated a series of repressive military regimes. Maximo Sanchez grows up in a climate of ignorance, knowing nothing of his ""disappeared"" father or of a peaceful life. ""After the Bombs"" describes the reigns of terror of corrupt generals and the constant fear experienced by a corrupted, intimidated populace. Torture is endemic and arbitrary, brazenly conducted in public. Executions are treated like sporting events. Books and writing are illegal, illiteracy is encouraged and school is usually called off, although students continue to be promoted. In depicting this scenario, Mr. Arias creates vivid, cartoonlike scenes that have the horror of nightmares. In a work filled with symbolism, his characters are caricatures and grotesques; his staccato, truncated style, ably rendered in Asa Zatz' translation, conveys immediacy as well as brutality. Mr. Arias, who is primarily known to American readers as the co-author of the film script for ""El Norte,"" has produced a powerfully disturbing work. In the novel, Americans are not only the agents of doom, the men who dropped the bombs on innocent civilians; they themselves also emerge, as the plot twists into the future, as both victims and saviors.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Women and Other Foreigners","LOOKING FOR HOME: Women Writing About Exile. Edited by Deborah Keenan and Roseann Lloyd. (Milkweed Editions, Paper, $11.95.) Women have often used the metaphor of exile to describe their position at the margins of our culture. Those wishing to enter the American mainstream frequently feel divided between traditionally female values and the male-defined values of the marketplace; they struggle to shape the culture they enter, rather than be shaped by it. Given this context, we can doubly welcome the publication of ""Looking for Home: Women Writing About Exile,"" an anthology of poetry written by women of diverse backgrounds, all with different definitions of alienation. Some of the poems describe the experience of learning a new language; some present women who want to hoard the words of their native tongue, to keep them safe, as Meredith Stricker writes, ""against the enemy's decoding."" There are poems about migration, the pulls of conflicting allegiances, the weight of history and the search for a unified self. Others tell stories of economic deprivation, chemical dependency and illness, of life as a lesbian in a culture hostile to sexual nonconformity. The collection includes work by poets as familiar as Sharon Olds and Denise Levertov, as well as poems by unknown writers. Its principle of organization remains somewhat obscure -- it is divided into seven sections with elusive quotations as titles, and even within one section two poems from one writer may or may not be placed together. Yet the anthology richly communicates both the singularity and the universality of women's deepest concerns. The poems that the editors, Deborah Keenan and Roseann Lloyd, have chosen may be more or less sophisticated in their technique, but they rarely strike a false note, and in most of them one hears language freighted with experience, the real voices of real women.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Lords of the Rings","For many people, including too many historians of popular culture, the modern American circus means Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey and little else. STEP RIGHT UP! The Adventure of Circus in America (Betterway Publications, Cloth, $29.95; Paper, $19.95) goes a long way toward correcting that misconception. It celebrates the renaissance of the circus during the last decade and lovingly salutes the tenacious entrepreneurs who have held on through adversity over generations. Tent shows take center ring here and names like Circus Vargas, Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers, Carson & Barnes, Franzen Brothers and Kelly-Miller are spotlighted, as well as such new wave productions as the Pickle Family Circus, the Big Apple Circus and Canada's Cirque du Soleil. The authors, LaVahn G. Hoh, a professor of drama at the University of Virginia, and William H. Rough, an independent scholar, are circus buffs who relish the details of how the shows move from town to town, how the performers and crews get fed and the minutiae of circus finance. Many of the more than 300 illustrations are unusual for a circus book -- details of decaying circus wagons or close-ups of the bale ring used to hoist a tent. This is an intimate and folksy book: managers and roustabouts are called by their first names and readers are made privy to their various physical ailments and financial reversals. ""Step Right Up!"" is also the first general study of the circus to examine in any detail the history of black and female performers. Unfortunately, the authors' style undermines the book. Early on they state, ""We are not historians,"" and their writing confirms this. The tortured prose, erratic footnoting, absurd generalizations (""No one played music in colonial America""; ""the total collapse of known civilization at the end of the Roman Empire"") and especially the silly pop psychology that substitutes for cogent analysis cry out for excision at every turn. Nonetheless, the authors' unabashed love of the circus is contagious and the glimpses behind the scenes will delight circus enthusiasts.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT/SMALL PRESSES: FICTION,"SEPTUAGENARIAN STEW: Stories & Poems. By Charles Bukowski. (Black Sparrow Press, Cloth, $25; Paper, $14.) Charles Bukowski loves to present himself as a crusty arrogant old man, proud of his years spent as a heavy-drinking bum, living the low life and thumbing his nose at the literary world and bourgeois society in general. In this regard, he shares company with William Burroughs, but while Mr. Burroughs specializes in weirdly vivid imagery and nearly hysterical satire, Mr. Bukowski's prose reflects bemused wonder at life's ongoing and all too familiar atrocities. In ""Septuagenarian Stew,"" his subjects are nearly always the same: drinking and womanizing; hanging out in bars, at the racetrack, in low-rent neighborhoods and low-down apartments; once in a while being recognized as the great writer fallen on hard times. Elsewhere, however, Mr. Bukowski's authorial persona, having come into some money from an indulgent publisher, rather relishes the good life he has so long eschewed. Aside from the rather harrowing story ""Son of Satan,"" in which a group of young toughs nearly succeeds in murdering a friend, most of the stories in this collection never get off the ground. Mr. Bukowski doesn't empathize with others -- especially not with women -- and the further characters stray from his own likeness, the flatter they become. His loosely constructed poems range from narratives forced into staggered lines to spare meditations leavened by a knowing wit. At best Mr. Bukowski comes across as a benign, somewhat bewildered spirit capable of surprising insights, at worst as a lazy writer unwilling to push his language to produce something extraordinary.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

At the funeral supper after her father's death, a woman is caught and held by the prints and paintings of Western life on the dining-room walls around her. ""Specific and faithful,"" these images of last stands and cattle roundups seem to her ""a celebration of the least detail of a twilight world."" Mary Clearman Blew, who grew up on a Montana ranch, certainly knows this world, which is evoked with great immediacy in her second collection of short stories. In ""Runaway,"" Ms. Blew makes readers privy to the clanking, dusty, bloody, reeking reality of home on the range. Oddly enough, although her stories with male narrators are particularly powerful, Ms. Blew is less convincing in her attempts to portray women who may bear some resemblance to herself -- women who have broken from the ranching culture to pursue a life of the mind. In stories like ""College Bound 1957"" and ""Granddaughters,"" the point of view is uneven, the author's voice intrusive. And yet, at her best, Ms. Blew can write of other women with great force. In ""Bare Trees,"" for example, a tragic, immensely fat girl welcomes death with open arms. Elsewhere, a tomboy and her cousin strip a Hutterite girl of her heavy clothing while outside their fathers shear the fleece from bewildered sheep. And, in the title story, the destiny of a failed nun and a feisty bay mare link in a wild, breakaway ride. Some of Ms. Blew's stories draw characters from a single family, and the mysterious death of a Scottish sheepherder also haunts several tales. Here, as we hunker on our heels by the campfire, the storyteller's voice drops low and an older world comes vividly back to life.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000

Grass Routes","GREENWAYS FOR AMERICA. By Charles E. Little. (Johns Hopkins University, $22.95.) Our system of land use may have lost much of its legitimacy and the planning profession may have few new ideas to offer, but Charles E. Little sees greenways as a grass-roots source of positive change. Greenways are protected natural areas; most are used for recreation such as hiking or biking, although some are designed primarily to protect environmental resources. Central to the greenway concept is the idea of linkage: creating connections among recreational resources, natural resources and communities. Mr. Little, whose previous books include ""Challenge of the Land"" and ""Green Fields Forever,"" sees such networks as providing the framework for regional planning. ""Greenways for America"" makes clear that greenways have provided recreation, environmental enhancement, economic stimulus and civic pride in widely varied situations. Mr. Little concludes that to make a greenway is to make a community. The projects that the author visited are located across the country, from the San Juan Islands in Washington to the Hudson River Valley, and are ""as rich and diverse as human ingenuity and topographic opportunity could make them."" Mr. Little is an enthusiastic journalist with both an eye and an ear for local history and politics. With a few colorful strokes he brings to life the unconventional people he met along the way. His text ranges from the history of the greenway concept to an examination of the types of greenways he identified. During his greenway reconnaissance, Mr. Little found the tenacity and ingenuity that we want to believe continue to define the American character. And he provides many practical ideas for people who would follow suit.",1990-11-25T05:00:00+0000
