us,BUSINESS DIARY/February 24-March 1,"AFTER THE WAR In 1930, when pearl-diving was the largest industry in Kuwait, Japan's development of cultured pearls wrecked Kuwait's economy. Now one of the world's wealthiest nations, Kuwait has seen its livelihood ruined again, its power and desalting plants destroyed, its oil wells feeding fires that blacken the skies. But few such devastated nations have ever had such gleaming prospects. With an estimated $100 billion in investments abroad, and most of its oil still securely in the ground, Kuwait has the cash and the credit for rebuilding. The Kuwaitis say the allies who fought the hardest will benefit the most; American companies have won about 70 percent of the 200 contracts signed so far. Kuwait has asked the Bechtel Group to manage the reconstruction of its oil industry, potentially a $10 billion task. Caterpillar Inc. is selling diesel engines to provide emergency power; Motorola Inc., portable telephones, and the Raytheon Company, air traffic control gear. Kuwait plans to not only rebuild but also modernize, promoting private enterprise and taking the nation another step beyond reliance on diving for pearls or drilling for oil. Kuwait would just as soon have an economy efficient enough to manage without the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Jordanian guest workers, whose political leanings are suspect. The War Payment Plan Even as American companies gain contracts, the United States is likely to continue paying some costs of its Persian Gulf mission. With rebuilding expenses of $50 billion to $100 billion -- in the same range as the post-World War II Marshall Plan -- Kuwaiti borrowing could squeeze credit around the world. Many analysts suggest that payments from allies will more than cover American military expense. But Hermann F. Eilts, a former Ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia who now directs the Boston University Center for International Relations, said that some nations might have second thoughts. Germany is burdened by reunification costs, he noted, and Japanese legislators are likely to renege on the Government's promises to the United States. ""When the shooting is over, they find reasons to limit their payments,"" he said. ""That means you and I are going to pay."" Return of the Oil Jitters The war ended, but the oil jitters resumed. A barrel of crude, down sharply since the allied assault began Jan. 17, eased back up by $1.47 a barrel to $19.38 last week. Some oil traders voiced fears that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon agree to cut back production. And Kuwait is unlikely to resume shipping oil for several months. Iraq, who knows when? But several energy analysts said that the world has already shown it can survive a winter without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil; the longer run worries them much more. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said that with worldwide consumption growing and Soviet production falling, the real squeeze could come in the mid-1990's. G.N.P. Hints at Rebound A revised estimate of the nation's output for the fourth quarter last year provided some evidence that the economy is poised for a rebound in the coming months. The Commerce Department said the the gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2 percent, compared to an initial estimate of 2.1 percent. But inventories were revised down, meaning that manufacturers would have to increase production to meet any stronger demand after the the victory in the Persian Gulf. Economists Turn Upbeat Economists had a mind last week to emphasize the favorable aspects of statistics that still tell of a recession. Consumer confidence remained at depressing levels last month, according to the Conference Board's survey, but analysts noted that it rose for the first time since September. Purchasing managers, responding to another survey, also remained downcast, but again, not as dismal as the month before. The government's index of leading indicators fell four-tenths of 1 percent for January, the sixth straight decline, but economists tended to say that the end of the war, an expanding money supply and a rising stock market in February virtually guarantee that the next report will be more favorable. ""You are forming a bottom,"" said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston. ""There is no question about that."" She said that growth is likely to resume in mid-year.

Most sing, although several (including the children) prefer to lip-sync while emoting ""Love Me Tender"" vibes (the Stanislavsky method is a big help, says one intense Elvis). Except for those who weren't born yet, these people can tell you what they were doing when the King died in 1977, and one says that from time to time Elvis drops in with career advice from beyond the grave.

But spring training for the uninitiated still promises an intimacy and informality that seem preferable to the rank commercialism, crude crowds and impersonal arenas of the regular season.

No other sport celebrates its annual prefatory phase to this degree; none has the good sense to begin the preliminaries in spring, when a new season heralds renewal and when fans from the North desperately need it.",1991-03-03T05:00:00+0000

A peninsula unexplored by Norman Douglas conjures up the image of a cultural wilderness and its early occupation by obscure Messapians and Salentines, the latter possibly of Cretan origin. The southernmost part of Apulia, the Salento has always been exposed, invaded, settled by people from across the sea.

First of all, the menu, written in both Korean and English, provides diners with descriptions of every dish. And second, with its Mongolian-Chinese influence, Korean food is familiar. Bite-sized meats or fish mingle with finely sliced or shredded vegetables and rice. Ginger, soy sauce, scallions and garlic season most dishes. What makes the difference, however, are the fillips of searing chilies -- sometimes added directly to a dish, sometimes mixed into a paste that can be applied to taste -- and the side dishes of briny kimchee (pickled Chinese cabbage) that appear at every meal. The range of tastes is broad, from mild and soothing to incendiary.

The patient, a 45-year-old woman identified only as Diane, had acute leukemia and stood a 25 percent chance of survival if she opted for a grueling regimen of chemotherapy and other treatment. Diane said she would rather die. When she later asked him for barbiturates to help her sleep, Dr. Quill said he knew she had decided to end her life. He prescribed the pills and told her how many would kill her. Authorities in Monroe County, N.Y., where Diane died, say they are investigating the incident. But a medical ethicist, Dr. Ronald E.

In HOLLYWOOD AT HOME: A Family Album, 1950-1965 (Crown, $30), a collection of deglamorizing black-and-white publicity photographs, Marlon Brando is seen taking out the garbage; Jimmy Durante and Rossano Brazzi chat over a back fence; dating couples assemble for a barbecue on Rock Hudson's patio; Frankie Laine drives off to work with a wave to his wife and the kids by the white picket fence. In his introductory essay, Richard Schickel, Time magazine's film critic, explains these mime shows of 50's fun as an awkward attempt by the beleaguered entertainment industry to strike a normal pose. Yet Mr. Avery's glossies inadvertently suggest something very weird. With television sets absent from every frame, the point of view of the camera often seems to be from inside a set peering out, as if television were a kind of magic window into people's homes. Perhaps the couch potatoes of yesteryear found the mirror image of their own paneled walls and plaid upholstery reassuring, but few who look at these pictures today will yearn for a bygone America that loved nothing so much as conformity.",1991-03-10T05:00:00+0000

Adding their voices are Malcolm Moran and William C. Rhoden, who cover college basketball for The Times WILLIAM C. RHODEN EAST North Carolina: Its toughest challenge will be a regional quarterfinal game against U.C.L.A., but the Tar Heels have the right blend of talent this season, plus depth. WEST U.N.L.V.: A victory over Georgetown will put the Rebels on a skyrocket path to the national championship game. MIDWEST Ohio State: Although they faded at the end of the regular season, the Buckeyes are well equpped for this region. Look for a monster game with Duke in the regional final. SOUTHEAST Arkansas: The Razorbacks full-court pressure defense and heart will pull them through a classic confrontation with Indiana. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP U.N.L.V.: The team's strength is its extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand, in this case beating Arkansas. When Mike Farmer, the former University of San Francisco forward, was asked what drove the Dons to win consecutive national championships, he said: ""If you're hungry, it's like a second piece of pie. You want it."" With the aroma enchanced by 30 regular-season victories, U.N.L.V.'s pie is now in sight. MALCOLM MORAN EAST North Carolina: The Tar Heels defeat Oklahoma State after Oklahoma State eliminates Syracuse. WEST U.N.L.V.: The Rebels have an easier route than expected until they survive a regional final against Seton Hall. MIDWEST Texas: The Longhorns end DePaul's joyride and then find a way to deny Duke a fifth Final Four appearance in six years. SOUTHEAST Indiana: The Hoosiers will have opportunities to exploit the Arkansas inside game. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP Indiana: The Hoosiers are left to preserve both the credibility of the N.C.A.A. and the status of the 1976 Indiana team as the last undefeated champion. They are propelled by pre-game speeches that begin at 6 A.M. and culminate with talks by former Hoosier Quinn Buckner at 8:37, Norman Schwarzkopf at 8:52, and N.C.A.A. executive director Dick Schultz at 9:07.

us,Guidepost; Go Fly the Right Kite,"Kite-flying season is on its way. Parents who want to buy their children kites that are easy to control can choose from several basic types. Most kites are controlled by a single line to the ground; two-line kites are usually too complex for small children. A child as young as 5 or 6 years old should be able to fly a simple kite, but keep in mind that kites -- especially stunt kites -- can be dangerous if misused. Read directions and safety instructions carefully. Kites made of nylon are the most durable and can last for years, while plastic kites may tear or fall apart after a few flights. The kites below are listed in order of their ease of flying. Delta wing: A triangular, single-line kite with a keel is the easiest to fly. The keel gives the kite stability, and generally a tail is not needed. Parafoil: A single-line parachute-style kite is the most portable kite; it has no sticks and can be folded up easily. The wind fills the kite, and it flies. Diamond: This single-line kite usually requires a tail for balance. Many diamond kites are decoratedwith appliques for children. The kite can be used as a decoration on a child's wall. Dragon: A single-line kite with a semicircular head and a tail that can range in length from 6 to 50 feet. This kite is fun to fly because of the long tail. Stunt: The minimum age for flying a stunt kite is 8 to 9 years. This is a two-line kite; it takes 1 to 2 hours to learn how to make it do acrobatics. It can fly at high speeds. Box/Multicellular: These kites need a lot of wind and close attention to fly. They are not very efficient aerodynamically, and would be difficult for a young child to maneuver. Source: Big City Kite Company, New York City",1991-03-16T05:00:00+0000

Even after he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1949, many Mississippians viewed their state's most famous writer with skepticism, banning his books from school libraries and calling him, as one student did, ""an old drunk."" So why did he love the place so much? His fellow Mississippian Willie Morris, a novelist and former editor of Harper's Magazine, and the photographer William Eggleston answer the question, each in his own way, in FAULKNER'S MISSISSIPPI (Oxmoor House, $50). For Mr. Morris, who grew up near Oxford, that means exploring not only Faulkner's life and geography but also the colors and gossip of his own childhood. For Mr. Eggleston it means framing fragments of Faulkner's cherished landscape in a bright, crisp noonday light that makes them appear, to a reader of Faulkner, both uncannily familiar and wonderfully strange.",1991-03-17T05:00:00+0000

Buddy Roemer of Louisiana, the operable belief was that he stood a better chance of being re-elected this fall as a Republican than as a Democrat, so he announced last week that he was switching. The move was seen not only as a way to quash challenges from several prominent Republicans who appeared ready to run against him, but also as a way of boxing out State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader with a following of voters who share his white supremacist views. Mr. Duke campaigns as a Republican, though embarrassed local and national party leaders have disavowed him, and keeping Mr. Duke out of the Governor's mansion might well earn Mr. Roemer their gratitude. For their part, Louisiana Democrats said they wouldn't miss the Governor.

us,Business Diary/March 10-15,"COMPANIES British Airways Whines About Its New Competition British Airways P.L.C. wants sympathy. Even after winning permission last week to fly between the United States and the Continent and penetrate the American market in a host of other ways -- rights no other foreign airline has had -- the British carrier is sounding defeated and distraught. It seems British Airways will have to accept some competition from United, American and Virgin Atlantic at Heathrow Airport, London's most convenient. The day before creditors were to seize Pan Am's planes, Pan Am and T.W.A. won British approval to sell their Heathrow routes to United and American. ""U.S. negotiators have succeeded in weakening British Airways,"" a spokesman for the airline intoned, as the company's chairman spoke of reduced profitability. Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, shed few tears. ""They're yelping so much it's suspicious,"" he said. British Airways already plans to invade the Continent by buying a large piece of Sabena World Airlines and forming a new carrier in Germany. The British deal hardly gives America's feeble old international carriers the strength to rise from their wheelchairs. Pan American World Airways, the sickliest case, is earning only enough from its route sale to perhaps survive until someone buys its remaining assets. And Trans World Airlines said the Transportation Department's ban on the sale of three of its six London routes to American, in the interests of competition, imperils its financial health. Maxwell's Plum, or Prune? ""Maxwell's Plum,"" said a Daily News headline Wednesday morning. ""Miracle Max!"" and ""Daily News Lives!"" followed that afternoon. Now Robert Maxwell needs to live up to his headlines. The plum he agreed to buy after settling with the unions last Tuesday has shriveled to perhaps half its former circulation of a million-plus, and even less of its former advertising. His purchase of The News -- the Tribune Company is actually paying him $60 million or more to take on the newspaper's liabilities -- is based on agreements by the striking unions to accept sharp staffing cuts. Mr. Maxwell, a British publisher, promised to invest what the News called ""mega-money"" -- not to mention the mega-time he might need in his trans-Atlantic schedule to lure scores of advertisers, several hundred thousand readers and Jimmy Breslin back to his pages. Exxon, and Taxpayers, Pay Up For a company that earns as much as Exxon, $1.1 billion actually isn't real money. No sooner had the Exxon Corporation agreed to pay such a settlement to Alaska and the Federal Government in the Exxon Valdez oil spill than Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman, said there would be virtually no effect on the company's earnings or image. The company also pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors. Exxon's ability to write off the whole settlement save a $100 million criminal penalty will cost taxpayers an estimated $300 million. A Purge at Chrysler Tough times provided the Chrysler Corporation with the perfect occasion to kick a union leader off its board. Cost-saving, Chrysler called it, adding that four of the other 18 members were leaving as well. In fact, it's the loss of labor's voice, responded Owen F. Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, a dissident on the board and the only departing member who is not in at least his late 60's. Labor representation, unusual on American boards, hardly seems to have hurt corporate competitiveness in countries like Germany. But by reversing itself on the issue, Chrysler has carried out Detroit's most celebrated boardroom purge since H. Ross Perot left General Motors. McDonald's New Burger No, McDonald's will not draw in the bean sprouts and oat bran crowd with its new, reduced-fat burger. At best, analysts say, the health-conscious might stop sneering so loudly that they embarrass those for whom dieting means ordering the burger and fries without the shake. Diners who do try the ""McLean"" are likely to be disappointed, said Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman. ""This doesn't even taste like a burger, based on what I've heard,"" she said. Like the company's recent abandonment of styrofoam containers to placate environmentalists, Ms. Levy said, ""It's good for McDonald's image, but I do not see it as good for the bottom line."" In Brief American Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, reduced its lowest fares -- reviving the 30-day advanced-purchase ticket -- to encourage travelers frightened off by the Persian Gulf war or the recession. But some other fares are rising. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the competitive practices of the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant maker of personal computer software. Microsoft calls the probe minor and limited, its competitors call it broad-ranging, and the F.T.C. is keeping quiet.

us,Rockin' With Nietzsche,"In an era when Vietnam consumed the national attention, Jim Morrison may well have been rock's point man in the cultural free-fire zone of the 60's. As lead singer and chief lyricist of the Doors, Morrison's dark lyric vision, dramatic stage presence and leonine visage electrified the rock world. When he died -- at the age of 27, probably of a heroin overdose, in July 1971 -- many refused to believe he was gone. If ever a rock star was capable of resurrection, it was Jim Morrison. The Doors' records continue to sell well, in many instances better than they sold when Morrison was alive. His presence returns anew in Oliver Stone's film ""The Doors"" and in books chronicling his life. In JIM MORRISON: Dark Star (Viking Studio, $29.95), the journalist Dylan Jones charts the star's rise and fall and offers some fresh insights into his motivations and early influences. To his credit, Mr. Jones explores Morrison's embrace of Nietzsche's thought, calling ""The Birth of Tragedy"" the key to understanding Morrison and the Doors. But there's often a sense that the book has been rushed into print, and it offers us little beyond the boilerplate tragedy. ""Dark Star"" flickers occasionally, but it will probably take its place with other books on other stars whose grip on the popular imagination extended beyond their lives -- another well-intentioned example of cashing in on a dead legend.",1991-03-24T05:00:00+0000

As Ambassador to Iraq, she met with Saddam Hussein in late July 1990. A transcript released by Iraq after the invasion said that she had told Mr. Hussein the United States had ""no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts,"" which Iraq -- and some Americans -- took to mean that the United States would not react if Iraq moved on Kuwait. But last week Ms. Glaspie, speaking publicly for the first time, said that the transcript omitted important sentences, such as her insisting that any disputes be settled without violence. She said Mr. Hussein was ""too stupid"" to realize that Washington meant business. The State Department now says it knew all along that Ms. Glaspie was in the clear. If so, why did she remain a scapegoat? Speaking for herself, Ms. Glaspie said that to respond to the criticism without clearance from her superiors would have been playing the Washington politics game, and ""I won't stoop to that.""",1991-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,RESULTS PLUS,"Horse Racing Stately Wager Was a Good Bet: Stately Wager drove between horses through the stretch and won the $118,400 Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct yesterday, strengthening his Kentucky Derby hopes. Stately Wager, ridden by Jorge Chavez, carried 119 pounds to a 1 1/4-length victory over the favored Mineral Ice, which was ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. and carried 119 pounds. It was another two lengths back to Vouch for Me in the field of seven. Neither Mineral Ice nor Vouch for Me was nominated for the Derby on May 4 at Churchill Downs. Stately Wager, a Florida-bred son of Bet Big and Regal Departure, notched his second victory in three starts this year. He took Aqueduct's Whirlaway Stakes in his last start. Stately Wager covered seven furlongs in 1:23 4/5, earning $71,040 for Robert B. Cohen, his owner, and returning $9, $4.20 and $2.60 for $2 across the board. (AP) Golf Nicklaus and Watson Falter: All eyes were on the Hall of Famers Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, who were paired together yesterday in the last group on the course and were only a stroke apart on the top of the leader board after two rounds. But nine other players stole the spotlight as they passed Nicklaus and Watson in the third round of the USF&G Classic in New Orleans. Jim Hallet, never a winner in a four-season career on the PGA Tour, surged into the third-round lead with a 65, which put him at 205, 11 under par. He was six strokes in front of Nicklaus, who shot a 74 for 211, and seven ahead of Watson, who shot a 73. Also ahead of the Hall of Famers were Ronnie Black, Joel Edwards, Billy Mayfair, Ian Woosnam, Kenny Knox, Tom Sieckmann, Phil Blackmar and John Huston. (AP) Hunting for First Victory: Danielle Ammaccapane, seeking her first L.P.G.A. victory, shot a three-under-par 70 yesterday to take a one-stroke lead after the third round of the Standard Register tournament in Phoenix. The former Arizona State standout, who grew up in Phoenix, was at 214 after two rounds at the 6,514-yard Moon Valley Country Club. Colleen Walker, Michelle McGann and Barb Bunkowsky, the second-round leader, were tied for second, four under at 215. The defending champion, Pat Bradley, had a 78 and fell out of contention at 229. (AP) Bowling Eight-Year Drought Ends: Norm Duke ended an eight-year streak without a victory with a 221-185 victory yesterday over Dave Husted in a Professional Bowlers Association tournament in Parma Heights, Ohio. Duke's only previous victory came in the 1983 Cleveland Open. Husted earned his shot at the title after disposing of Joe Firpo, 227-215, in the semifinal game. (AP) Skiing Swede Wins in Season's Last Slalom: Tomas Fogdoe of Sweden, three times a runner-up in his first World Cup racing season, scored his first victory yesterday. It came in Waterville Valley, N.H., in the final slalom of the season. Fogdoe, 21 years old, blasted from second place after the morning run to complete two heats in 1 minute 42.48 seconds. His victory was assured when Michael Tritscher of Switzerland, who led the first run over Fogdoe by .18 seconds, hooked a ski tip and fell late in his run. When Tritscher fell, second place went to Alberto Tomba of Italy and Rudi Nierlich of Austria, who each completed two runs in 1:42.91, .43 seconds behind the Swede. Marc Girardelli, a four-time overall World Cup champion, clinched his third career slalom title in the first run. (AP) Speed Skating World Record for Chinese Woman: Zhang Yamei of China set a world record in winning the women's 500-meter event at the world short-track championships yesterday in Sydney, Australia. Zhang was timed in 47.08 seconds, breaking the mark of 47.77 set by Christina Sciolla of Italy. Sylvie Daigle of Canada was disqualified in the 500-meter final, but won the 1,000-meter title, beating her compatriot Nathalie Lambert. Willie O'Reilly of Britain won the men's 500-meter and 1,000-meter titles. The races were skated on a 110-meter track. (AP) Road Racing New Jerseyan Wins in New York: Keith Turner of Fort Lee, N.J., won a 20-mile run in 1 hour 49 minutes 31 seconds yesterday in a steady rain at Central Park. Turner finished three-quarters of a mile ahead of John Shanley of Hamden, Conn., who was second in 1:56:20. Gillian Beschloss of the Warren Street Athletic Club of Jersey City was the women's winner in 2:04:10. (AP) Boxing McGirt Stops Montgomery: Buddy McGirt improved his record to 52-2-1 with his 41st knockout, stopping Frank Montgomery in the ninth round of their scheduled 10-round welterweight bout Friday night at the Villa Roma Country Club in Callicoon, N.Y. McGirt, the top-ranked contender of the World Boxing Council and the International Boxing Federation, was in control throughout before catching Montgomery with an overhand right early in the ninth round.

us,"The Splatterpunk Trend, And Welcome to It","From H. P. Lovecraft to Stephen King, modern horror fiction has been concerned with the scariness of the unseen -- of evil spirits and the rustling sound in the back of a dark closet, of ghostly moans and overactive imaginations. Over the last few years, however, there has been a significant shift in horror fiction; the genre's traditional jolt of fright now is provided by acts of violence described in elaborate, gruesome detail. The results, at their most artful and bold, have included the serious popular fiction of Thomas Harris, whose novels ""Red Dragon"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are full of a careful measured dread. At its most snobbish and callow, the new horror has led to Bret Easton Ellis's ""American Psycho"": class animus as a slaughtering ground. And with the rise of so-called splatterpunk fiction, an aggressively grubby underground movement now seeks to compete with more conventional horror writers like Mr. King, Peter Straub and Dean R. Koontz. Most of this new horror fiction trades in the scariness of the seen, the notion that a reader will be frightened -- and entertained? -- by the explicit depiction of horrific acts, including murder and every sort of mutilation of the body.",1991-03-24T05:00:00+0000

This is a good time to bring overgrown deciduous shrubs and trees under control since their limbs are still bare and you can see what you're doing. This is also a good time to start developing the single-stemmed lollipop topiary known as a standard. Topiary standards can be made of any woody-stemmed plant -- rosemary, myrtle, sweet bay (laurus nobilis), scented geranium, lavender-cotton (Santolina chamaecyparissus) and Australian tea tree (Leptosperumum laevigatum). Select a plant with a strong vertical stem or use a stake and ties to support a weak one. Prune all the lower branches leaving only the twigs on top. When the stem reaches the height you want, clip it off and snip all around to start shaping the rounded head. Continue clipping through the growing season to encourage multiple branching; rotate windowsill plants regularly for even exposure to sun. In about 18 months you should have a respectable-looking specimen. Dead Seedlings",1991-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Q and A,"Rent-Rise Exemptions Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment and would like to know about the rent-increase exemption program for senior citizens. Where can I get information? . . . Claire D. Taylor, Floral Park, Queens 1 Answer: Call the New York City Housing Preservation and Development Department's rent-exemption office at 240-7000. Some Nassau and Westchester municipalities also offer exemptions to their residents. The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal provides information on those programs at (516) 481-9494 and (914) 948-4434. Thomas R. Viola, spokesman for the division, said regulated localities grant full or partial exemptions from rent increases to tenants 62 years of age or older who meet varying local income limits. In New York City, the limit is $15,000, but certain expenses can be excluded. Landlords are compensated for the lost rent through reductions in their tax bills. Co-op Rental Liability Question: The owner of the co-op we rent told us when we moved in that the air-conditioner was not installed, but instead balanced on the windowsill. When an unaware guest raised the window, the air-conditioner crashed to the ground. Luckily, no one was injured. Now the landlord says he will deduct its price from our security deposit. We believe he was negligent. Are we responsible? . . . Lynn O'Kelley, Manhattan Answer: Probably not. Michael R. Finder, a housing lawyer in Manhattan, said both sides were negligent, but standard leases generally hold landlords responsible for maintaining major appliances. You could sue in Small Claims Court to recover any withheld security money. Vahe Tiryakian, spokesman for the New York City Buildings Department, said the Building Code in general requires owners to maintain safe buildings. Specifically, Local Law 10, the facade safety law, requires owners of buildings over six stories to have the exterior walls and appurtenances -- including air-conditioners -- inspected every five years. Co-op Tax Deductions Question: What determines tax deductions on co-ops? Do all apartments in a building, regardless of size, have the same deduction? Can the deduction change? If so, what would cause that? . . . L. Landis, Manhattan Answer: In nearly all co-ps, the co-op corporation may allocate to each owner-resident a proportionate share of what it pays each year for local property taxes and interest on the building's mortgage. Residents may then deduct their shares of the building's payout from their taxable income along with whatever interest they pay on their own apartment mortgages.",1991-03-24T05:00:00+0000

Now, even with fixed-rate mortgages at their lowest rates in years -- an average of 9.41 percent -- adjustable mortgages, with initial rates averaging about 7.43 percent, are still cheaper. The rate on a variable-interest mortgage rises and falls with a particular financial index. Each lender selects its index based on an analysis of what best protects its own loan portfolio. Almost half of all adjustable-rate mortgages are tied to Treasury securities that are traded daily and mature in one year. In shopping for a mortgage, be aware that other choices are available, like two-step mortgages, which let the lender reset the rate once. Here are the more commonly used indexes, which borrowers may use as a guide in estimating how their present adjustable mortgages may change, or in seeking the best deal: Index Current Rate Rate A Year Ago One-year Treasury (estimated return) 6.41% 8.35% 11th District cost of funds (aver age yield paid on all savings by California savings institutions) 7.85 8.36 National cost of funds (average yield paid on all savings by sav ings institutions nationwide) 6.54 7.92 Source: Federal National Mortgage Association and Bank Rate Monitor",1991-03-30T05:00:00+0000

Over the years, thousands of men on trial for killing wives accused of adultery have been acquitted on the ground that their honor was jeopardized by the wife's behavior. One study showed that over a two-year period, 722 men used the honor defense in Sao Paulo State alone. The Supreme Court's ruling asserted that ""homicide cannot be seen as a normal and legitimate way of reacting to adultery"" and said that in such instances, ""what is defended is not honor but vanity, exaggerated self-importance."" Jacqueline Pitanguy, a Brazilian women's rights advocate and a leader of the campaign to outlaw the honor defense, said the decision reflected ""a victory of the women's movement in the political game.""",1991-03-31T05:00:00+0000

Ten years ago, Mr. Brady suffered permanent brain damage when John W. Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Mr. Reagan.
