Although the genre is often associated with the work of John Wyndham, especially The Day of the Triffids (1951), Aldiss traced it back to THE HOPKINS MANUSCRIPT (Scribner, 385 pp., paperback, $18), by R.C. Sherriff, which first appeared in 1939. Reissued this month, this wonderful novel should powerfully resonate with readers whose consciences are troubled by inequality and climate change.

Originally based in Arcata, in Northern California, 10 years ago he moved his operation and established his own hives further south, in Point Reyes Station, Calif., near San Francisco. His varietal sparkling meads use honeys close to home and farther afield (Marin County Wildflower and Hawaiian Lehua Blossom, for example), each resulting in distinct aromas and flavors, just the way Champagnes are distinguished by terroir and cuve. Now, to encourage small beekeepers worldwide, he and Michael Zilber, his managing director, have introduced the World Honey Initiative Collection, three new international sparkling meads in partnership with the World Honey Exchange, an organization that helps honey cooperatives. The Ethiopian Geteme Blossom sparkling mead is pale and floral, slightly bitter, with a honeyed aftertaste. Chilean Ulmo Blosson is a deeper gold, with hints of spice and mellow richness. Tanzanian Miombo Wildflower is amber, full-bodied with an alluring smokiness, making it a fine partner for cheese.",2023-01-03T17:32:51+0000

The result is a fairly compact dining room, mostly with high-top tables and creamy leather upholstered chairs that share the space with the bar. (More tables are set in an L-shaped extension for a total of 80 seats.) Walls are sheathed in pale wood and light, deeply textured Turkish volcanic stone; woven Turkish runners are placed over the tablecloths. The chef, Hasan Karci from Turkey, worked at Ritz-Carltons in Istanbul and Palm Beach. The Greek repertoire is represented by tzatziki, keftedes (meatballs), baked shrimp saganaki, lemon potatoes and lavraki (branzino). The pacanga pastry with pastrami, ezme dips and shredded phyllo knafeh are Turkish. Lamb chops and a baklava ice cream sandwich celebrate both countries. A liquor license is expected this month, its absence filled by a long list of timely mocktails, mostly made with tropical fruit juices; when alcohol becomes available, there will be French, Italian, Californian and Australian wines, including high-end labels like Solaia and Chteau Lafite Rothschild, with some Greek and Turkish wines as well.

us,"In the Mountains of Lebanon, a Centuries-Old Guesthouse Welcomes New Visitors","The morning is very simple: I shower and wash my face with the Deep Cleanse exfoliating cleanser from Tatcha and, once a week, Ill use this Sisley-Paris Exfoliating Enzyme Mask. That has been great for the discoloration on my skin. On my body Ill use the Grown Alchemist Intensive Body Exfoliant followed by the Tatcha Hinoki Body Milk while my skin is still wet. Unlike a lot of creams that just sit on the skin, this really hydrates and sinks in. I wear the Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair serum during the day, because I have eczema and its really protective, and EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46. I just got back from Japan and discovered this really great gender-neutral complexion line called Iroiku. It helps neutralize the undertones of the skin and gives you this really beautiful, balanced complexion, so Ive been wearing that when Im on camera. And I have a few things I always carry: Honest Beauty Magic Beauty Balm, I use it as a highlighter, elbow cream, everything. On my lips I use the Sisley-Paris Nutritive Lip Balm, which is heavier for winter. Lastly, no one seems to understand Tatchas Serum Stick  you can slather it all over your skin or on top of makeup if its starting to dry out, but I use it any time Im feeling a bit dry or am getting flaky skin around my nose. A few times a week Ill use 111Skin Celestial Black Diamond mask or Jaxon Lanes Bro Mask, which has a lot of caffeine and niacinamide in it. I tried the Theraface Pro after giving one to a client who loved it, and Ive noticed it really de-puffs and the LED lights help with breakouts. I also see Joanna Vargas for Triple Crown facials. The first time I saw her it changed my skin. Ive been bald for so long and Im very particular about my head-shaving ritual. I always use this Gillette Ultra Sensitive Shave Gel, but the trick is that you need to exfoliate the skin before and after. Ive been using Tatchas Texture Tonic as an after-shave and I dont get any bumps or razor burn  and it doesnt sting. I even tell my clients to use it on legs or underarms where they might get bumps. The first fragrance I bought in college at the Nordstrom in Seattle was LEau dIssey and its still the one I go back to.",2023-01-05T14:00:08+0000

Ten years ago, at age 21, he was living in Detroit, working as a nursing assistant at a nearby hospital, watching a lot of Adult Swim and accumulating a collection of horror- and comedy-themed tattoos. He didnt know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew that he liked to make short videos with his friends, the kind of outsider art that happens in basements and backyards across America. At the suggestion of one of those friends, he took a 12-week training course at the House of Truth wrestling school in Center Line, Mich., and then entered the indie circuit as a hand: an unknown, unpaid wrestler who shows up at events and does whats asked of him, typically setting up the ring, pretending to be a lawyer or other species of extra, maybe participating in a battle royale. For the next few years, he worked shows around the Great Lakes region, wrestling strangers or sometimes the guy he rode up with, trying to figure out where he fit in. ",2023-01-10T10:00:15+0000

Replacing the hotels former Brasserie dAumont and mens grooming space, Nonos by Paul Pairet, with its moody interior by Tristan Auer, is the chefs take on a modern French steakhouse (the name means little bone in childrens French).

The menu is focused on familiar favorites ranging from onion soup and cheese souffls to traditional dishes like seafood vol-au-vent. Comestibles, the deli area, will serve up snacks such as deviled eggs, pt en crote and Gascon cured ham. Traditional French food is back in a big way across Paris, Pairet says.

In total, the disruption caused more than 9,000 delays and 1,300 cancellations, leaving many passengers stranded with no airline to blame. The cause was a damaged database file, according to the agency, and the White House said there was no evidence of a cyberattack. But the system failure is nonetheless unsettling, revealing the fragility of the infrastructure that the country relies on to manage commercial air traffic. Critics say the F.A.A. has struggled to keep up with technological advances as well as the rise in the number of flights and passengers. The air travel chaos again put Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who oversees the agency, in the hot seat.

Four years ago, following a career in finance and residential renovation, he obtained the rights to open a branch in Hollywood, Calif., and another in Santa Barbara. Now, hes opening one in New York. With a big, glassed-in open kitchen in a spacious rear dining room, the place is more restaurant than pizzeria. A pizzeria doesnt have to be a joint, Mr. Zimone said. His is clearly not. It has a barroom in front, with a separate counter for salumi and cheeses, and a brick-walled main dining room beyond. Tables are roomy to accommodate the 16-inch Neapolitan-style pies with their typically flavorful thin crusts and puffy, char-tattooed edge. Here, theyre also made with imported Italian ingredients like flour, San Marzano tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella. (Mr. Zimones partner and head pizzaolo, Michele Rubini, is a fifth-generation member of the original pizzeria family.) In addition to pizza, there are antipasti, including gnocco fritto and montanarine made with fried pizza dough; salads; sandwiches (with a burger to come); a few pastas; and main courses. He said everything is made in house. In a few weeks, he plans to open a more-intimate Taverna downstairs for dining and private parties. After looking at many possible locations, he selected this one in the West Village, even though it required extensive renovation. The streets reminded me of parts of Napoli and Trastevere, he said.

Located behind the original Robertas in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Blanca has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic, but there are plans for its reopening.

Marble, stone, Murano glass elements and a colorful palette are hallmarks of Mr. Hoys design for a setting worthy of some of Mr. Mirarchis high-end ingredients. The menu is brief, featuring no more than five each of starters, pastas and main courses. Currently theres no pizza, but a wood-fired oven is used. Sam Pollheimer, who was at Robertas in Los Angeles, is the chef de cuisine in charge, working with Mr. Mirarchi.
