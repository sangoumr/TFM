Network Associates, whose software guards against computer viruses, is offering 0.90 share for each McAfee.com Class A share. The offer, worth $18.46 a share when a takeover was first proposed in March, values McAfee.com at $10.94 a share, $2.15 less than its closing price yesterday of $13.09. Network Associates owns 75 percent of McAfee.com. Network Associates shares have lost more than half their value this year, as the software maker disclosed that it was the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and forecast yearly sales that disappointed some investors. McAfee.com said the offer, accepted by only 4 percent of its shareholders, has weighed on its stock price. Network Associates, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., first bid 0.675 share in March, then raised it to 0.90 after the value of Network Associates shares declined. The offer, which was set to expire last night, was extended to Aug. 13. McAfee.com sells antivirus software through a subscription service over its Web site. Network Associates, maker of McAfee brand software, first sold shares of McAfee.com to investors in 1999, taking advantage of the high values given to Internet companies at the time.

Their heads were caught between the car and the floor above. The mechanism was designed to prevent the elevator from moving without the gate being closed, the Monmouth County prosecutor, John Kaye, said. But for reasons he cannot explain, he said, it was taped over, closing a switch to signal that the gate was closed and allow the elevator to move. Nanci and Areli Franco, 6 and 7, were killed in the accident. The children were the daughters of the caretaker of the house and 10-acre estate. There is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, the prosecutor said. ",2002-08-02T05:00:00+0000

As Hammond explores the relationship of American mountain worship to American transcendentalism and American pragmatism, she discusses Adams and absolutism, Adams and vitalism, Adams and primitivism, monism, pantheism, Zen Buddhism, post-Cubist abstraction and psychoanalysis. Only in this country does wilderness so stubbornly refuse to remain wilderness; it must be allegory or epic, microcosm and macrocosm all at the same time. And it's hard to stay on the level of ''the organic interconnectedness of all things'' for more than a paragraph, much less for an entire book. Hammond's scholarship does present at least one sublime truth: great pretension can make for great art. The fact that Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston, Minor White and Ansel Adams were in all seriousness vying for visionary status may now seem quaint, but their utter lack of irony about their work has made it endure.

I dumped my wife and kids with friends and ran into a bar to watch the finish and see Ernie Els win. That night I watched ''SportsCenter'' to see him win again. The next morning I watched the repeat. My thanks go to Peter de Jonge for helping my wife understand why I can be transformed instantly from a responsible family man into a raving sports lunatic.,2002-08-04T05:00:00+0000

An award winning journalist Aaron Robert Einfrank began his career at the New York Herald Tribune while still in college. After graduating from Washington Square College, New York University in 1955, he served in the U.S. Army as a linguist and staff writer for Stars and Stripes. In 1957 he returned to the Tribune as Wire Editor for its news service. In 1960, he was named United Nations Bureau Chief by the Toronto Telegram. His work earned him a Sigma Delta Chi award for distinguished UN reporting. In 1963 he took a sabbatical to become a Ford Fellow at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. In 1967 he became the Telegram's Moscow Bureau Chief. His hard-hitting, no holds barred reporting on the Soviet system led to his expulsion in 1969. After Moscow, he became the paper's Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief, where he remained until the Telegram ceased publication in 1971. He was later employed by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a foreign affairs editor based in Munich, Germany. He held a variety of positions including Islamabad Bureau Chief. From Pakistan, he reported on the 1979 War in Afghanistan. He retired from the Corporation in 1991. Before his illness, he was planning a book on radical Islam.

The stones, slip-covered in white paper for the party and painted with scarlet faces, looked otherworldly. So did wandering performers dressed like the stones. The woods were filled with the haunting Persian songs of Sussan Deyhim. Andrey Bartenev, the Russian artist, created this magical installation. He also conceived a performance, which took place on a lacquered red stage in a clearing between the center's buildings. There were 34 performers wearing costumes that recalled Russian Constructivism. They were made of white cardboard and paper painted with red patterns. At one point, three performers painted themselves red with crimson paint jetting from under their wide collars. Afterward, there was dinner and dancing under a huge tent. The evening, which included an auction of donated artworks, was attended by 550 and raised $600,000. The event was underwritten by Louis Vuitton.

For a one-month-old baby, a twenty-year-old athlete, and a centenarian, body temperature is still the same. Muscles bulge or atrophy, teeth erupt or fall out, vision is acute or clouded by cataracts, heart rates double under stress, breathing fluctuates wildly, you shiver uncontrollably or sweat buckets, but temperature stays the same. And you feel sick if it varies by the merest 2 percent. If it rises or falls by much more than 5 percent, you should consider heading for the emergency room. The resemblance of one human to another in this respect is truly remarkable.

us,DEATH SENTENCE REPRIEVE,"Leslie Ann Nelson, the only woman on death row in the state, won a second reprieve last week when the State Supreme Court overturned her sentence. Ms. Nelson killed a police officer and an investigator from the Camden County prosecutor's office during a standoff at her house in 1995. The Supreme Court's 5-to-0 decision said the jury might have been confused by instructions on its verdict sheet, but two of the five justices wrote that they would also find Ms. Nelson's execution unconstitutional because of her history of severe emotional problems. Ms. Nelson, now 44, underwent sex-change surgery in 1992 and was pursuing a career as an exotic dancer when the confrontation with police occurred. Her first death sentence for the shooting of a Haddon Heights patrolman was overturned on the ground that the prosecution had failed to disclose important evidence, but she was sentenced to death by a second jury last year. Ms. Nelson is serving a life sentence for killing the second man. Laura Mansnerus",2002-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Innosense was designed to be an American version of the Spice Girls, but Britney left to pursue her solo career. Lately, Spears's star has fallen; her last record sold disappointingly, and her HBO special revealed that she can't sing live.

We had not previously been resort-inclined, and tended to smile at people who were, viewing them as less imaginative and self-reliant than those of us who improvised their own vacations. But when my older daughter was a toddler and my younger was a baby, I was so beside myself that I routinely forgot to turn on the oven, turn off the toaster, hang up the phone, or close the car windows in the rain. The baby was teething; the toddler was having tantrums. Ken once walked into traffic without looking and then refused to say it was an accident. In other words, imagination and self-reliance were no longer of interest.",2002-08-04T05:00:00+0000

That is, if it weren't for the enormous red awning draped over the white brick proclaiming, ''You never SAUSAGE a thing!'' Puns and buns? I pulled into Jimmy Buff's lot without another thought. Rutt's Hut in Clifton seems to get the ink in roundups on hot dog joints, deservedly. But any comprehensive look at this dog-eat-dog business should include Jimmy Buff's, which claims to be the inventor of the Italian hot dog, in Newark, in 1932. The Newark dog combines the deep-fried goodness of Rutt's with the piled-high philosophy of a Chicago-style concoction. A ''double'' ($5.57) consists of a half-moon of fresh, soft pizza bread (picture a pita on steroids), filled with two hot dogs fried in soybean oil, topped with grilled onions, peppers, fried potato slices, mustard and ketchup. The same treatment can also be applied to sausage, cheese steaks, hamburgers, chicken, potato and vegetables and potatoes and eggs, all in single and double servings. For the less adventurous, there are fish and chips, shrimp, chicken tenders, roast beef and meatball sandwiches, French fries, and onion rings. The North Arlington location has a charming and simple look, with its black-and-white checkerboard tile floor, old-fashioned bar stools, and a large crescent-shaped wooden counter. This year is the 70th anniversary of Jimmy Buff's, and throughout this month, a single hot dog will cost you the 1932 price of a nickel, with the purchase of any other sandwich of at least $2.90. If you go to Buff's every day this month, though, it will be tough to be buff. Jack Silbert",2002-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Beginning with their initial meeting in 1926, a binding covenant quickly developed, a union that would connect them personally and professionally for the rest of their lives. In Balanchine's eyes, Stravinsky was a colossus, the &quot;Orpheus of the twentieth century.&quot; Along with Mozart and Tchaikovsky, no composer inspired him more. Even as a young ballet student at the Imperial Theater School in Petersburg, Georgi Balanchivadze was immediately drawn to Stravinsky's vibrant music. By the time of his death in 1983, he had choreographed many of the composer's most important works. The powerful pulse of Stravinsky's music flowed relentlessly forward, begging to be placed into physical motion, to be visualized, to be danced. Even through those electrically charged Stravinskyan moments of silence that so powerfully jolt the music's continuity, &quot;life goes on,&quot; Balanchine remarked. No matter what the piece, the genre, the instrumentation, the choreographer declared that &quot;every measure Eagerfeodorovitch ever wrote is good for dancing.&quot; ",2002-08-04T05:00:00+0000

The federal appeal, filed Friday, says the conviction of Mr. Lasaga, 52, was flawed because the images were created by computer, and were not pictures of actual children, and that making the videotape did not fall under federal jurisdiction. The appeal will not affect the state conviction for which Mr. Lasaga was sentenced to 20 years to be served concurrently with the federal sentence. (NYT) ",2002-08-05T05:00:00+0000

In April, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the government may not use a law that allows detention of material witnesses to hold people for grand jury investigations. The government had held a Jordanian student, Osama Awadallah, above, as a material witness and later indicted him on charges of lying before a grand jury. Judge Scheindlin ruled that Mr. Awadallah was detained illegally, and, therefore, his grand jury testimony must be suppressed and the charges dismissed. In a 139-page brief filed July 31, prosecutors said Judge Scheindlin's conclusions disregarded legislative history and Supreme Court precedent.

After a search of Mr. Merrill's Long Branch home, the authorities found pipe bombs, a pistol and a falsely obtained West Virginia driver's license. Prosecutors also linked Mr. Merrill to threatening faxes sent to Fort Monmouth by comparing the font from the faxed threats with the font of documents in Mr. Merrill's home.

The comments, made public late last month when the court ordered the documents unsealed, echoed those filed with the court by Scott VanDeVelde, Gator's vice president of sales. Noting the company expected $3.7 million in monthly revenues for the rest of this year, Mr. VanDeVelde said he conservatively estimated that 65 percent of this revenue would be lost in the two months after a preliminary injunction. Mr. McFadden, in a statement on Monday, said he was ''pleased by our clients' and prospective customers' response to the court case and their continued support.''

Because prices are actually falling in Hong Kong, the overall drop adjusted for deflation was 6.9 percent. The government said the World Cup might have distracted some consumers from shopping. But Hong Kong is also having record unemployment, 7.8 percent and rising, while bankruptcies have quadrupled in the last year as the former British colony struggles with low-cost competition from cities on the Chinese mainland. For the first half of 2002, retail sales were down 4.7 percent, or 3.1 percent when adjusted for deflation. Keith Bradsher (NYT)",2002-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Both groups said they would file briefs on the contentious issue before the United States Court of Appeals in Washington later this year. The recording industry argues that the rates set by the Librarian are too low and based on erroneous information about the market for Webcasting services. The radio stations say the rates will force many smaller stations out of business before they have a chance to generate revenue from advertising or other sources. On June 20, the Librarian cut the rate proposed by an arbitration panel in half, ruling that Internet radio companies must pay record labels 0.07 cents a song for each listener playing the music online.

The company, the world's largest maker of computer chips, called the current debate over stock options misdirected.

A number of companies, including General Electric and Coca-Cola, have agreed to count options as a regular expense, but most technology companies oppose the move, saying they rely more heavily on option grants as a key component of employee compensation.

us,"Oversize, Under Age","Adolescent estrangement drives the stories in SUICIDE'S GIRLFRIEND (Perennial/HarperCollins, paper, $11.95), a troubling, addictive collection by the author of the novel ''Carter Clay.'' Even when Elizabeth Evans's characters are adults, they're usually adults remembering their youth -- in a slangy, slippery, first-person style that instantly establishes each narrator's voice. ''Thieves'' uses a precocious 14-year-old to observe teenage flirtation rites; ''Ransom'' handles child abuse in a similar manner. Traffic accidents provide the drama in ''Blood and Gore,'' ''Voodoo Girls on Ice'' and ''A New Life,'' stories that otherwise have little in common. The narrators include a self-justifying coward, a haunted girl and a recently ditched boyfriend. Evans makes each of them convincingly distinctive, even if ''Blood and Gore'' is so condensed that it borders on the trite. Evans lives in Tucson, where she sets the novella that ends the book and provides its startling title. It refers to the surviving girlfriend of a young man who tells her ''Wake up, I have something to show you,'' just before he blows his brains out. The suicide is reconstructed from the viewpoint of a casual acquaintance who has flirted with self-destruction herself. As she does through much of the book, Evans makes this oblique approach to trauma seem natural and valid. John Hartl",2002-08-11T05:00:00+0000

This gentle ridge, called by geologists a terminal moraine, lifts Scuttlehole Road above the rich farmland that slopes southward to the sea. Part of a 100-mile spine marking the glacier's terminal extension, the ridge runs from Brooklyn to Amagansett at the far end of Long Island's South Fork and enters the sea where it may once have formed a third fork, long since eroded. This glacier, aided in its progress by the broad river valley that would later become Long Island Sound, shaped the hundred-mile sandbar known as Long Island.",2002-08-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Brit Wit,"The hero of ''I'm Alan Partridge,'' an extremely popular comedy series in Britain, has all the personal attributes you expect in a sitcom protagonist -- with the exception of good looks, intelligence and the faintest trace of kindness. Alan Partridge is the antithesis of his American cousins; he lacks the charm of a Jerry Seinfeld, and unlike Raymond, everybody does not love him. Yet Steve Coogan, the actor who plays the churlish, self-absorbed character, is revered in his home country as a comic genius. The BBC series mercilessly chronicles the decline of this rather horrid media personality, with his smarmy wig and sickly smile. Once a successful London talk-show host (with a ludicrous catch phrase, ''Ahaaa!''), the character has been exiled to the graveyard shift of Radio Norwich, and he takes it out on everyone he meets. In one episode, when an acquaintance irks Partridge with condolences on the fact that unsold copies of his (failed) autobiography have been scheduled for incineration, the host bites back: ''The book's not being incinerated. It's being pulped. My book might well end up becoming a trestle table in a battered women's center! I'm giving something back!''",2002-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Quite simply, India's huge software and information technology industry, which has emerged over the last decade and made India the back-room and research hub of many of the world's largest corporations, essentially told the nationalist Indian government to cool it. And the government here got the message and has sought to de-escalate ever since.

LAW, Resumed 24 7 1 2 DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MacLEISH, cont. 3 Q Good morning, Your Eminence, and thank you for 4 returning this morning for your deposition. 5 During your deposition that we had on 6 Wednesday, there was a variety of references to 7 your existing policy that you're proposing for 8 the Boston Archdiocese. 9 Do you recall that testimony that you gave 10 on Wednesday? 11 A I do. I do. You'll refresh me if I don't. 12 Q Today we're going to be focusing on events 13 principally between 1977 and 1993. We're not 14 going to be going up to the current date. So if 15 I could respectfully request in your answers if 16 we could try and focus on the dates which are 17 going to be in question, which are, again, 1977 18 to 1993. 19 Does that sound fair? 20 A Surely. 21 Q Now, you said at the last deposition -- I want to 22 give you this opportunity -- that you were going 23 to do some thinking about another priest in 24 Jackson, Mississippi, of which you may have been 8 1 aware was involved in the molestation of 2 children? 3 A During my time. 4 Q During your time. That's exactly right. 5 Have you now had the opportunity to do that? 6 A I have, Mr. MacLeish, and I don't have a name to 7 bring forward. 8 Q Now, Cardinal Law, you attended the Pontifical 9 College of Josephinum. Have I pronounced that 10 correctly? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q In Columbus, Ohio. Is it not a fact that Father 13 Broussard, the same Father Broussard that you 14 later learned had been involved in sexual 15 misconduct when you were in Jackson, Mississippi, 16 as vicar general, was one of your seminarian 17 classmates? 18 A Not a classmate, but he also was at the 19 Josephinum, yes. 20 Q You were in the class of 1961; is that correct? 21 A That's correct. 22 Q He was in the class of 1964? 23 A I believe that's correct. I wouldn't be certain 24 of his ordination class, but -- 9 1 Q And the total number of seminarians who were 2 there at the time was approximately how many, 3 Your Eminence? 4 A In the theology department? 5 Q Yes. 6 A That would have been six years. I would hazard 7 that in that department, that six-year 8 department, there would have been -- which would 9 have been the two years of philosophy and the 10 four years of theology -- there would have been 11 around 100, perhaps a few more. 12 MR. MacLEISH: Mr. Todd? 13 MR. TODD: Mr. MacLeish, you started 14 off asking the Cardinal whether he had reflected 15 more on that one subject. 16 MR. MacLEISH: Certainly. 17 MR. TODD: And in the past, you've 18 invited him to make any additions. I believe 19 there is another further reflection the Cardinal 20 had, so at a convenient time. 21 MR. MacLEISH: Fine. 22 Q I'll certainly afford you the opportunity, if we 23 could just continue with this, and then I am 24 going to give you the opportunity to modify, 10 1 change or supplement any of the answers that you 2 gave -- 3 A Thank you. 4 Q -- on Monday. 5 You knew Father Broussard when you were a 6 seminarian, though; is that correct? 7 A I did. 8 Q And you were friends with Father Broussard when 9 you were a seminarian; is that correct? 10 A Yes. 11 Q Were you close friends with Father Broussard when 12 you were a seminarian? Would you use that term 13 to describe your relationship? 14 A We were certainly not distant, but we were not 15 the closest of friends, yes. 16 Q And you knew, when Father Broussard was at the 17 seminary in Columbus, Josephinum, you knew that 18 Father Broussard was the high school choir 19 director for what I think was called, at the 20 time, Unchanged Voices. 21 Do you recall that? 22 A I don't, but he had a very good voice, and so it 23 would have been likely to have been the case, but 24 I don't recall that. 11 1 Q When you learned in -- let me just back up for a 2 second. The Josephinum Seminary also had a 3 school that was in some way associated with it or 4 attached to it; is that correct? 5 A Well, the Josephinum, somewhat unique in the 6 country, had a minor seminary, which was four 7 years of high school, and the first two years of 8 college; and then it had a major seminary, which 9 was two years of -- the last two years of college 10 and the four years of theology. And there was a 11 strict separation between those two sections. It 12 was like two different institutions on the same 13 campus. 14 In its later configuration, the high school 15 seminary was dropped. The four years of college 16 were brought together as a separate unit, which 17 is the college, and then the years of theology 18 were brought together. And as a matter of fact, 19 I'm out of touch as to what their curriculum is 20 today. It may be that they have a fifth year of 21 theology for all I know. Many people do. Some 22 people have added a sixth, but... 23 Q But when you were there with Father Broussard, 24 there was a high school program on the campus; is 12 1 that correct? 2 A That's correct. 3 Q And so you knew in 1973, when you became aware of 4 the sexual abuse allegations involving the 5 Morrison children and Father Broussard, you knew 6 that when Father Broussard was at the seminary 7 with you, he may have had access to children; is 8 that correct? 9 MR. TODD: Objection. 10 A One of the things, Mr. MacLeish, that I want to 11 be able to have greater time to reflect upon is 12 how and when I may have become knowledgeable 13 concerning the letter that you put before me the 14 other day. 15 Q Certainly. 16 A And so I was, as you recall when you questioned 17 me, I was not very clear in a recollection, and 18 as much as I try, I'm still not very clear, and 19 so I would rather not -- 20 Q Sure. 21 A -- rather not be as specific as to say that I 22 knew this before 1973 or after 1973. I really 23 need more time for that. 24 Q Fair enough. 13 1 A But your question is what I know -- 2 Q Well, let me rephrase it in light of what you've 3 said. 4 When you became aware, whether it was before 5 you left as vicar general or after you left as 6 vicar general, that there were allegations of 7 sexual misconduct involving Father Broussard, 8 would it be a fair statement that you also knew 9 that when Father Broussard was at seminary with 10 you, that he had access to children at the high 11 school? Would that be a fair statement? 12 A Well, as I answered your question previously, I 13 really don't recall that he was a choir director 14 at the seminary. If he hadn't been a choir 15 director at the seminary, the ordinary rule of 16 separation would have precluded contact. There 17 was a very strict rule of separation between the 18 two segments, if you will, of the seminary. 19 Perhaps, you know, 30 years ago I would have 20 had a different and clearer memory, but I can't 21 sit here now and say that I knew then that he had 22 contact with high school seminarians at the 23 Josephinum. I just can't say that. 24 Q Do you know -- would it be fair to state, 14 1 Cardinal Law, that as you sit here today, you 2 can't recall any specific action that you took in 3 alerting administrators at the Josephinum 4 Seminary that Father Broussard had admitted to 5 being involved in sexual misconduct with the 6 Morrison children in Mississippi? 7 Is that a fair statement? 8 A Mr. MacLeish, it's a statement that says many 9 things that I cannot say with certainty. I am 10 not certain how or when I learned of this matter 11 that you put before me the other day, and so the 12 predicate -- the underlying -- the first 13 statement there that you've made, I would have 14 difficulty agreeing with, but I certainly did not 15 alert the authorities at the Josephinum about 16 anything. 17 Q But you do remember that at some point -- I think 18 you said this earlier, whether it was before you 19 left as vicar general or after you left as vicar 20 general, you do remember learning about 21 allegations of sexual misconduct involving Father 22 Broussard and minor children; is that correct? 23 A That is correct. 24 Q Okay. Thank you. 15 1 Now, you -- if we could go to Exhibit 2 No. 13, Your Eminence. This was your statement 3 of April 12, 2002, some of which we covered on 4 Wednesday. In Paragraph 2, you state: 5 ""The case of Father Paul Shanley is 6 particularly troubling for us. For me, 7 personally, it has brought home with painful 8 clarity how inadequate our recordkeeping has 9 been."" 10 Okay? Now, when did you first discover how 11 inadequate your recordkeeping had been at the 12 Archdiocese of Boston? 13 A In the course of the last -- we're in June now -- 14 in the course of the last six months. 15 Q Okay. 16 A As we have dealt with these cases. 17 Q And so would it be fair to state that, as you sit 18 here today, you can't recall any difference in 19 the adequacy of your recordkeeping between 1984 20 and the last several months? Would that be a 21 fair statement? 22 A Excuse me? 23 Q Sure. You state you had learned about the 24 inadequacy of the recordkeeping at the 16 1 Archdiocese within the last several months; is 2 that correct? 3 A That's correct. 4 Q Are you aware of anything that occurred between 5 1984 with respect to the adequacy of the 6 recordkeeping and the present time? Do you 7 understand my question? 8 A Yes. Well, I was unaware of the inadequacy of 9 our recordkeeping until this past six months when 10 we have had occasion again and again and again to 11 retrieve a whole host of records. And as 12 difficult and frustrating as that has been, I'm 13 frankly very grateful for the fact that that 14 inadequacy has come to light and that we are 15 addressing it. 16 Q So would it be a fair statement that since you've 17 been the Archbishop of Boston, the recordkeeping, 18 as you understand it, has been inadequate over 19 the past 17 years? Would that be a fair 20 statement? 21 A No. I'm not sure that saying that our 22 recordkeeping has been inadequate is a necessary 23 reflection on the recordkeeping since 1984, 24 because we're talking about records that go back 17 1 to 1966 and before, that go back to two 2 archbishops before me; to the fact that records 3 were kept in a variety of different places. So 4 I -- but there's certainly, in terms of where we 5 are today and the handling of these kinds of 6 cases, they certainly -- our recordkeeping 7 certainly has to be modified. We recognize that, 8 and we're doing that. 9 My presumption is that successive delegates 10 who were following these kind of cases, just to 11 speak to these cases -- 12 Q Right. 13 A -- records, obviously deal with more than this. 14 Q Right. 15 A But to deal with -- when I say that our records 16 were inadequate, I'm really focusing on records 17 dealings with this type of aberrant behavior, and 18 I would think that our recordkeeping in later 19 years on this matter has been adequate. But 20 where our difficulty has been is retrieving some 21 previous material, which is in a lot of disparate 22 places, rather than coming together in one place. 23 Q And you're referring, when you say that, to the 24 allegations of sexual abuse, for example, against 18 1 Paul Shanley that were reported to the 2 Archdiocese in 1966? 3 A Yes. 4 Q You're referring to those types of records? 5 A That's correct. Things before '84. 6 Q You're referring principally to records before 7 '84, that's correct? And that -- 8 A I would have -- if I may? 9 Q Sure. Absolutely. 10 A I would have greater confidence in the ability to 11 retrieve material post '84. 12 Q Post '84. And as far as you know, it has always, 13 since you arrived as Archbishop, it has always 14 been the case that it's been difficult to 15 retrieve post-1984 records; is that correct? I'm 16 sorry. Pre-1984 records? 17 A Pre-1984. 18 Q Is that your testimony? 19 A It's been -- what has been my knowledge of that, 20 certainly my knowledge is very keen on that 21 today -- 22 Q Right. 23 A -- that the information wasn't brought forward. 24 And as I say -- as I tried to say here in this 19 1 letter that you put before me -- which, 2 incidentally, is my letter -- 3 Q Yes. 4 A -- it's not someone else's letter. 5 Q Yes. No. 6 A A continual institutional memory concerning 7 allegations and cases of abuse of children was 8 lacking; and I think that expresses the 9 frustration I have had and it's that that we have 10 tried to address in terms of ensuring that, 11 moving forward, that institutional memory is 12 going to be readily accessible to anyone having 13 to deal with this kind of an issue in the future, 14 and that means having the pertinent information 15 carried forward in a way that the full case is 16 there for somebody to see. 17 Q So you're suggesting that there was some 18 difficulty perhaps during the time that you 19 received the Wilma Higgs letter in having access 20 to information about Paul Shanley's -- the 21 allegations against Paul Shanley in 1966. Is 22 that what you're suggesting? 23 MR. TODD: Objection. 24 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 20 1 A Well, the question that you've asked me, I 2 didn't -- I wasn't thinking of the Wilma Higgs 3 letter. 4 Q Okay. 5 A But certainly there was information about Paul 6 Shanley that was not readily available and it 7 would be helpful to have been. 8 Q Okay. And that's not something you know of your 9 own personal knowledge; that is something that 10 you've been told. Is that correct? 11 A That is something that I have been told by those 12 who assist me in these cases. 13 Q And that would be including your delegate, Father 14 Higgins, who has been someone looking for 15 records; is that correct? 16 A That's correct. 17 Q Now, Your Eminence, you're aware, are you not, 18 that in April -- early April, certain records 19 were produced to our office at the order of the 20 Superior Court Judge Leila Kern? 21 Are you aware of that? 22 A Mr. MacLeish, I must tell you that I am not aware 23 of the details of the many things that have 24 occurred in response to court orders. I rely on 21 1 counsel for that. 2 Q I don't wish to get into your conversations with 3 counsel, but are you generally familiar with the 4 fact that records were produced in this case 5 involving the Ford family? Are you generally 6 aware of that? 7 A I am generally aware that many, many records have 8 been produced in response to many cases. 9 Q And do you know when the records of the 1966 10 complaint about Paul Shanley sent in by a priest 11 at the LaSalette Center was first located by the 12 Archdiocese of Boston? 13 A No, I don't. 14 Q You would rely on Father Higgins for that; is 15 that correct? 16 A That's correct, and those assisting him. 17 Q Okay. 18 MR. MacLEISH: We are just going to 19 mark an exhibit. 20 (Law Exhibit No. 21, Excerpt of 21 Deposition from Father Higgins, 22 marked for identification.) 23 Q Now, with respect to the 1966 allegation against 24 Paul Shanley, you don't know either way whether 22 1 that was located in what we've referred to as 2 either the secret archive or the confidential 3 file; is that correct? 4 A That's correct. 5 Q You don't know whether that information about 6 Paul Shanley was accessible at the time you 7 received the letter from Mrs. Higgs in 1985, do 8 you? 9 A No, I do not. 10 Q You do agree with me that it related to a matter 11 of scandal, is that correct, alleged scandal? 12 A The 1966 letter? 13 Q Let's start with the -- let's start with the 1966 14 letter, yes. 15 A The 1966 document, as I recall, it was a very 16 serious allegation of abuse. 17 Q And you're aware, are you not, that, as I think 18 you testified previously, that matters relating 19 to abuse or scandal within the Church would 20 customarily, under canon law, be kept in the 21 confidential file; is that correct? 22 A Customarily, yes. 23 Q And that's been a policy -- is that the correct 24 way of putting it -- of the Church since you were 23 1 in seminary? Is that correct? 2 A That's correct. 3 Q So you don't, as you sit here today, don't have 4 any reason to believe that that 1966 record was 5 not in the confidential file in 1985 when you 6 received the letter from Wilma Higgs, correct? 7 A I have no confidence that that letter was in the 8 secret file. 9 Q You have no confidence? 10 A I have no confidence. 11 Q What is the basis for that, Cardinal Law? 12 A The fact that it is -- it has become, as I wrote 13 here, it has been -- for me, personally, it has 14 brought home with painful clarity how inadequate 15 our recordkeeping has been, a continual 16 institutional memory concerning allegations and 17 cases of abuse of children was lacking. 18 It's conceivable that that letter was in 19 some other file. 20 Q You just don't know either way, do you? 21 A That's correct. 22 Q And do you know of any changes in how letters 23 were filed in the confidential file, any change 24 between 1984 and 2002? 24 1 A Mr. MacLeish, I myself do not keep the files. 2 Q I understand that. 3 A And I rely on others to do that. Out of this 4 experience, one of the things that -- one of the 5 things that has -- I was going to say has highest 6 priority, but it seems everything has highest 7 priority, but one of the things we're attempting 8 to do is to go through our records and ensure 9 that this institutional memory is adequately 10 recorded and easily accessible. Now, at what 11 point that is now, I cannot say. 12 Q All right. Your Eminence, I'd like to direct 13 your attention to Exhibit No. -- is that No. 21? 14 A 21, yes. 15 Q And I'd like to read a section from Father 16 Higgins' deposition and then ask you a question. 17 A What page? 18 Q It's actually marked -- this is what we call a 19 Min-U-Script, page 48, starting at line 2. 20 A Yes. 21 Q Okay. I'm sorry. Let's go to page 47 first. 22 Question there is to Father Higgins: 23 ""Are you able to identify whether any of the 24 archived files that were produced as part of what 25 1 I think we can call the first production of 2 documents, the first 850 or so pages? 3 ""ANSWER: None. 4 ""QUESTION: None. At the time that you 5 located the files that were"" -- 6 A Excuse me. I must be looking at the wrong place. 7 Q Page 47, line 16. 8 A Oh, 16. All right. 9 Q Yes. Do you want to take a moment and just look 10 at that? 11 A Yes. 12 Q I'll start with line 21 when you've read 16 13 through 20. Starting on line 21. 14 ""QUESTION. None. At the time that you 15 located the files that were produced as part of 16 the first production pursuant to Judge Kern's 17 order of April 3, had you checked the archives? 18 ""ANSWER: No. 19 ""QUESTION: With respect to the second 20 grouping of documents, the files that were 21 produced on or about April 3, 2002, did you at 22 that point go to the"" -- 23 MR. TODD: April 25. 24 Q I'm sorry. 25 -- 2002. 26 1 ""Did you at that point go to the archived 2 file room to see if there were archived files on 3 Father Shanley? 4 ""ANSWER: I did it. 5 ""QUESTION: Is that where the second group 6 of documents, approximately 813 pages came from? 7 ""ANSWER: Correct."" 8 Then if I could just refer you to another 9 section of this as well. 10 If I could refer you to page 49, Cardinal 11 Law, starting at line 16. 12 ""QUESTION: You're the keeper of the 13 records"" -- this is, again, to Father Higgins. 14 ""You're the keeper of the records; is that 15 correct?"" 16 ""ANSWER: Correct."" 17 MR. ROGERS: Hold on. 18 Q I'm sorry. Page 49. It's on the same page. 19 A Oh, 49, okay. 16. Good. 20 Q Okay? 21 A Yes. 22 Q Page 49, line 16: 23 ""You're the keeper of records; is that 24 correct?"" 27 1 ""ANSWER: That is correct. 2 ""You have a file for Paul Shanley? 3 ""ANSWER: Correct. 4 ""QUESTION: You have a file for other 5 priests; is that correct? 6 ""ANSWER: Correct. 7 ""And are those files maintained by the 8 Archdiocese in some particular room at the 9 Chancery? 10 ""ANSWER: Correct. 11 ""QUESTION: What room is that? 12 ""ANSWER: It's a locked cabinet at the end 13 of the hall. 14 ""QUESTION: Where are the confidential files 15 kept? 16 ""ANSWER: That is the locked cabinet. 17 ""QUESTION: That's where the confidential 18 files are kept? 19 ""ANSWER: Correct."" 20 MR. MacLEISH: I'm going to mark 21 another exhibit, if I could, please. 22 (Law Exhibit No. 22, Excerpt of Father 23 Higgins Deposition, marked for 24 identification.) 28 1 Q If we could, Your Eminence, go to Exhibit 22, 2 which is another excerpt from the deposition of 3 Father Higgins. 4 A Yes. 5 Q And page 38. I should start at page 37, line 15. 6 ""Who provided you with a copy of this 7 subpoena?"" 8 This is the subpoena for the records of Paul 9 Shanley. 10 ""ANSWER: The law firm of Rogers. 11 ""QUESTION: Who at the law firm? 12 ""ANSWER: I don't remember. 13 ""QUESTION: Was it given to you personally 14 or sent to you by fax or mail? 15 ""ANSWER: I believe it was mailed. 16 ""QUESTION: And you received it. What did 17 you do after getting the subpoena? 18 ""ANSWER: Collected the appropriate records 19 that were asked for. 20 ""QUESTION: And did you do that yourself or 21 did you have any -- did you have other 22 individuals assist you? 23 ""ANSWER: I did that myself. 24 ""QUESTION: Well, you are thoroughly 29 1 familiar with the subpoena and you've turned over 2 to your attorneys all records which are 3 responsive to the subpoena. Is that your 4 testimony? 5 ""ANSWER: Correct. 6 ""How much time did you personally spend 7 locating records that were responsive to the 8 subpoena? 9 ""ANSWER: About three hours."" 10 Do you see that? 11 A I do, yes. 12 MR. MacLEISH: Now, let's mark this 13 document, please. 14 (Law Exhibit No. 23, Handwritten 15 Document, marked for identification.) 16 Q Your Eminence, I'd like to show you Exhibit No. 17 23 and ask if you recognize that as the 1966 18 letter that you referred to in your statement of 19 April 12, 2002, about the inadequate 20 recordkeeping? 21 A I don't recall seeing this. I recall seeing a 22 printed, typed report, which has reference to an 23 allegation. I don't recall seeing this itself. 24 I recall a reference to what I presume this is in 30 1 a written file report. 2 Q Was this something written by Paul Shanley, or 3 was it written -- 4 A Oh, no. I don't think so. I think it was a -- 5 maybe my memory is failing me, but it seemed to 6 me that I saw a typed report -- 7 Q All right. Well, let's go through -- 8 A -- that references this. 9 Q Certainly. All right. Okay. 10 Well, this is Exhibit No. 23 and you see 11 it's from the Shrine of our Lady of LaSalette. 12 Do you see that? 13 A Yes, I do. 14 Q It says, ""Reverend Paul Shanley, St. Patrick's 15 Church, Stoneham, Massachusetts."" 16 And I can represent to you that this was 17 part of the first production of documents that we 18 received. In fact, you'll see the Bates stamp 19 down underneath. That's what we call a Bates 20 stamp, which is a way of marking documents. It 21 says RCAB00001. This was received by our office 22 on April 5 in response to Judge Kern's order. 23 You'll see in the first sentence, it states: 24 ""During the summer, July or August, August, 31 1 1966, said priest masturbated the boy."" 2 Do you see that? 3 A Yes. 4 Q And you'll see down at the bottom of the second 5 paragraph, there's reference to a cabin in the 6 Blue Hills. 7 Do you see that? 8 A I do. 9 Q And you've heard about that cabin in the Blue 10 Hills where Paul Shanley molested children; is 11 that correct? 12 MR. TODD: Objection. 13 A I have not. 14 Q You'll see down at the bottom a reference, 15 although that's blanked out in the exhibit 16 because we want to eliminate the names of 17 victims, it says, ""The boy in question is,"" and 18 then there's a redacted portion. 19 Do you see that? 20 A Yes. 21 Q And then on the second page, it says: 22 ""The boy mentioned above"" -- there in the 23 second paragraph, Cardinal Law -- ""The boy 24 mentioned above knows of two other boys who go 32 1 with said priest without knowing if this is going 2 on or not with them."" 3 Do you see that? 4 A I do. 5 Q And there's also a portion -- two separate 6 portions that are blacked out. 7 Do you see that? 8 A Yes. 9 Q This was a file that was produced for us on April 10 5. Now, you've read the testimony of Father 11 Higgins where he states that it took him three 12 hours to find these documents in 2002. 13 Based on that testimony, and looking at 14 Exhibit No. 23, the report of molestation in 15 1966, do you have any factual basis to believe 16 that this document, this report in Exhibit 23 of 17 molestation, was not accessible in the 18 confidential file or personnel file of Paul 19 Shanley at the time you received the Wilma Higgs 20 letter in 1985? 21 A First of all, Mr. MacLeish, as Father Higgins' 22 testimony, as I read it very cursorily as you 23 just put it before me, indicates you received 24 over 1600 pages of documents. 33 1 Q Right. 2 A And when I say that the institutional memory is 3 faulty -- and I stand by that statement -- I 4 mean that such material should have been filed in 5 such a way that it would be immediately and 6 readily accessible as material that -- first of 7 all, such an allegation would have resulted in a 8 much different action today and so I stand by my 9 comment that our institutional memory was 10 lacking. I think that proves that it was lacking 11 in terms of documentation, and that our filing 12 system needs to be improved. 13 Now, whether -- I'm not certain what file 14 this came from. If Father Higgins says he 15 retrieved this from the confidential, locked 16 file, then I presume that's where he got it, 17 along with the other 800 pages that he got from 18 that file, but my point is that this kind of 19 sensitive material needs to be filed in a much 20 more accessible way that is kept actively 21 together so that this kind of a history can be 22 immediately and readily known. 23 As I have said earlier, it was not my 24 practice in '84, and I doubt it was the practice 34 1 of any bishop to check on -- or to view with 2 suspicion people in place. 3 I would hope, when I have a successor, that 4 there can be some confidence that the people who 5 are in place are appropriately so in terms of 6 this kind of behavior. 7 However, I also hope that there will be a 8 very clear type of recordkeeping so that these 9 things are more immediately and evidently 10 available and are kept apart, not with 1600 11 pages, but kept apart in a way that it's 12 immediately there. 13 Q Your Eminence, I'm not referring to institutional 14 memory. I'm referring to the remarks that you 15 made about the inadequacy of the recordkeeping. 16 Now, Father Higgins has testified it took 17 three hours to find these documents. 18 Do you have any basis to believe that at the 19 time you received the Higgs letter in 1985, this 20 document, Exhibit 23, from a priest at the 21 LaSalette Center concerning allegations of abuse, 22 was not as accessible then as it is now? Do you 23 have any facts to support that? 24 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 35 1 MR. TODD: Objection. 2 A I presume the letter was where it was found, and 3 so, therefore, it would have been accessible if 4 someone had gone there to go through 1600 pages, 5 yes. 6 Q And in fact, when -- you testified that you 7 regarded the matters raised by Mrs. Higgs in 1985 8 as serious matters involving Paul Shanley. You 9 testified to that on Wednesday. Do you recall 10 that? 11 A I'd like an opportunity to go back to some of my 12 testimony on that at a later time. 13 Q Certainly. 14 A But as I recall the letter, reading the letter, 15 as you put it before me, I said yes, those are 16 serious matters that need to be looked at. 17 Q But wouldn't it have been just common sense that 18 when one receives a letter like that, and knowing 19 that there is a confidential file which contains 20 allegations of priest misconduct of a sexual 21 nature or matters of scandal, wouldn't it have 22 been just common sense, when that letter was 23 received, to have someone go back and look in 24 Paul Shanley's confidential file to see if there 36 1 were other reports or allegations of a similar 2 nature? 3 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 4 MR. TODD: Objection. 5 A I'm not so certain that it would have been common 6 sense to have -- to receive a report about what a 7 priest allegedly has said in a talk, to -- to 8 immediately go back to the confidential file to 9 check the priest. I think the logical thing 10 first would be to deal with the letter and deal 11 with the priest and try to ascertain what did he 12 say, what is his reaction to this, as I think I 13 indicated when we met. 14 There are a number of times in my experience 15 when people will hear something one way that was 16 said in another. And I think the fair way to 17 handle something like that is to call the person 18 in and say, Look, we understand that you've said 19 this. Is this true? Do you have some 20 explanation here? 21 The allegation in the letter, as I recall, 22 had to do with what he had said. 23 Q That's correct. 24 A And that's what was being dealt with. Would it 37 1 be wise in every case, when any kind of an 2 allegation comes against a priest, what he said 3 or allegedly said, that the confidential file on 4 that priest be checked? Perhaps that would be a 5 good thing to do, but I'm not -- I wouldn't say 6 that that would be necessarily the thing that one 7 would immediately and appropriately do. 8 Q One would go to the priest first, is what you 9 said? 10 A If -- I think the appropriate thing to do, when 11 someone writes a complaint about what you had 12 said, is to ask you: What did you say? Clarify 13 this. What's your reaction to this? 14 Q Sure. 15 A And then on the basis of that, if the 16 clarification isn't convincing, isn't satisfying, 17 then to investigate the thing further. 18 Q Well, your understanding is -- and let's go to 19 the Higgs letter which we previously had marked 20 as an exhibit so that I can ask you a question 21 about it. 22 Let me get you the exhibit number. 23 MR. MacLEISH: Mr. Thomas? 24 MR. ROGERS, III: It's No. 18. 38 1 Q No. 18. In this letter, Mrs. Higgs is stating 2 that Paul Shanley said: 3 ""When adults have"" -- 4 A Excuse me? 5 Q I'm sorry. I apologize. Exhibit 18, Your 6 Eminence. 7 A Yes, I have it. 8 Q It says: 9 ""When adults have sex with children"" -- this 10 is attributed to Paul Shanley -- ""the children 11 seduced them. Children may later regret having 12 caused someone to go to prison, knowing that they 13 are the guilty ones."" 14 We established Wednesday that this was what 15 Mrs. Higgs was stating Paul Shanley had said at a 16 talk in Rochester, New York. 17 Do you recall that? 18 A That's what the letter says. 19 Q And you described this as a serious matter? 20 A That's correct. 21 Q Serious allegation. You said that in the -- I 22 think your last answer was that you had not seen 23 anything of -- like this about a priest since you 24 became Archbishop of Boston in 1984, any 39 1 allegation like this; is that correct? 2 A That's correct. 3 Q And so given that this was a serious and unusual 4 allegation, you would have expected, as I 5 understand it, that Paul Shanley be interviewed; 6 is that correct? 7 A That's correct. 8 Q And you also, being a person of common sense and 9 good judgment, would understand that when 10 individuals are sometimes asked about whether 11 they have done certain things of a serious 12 nature, they don't always admit it. 13 You would agree with me on that? 14 A That's correct. 15 Q And wouldn't it be just common sense if Paul 16 Shanley denied making this statement, wouldn't it 17 just be common sense that one would go to the 18 same file that Father Higgins went to to see if 19 there were other documents of a similar nature so 20 that one could arrive at the truth? Wouldn't 21 that be common sense? 22 MR. TODD: Objection. 23 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 24 A Mr. MacLeish, I must say that you and I are both 40 1 sitting here with the knowledge of certain things 2 that I did not have in 1985, and that Father 3 McCormack did not have in 1985, and it's very 4 easy for us to think back now and look at this 5 letter in terms of our present knowledge and say 6 this should have happened. 7 It would have been good for this to have 8 happened. But I think if you put yourself back 9 in 1985 and realize that Father Paul Shanley in 10 1985 was a pastor, that there was nothing on the 11 radar screen of mine, and there was nothing on 12 the radar screen of Father McCormack that would 13 have suggested that Father Shanley had been 14 guilty in 1966 of acts of abuse of minors; and 15 had that been on the radar screen, certainly this 16 letter in 1985 wouldn't perhaps even have needed 17 to have been written because he wouldn't have 18 given the talk as a priest. 19 However, that was not the case. Should it 20 have been the case? Should that knowledge have 21 been present? That's what I mean about the 22 faulty institutional memory. I think that our 23 institutional memory was faulty. 24 What Father McCormack had immediately 41 1 available to him was not as full as it should 2 have been, and had he had that knowledge, he may 3 have acted -- and would have acted differently 4 than he did getting this letter. 5 But he got this letter in tempore non 6 suspecto. 7 Q I'm sorry? 8 A There was no reason to suspect -- there was no 9 reason for him to be suspicious. There was no 10 reason for him to suspect. So he calls the 11 priest in -- and as I've indicated to you often 12 happens, and very often there are 13 misunderstandings in terms of what people hear -- 14 and so he puts this before Shanley and asks his 15 explanation. 16 And as I recall, the response of Father 17 McCormack, he felt that the explanation was 18 convincing, and that what he had said was 19 misunderstood. 20 Now, your question to me is would it have 21 been common sense to check the file? I'm not 22 certain that it's common sense to check the file, 23 the confidential file on every priest every time 24 there's a complaint. Would it make -- would it 42 1 be good when this kind of complaint comes in with 2 this kind of a reference to check a file that 3 brings together this kind of material and is 4 updated? I think that that would have been -- 5 had we had that -- that would have been a good 6 thing to do. 7 Q Again, we have Father Higgins stating that he 8 found these records -- we're going to be going 9 over some more -- in three hours in 2002. 10 Now, the question, Cardinal Law, is that 11 given that you, as the Archbishop of Boston, are 12 running 400 parishes and 200 schools and given 13 that you have just promoted, at the time this 14 letter is sent to you, Paul Shanley to pastor of 15 a church in Newton, Massachusetts, where 16 individuals such as Greg Ford and other children 17 were attending CCD classes, wouldn't it have just 18 been common sense if Paul Shanley were to deny 19 that he ever said such a thing as is quoted in 20 Exhibit 18 about adults having sex with children, 21 given the responsibilities that you had as 22 Archbishop towards the children being served in 23 your programs, would it not have been just common 24 sense, when you've got a dispute between 43 1 Mrs. Higgs and Paul Shanley, to go back and spend 2 a couple of hours and look at the records? 3 Wouldn't it have been common sense? 4 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 5 MR. TODD: Objection. 6 A I'm -- you know, as difficult as it may be for 7 you to appreciate this, I'm not so certain, going 8 back in time, that that would have been the 9 common sense thing to do. 10 Q Okay. You understand -- 11 A There -- 12 Q I'm sorry. 13 A You must realize that this man, in 1985, was not 14 under suspicion or I would not have appointed him 15 to pastor. My predecessor would not have 16 appointed him as the admin -- the administrator 17 would not have appointed him as administrator in 18 the interim period. He was not under suspicion. 19 This is a very volatile situation. The 20 general context here is the context of 21 homosexuality. This issue can easily lead to a 22 misunderstanding of what is being said when one 23 differentiates between a lifestyle and an 24 orientation. 44 1 The Church's teaching, as you well know, is 2 criticized by many people on this issue, because 3 we do not believe that a homosexual lifestyle is 4 a morally acceptable behavior, even though we 5 don't place a moral connotation on an 6 orientation, that one can't act out of the 7 orientation. 8 Father Shanley had a reputation of speaking 9 to the necessity of dealing in a compassionate 10 way with people who were homosexuals, and very 11 often when someone does that, it can, 12 unfortunately, create a backlash, and it's very 13 possible that when Father McCormack read this 14 letter, he read this letter in terms of that 15 context, which is a very understandable context, 16 and -- 17 Q I'm really not referring to that portion of it, 18 Cardinal Law. 19 A I understand that, Mr. MacLeish, but I think that 20 that context does set a certain -- that paragraph 21 does set a context for the letter. It sets a 22 context for how possibly someone is hearing what 23 is being said. 24 Q I'm not referring to the sections where Paul 45 1 Shanley is alleged by Mrs. Higgs to have made 2 remarks about homosexuality. You and I agree 3 that adults having sex with children and that 4 children later regretting having caused someone 5 to go to prison knowing that they are the guilty 6 ones, that doesn't have anything to do with 7 homosexuality, Cardinal Law? 8 A Absolutely not. 9 Q So my question is, would there have been any 10 reason, in 1985, why someone in the Archdiocese 11 who had access to Paul Shanley's files could not 12 have gone and looked at them? Would there have 13 been a reason, a policy, why they couldn't have 14 looked at those records? 15 A Your question is different now, Mr. MacLeish, and 16 my answer to that is no. There is no reason why 17 one could not have done that. Your earlier 18 question to me was would it be -- would it have 19 been common sense? Your earlier question implied 20 was there, on the part of Father McCormack, a 21 lack of due diligence in his investigation of 22 this matter raised in this letter, and it was 23 really that question that I was answering. 24 Q That's fine. I agree it's a different question. 46 1 Different question. 2 Was there any reason why the same thing that 3 happened in 2002, three hours of search for 4 records, could not, as a matter of policy, have 5 happened in 1985 when the Higgs letter was 6 received? 7 A There's no reason why it could not have happened. 8 Q And was there any reason, when this letter was 9 received, why Mrs. Higgs could not have been 10 contacted, and we went over it on Wednesday, and 11 asked to provide the tape that she refers to in 12 the first paragraph of her letter? 13 MR. TODD: Objection. 14 A She certainly could have been asked. 15 Q Cardinal Law, again, you know that St. Jean's 16 Parish serves children in 1985, because you had 17 actually just promoted Paul Shanley to pastor at 18 that parish, correct? 19 A Yes. You've made that point a number of times, 20 Mr. MacLeish, he was appointed in 1985 as pastor. 21 That hasn't changed. 22 Q By you? 23 A That's correct. 24 Q And he was made pastor after a recommendation of 47 1 the personnel board? 2 A That's correct. 3 Q And was that typically a written recommendation? 4 A As a matter of fact, I'm not certain that that 5 would have gone through the personnel board, 6 because those people who are appointed as pastors 7 during the administratorship often would be -- 8 can be routinely made pastor. The administrator 9 simply doesn't have the authority to name 10 somebody a pastor. He only has the authority to 11 name somebody an administrator. So the act of 12 appointing him as pastor would have been simply 13 to validate and do what would ordinarily have 14 been done had he been the Archbishop rather than 15 the administrator. 16 Q Well, when one is a pastor -- and we're going to 17 take a break just in a minute. 18 A Excuse me. 19 Q Sure. Absolutely. 20 A If I could say, you're correct that the ordinary 21 procedure in the naming of a pastor is that -- 22 ordinarily, but not necessarily, ordinarily, is 23 that I hear from the personnel board. I get a 24 list of three names, and ordinarily, I would 48 1 choose one of those three. Not necessarily. I 2 might send the three names back and ask them to 3 propose three others or I may make the decision 4 to make a direct appointment. 5 I, frankly, cannot recall in the case of 6 1985, Father Shanley's appointment, whether that 7 was simply an act validating what was done by the 8 administrator -- 9 Q Bishop Daily? 10 A -- Bishop Daily, or whether it's something that 11 came to me from the personnel board. 12 Q Yes. You're right that Bishop Daily was the 13 individual who made Father Shanley administrator 14 of the St. Jean's Parish in 1984. Is that 15 correct? 16 A That's my recollection. 17 Q But when one is elevated to pastor, one is in 18 charge of the parish; is that correct? 19 A Well, an administrator is also -- 20 Q Okay. 21 A An administrator has -- an administrator has the 22 full responsibility of the pastor, but what he 23 doesn't have is the term, and the pastor has a 24 term for his office. 49 1 Q And you were the one, in 1984 and '85, who was 2 exclusively making these assignments to 3 individuals? 4 A After March of '84. 5 Q After March of '84; is that correct? 6 A Right. 7 Q Was it your practice at the time that Paul 8 Shanley was elevated to pastor by you for there 9 to be any review of the priest's files to see if 10 there might be some matter of scandal or abuse 11 that would preclude him from being in charge of a 12 parish serving young children? 13 A No, there was not, because I would have assumed 14 that there was no matter of scandal or abuse if 15 the person was in place. 16 Q So you were relying on Bishop Daily's decision in 17 appointing Paul Shanley as administrator; is that 18 correct? 19 A That's correct. 20 Q Do you know whether when someone is appointed -- 21 elevated to the position of administrator, that 22 customarily, in 1984, there was any review of the 23 file to see if that person -- when I say the 24 ""file,"" I mean the Church's own records -- to see 50 1 if that person might have been involved in 2 abusive conduct or inappropriate conduct? 3 A I'm not aware of such a policy. 4 Q Would there have been any policy that would have 5 been precluding you or Bishop Daily from 6 instructing someone to look at the file before 7 one is elevated to administrator or pastor to see 8 if there was any information in there suggesting 9 that the priest had engaged in inappropriate or 10 sexually abusive behavior? 11 A Here again, Mr. MacLeish, your question creates a 12 perception of reality that simply was not the 13 perception of reality that pertained for me, and 14 I'm sure for those working with me, in 1984 and 15 1985. 16 If a man was in place doing priestly 17 ministry, and had been assigned there, the 18 presumption, which, indeed, may be a naive 19 presumption, but nonetheless, the presumption was 20 that such a person was there as a trustworthy and 21 appropriate individual to carry out that 22 responsibility. 23 Q Cardinal Law, my question was, was there any 24 policy -- I believe my question was, was there 51 1 any policy that would have prevented you or 2 Bishop Daily, when Paul Shanley was elevated to 3 administrator and then pastor, to spend a couple 4 of hours looking at his files before that 5 occurred? Was there any policy that would have 6 prevented that? 7 A No. 8 Q Just one more question and we'll take a break. 9 On institutional memory, you would agree 10 with me, would you not, that institutional memory 11 is not simply records; institutional memory can 12 be something that's oral. Is that correct? 13 A That's correct. 14 Q And so when you were coming in as Archbishop of 15 Boston, you were relying on people who were there 16 who had been preceded -- I'm sorry. You were 17 relying on people who were there at the time to 18 provide you with relevant information about 19 priests that might be promoted or put in charge 20 of parishes. Would that be correct? 21 A Allow me to answer your question and then go back 22 to something that you said just before that. 23 Q Certainly. 24 A Certainly I was relying on what people would say 52 1 and what their memory was. However, when I refer 2 to institutional memory in that letter, what I 3 have in mind is not so much -- and you're correct 4 in broadening the concept, and I perhaps should 5 have been more specific, but I did use -- the 6 preceding sentence I think has to do with 7 recordkeeping. 8 I was thinking more on how that 9 institutional memory is served by records. I 10 think it is very important, the oral tradition, 11 but what -- where I think we need to be much more 12 effective, frankly, is -- and please God, we're 13 becoming more effective, and I must say you and 14 others are helping us do that. 15 Q Thank you. 16 A And I mean that. 17 Q I know you do. 18 A I appreciate the fact that we're going through 19 this exercise. 20 Q I know you do. 21 A But I was referring there to the written 22 record -- not to in any way denigrate the 23 importance of those personal, oral responses -- 24 but I think that there needs to be a clear and 53 1 concise and precise and readily accessible record 2 of things of this type that are not, if I might 3 say, in among 1600 other pages, but are there 4 clearly. 5 Q Three hours, yes. 6 Would you like to take a break now, 7 Cardinal? 8 A Might I just, since we're on this -- unless you 9 want to -- if you prefer the break -- 10 Q Go ahead. Please, please go ahead. 11 A I just wanted to address a remark that -- 12 MR. TODD: Identify what you have 13 there. 14 A You gave me an exhibit of my interrogatories. 15 Q Admissions. 16 A Which is that? No. 1, is it? 17 Q Yes. The one you wanted to change. 18 A Yes. And then you put before me a letter from 19 Bishop McCormack to Mrs. Higgs. Here it is. 20 Q Exhibit 20, about your note. 21 A Yeah. 22 Q That's your note. 23 A I'd like to talk about that again, if I may. 24 Q Certainly. 54 1 A I think that I would prefer to leave response to 2 No. 1 as I have it, because as I -- I thought 3 about this letter. It's one of the many things 4 that I've been keeping a lot to think about. He 5 says, ""Recently I received a note from the 6 Cardinal."" 7 Q Right. 8 A And when I saw that -- and that was the first 9 time I had seen that letter -- I thought of it in 10 terms of a note from me, and, obviously, if I 11 sent him a note, I would have read what that note 12 was about. At least I would have scanned it. I 13 would have seen it. 14 But I really think that it's conceivable and 15 not unlikely that Father McCormack is referring 16 to having gotten this, ""not acknowledged at 17 residence,"" which implies, as I think I said 18 earlier, in the use of this stamp, that the 19 person getting it is to respond either by looking 20 into it, by doing whatever is necessary. If I 21 have to be involved, to get back to me about 22 that, but to take care of it, and it hasn't been 23 acknowledged at the residence, and the fact is 24 that it went to Father McCormack. I'm presuming 55 1 that that is that indication where -- 2 MR. TODD: You're pointing to -- 3 A I'm pointing to his name up there in the corner, 4 and it may very well be that that's the note, and 5 that note would not imply at all that I had seen 6 this. As a matter of fact, it would be quite the 7 opposite. 8 Something that is stamped in that way would 9 ordinarily be something that I have not seen but 10 that has gone to the person referenced. And 11 perhaps, if you're with Father McCormack again -- 12 and I have not talked to him about this -- I 13 mean, Bishop McCormack -- you might ask about 14 that, but I -- 15 Q Yes. 16 A But my sense is that when he says ""note,"" that 17 that could be the explanation of that, because 18 seeing his letter does still not awaken in me a 19 memory of having seen this letter. 20 MR. MacLEISH: Would you mind if I just 21 had a few more questions before we break, on your 22 testimony, Cardinal? 23 MR. ROGERS: No. 24 Q Cardinal, so as I understand it, your original 56 1 admission says: 2 ""The defendant does not believe he read the 3 Higgs letter in 1985."" 4 A Yes. 5 Q If I could, Cardinal, at the conclusion of our 6 day Wednesday, you indicated you wanted to change 7 that admission based upon the documents I 8 presented to you; is that correct? 9 A That's correct. 10 Q Now you want to go back and change what you said 11 on Wednesday to indicate that your original 12 admission stands; you do not believe you read the 13 Higgs letter in 1985? 14 A That's correct. I believe that what is said 15 here -- that the defendant does not believe he 16 read the Higgs letter -- is the truth, as I see 17 it; and I was persuaded by the reference to the 18 note, that if I sent him a note about this, then 19 I must have read the letter, but I really believe 20 that that note could be a reference to what is 21 here. That would not indicate, if that's the 22 basis of his word ""note,"" that would not indicate 23 that I read the letter. 24 Q Well, respectfully, he says he received a note 57 1 from the Cardinal. 2 A I understand. 3 Q He doesn't say he received a note. He said he 4 received a note from you. 5 A I know it says that. 6 Q And Bishop McCormack would not be someone who 7 would, to Paul Shanley, at this time, state 8 something that was not true? 9 A Well, I don't -- you know, it is not true to say 10 that he received this from -- 11 Q When you say ""this"" you're meaning Exhibit -- 12 A -- received Exhibit 18 from me, from my office, 13 which is receiving it from me, from my office. 14 Q Well, respectfully, Exhibit 18 is not a note; 15 Exhibit 18 is a letter from Wilma Higgs. 16 A No, no. I'm talking about -- 17 Q The stamp? 18 A Yes, the stamp with his name on it. 19 Q That that -- 20 A I believe that that could reference a note to 21 him. 22 Q Well, Cardinal, the truth is, is that -- and 23 memories are fallible, and I accept that and we 24 all accept that -- is that you just don't know 58 1 either way. Now, you're stating you don't know 2 either way whether you had read the Higgs letter 3 or whether you didn't read the Higgs letter; is 4 that correct? You just don't know either way? 5 MR. TODD: Objection. 6 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 7 A I don't believe that that's what I said in 8 response to this -- 9 Q No, I know that -- 10 A -- question. And that's what I'm referencing 11 here. You asked me, ""Cardinal Law read the 12 letter addressed to him from a true and accurate 13 copy of the Higgs letter. Response No. 1. The 14 defendant does not believe he read the Higgs 15 letter in 1985. The defendant admits that he has 16 since read this correspondence."" 17 Q Right. 18 A And I am saying to you that that's the response 19 that I would like to enter, and not the response 20 as I changed it yesterday. 21 Q On Wednesday? 22 A On Wednesday. 23 Q Respectfully, Cardinal, wouldn't the better 24 response be simply, as you reference in other 59 1 sections of your admissions -- and I can point 2 them out to you, for example, Response No. 15, 3 which is on page 3 of the admissions, where you 4 state that ""The defendant has no recollection of 5 any such discussion, and therefore, can neither 6 admit nor deny this request for admission,"" 7 wouldn't the better response for No. 2 be that 8 you just don't know either way, so you can't 9 admit or deny? Wouldn't that be the better 10 response, Cardinal Law? 11 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 12 MR. TODD: Objection. It's No. 1, not 13 No. 2. 14 Q Yeah, right. No. 1? 15 A Number 1. 16 Q Isn't it true that you just, as you sit here 17 today, truthfully, you just don't know? You 18 might have seen it; you might not have seen it? 19 Isn't that what you're saying? 20 A Well, I think, Mr. MacLeish, at least as I 21 understand it, when I say ""The defendant does not 22 believe he read the Higgs letter in 1985,"" I'm 23 not saying that I know without any shadow of a 24 doubt that I did not read the letter. That's not 60 1 what's being said. 2 If you want to suggest to me how I respond 3 to that, I -- you know, I can frame it in another 4 way, and perhaps you can give me a little bit of 5 time to think about it. 6 Q Sure. 7 A But the substance of what I want to say is that I 8 cannot here say to you under oath that I saw this 9 letter. 10 Q Nor can you say that you didn't? 11 A That's correct. 12 Q So the better answer is you just don't -- 13 MR. TODD: No. 14 Q Wait a second. The better answer, you would 15 agree with me, is you just don't know whether you 16 saw it or you didn't? Is that the truth, 17 Cardinal Law? 18 MR. TODD: Objection. 19 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 20 MR. TODD: Objection. 21 Q Go ahead; you can answer. 22 MR. TODD: Is it a better answer or is 23 it true? It's two questions. 24 Q Well, you just don't know either way? 61 1 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 2 A You know, perhaps you should let me think about 3 this over coffee and come back. 4 Q Sure. I'd be happy to do that. Why don't we 5 take our break. 6 A It's what does ""believe"" mean. I think that -- 7 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 10:14. 8 We're off the record. 9 (Recess) 10 (Law Exhibit No. 24, Letter, 11 marked for identification.) 12 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 10:25. 10:25:57 13 We're back on the record. 10:26:10 14 Q Cardinal Law, you wanted to say something? 10:26:13 15 A Yes, Mr. MacLeish, thank you. To go back, if I 10:26:14 16 may, just for a moment to my responses. 10:26:17 17 Q Yes. 10:26:20 18 A Request for admissions, and it's that response 10:26:23 19 number 1. 10:26:26 20 Q Yes. 10:26:26 21 A You know, with all due respect, I think I'm 10:26:27 22 more comfortable with my response as I 10:26:31 23 originally gave it, because the stamp on the 10:26:34 24 letter, the Higgs letter, and the note at the 10:26:43 62 1 top, that would indicate to me that this was 10:26:45 2 something that I did not see. Obviously I saw 10:26:48 3 this, as I indicate in the response 10:26:52 4 subsequently, but that I did not see it at the 10:26:55 5 time, and I would prefer to leave it as it is. 10:26:58 6 It's not an absolute does not believe, but I 10:27:02 7 think it conveys a tilt toward the fact that it 10:27:09 8 is my thought that it is likely that I did not 10:27:12 9 see it, and I think that's different than 10:27:17 10 saying I can't say whether I did or whether I 10:27:19 11 didn't. 10:27:23 12 Q Okay. 10:27:23 13 A You know, we could argue -- 10:27:24 14 Q Sure. No, I don't -- 10:27:26 15 A -- one way or the other. I perhaps could live 10:27:27 16 with the other, but I'm more comfortable with 10:27:30 17 this, so I would rather leave it as I 10:27:33 18 originally said it. 10:27:35 19 Q So the tilt on Wednesday was that you had seen 10:27:36 20 it; now the tilt is you didn't see it. Is that 10:27:39 21 correct? 10:27:41 22 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 10:27:41 23 MR. TODD: Objection. 10:27:43 24 A No, that is not correct. It's not -- when you 10:27:43 63 1 put before me the letter of Bishop McCormack. 10:27:46 2 Q Right. 10:27:48 3 A Which I had not seen before. 10:27:49 4 Q Right. 10:27:50 5 A And -- to Paul Shanley. 10:27:50 6 Q Right. 10:27:57 7 A Which is Exhibit 20. 10:27:57 8 Q Right. 10:27:59 9 A And it says recently I received a note from the 10:28:00 10 Cardinal. 10:28:04 11 Q Right. 10:28:05 12 A It's that that took me back. 10:28:05 13 Q Right. 10:28:08 14 A And it's based on that word ""note"" that I 10:28:08 15 altered my response, but as I have reflected 10:28:11 16 further on that, I believe that -- and the only 10:28:15 17 way to ascertain this is if you could question 10:28:17 18 Bishop McCormack further, and he may not have a 10:28:21 19 clearer memory than I, but it seems to me that 10:28:23 20 he could use certain literary license at that 10:28:27 21 point, and -- because he did receive the letter 10:28:31 22 with the stamp and with his name, and he could 10:28:38 23 reference that as a note. It's not a written 10:28:42 24 note, but it is a note out of my office from 10:28:48 64 1 those whose responsibility it is to assist me 10:28:51 2 with the mail, and they act on my behalf. So I 10:28:54 3 think it's appropriate that he may have 10:28:58 4 responded that way. 10:29:01 5 Q All right. So this reflection that you've had, 10:29:02 6 Cardinal Law, has this reflection included 10:29:05 7 communication with your attorneys about this 10:29:09 8 subject matter since Wednesday? 10:29:11 9 A I've let them know how I feel about this, and I 10:29:12 10 checked it out, because I don't want to be -- I 10:29:14 11 don't want to be, you know, doing something 10:29:17 12 that legally may not be the appropriate thing 10:29:20 13 to do, and I was told that I had the ability to 10:29:23 14 come and ask you if I could change that. 10:29:26 15 Q Sure. Absolutely. So your reflection has 10:29:29 16 included discussions with your attorneys about 10:29:32 17 this; is that correct? About this subject? 10:29:33 18 A Correct. I just discussed it with them at this 10:29:35 19 five-minute coffee break to let them know how I 10:29:39 20 felt about it, and what I would like to proceed 10:29:42 21 with, and they concurred that I should do that. 10:29:46 22 Q And your reflection also included 10:29:49 23 communications with your attorneys between the 10:29:52 24 time on this -- on this subject between the 10:29:54 65 1 time you left the deposition on Wednesday and 10:29:56 2 the time that you arrived here this morning; is 10:29:58 3 that correct? 10:30:00 4 MR. ROGERS: I object. 10:30:01 5 MR. MacLEISH: Your objection is 10:30:02 6 noted. 10:30:03 7 MR. ROGERS: Well, you're asking 10:30:04 8 about the subject matter of communications 10:30:05 9 between counsel -- 10:30:06 10 MR. MacLEISH: I'm asking about 10:30:07 11 the -- the witness has, I think very candidly, 10:30:09 12 changed his testimony, which I allowed at the 10:30:13 13 beginning was perfectly appropriate to do, to 10:30:17 14 modify it. I invited him to do that. 10:30:20 15 Q My question is whether or not between the time 10:30:22 16 that we stopped on Wednesday and this 10:30:25 17 morning -- not the five-minute break we just 10:30:29 18 took -- whether your reflection included 10:30:32 19 discussions on the subject matter of this 10:30:34 20 admission with your attorneys. 10:30:36 21 A Listen, yes, I discussed with my attorney -- 10:30:39 22 Q I don't want the substance. 10:30:43 23 MR. TODD: Without a waiver. 10:30:43 24 MR. ROGERS: That's what you're 10:30:45 66 1 asking. 10:30:46 2 MR. MacLEISH: Only subject matter. 10:30:47 3 A But you've asked me that, so I should say in 10:30:49 4 context, Mr. MacLeish, lest it be 10:30:51 5 misunderstood, because should it be 10:30:54 6 misunderstood that this item was yanked out of 10:30:58 7 context, I discussed in a general way how did 10:31:00 8 the deposition go, where do you think it's 10:31:03 9 going, those kinds of questions, and in the 10:31:08 10 context of that, that change also emerged, and 10:31:11 11 my unease about it. 10:31:16 12 Q Now, you testified about you had not discussed 10:31:17 13 this specific issue with Bishop McCormack; is 10:31:20 14 that correct? 10:31:25 15 A That is correct. 10:31:25 16 Q Has anyone relayed to you the substance of 10:31:26 17 Bishop McCormack's testimony on this subject? 10:31:31 18 A The substance of his testimony? 10:31:31 19 Q Yes. 10:31:32 20 A No. 10:31:32 21 Q I have another exhibit before you, Cardinal 10:31:36 22 Law, which is Exhibit No. 24 -- I think we have 10:31:37 23 that right here -- which is Bishop McCormack's 10:31:40 24 letter to Wilma Higgs of May 15, and it 10:31:45 67 1 states -- again, this is the woman that is -- 10:31:49 2 from Rochester who has written in about this 10:31:52 3 discussion of Paul Shanley at this meeting in 10:31:55 4 Rochester, and it states, ""Dear Miss Higgs"": 10:32:00 5 First paragraph, ""Archbishop Law received your 10:32:03 6 letter of April 29, 1985. He is sorry to hear 10:32:06 7 you were disturbed about the talk given by 10:32:09 8 Father Paul Shanley last November regarding 10:32:11 9 homosexuals and asked that I respond on his 10:32:14 10 behalf."" Have you seen this letter, Exhibit 10:32:17 11 No. 24, before today? 10:32:21 12 A Yes. Did you put this before me earlier? 10:32:25 13 Q I don't believe it's an exhibit, no. 10:32:28 14 A Yeah. Yeah. I've seen this in recent days, 10:32:30 15 yes. 10:32:35 16 Q Well, here in this letter, Bishop McCormack is 10:32:36 17 describing to Mrs. Higgs your feelings. Is 10:32:39 18 that not the case? 10:32:44 19 A That's -- that's what he's describing, yes. 10:32:46 20 Q He says that you were sorry to hear that she 10:32:48 21 was disturbed about the talk. Is that correct? 10:32:52 22 A That's what the letter says. 10:32:54 23 Q And in order -- well, certainly Bishop 10:32:57 24 McCormack would not be stating something that 10:32:59 68 1 was untrue to this woman who had sent in the 10:33:01 2 letter about Paul Shanley. That wasn't his 10:33:05 3 practice at the time, was it? 10:33:07 4 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 10:33:08 5 MR. TODD: Objection. 10:33:10 6 A If you're asking me if this letter -- well, 10:33:10 7 what is the question? 10:33:14 8 Q Was it Bishop McCormack's practice, when he was 10:33:16 9 writing letters to people who had made 10:33:20 10 complaints about priests in 1985, 1986, 1987, 10:33:21 11 was it his practice to make statements about 10:33:26 12 your feelings on subjects without speaking with 10:33:29 13 you? 10:33:31 14 A You'd have to ask him about that. 10:33:34 15 Q Okay. All right. Let's go back to the 10:33:37 16 institutional oral memory, and I'd like to give 10:33:42 17 you a letter. 10:33:44 18 While Mr. Thomas is retrieving it, let me 10:33:50 19 first ask you about your relationship with 10:33:53 20 Bishop Daily. He was present when you arrived 10:33:55 21 as Archbishop; is that correct? 10:33:59 22 A He was. 10:33:59 23 Q He was one of the auxiliary bishops; is that 10:34:00 24 correct? 10:34:04 69 1 A He was. 10:34:04 2 Q And he was someone you would speak with 10:34:04 3 regularly; is that correct? 10:34:06 4 A I spoke with him a good bit. 10:34:08 5 Q I'm sorry. I didn't -- 10:34:11 6 A I spoke with him a good bit, yes. 10:34:11 7 Q When you first came in, you really didn't have 10:34:13 8 that much familiarity with the priests of the 10:34:15 9 Archdiocese; is that correct? 10:34:18 10 A That's correct. 10:34:19 11 Q And you would rely upon people like Bishop 10:34:19 12 Daily to keep you updated on matters of 10:34:22 13 importance; is that correct? 10:34:23 14 A That's correct. 10:34:24 15 Q And that would include matters relating to 10:34:25 16 priests; is that correct? 10:34:26 17 A That's correct. 10:34:29 18 Q When did Bishop Daily leave? 10:34:29 19 A Bishop Daily left -- was it -- he left in '8 -- 10:34:33 20 I'm not certain. 10:34:42 21 Q He left in '84 or '85? 10:34:42 22 A Yeah, around there, yeah. 10:34:45 23 Q But you had had the opportunity -- 10:34:46 24 A Some months, but he left, I believe, less than 10:34:49 70 1 a year after I came. 10:34:53 2 Q Less than a year? 10:34:53 3 A I believe so. 10:34:54 4 Q But during that year he was one of your closest 10:34:55 5 advisors; is that correct? 10:34:57 6 A That's correct. 10:34:58 7 Q And you have maintained a friendship with 10:35:00 8 Bishop Daily in the years since? 10:35:01 9 A Well, we are friends. You know, we both stay 10:35:02 10 rather busy, so that you see yourselves at a 10:35:06 11 meeting maybe, but that's about it. 10:35:10 12 Q Would you consider him to be a friend? 10:35:12 13 A Oh, yes, I consider him a friend. 10:35:14 14 Q And when he went down to Palm Beach, I think 10:35:14 15 that was his next assignment, is that not 10:35:17 16 correct, after he left Boston? 10:35:19 17 A That's correct. 10:35:20 18 Q That was from a recommendation from you; is 10:35:20 19 that correct? 10:35:25 20 A Well, you know, the issue of inter -- the issue 10:35:25 21 with regard to candidates for bishops come with 10:35:31 22 the understanding that you don't reveal that 10:35:41 23 you have been asked about them. So I'm really 10:35:44 24 not -- 10:35:47 71 1 Q Fair enough. 10:35:47 2 A I'm not willing to speak about who I recommend 10:35:48 3 or don't recommend to the office of bishop. 10:35:55 4 Q Fair enough. I don't want to get into these 10:35:56 5 types of communications. It would be fair to 10:35:59 6 state you thought highly of Bishop Daily when 10:36:02 7 he left for Palm Beach; is that correct? 10:36:05 8 A That's correct. 10:36:07 9 Q There wasn't anything about Bishop Daily 10:36:07 10 that -- let me just withdraw that question. I 10:36:10 11 think you've already answered the question. 10:36:12 12 Now, let's mark this next document, 10:36:14 13 please. 10:36:16 14 (Law Exhibit No. 25, Letter, 11/17/77, 15 marked for identification.) 16 Q This is a letter, again retrieved during the 10:36:31 17 three-hour search by Father Higgins, as part of 10:36:35 18 the first production, directed to His Eminence 10:36:38 19 Cardinal Medeiros on November 17, 1977. You'll 10:36:45 20 note, Cardinal Law, in the first paragraph, this 10:36:50 21 is yet another document, ""Cardinal's Residence, 10:36:53 22 Received,"" do you see that at the bottom and ""Not 10:36:56 23 acknowledged""? Do you see that? 10:37:02 24 A Yes. 10:37:02 72 1 Q If you'd take a look at the first paragraph. 10:37:02 2 This is from a Jeanne Sweeney, who indicates 10:37:05 3 she's a registered nurse married to a physician 10:37:06 4 and the mother of three children, and that 10:37:08 5 she's active in the Catholic Diocese of 10:37:11 6 Rochester, New York. Do you see that? 10:37:14 7 MR. TODD: Just take a minute. 10:37:16 8 A Let me just take a look at the letter. 10:37:19 9 Q Certainly. 10:37:21 10 (Law Exhibit No. 26, Letter, 10/4/77, 11 marked for identification.) 12 A Mr. MacLeish. 10:38:05 13 Q Yes. 10:38:06 14 A May I ask you a question? 10:38:07 15 Q Could we do that at the end? 10:38:09 16 A At the end. All right. 10:38:11 17 Q I'd very much appreciate that. You can ask, 10:38:13 18 absolutely. 10:38:16 19 A (Witness reviewing document.) 20 Q You've read the letter? 10:38:27 21 A I have. 10:38:28 22 Q You'll see that Mrs. Sweeney in this letter 10:38:29 23 produced from your files indicates that there 10:38:32 24 was a talk given in Rochester, the same place 10:38:35 73 1 as Mrs. Higgs' talk, about -- do you see 10:38:41 2 Mrs. Higgs was also reporting about a talk 10:38:45 3 given by Paul Shanley in Rochester? 10:38:49 4 A Is it the same date? 10:38:50 5 Q No. A different year. Totally different year. 10:38:52 6 This is 1977. 10:38:54 7 A All right. 10:38:56 8 Q Okay? 10:38:56 9 A Mm-hmm. 10:38:56 10 Q I'm sorry. To be clear, this is many years 10:38:57 11 earlier, before you were in Boston? 10:39:00 12 A I realize that, yeah. 10:39:01 13 Q November 17, 1977. And she refers to a talk -- 10:39:03 14 a meeting on homosexuality held in Rochester 10:39:08 15 where Father Shanley was speaking, and that 10:39:12 16 there's a woman who has written a report of the 10:39:15 17 meeting and enclosed is the report she wrote 10:39:19 18 from her notes. Do you see that? 10:39:21 19 A I do. 10:39:22 20 Q Then she also provides copies of -- in the last 10:39:23 21 paragraph she indicates that she's providing 10:39:26 22 ""copies of clippings, correspondence, which are 10:39:28 23 pertinent to Reverend Shanley's appearance here 10:39:30 24 and my efforts in trying to bring Mrs. Stevens' 10:39:33 74 1 report before the channels of this Archdiocese 10:39:37 2 open to me as a laywoman."" Do you see that? 10:39:39 3 A I do. 10:39:41 4 Q Again, we have Exhibit 26, Cardinal Law, again 10:39:42 5 contained in the first set of production that 10:39:47 6 was found by Father Higgins, a letter of October 10:39:50 7 4, 1977, entitled Report of Reverend Shanley's 10:39:53 8 talk to Dignity - Integrity, 9/23/1977. Do you 10:39:59 9 see that? 10:40:04 10 A I do. 10:40:04 11 Q Have you seen this document before today? 10:40:05 12 A I have not. 10:40:06 13 Q Why don't you take a moment and read Exhibit 10:40:07 14 No. 26. 10:40:09 15 A (Witness reviewing document.) 16 Q Have you read the letter, Cardinal? 10:41:49 17 A I have. 10:41:50 18 Q I'd like to read a section of it from the first 10:41:51 19 page. This is about three-quarters of the way 10:41:55 20 down. This is again about the speech that 10:41:57 21 Mrs. Delores Stevens -- do you see her as the 10:41:59 22 signatory? Do you see Delores Stevens, the 10:42:02 23 signatory? This is the letter she sent to 10:42:05 24 Jeanne Sweeney, and it is referred to in 10:42:08 75 1 Exhibit 25, Jeanne Sweeney's letter to Cardinal 10:42:10 2 Medeiros. Do you see that? 10:42:13 3 A Yes. 10:42:14 4 Q And at this talk, it is reported by Mrs. Stevens 10:42:15 5 that Paul Shanley said as follows: ""He spoke of 10:42:21 6 pedophilia (which is a noncoerced sexual 10:42:26 7 manipulation of sex organs including oral-genital 10:42:31 8 sex between an adult and child.) He stated that 10:42:34 9 the adult is not the seducer -- the kid is the 10:42:36 10 seducer and further the kid is not traumatized by 10:42:40 11 the act per se, the kid is traumatized when the 10:42:43 12 police and authorities drag the kid in for 10:42:46 13 questioning."" 10:42:48 14 Next paragraph, ""He stated that he can 10:42:50 15 think of no sexual act that causes psychic 10:42:52 16 damage"" quote, ""'not even incest or 10:42:56 17 bestiality,'"" close quotes. Do you see those 10:42:59 18 statements? 10:43:03 19 A I do, and they're terrible. 10:43:03 20 Q They're terrible statements? 10:43:04 21 A Absolutely. 10:43:05 22 Q And if Paul Shanley had said these things, he 10:43:06 23 would have absolutely no business being 10:43:10 24 assigned to any parish ministry which involved 10:43:11 76 1 young children; you would agree with me about 10:43:14 2 that, would you not? 10:43:16 3 A That's correct. 10:43:16 4 Q And you'll note the date of the communication 10:43:22 5 from Mrs. Sweeney that refers to this report 10:43:35 6 from Delores Stevens, that's November 17, 1977; 10:43:39 7 is that correct? 10:43:43 8 A That's correct. 10:43:43 9 (Law Exhibit No. 27, Letter, 12/2/77, 10 marked for identification.) 11 A If I may say, you know, it is not only that 10:44:05 12 paragraph which is -- which is wrong and 10:44:14 13 deplorable and would render a person incapable 10:44:21 14 of exercising ministry, but I must say that the 10:44:26 15 very second paragraph would also -- where he 10:44:31 16 says homosexual acts -- homosexual acts are not 10:44:35 17 sinful, nor are they immoral, if he were 10:44:40 18 teaching that, that would be contrary to the 10:44:43 19 Church's teaching. 10:44:46 20 Q Right. But that would -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. 10:44:48 21 That wouldn't suggest that he was 10:44:50 22 dangerous to children. The portion that I read 10:44:52 23 to you before would suggest to you that this 10:44:55 24 man was a danger to children, would it not? 10:44:57 77 1 A That's correct. 10:45:00 2 Q And that -- 10:45:02 3 A Well, excuse me. 10:45:03 4 Q Go ahead. 10:45:05 5 A It would certainly be that he is teaching 10:45:06 6 something that is dangerous. Now, whether he 10:45:10 7 himself was doing this, it doesn't say that. 10:45:17 8 Q Well, it would raise concerns, would it not? 10:45:18 9 A But it would certainly raise question about his 10:45:20 10 judgment, and if he were giving this opinion 10:45:23 11 and reinforcing others who may be acting in 10:45:24 12 this way, that would be wrong. 10:45:27 13 Q Well, he's speaking out in a parish in 10:45:28 14 Rochester, New York, as I understand 10:45:33 15 Mrs. Sweeney's letter, St. Luke's Episcopal 10:45:36 16 Church? 10:45:40 17 A To a group called Dignity - Integrity. 10:45:40 18 Q That's correct. And certainly someone who 10:45:43 19 would make a remark that he can think of no 10:45:45 20 sexual act that causes psychic damage, not even 10:45:48 21 incest or bestiality, would you agree with me 10:45:52 22 that that's a deviant, perverted thought? 10:45:54 23 A Absolutely, without any shadow of a doubt. 10:45:57 24 Q And that people who make statements like that, 10:45:59 78 1 it would at least raise a concern whether they 10:46:02 2 themselves are engaging in those types of acts? 10:46:04 3 A It would -- the teaching in and of itself is 10:46:08 4 sufficient to indicate that someone may not be 10:46:13 5 given the responsibility of teaching and being 10:46:16 6 a pastoral leader. I'm not certain that you 10:46:20 7 can move from what is written here to the fact 10:46:22 8 that the person is engaging in the act. 10:46:26 9 Q But you might? 10:46:28 10 A But you might, yes. You'd certainly -- it 10:46:29 11 would be a flag. 10:46:32 12 Q And you've not seen this document before today? 10:46:34 13 A I have not. 10:46:35 14 Q And are you aware that in 1977, that was the 10:46:36 15 year that Greg Ford, Paul Busa and Anthony 10:46:39 16 Driscoll were born? 10:46:43 17 A I was not. 10:46:44 18 Q So then I'd like to show yo R C exhibit, 10:46:45 19 Cardinal Law, which is Exhibit No. 27, which 10:46:49 20 is, again, retrieved from your files in the 10:46:52 21 first set of documents. And it states ""Dear 10:46:56 22 Mrs. Sweeney: Your letter to His Eminence 10:46:59 23 Cardinal Medeiros, has been referred to this 10:47:03 24 office. It concerns, as you know, a 10:47:04 79 1 presentation made by Father Paul Shanley, a 10:47:06 2 priest of the Archdiocese of Boston, September 10:47:09 3 23, 1977, at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, 10:47:11 4 Rochester, New York. 10:47:16 5 ""I am grateful to you for your letter and 10:47:17 6 for the information which is enclosed. The 10:47:19 7 position of the Archdiocese of Boston is that, 10:47:21 8 while Father Shanley enjoys the faculties of 10:47:23 9 the Archdiocese of Boston, he alone must be 10:47:27 10 held responsible for any statements regarding 10:47:29 11 homosexuality. 10:47:31 12 ""With a sincere hope that the above is 10:47:33 13 helpful to you, I am In Christ Most Reverend 10:47:35 14 Thomas V. Daily, Auxiliary Bishop of Boston."" 10:47:38 15 Do you see that? 10:47:41 16 A I do. 10:47:42 17 Q You would agree with me, would you not, 10:47:43 18 Cardinal Law, that the report of Mrs. Delores 10:47:45 19 Stevens concerns matters separate and apart 10:47:47 20 from homosexuality, specifically deviant and 10:47:51 21 perverted thoughts, statements about bestiality, 10:47:56 22 incest and pedophilia? 10:48:01 23 A That's correct. 10:48:04 24 Q And you'll notice on Exhibit No. 26, you'll 10:48:05 80 1 notice, I think, a similarity between what was 10:48:09 2 said by Mrs. Higgs in 1985 and what is said by 10:48:11 3 Mrs. Stevens in 1977 where she reports, 10:48:16 4 Mrs. Stevens, ""He stated that the adult is not 10:48:18 5 the seducer -- the kid is the seducer and further 10:48:21 6 the kid is not traumatized by the act per se, the 10:48:26 7 kid is traumatized when the police and 10:48:28 8 authorities drag the kid in for questioning."" 10:48:30 9 There's some similarity there, is there not? 10:48:33 10 A There is similarity there. 10:48:35 11 Q Are you aware of any action undertaken by 10:48:38 12 Bishop Daily in 1977 -- I understand you were 10:48:43 13 not there at the time -- to investigate this 10:48:45 14 allegation -- again, portions of which are 10:48:50 15 similar to the Higgs letter -- in 1977? Have you 10:48:53 16 ever heard anything that was done at that time? 10:48:56 17 A Well, clearly I cannot respond to what was done 10:48:58 18 in '77, and I have not heard of anything 10:49:02 19 subsequently. 10:49:06 20 Q Well, you believe, based upon the report that was 10:49:06 21 provided by Mrs. Sweeney, on behalf of 10:49:10 22 Mrs. Stevens, that some further action would be 10:49:16 23 required, given the severity of those 10:49:20 24 allegations; is that correct? 10:49:22 81 1 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 10:49:23 2 MR. TODD: Further than what? 10:49:26 3 Q Do you understand my question? 10:49:27 4 A I'm not sure, but if you could repeat it. 10:49:30 5 Q Well, the only thing we have in the file that 10:49:33 6 was produced after this three-hour search by 10:49:35 7 Father Higgins is this letter from Thomas 10:49:38 8 Daily. Would you agree with me that in 1977 if 10:49:40 9 it is being alleged that a priest is speaking 10:49:44 10 about sexual acts such as pedophilia, incest, 10:49:47 11 bestiality and alleging -- stating that it 10:49:52 12 doesn't cause psychic harm and that in cases of 10:49:56 13 pedophilia the child is the seducer, that that 10:49:59 14 is the type of allegation that would require 10:50:02 15 some further inquiry, separate and apart from 10:50:08 16 Bishop Daily's letter to Mrs. Sweeney? Would 10:50:09 17 you agree with me about that? 10:50:11 18 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 10:50:13 19 A I don't think that the letter necessarily 10:50:14 20 exhausts what the response was to this report, 10:50:17 21 and I would think that the appropriate person 10:50:23 22 to ask about that would be Bishop Daily. 10:50:26 23 Q We intend to at a deposition. 10:50:29 24 A But if your question to me is whether I know of 10:50:31 82 1 what further action or additional action may 10:50:36 2 have been taken as a consequence of this 10:50:40 3 report, I do not know. 10:50:42 4 Q Well, you were at the time in 1977, you were 10:50:46 5 the bishop in Springfield, Missouri; is that 10:50:49 6 correct? 10:50:49 7 A That's correct. 10:50:50 8 Q If you had received a report such as this one, 10:50:50 9 you would have taken some affirmative action to 10:50:53 10 investigate the allegations; is that correct? 10:50:55 11 MR. ROGERS: Objection to the form. 10:50:57 12 A I would hope that I would have, but what I 10:50:58 13 don't want to imply by that is that I presume 10:51:02 14 that Bishop Daily did not take any action. I 10:51:08 15 just -- 10:51:11 16 Q We don't know the answer. You don't know the 10:51:11 17 answer to that either way? 10:51:14 18 A I do not. 10:51:15 19 Q I'm just asking about, if you had received a 10:51:16 20 report in Springfield, Missouri, when you were 10:51:18 21 bishop in 1977, that a priest was going around 10:51:21 22 stating that bestiality and incest and 10:51:23 23 pedophilia cause no damage -- 10:51:26 24 A Or that homosexual acts are not immoral. 10:51:28 83 1 Q I'm not talking about homosexuality. 10:51:33 2 A But that's also in the letter. 10:51:34 3 Q I think that's in a different category -- I 10:51:35 4 think we agreed on that -- a different level of 10:51:38 5 severity, his remarks about bestiality. That's 10:51:42 6 having sex with animals, having sex with 10:51:45 7 brothers and sisters. If you had received a 10:51:49 8 report like that as bishop in Springfield, 10:51:51 9 Missouri, in 1977, a red flag would have gone up 10:51:54 10 and some investigation would have been 10:51:57 11 undertaken, fair statement? 10:51:59 12 A Very fair statement. 10:52:00 13 (Law Exhibit No. 28, Letter, 4/2/79, 14 marked for identification.) 15 Q Before you read this, Cardinal Law, when you 10:52:29 16 arrived in Boston, was Father Helmick your 10:52:31 17 chief secretary? 10:52:35 18 A He was. 10:52:36 19 Q And was he someone that you confided in and 10:52:37 20 spoke with? 10:52:40 21 A Confided in and spoke with. A secretary has a 10:52:44 22 very specific task. 10:52:50 23 Q All right. 10:52:51 24 A He keeps very busy, but yes, I would -- he 10:52:52 84 1 lives in the house. We speak, yes. 10:52:55 2 Q On a daily basis? 10:52:57 3 A On a daily basis. Celebrate mass together, if 10:52:58 4 I don't have mass outside. 10:53:02 5 Q Would you speak to him from time to time about 10:53:03 6 priests? 10:53:04 7 A You know, my policy has been with my 10:53:05 8 secretaries not to do that. 10:53:11 9 Q Mm-hmm. 10:53:13 10 A My policy. I wouldn't say that on occasion it 10:53:14 11 wouldn't occur. But, for example, Bishop -- 10:53:17 12 two of my secretaries that I call to mind, 10:53:24 13 Monsignor McInerney and Father McCune, would 10:53:26 14 complain in good humor to me, because they 10:53:34 15 would hear out of the house about impending 10:53:38 16 changes that they had not heard of in the 10:53:42 17 house, even when they were promulgated, and I 10:53:45 18 kept saying to them that it's much better for 10:53:49 19 them really not to know. 10:53:51 20 Q Okay. 10:53:52 21 A And so -- 10:53:53 22 Q Fair enough. 10:53:55 23 A So to answer your question, my general policy 10:53:56 24 has been not to discuss personnel issues with 10:54:00 85 1 my priest secretaries. 10:54:03 2 Q But your priest secretary, Father Helmick, he 10:54:03 3 is one of the people who makes the decision on 10:54:07 4 whether a piece of correspondence about a 10:54:09 5 priest such as some of the ones we've been 10:54:11 6 through here, the Higgs letter, for example, 10:54:14 7 whether that goes to you or gets sent for 10:54:17 8 action to one of your subordinates; is that 10:54:23 9 correct? 10:54:25 10 A The ordinary policy, as it has evolved -- and 10:54:27 11 exactly the point at which it got solidified 10:54:33 12 this way I cannot say with certainty -- is that 10:54:37 13 if a letter comes to me personal and 10:54:41 14 confidential, then I open that letter. 10:54:46 15 Q Right. 10:54:48 16 A Other than that, the mail is opened, and it 10:54:48 17 is -- and the priest secretary usually working 10:54:53 18 with my administrative assistant, Mrs. Kaye 10:54:57 19 Woodward, sends the mail into the appropriate 10:55:02 20 direction for handling. 10:55:08 21 Q All right. Let's move on, and if you could 10:55:10 22 take a look at the next exhibit, which is 10:55:13 23 number 28. If you could just take a look at 10:55:18 24 the front page first, and then we'll get to the 10:55:20 86 1 enclosure. Do you see that? 10:55:28 2 A Yes, I do. 10:55:36 3 Q This is a letter from an attorney in New York, 10:55:36 4 and he's bringing to Cardinal Medeiros' 10:55:38 5 attention periodicals involving -- two 10:55:41 6 periodicals that involve Father Shanley, 10:55:44 7 including Gay Community News and Gaysweek. Do 10:55:47 8 you see that? 10:55:53 9 A I do. 10:55:53 10 Q And then there's an article that was also 10:55:53 11 produced, and you'll actually see in the top 10:55:54 12 right-hand corner, there's a stamp. We don't 10:55:59 13 have a perfect copy of this from the 10:56:02 14 Archdiocese, but it was received, I believe it 10:56:05 15 says, in the Office of Chancellor; is that 10:56:06 16 correct? 10:56:08 17 A I can't read it either, but I presume that's -- 10:56:10 18 I'm sure that's what it says. 10:56:12 19 Q The chancellor at that time would have been 10:56:13 20 Bishop Daily; is that correct? 10:56:16 21 A That's correct. 10:56:17 22 Q In 1979? 10:56:17 23 A I believe so. 10:56:19 24 Q You believe so. I understand. 10:56:19 87 1 A I'm not sure. 10:56:20 2 Q You were not there. 10:56:21 3 A Well, I'm not -- I'm not being overly cautious 10:56:22 4 here. I simply don't know whether he was 10:56:27 5 Chancellor in '79 or not. He certainly was 10:56:29 6 when I got here. 10:56:31 7 Q This is an article about men and boys, and it 10:56:38 8 states, you'll see at the top, ""150 people 10:56:40 9 turned up for the day-long series of panels 10:56:42 10 discussing the issue of man-boy love; organizer 10:56:45 11 Tom Reeves expected several dozen."" 10:56:50 12 I'd like to direct your attention to 10:56:52 13 certain portions of this, because many are not 10:56:53 14 relevant to our discussion here today. If I 10:56:58 15 could direct your attention, Cardinal Law, to 10:56:59 16 the third paragraph that begins with the 10:57:01 17 capital E. 10:57:05 18 A Yes. 10:57:05 19 Q Do you see that? 10:57:05 20 A Yes, I do. 10:57:06 21 Q And it says, ""Even speakers representing 10:57:06 22 various religious beliefs joined their 10:57:10 23 endorsement of love between man and boy."" Do 10:57:14 24 you see that? 10:57:16 88 1 MR. TODD: Boys. 10:57:17 2 MR. MacLEISH: I'm sorry. 10:57:18 3 A No, I really don't. What paragraph is that? 10:57:20 4 Q This is the one that begins with E. 10:57:22 5 A Oh, E. 10:57:24 6 Q ""Even speakers representing various religious 10:57:24 7 beliefs joined -- voiced their endorsement of 10:57:28 8 love between man and boy""; is that correct? 10:57:32 9 A Yes. Yes. 10:57:33 10 Q And that's certainly not part of the teaching 10:57:34 11 of the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, it's 10:57:35 12 contrary; is that correct? 10:57:38 13 A Absolutely. 10:57:39 14 Q It's repugnant? 10:57:39 15 A Absolutely contrary, absolutely repugnant. 10:57:41 16 Q Then there's a quote from one priest from 10:57:44 17 Hartford, Connecticut, but then I'd like to go 10:57:49 18 on to the other page, which is circled, and it 10:57:52 19 states, ""Father Paul Shanley, a representative 10:57:57 20 of Boston's Cardinal Medeiros for outreach to 10:58:01 21 sexual minorities, told the story of a boy who 10:58:05 22 was rejected by family and society, but helped 10:58:08 23 by a boy-lover. When the parents found out 10:58:12 24 about the relationship, however, the man was 10:58:13 89 1 arrested, convicted, and sent to prison."" 10:58:15 2 Quotes, ""'And there began the psychic demise of 10:58:18 3 that kid.' Shanley commented,"" quote, ""'He had 10:58:21 4 loved that man ... it was only a brief and 10:58:25 5 passing thing as far as the sex was concerned, 10:58:28 6 but the love was deep and the gratitude to the 10:58:30 7 man was deep, and when he realized that the 10:58:32 8 indiscretion in the eyes of society and the law 10:58:34 9 had cost this man perhaps 20 years ... the boy 10:58:36 10 began to fall apart.' Shanley concluded,"" 10:58:40 11 quote, ""'We have our convictions upside down if 10:58:45 12 we are truly concerned with boys ... the'"" 10:58:49 13 quote, ""'cure'"" close quote, does far more 10:58:53 14 damage,'"" end of quote. Do you see that? 10:58:58 15 A I do. 10:58:59 16 Q That's certainly repugnant to the teachings of 10:59:00 17 the Catholic Church and your own moral code? 10:59:02 18 A Absolutely, and I would say not only the 10:59:05 19 Catholic Church. 10:59:08 20 Q The Catholic Church? 10:59:08 21 A But I would say all Catholic churches. 10:59:10 22 Q Society at large? 10:59:14 23 A Right. 10:59:15 24 Q This document was produced, Cardinal Law, as 10:59:19 90 1 part of the three-hour search that Father 10:59:22 2 Higgins refers to in his deposition. Then at 10:59:24 3 the end it says -- the last paragraph on the 10:59:28 4 second page it says, ""At the end of the 10:59:31 5 conference, 32 men and two teen-agers caucused 10:59:34 6 and formed the Man Boy Lovers of North America. 10:59:39 7 A newsletter and a March meeting in New York 10:59:43 8 City are planned."" 10:59:44 9 New paragraph. ""The group can be 10:59:47 10 contacted by writing them care of Fag Rag, Box 10:59:49 11 331, Kenmore Station, Boston, Mass., 02115."" 10:59:54 12 Do you see that? 10:59:59 13 A I do. 10:59:59 14 Q Have you ever seen this document before today? 11:00:00 15 A I have not. 11:00:01 16 Q And is this the type of document, again coming 11:00:03 17 from Attorney McGeady, an attorney in New York 11:00:06 18 City, that would -- when you were -- if you'd 11:00:10 19 received such a letter as bishop in Springfield, 11:00:13 20 Missouri, in 1979 would have raised yet another 11:00:16 21 red flag? 11:00:20 22 A Absolutely. 11:00:20 23 Q Would it have caused you -- particularly if you 11:00:21 24 had received the 1977 letter that we've just 11:00:24 91 1 been through -- caused you to undertake some 11:00:26 2 sort of inquiry now concerning Reverend Paul 11:00:27 3 Shanley and his suitability to serve as a 11:00:31 4 priest in the Archdiocese -- in the Diocese of 11:00:34 5 Springfield? 11:00:38 6 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:00:38 7 A Yes. 11:00:38 8 Q It would. This is now a second independent 11:00:40 9 report from someone two years after the Stevens 11:00:42 10 report. Do you see that? 11:00:45 11 A I do. 11:00:45 12 Q Now, if you had received these two reports, 11:00:49 13 Cardinal Law, when you were at the diocese of 11:00:52 14 Springfield, Missouri, would these two reports 11:00:56 15 cause you, in 1979, to undertake a review of 11:00:59 16 the priest's file to see if there were 11:01:03 17 allegations -- further allegations that 11:01:06 18 predated your knowledge of these two reports? 11:01:10 19 MR. TODD: I'll object to the word 11:01:13 20 ""reports."" 11:01:14 21 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:01:15 22 Q Do you understand the question? 11:01:15 23 A I think I understand the question. 11:01:16 24 Q Go ahead. 11:01:19 92 1 A I'm not certain that you'd have to go back to 11:01:21 2 previous files. I think what you would do is 11:01:26 3 you would investigate what was before you and 11:01:28 4 find out what the substance of that allegation 11:01:31 5 is. But I'm not sure where you're taking me. 11:01:35 6 You know, the question is not what I did in 11:01:44 7 '77. The question is what is happening now. 11:01:46 8 Could you rephrase that question again? 11:01:52 9 Q Sure. Absolutely. I'm asking you whether it 11:01:54 10 was your practice as a bishop -- would have 11:01:57 11 been your practice in 1977, if you received 11:02:00 12 reports from two independent sources that Paul 11:02:02 13 Shanley was making these kinds of deviant, 11:02:04 14 perverted remarks, and assuming Paul Shanley 11:02:07 15 was with your diocese, would you have 11:02:12 16 undertaken some investigation? 11:02:15 17 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:02:18 18 A First of all, I never received such kind of 11:02:18 19 reports. 11:02:19 20 Q I understand. 11:02:19 21 A And I guess what you're asking me is would I 11:02:19 22 have considered such a report a matter of such 11:02:23 23 urgency that I would have -- that I would have 11:02:28 24 done some serious investigation in some way or 11:02:29 93 1 other to determine whether this accurately 11:02:34 2 reflected what he said, and that is certainly 11:02:36 3 true. 11:02:39 4 Q Okay. All right. 11:02:39 5 (Law Exhibit No. 29, Memorandum, 6 4/6/79, marked for identification.) 7 Q Showing you another file that was received as 11:03:10 8 part of the first production, Exhibit No. 29, 11:03:13 9 Cardinal Law, this is a memo of April 6, 1979 11:03:16 10 to Bishop Daily from Father Helmick. 11:03:22 11 ""Attached to this memorandum is a letter 11:03:25 12 the Cardinal received from Paul J. McGeady, 11:03:27 13 Esquire, together with some enclosures from Gay 11:03:30 14 Community News and Gaysweek, as well a copy of 11:03:34 15 my response. 11:03:37 16 ""You will want to review this material and 11:03:38 17 perhaps write a letter to Mr. McGeady for the 11:03:40 18 Cardinal's signature after you have spoken with 11:03:46 19 His Eminence."" Do you see that? 11:03:47 20 A I do. 11:03:49 21 Q So have you ever seen this memorandum before 11:03:49 22 today? 11:03:53 23 A No, I have not. 11:03:53 24 94 1 (Law Exhibit No. 30, Letter, 4/6/79, 2 marked for identification.) 3 Q Now, you'll see, this again from the files of 11:04:27 4 the Archdiocese, you'll see a letter from your 11:04:30 5 personal secretary, not at the time, but when 11:04:36 6 you arrived in Boston, Reverend William 11:04:38 7 Helmick, you'll see a letter unsigned, 11:04:43 8 presumably a copy, to Mr. McGeady in which it 11:04:45 9 states, ""In the absence of His Eminence 11:04:48 10 Cardinal Medeiros, I'm writing to acknowledge 11:04:51 11 receipt of your letter of April 2 and the 11:04:54 12 enclosures from Gay Community News and 11:04:57 13 Gaysweek. 11:04:58 14 ""I will certainly bring your letter and 11:04:59 15 enclosures to the Cardinal's attention when he 11:05:03 16 returns to Boston from Rome. 11:05:05 17 ""With best wishes, I am Sincerely in 11:05:07 18 Christ Reverend William Helmick, secretary to 11:05:08 19 the Cardinal."" Do you see that? 11:05:12 20 A I do. 11:05:12 21 Q Do you know how long after that letter was sent 11:05:12 22 to Mr. McGeady, Paul Shanley was removed as the 11:05:15 23 minister of Alienated Youth and placed in the 11:05:18 24 family parish St. Jean's in Newton, 11:05:23 95 1 Massachusetts? 11:05:25 2 A I do not. 11:05:25 3 Q We will come back to that, I think. We'll come 11:05:39 4 back to that. 11:05:41 5 Now, given that Bishop Daily was a 11:05:43 6 recipient of both -- from the records that we 11:05:50 7 have in front of us -- of the 1977 allegations 11:05:54 8 from Mrs. Stevens and was given, according to 11:05:58 9 your own records -- the Archdiocese's records, I 11:06:03 10 should say -- given by Father Helmick a copy of 11:06:05 11 the, as you've said, perverted writings of Paul 11:06:12 12 Shanley, would you not agree with me that Bishop 11:06:16 13 Daily had an obligation to inform you, when you 11:06:20 14 arrived in Boston, that these types of writings 11:06:26 15 had been attributed to Paul Shanley? Would you 11:06:29 16 agree with that statement? 11:06:32 17 MR. ROGERS: Objection to the form. 11:06:33 18 A There's a step missing here -- 11:06:37 19 Q Okay. 11:06:41 20 A -- Mr. MacLeish, and I don't know the answer to 11:06:43 21 that step. 11:06:46 22 Q Okay. 11:06:47 23 A And only Bishop Daily would know that, and I'm 11:06:48 24 not going to discuss it with him, because I 11:06:51 96 1 presume you will be discussing it with him at 11:06:54 2 some future time. 11:06:58 3 Q I will. 11:06:59 4 A But that is what he did in response to this. 11:06:59 5 What kind of investigation he did, and what was 11:07:06 6 the result of that, and I'd have to -- and so 11:07:08 7 in order to -- my presumption at this point is 11:07:11 8 that there was an investigation, and that he 11:07:18 9 was satisfied as a result of that that he 11:07:23 10 could, with confidence, place him in the 11:07:27 11 position into which he placed him. But absent 11:07:30 12 that bit of information about which I have not 11:07:36 13 spoken with Bishop Daily, I can't answer. I'm 11:07:38 14 not going to conclude that there was no 11:07:41 15 intermediate action. I'm not going to conclude 11:07:46 16 that there was no just basis upon which he made 11:07:47 17 his assignment. That would have to be checked 11:07:51 18 out, and I'm sure that that will be done. 11:07:55 19 Q Fair enough. 11:07:57 20 MR. ROGERS: Mr. MacLeish, it's five 11:07:58 21 past 11:00. May we take a brief recess? 11:08:00 22 MR. MacLEISH: Yes. 11:08:03 23 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:07. 11:08:04 24 This is the end of cassette one in today's 11:08:07 97 1 volume of the deposition of Cardinal Law. 11:08:10 2 We're off the record. 11:08:12 3 (Recess.) 4 (Law Exhibit No. 31, Letter, 4/12/79, 5 marked for identification.) 6 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 11:16. 11:16:45 7 This is Cassette No. 2 in today's volume in the 11:16:47 8 deposition of Cardinal Law. We're back on the 11:16:50 9 record. 11:16:53 10 Q Cardinal Law, assuming -- and, again, we don't 11:16:55 11 know this until we have the deposition of 11:16:58 12 Bishop Daily -- but I'd like you to assume that 11:17:03 13 nothing more was done to follow up on the two 11:17:04 14 letters we've seen so far concerning the 11:17:08 15 deviant views of Paul Shanley. 11:17:11 16 Do you believe if any investigation had 11:17:13 17 been undertaken, Bishop Daily should have 11:17:14 18 brought these matters to your attention before 11:17:17 19 you promoted Paul Shanley to pastor in 1985? 11:17:21 20 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:17:25 21 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:17:26 22 Q You can answer the question. 11:17:26 23 A I'm not sure that I can answer the question as 11:17:29 24 you've put it, because I think the answer -- a 11:17:34 98 1 yes or a no would imply something that I do not 11:17:39 2 think I can say. 11:17:42 3 I believe that this letter you have placed 11:17:46 4 before me, which is Exhibit 31 -- 11:17:48 5 Q Well, before we get to that -- 11:17:51 6 A -- in its first and second paragraphs, 11:17:54 7 indicates to me that some action was indeed 11:17:56 8 taken. I think that that second -- that second 11:17:59 9 paragraph would imply to me -- and, again, you 11:18:07 10 will be in the position to determine that -- 11:18:12 11 but that second letter -- that second paragraph 11:18:15 12 would imply to me that there's been an 11:18:17 13 interaction here with Shanley, and that it's 11:18:20 14 been an interaction around this issue, and it 11:18:24 15 is this issue which you rightly raise in that 11:18:27 16 previous document, has Father Shanley 11:18:31 17 responsible for saying things which are 11:18:37 18 terribly deviant from not only the teaching of 11:18:39 19 the Church, but from sound and moral teachings 11:18:42 20 generally accepted. 11:18:46 21 So I cannot assume on the basis of this 11:18:50 22 document that you have put before me that there 11:18:52 23 was not something done. I would say that 11:18:56 24 something was done. Was it adequate? Was it 11:18:58 99 1 not adequate? It depends on what it was. 11:19:01 2 Q Let's assume -- you're correct, Cardinal Law, 11:19:04 3 where it states that Paul Shanley is told that 11:19:07 4 he has to adhere to the pronouncement of the 11:19:11 5 Holy See regarding sexual ethics. I understand 11:19:13 6 that. 11:19:16 7 What I'm asking you is that, assuming 11:19:18 8 nothing was done to verify that Paul Shanley 11:19:19 9 was openly promoting or talking about 11:19:23 10 bestiality, incest, sex with children, saying 11:19:25 11 that when children have sex with adults, it's 11:19:28 12 not the fault of the children -- assuming that 11:19:31 13 there was no followup by Bishop Daily -- 11:19:35 14 A To that letter? 11:19:38 15 Q -- to those letters. 11:19:39 16 A And reports? 11:19:40 17 Q We have now got two of them. And reports. 11:19:41 18 Do you believe this was a matter that 11:19:44 19 Bishop Daily should have brought to your 11:19:47 20 attention before you promoted Paul Shanley to 11:19:47 21 pastor in 1985? 11:19:50 22 MR. TODD: Well -- 11:19:52 23 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:19:52 24 MR. TODD: I am going to object to 11:19:53 100 1 that. The Cardinal has already said he cannot 11:19:55 2 answer that question and I'm going to instruct 11:19:58 3 him not to answer it until we get before a 11:20:00 4 judge to make a ruling on it. 11:20:02 5 MR. MacLEISH: Well, what's -- it's 11:20:04 6 not a privilege issue. 11:20:05 7 MR. TODD: Under these 11:20:09 8 circumstances -- I didn't mean to interrupt 11:20:09 9 you. 11:20:11 10 Go ahead. 11:20:11 11 MR. MacLEISH: No. You can instruct 11:20:11 12 him not to answer, but it's -- fine. 11:20:12 13 Q You're accepting your counsel's instructions? 11:20:15 14 A I'm going to accept counsel's instructions. 11:20:16 15 Q Did Bishop Daily tell you anything about Paul 11:20:21 16 Shanley making remarks about incest, 11:20:22 17 bestiality, pedophilia or that when children 11:20:25 18 have sex with adults, it's the fault of the 11:20:29 19 child? 11:20:31 20 A No. 11:20:32 21 Q You're certain -- you're certain of that? 11:20:33 22 A I am quite certain of that. 11:20:34 23 Q Okay. Because if you had known that, you would 11:20:36 24 not have made Paul Shanley pastor of St. Jean's 11:20:38 101 1 Parish in Newton, Massachusetts; is that not 11:20:42 2 correct? 11:20:45 3 MR. ROGERS: Objection to the form. 11:20:46 4 A Here again, to have been informed that he had 11:20:47 5 said these things and then to know how they'd 11:20:51 6 been checked out, what intervening action had 11:20:55 7 been taken, all of that's important. I don't 11:20:58 8 know that. And my presumption is that you will 11:21:00 9 find that out. 11:21:06 10 I'm not going to be talking to Bishop 11:21:06 11 Daily about it. As I read this letter from 11:21:09 12 Cardinal Medeiros, my assumption is that 11:21:13 13 something was done, and that Cardinal Medeiros 11:21:16 14 would not have made this kind of an appointment 11:21:19 15 if he wasn't confident that he could do so with 11:21:22 16 a clear conscience. And for that to have 11:21:26 17 occurred, something needed to transpire between 11:21:30 18 that report being received and this letter 11:21:33 19 being written. I don't know what that is. 11:21:36 20 Q All right. You don't know what it is, but you 11:21:39 21 do think that Exhibit 31 suggests that there 11:21:41 22 was at least some discussion with Paul Shanley 11:21:43 23 where he was told to adhere to the Church's 11:21:46 24 doctrines on sexual ethics, correct? 11:21:50 102 1 A As I read the letter, it would be more than 11:21:51 2 that. As I read the letter, it would be that 11:21:54 3 there has been some assurance given that this 11:21:57 4 is going to be the case. 11:22:04 5 Q All right. Okay. 11:22:06 6 MR. MacLEISH: Next exhibit. 7 (Law Exhibit No. 32, The Homosexual. 8 Network, marked for identification.) 9 Q Cardinal Law, this is Exhibit No. 32, which is 11:22:34 10 a document that we recently received from the 11:22:37 11 Archdiocese. 11:22:41 12 I'd like to direct your attention, if I 11:22:42 13 could, to page 296, which is -- you'll see in 11:22:43 14 the bottom left-hand corner. 11:22:51 15 A We're all set. 11:23:23 16 Q Okay. You'll see on page 296, it states -- and 11:23:24 17 the title of this is the ""Homosexual Network."" 11:23:27 18 Again, this was something that we got from you. 11:23:31 19 MR. TODD: From the Archdiocese. 11:23:34 20 MR. MacLEISH: That's correct. Thank 11:23:35 21 you, Mr. Todd. That's correct. 11:23:36 22 Q It states: 11:23:37 23 ""Still, not only did the conference take 10:32:06 24 place in a church, but church 11:23:41 103 1 representatives"" -- 11:23:43 2 A Excuse me. Where are you? 11:23:44 3 Q Top of the page on 296. 11:23:45 4 A Okay. 11:23:46 5 ""Not only did the conference."" 10:32:15 6 Q Yes. It says: 11:23:48 7 ""Still, not only did the conference take 10:32:17 8 place in a church, but church representatives 11:23:51 9 also participated as speakers in the pederasts' 11:23:53 10 affair where, according to Gaysweek, members 11:23:58 11 'voiced their endorsement of love between man 12 and boy.' Among the speakers were Canon 10:32:37 13 Clinton Jones, pastor of Christ Church 11:24:09 14 Cathedral (Episcopal) in Hartford, Connecticut; 11:24:11 15 Father Paul Shanley, representative of Boston's 10:32:47 16 Cardinal Medeiros for sexual minorities (Roman 11:24:18 17 Catholic); and Reverend Robert Whentley, from 11:24:22 18 the National Office of the Universalist 11:24:24 19 Church."" 11:24:28 20 Do you see that? 11:24:28 21 A And that's a quote from what I saw earlier, 11:24:29 22 isn't it? 11:24:32 23 Q Yes, it is. It's yet another document making 11:24:33 24 reference in the Archdiocese's files to Paul 11:24:36 104 1 Shanley. 11:24:38 2 MR. MacLEISH: Next exhibit, please. 11:24:41 3 (Law Exhibit No. 33, Handwritten 4 Document, marked for identification.) 5 MR. TODD: 33, right? 11:25:11 6 MR. MacLEISH: Yes. 11:25:13 7 Q This is two pages. This is Exhibit 33. If you 11:25:13 8 could just take a look at the first page for 11:25:16 9 the time being. This is a letter that we, 11:25:18 10 again, got as part of the second production from 11:25:21 11 the Archdiocese, from a Mr. Hugh Weston, of May 11:25:23 12 5, 1983, and he writes to Cardinal Medeiros, and 11:25:28 13 do you see he states: 11:25:32 14 ""Is it a fact that Father Paul Shanley 11:25:33 15 represented you at the founding conference of 11:25:36 16 NAMBLA, North American Man/Boy Love 11:25:38 17 Association? Please advise as to all details. 11:25:43 18 Thank you. Pastor Hugh Weston."" And then you 11:25:45 19 see it says, as asterisked down the bottom, 11:25:49 20 Cardinal, first page, it says: 11:25:52 21 ""As reported in the book The Homosexual 10:34:09 22 Network."" 11:25:56 23 Do you see that? 11:25:57 24 A Which is that? 11:25:57 105 1 Q Which is Exhibit 32. 11:25:58 2 A Right. 11:26:00 3 Q Do you see that? 11:26:00 4 A I do. 11:26:00 5 Q That's sent to Cardinal Medeiros, according to 11:26:01 6 the records we received from the Archdiocese, 11:26:04 7 and received at the Cardinal's residence, but 11:26:07 8 then not acknowledged on May 5, 1983. 11:26:09 9 Do you see that? 11:26:13 10 A I do. 11:26:13 11 Q All right. 11:26:14 12 And before we get to the second page, let's 11:26:15 13 do that Exhibit No. 34. 11:26:17 14 15 A May I read the second page? 11:26:21 16 Q I didn't -- you certainly may. We're trying 11:26:23 17 to -- we didn't put them in proper sequence. 11:26:26 18 MR. TODD: Are you going to mark this 11:26:29 19 separately, the second page? 11:26:30 20 MR. MacLEISH: Why don't we mark it 11:26:32 21 separately. I think that's a good idea. Let's 11:26:33 22 tear off the second page and mark the second 11:26:37 23 one separately. 11:26:38 24 THE WITNESS: If I may say so, I 11:26:38 106 1 think the second one is rather important, 11:26:42 2 because it clearly -- 11:26:42 3 MR. MacLEISH: Yes. Let's tear off 11:26:43 4 the second page. Let me take that back. And 11:26:46 5 show you -- we'll make this other one 34. 11:26:49 6 MR. ROGERS: Which is 34? 11:26:54 7 (Law Exhibit No. 34, Letter, 6/1/83, 8 marked for identification.) 9 A Father Weston and Monsignor Daily. 11:27:08 10 Q This was in the second production, Cardinal 11:27:18 11 Law, that we received from the Archdiocese. 11:27:22 12 It's a copy of a letter from, No. 34, from 11:27:23 13 Thomas V. Daily, auxiliary bishop of Boston, 11:27:29 14 chancellor, and although it's not a good copy, 11:27:34 15 it appears to read: 11:27:36 16 ""Dear Pastor Weston: I write to 11:27:38 17 acknowledge your communication to His Eminence 11:27:39 18 Cardinal Medeiros and your question concerning 11:27:42 19 Father Paul Shanley, a priest of this 11:27:46 20 Archdiocese, regarding the founding conference 11:27:47 21 of NAMBLA."" 11:27:49 22 You understand the acronym NAMBLA? 11:27:51 23 MR. TODD: You're looking at the 11:27:53 24 wrong -- 11:27:54 107 1 THE WITNESS: No, I think I'm looking 11:27:54 2 at the right one. 11:27:56 3 MR. MacLEISH: He's looking at the 11:27:57 4 right one. 11:27:58 5 MR. TODD: We marked this one 34, did 11:27:59 6 we not? 11:28:00 7 MR. MacLEISH: No, no. It's going to 11:28:01 8 be 35. 11:28:03 9 MR. TODD: I did. 11:28:03 10 MR. MacLEISH: Right. 11:28:05 11 Q ""I can assure you Father Shanley did not 11:28:05 12 represent His Eminence Cardinal Medeiros at 11:28:08 13 NAMBLA."" 11:28:11 14 You know what NAMBLA is? 11:28:11 15 A I do now. 11:28:13 16 Q Did you before today? 11:28:14 17 A I did before today. 11:28:15 18 Q ""With best personal regards, I am sincerely in 11:28:15 19 Christ, Most Reverend Thomas V. Daily, 11:28:19 20 Auxiliary Bishop of Boston, Chancellor."" 11:28:22 21 So this is the first response given to 11:28:25 22 Father Weston's -- Pastor Weston's letter, 11:28:28 23 Exhibit 33, where he asks Cardinal Medeiros 11:28:32 24 whether Paul Shanley represented the 11:28:34 108 1 Archdiocese at the founding conference of 11:28:40 2 NAMBLA. 11:28:40 3 Then it says -- you also note that Father 11:28:40 4 Weston had asked: 11:28:42 5 ""Please advise as to all details"" -- and 10:37:05 6 underlined that in Exhibit 33. 11:28:46 7 Is that correct? 11:28:47 8 A Yes. 11:28:49 9 Q Okay. 11:28:50 10 MR. MacLEISH: And then the next 11:28:51 11 exhibit, which is No. 35. 11:28:55 12 (Law Exhibit No. 35, Handwritten 13 Document, marked for identification.) 14 MR. TODD: That's the Weston to Daily 11:29:15 15 one? 11:29:17 16 MR. MacLEISH: That's Weston to 11:29:19 17 Daily. 11:29:20 18 Q Showing you Exhibit No. 35, you'll see -- again, 11:29:24 19 this is from the second production from the 11:29:28 20 Archdiocese: 11:29:31 21 ""Dear Most Reverend Thomas V. Daily. Was 22 Father Shanley at"" -- and the word ""at"" is 11:29:36 23 underlined -- ""at the NAMBLA founding 11:29:39 24 conference (you say he did not represent 11:29:41 109 1 Cardinal Medeiros). But was he present? Was he 11:29:44 2 later reprimanded? If so, thank you. Reverend 11:29:48 3 Hugh Weston."" 11:29:53 4 Do you see that? 11:29:54 5 A I do. 11:29:54 6 Q So this is Reverend Weston writing again back 11:29:55 7 to Thomas Daily about the issue of whether a 11:30:01 8 priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of 11:30:03 9 Boston attended the NAMBLA conference. 11:30:06 10 Do you see that? 11:30:09 11 A Yes. 11:30:09 12 Q Was Father Weston's letter -- 11:30:10 13 A Or Reverend Weston. He probably would not want 11:30:14 14 to be called Father. 11:30:19 15 Q I'm sorry. You're correct. Thank you for 11:30:19 16 correcting me. 11:30:22 17 Was Reverend Weston's letter to Bishop 11:30:23 18 Daily and his first response brought to your 11:30:26 19 attention in any way by Thomas Daily a year 11:30:27 20 later -- actually, less than a year later when 11:30:30 21 you arrived in Boston as Archbishop? 11:30:33 22 A It was not. 11:30:36 23 MR. MacLEISH: All right. Next 11:30:37 24 exhibit, please 11:30:38 110 1 (Law Exhibit No. 36, Handwritten Note, 2 marked for identification.) 3 Q Then we see here -- do you know a Father Rueda 11:31:12 4 at all? Have you ever heard of him before? 11:31:17 5 A No. 11:31:19 6 Q Well, this is, again, something that was 11:31:20 7 contained in the second production from the 11:31:21 8 Archdiocese, and it states: 11:31:24 9 ""Dear Father Rueda"" -- who I believe was 10 the -- one of the authors of The Homosexual 11:31:29 11 Network, if I'm not mistaken. 11:31:32 12 A I saw his name, yes. 11:31:34 13 Q ""Dear Father Rueda: The Archdiocese of Boston 11:31:36 14 has written me saying that Father Shanley did 11:31:38 15 not represent Cardinal Medeiros at NAMBLA."" 11:31:40 16 And then it says: 11:31:44 17 ""Someone is in error or lying. Reverend 18 Hugh Weston."" 11:31:47 19 Do you see that? 11:31:47 20 A I do. 11:31:47 21 Q And this, again -- have you ever seen this 11:31:48 22 document before today? 11:31:50 23 A I have not. 11:31:51 24 MR. MacLEISH: Next document. 11:31:52 111 1 (Law Exhibit No. 37, Handwritten 2 Document, marked for identification.) 3 Q Showing you Exhibit No. 37, this was received 11:32:11 4 July 6 -- I'm sorry -- received at the 11:32:14 5 Cardinal's residence, not acknowledged, July 5, 11:32:18 6 1983. And this letter, if you want to take a 11:32:22 7 look at it, is yet another report concerning 11:32:24 8 Father Shanley and NAMBLA. It's difficult to 11:32:28 9 read. I can help you. It's a poor 11:32:34 10 reproduction. But this was from your files, 11:32:36 11 Cardinal Law. 11:32:38 12 A Excuse me. Who did you say this was from? 11:33:02 13 Q It's from a Joseph Moynihan. Do you see that? 11:33:05 14 A Oh, I see. This is referencing the same -- 11:33:07 15 Q That's correct. 11:33:25 16 A -- book and the quote. 11:33:26 17 Q Right. It's yet another letter to the 11:33:27 18 Archdiocese, in this case, to Bishop Daily. 11:33:31 19 This would have been after he's received the 11:33:35 20 1977 letter. You remember that one from 11:33:37 21 Mrs. Stevens, the 1979 correspondence with 11:33:40 22 Attorney McGeady, the correspondence from 11:33:44 23 Reverend Weston. 11:33:48 24 This is now, I believe, the fourth letter 11:33:49 112 1 that has come in on the subject. Would you 11:33:51 2 agree with me about that? 11:33:53 3 A Yes. I think that's right. 11:33:55 4 Q And you'll see that Mr. Moynihan, who lives in 11:33:57 5 Brockton, Massachusetts, who is a communicant 11:34:01 6 at St. Patrick's in Brockton, as he reports, is 11:34:06 7 making -- raising yet another question about 11:34:08 8 Father Paul Shanley based upon The Homosexual 11:34:11 9 Network book. 11:34:14 10 Do you see that? 11:34:15 11 A I do. 11:34:15 12 MR. MacLEISH: And we then have as 11:34:17 13 our next exhibit, please. 11:34:19 14 (Law Exhibit No. 38, Letter, 7/13/83, 15 marked for identification.) 16 Q Showing you Exhibit No. 38. 11:34:35 17 A This is about two months before the Cardinal's 11:35:31 18 death. 11:35:34 19 Q That's correct. It's from his Chancellor, 11:35:34 20 Father -- Bishop Daily, also someone that 11:35:40 21 you've indicated previously you relied upon 11:35:42 22 when you arrived in Boston; is that correct? 11:35:44 23 MR. TODD: Actually, it's not from 11:35:47 24 Father Daily. 11:35:49 113 1 Q It's from -- 11:35:49 2 A It is. Father Little signed it for Bishop 11:35:51 3 Daily. 11:35:55 4 MR. TODD: For? 11:35:55 5 MR. MacLEISH: That's correct. 11:35:56 6 Q And the practice at the Archdiocese is that 11:35:57 7 there are occasions when other people can sign 11:35:59 8 letters, but if the letter has the name of the 11:36:02 9 person on it, it indicates that it is his 11:36:05 10 letter; is that correct? 11:36:07 11 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:36:08 12 A That's correct. 11:36:08 13 Q So this would be a letter from Thomas Daily, as 11:36:09 14 you understood the practice; is that correct? 11:36:11 15 A That's correct. 11:36:13 16 Q And you'll see in this letter it is stated in 11:36:14 17 response to Mr. Moynihan's letter, it is 11:36:16 18 stated -- he provides him with a copy of his 11:36:20 19 pastoral letter on pastoral ministry to the 11:36:30 20 homosexual. 11:36:32 21 Do you see that? 11:36:33 22 A I do. 11:36:33 23 Q Then it says that copy is enclosed. Then it 11:36:33 24 goes on to state, it states His Eminence's 11:36:35 114 1 position and that of the Church in regard to 11:36:39 2 ministry to homosexuals. 11:36:42 3 Do you see that? 11:36:45 4 A I do. 11:36:45 5 Q Mr. Moynihan wasn't just writing about his 11:36:45 6 ministry to homosexuals; he was writing about 11:36:48 7 the same thing that Reverend Weston had written 11:36:51 8 about: Father Shanley's attendance at a NAMBLA 11:36:52 9 conference. 11:36:55 10 Do you see that? 11:36:56 11 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:36:56 12 Q Same subject matter. 11:36:57 13 A Yes. 11:36:59 14 Q Then it goes on to state: 11:36:59 15 ""For information concerning Father Paul 10:45:34 16 Shanley or his presence at the conference, His 11:37:03 17 Eminence suggests that you write directly to 11:37:05 18 him at St. John's Church, 253 Watertown Street, 11:37:08 19 Newton, 02158. His Eminence also indicates 11:37:12 20 that in no way is Father Shanley authorized to 11:37:16 21 help him at any conference sponsored by NAMBLA 10:45:53 22 and personally doubts any claim that Father 11:37:21 23 Shanley represented him in this regard."" 11:37:23 24 Do you see that? 11:37:25 115 1 A I do. 11:37:25 2 Q Would that letter not suggest to you, Cardinal 11:37:26 3 Law, that as of July 13, 1983, the Reverend 11:37:29 4 Bishop Daily did not, in fact, know whether or 11:37:35 5 not Paul Shanley, then, I believe, a curate or 11:37:37 6 administrator at St. Jean's, had attended the 11:37:43 7 NAMBLA conference; that no investigation had 11:37:46 8 been done into that? 11:37:47 9 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:37:48 10 A No, that would not -- this letter would not 11:37:48 11 indicate that. 11:37:51 12 Q Fine. 11:37:51 13 A This letter would indicate to me what it 11:37:52 14 states. 11:37:54 15 Q Okay. But the letter does not deny that Paul 11:37:55 16 Shanley attended the founding conference of 11:37:59 17 NAMBLA, correct? 11:38:02 18 A It does not deny that. 11:38:03 19 Q Did Bishop Daily ever bring to your attention 11:38:05 20 the fact that correspondence had been received 11:38:09 21 suggesting that Paul Shanley had attended the 11:38:13 22 founding conference of NAMBLA? 11:38:17 23 A I have no recollection of that having been 11:38:19 24 communicated to me. 11:38:22 116 1 Q If you had known that Father Paul Shanley had 11:38:25 2 attended the founding conference of the North 11:38:27 3 American Man/Boy Love Association, would you 11:38:31 4 have appointed him as pastor with unsupervised 11:38:34 5 access to children, as you have admitted in 11:38:37 6 your admissions, in 1984? 11:38:40 7 MR. ROGERS: Objection to the form. 11:38:44 8 MR. MacLEISH: Go ahead. 11:38:45 9 A I would have inquired what had been done in the 11:38:46 10 investigation of that claim, and what the 11:38:51 11 result of that was, and if there was a 11:38:55 12 reasonable explanation to his presence at that 11:39:05 13 meeting. And I cannot conceive of what it 11:39:08 14 might be, but if there was a reasonable 11:39:10 15 explanation, a misunderstanding of what it 11:39:13 16 means to be in outreach to people who are 11:39:17 17 homosexual or whatever the phrase was that was 11:39:24 18 used, sexual minorities, and he was brought to 11:39:29 19 see that that was incorrect, that would be one 11:39:39 20 thing. 11:39:41 21 But if, on the other hand, the 11:39:42 22 investigation showed that not only was he 11:39:44 23 present but that he was sympathetic with the 11:39:46 24 aims and spoke in favor of those aims, he would 11:39:49 117 1 not be qualified to hold any position in the 11:39:52 2 church. 11:39:56 3 Q At minimum, based upon the materials you've 11:39:57 4 seen here today, you would agree with me that 11:40:00 5 some investigation would have been in order; is 11:40:01 6 that correct? 11:40:03 7 A Absolutely. 11:40:05 8 Q But none of these facts were brought to your 11:40:05 9 attention by Bishop Daily; is that correct? 11:40:06 10 A None of which facts? 11:40:10 11 Q None of the allegations about Paul Shanley not 11:40:12 12 only attending the NAMBLA conference, but 11:40:15 13 speaking in support of man/boy love, speaking 11:40:18 14 at the 1977 conference in Rochester about 11:40:24 15 bestiality, incest, pedophilia, none of those 11:40:29 16 allegations were brought to your attention by 11:40:35 17 Bishop Daily before you appointed him pastor; 11:40:37 18 is that correct? 11:40:40 19 A That's correct. Nor was there brought to my 11:40:40 20 attention whatever intervening action was 11:40:43 21 taken, which I would presume undergirded the 11:40:45 22 appointment that he received from Cardinal 11:40:51 23 Medeiros. 11:40:53 24 Q You're making that as an assumption; is that 11:40:54 118 1 correct? 11:40:56 2 A That's correct. 11:40:57 3 Q You don't know what happened? 11:40:57 4 A I do not know. 11:40:59 5 Q And there were complaints? 11:41:00 6 A As you do not know. 11:41:01 7 Q Thank you. 11:41:02 8 I'm only looking at what was in your file 11:41:03 9 at the time you appointed him to be pastor. 11:41:06 10 There's a great deal of other information, 11:41:09 11 you're correct, we do need to explore. 11:41:11 12 But what was in your file at the time you 11:41:14 13 appointed -- I want to be clear -- the 11:41:18 14 Archdiocese's file, not your file. 11:41:21 15 What was in the Archdiocese's file at the 11:41:23 16 time you appointed Paul Shanley pastor in 1984? 11:41:24 17 Why don't we mark that letter too, your 11:41:28 18 appointment. 11:41:31 19 (Law Exhibit No. 39, Letter, 12/11/84, 20 marked for identification.) 21 Q This is Exhibit 39, Cardinal Law. Do you 11:41:53 22 recognize that as your appointment? 11:41:56 23 A I do. 11:41:57 24 Q You state in your appointment letter: 11:41:58 119 1 ""It is a pleasure for me to give you this 10:49:56 2 appointment as Pastor in the Archdiocese."" 11:42:03 3 Do you see that in the second to last 11:42:05 4 paragraph? 11:42:07 5 A It is. I do see that. 11:42:08 6 Q Would you agree with me, based upon the 11:42:09 7 materials that we've reviewed, that you 11:42:11 8 appointed him pastor despite the fact that the 11:42:13 9 records of the Archdiocese contained the last 11:42:17 10 letter of 1966 accusing Shanley of masturbating 11:42:23 11 a boy and bringing other boys to his cabin in 11:42:26 12 the woods; Father Shanley -- the Stevens letter 11:42:29 13 from 1977 reporting that Shanley believed that 11:42:33 14 sex between men and boys was appropriate, and 11:42:35 15 that bestiality and incest and other sexual 11:42:37 16 acts cause no psychic can harm; the four -- I'm 11:42:49 17 sorry -- the McGeady letter and the man/boy 11:42:50 18 love article from 1979, which contended that 11:42:50 19 Paul Shanley attended the NAMBLA conference and 11:42:53 20 spoke in favor of man/boy love relationships; 11:42:57 21 the two Weston letters that we've reviewed in 11:43:00 22 1983 regarding Paul Shanley's attendance at the 11:43:04 23 organizational meetings of NAMBLA as reflected 11:43:07 24 in the book, the Homosexual Network; the 11:43:11 120 1 Moynihan letter in 1983; you appointed him 11:43:14 2 pastor, as we now see, with all of those 11:43:18 3 records in the files of the Archdiocese of 11:43:22 4 Boston. Is that correct? 11:43:24 5 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:43:25 6 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:43:25 7 A I appointed him as pastor upon the 11:43:29 8 recommendation of the personnel board, and 11:43:32 9 having moved him from being administrator, 11:43:34 10 which was the appointment made by the -- or 11:43:38 11 diocesan administrator between the two bishops, 11:43:43 12 and my being appointed in March of '85. 11:43:47 13 His appointment was not made in view of 11:43:53 14 those reports that you have brought before me 11:43:56 15 today, as I've cited in response to each one in 11:44:00 16 particular as it has been brought before me, 11:44:05 17 and in general, as I've indicated, that I did 11:44:07 18 not go back to the previous file in making 11:44:10 19 these appointments. I was not aware of those 11:44:13 20 materials and they were -- and had I been aware 11:44:17 21 of them, I would have certainly wanted to have 11:44:22 22 had some knowledge of how those reports had 11:44:24 23 been dealt with, and what it was that resulted 11:44:29 24 in the ability of his being appointed, first, 11:44:32 121 1 as an assistant and then as an administrator. 11:44:35 2 I did not do that. That's correct. 11:44:38 3 Q My question, Cardinal Law, was he was appointed 11:44:42 4 pastor even though all these records were 11:44:46 5 contained in files of the Archdiocese at the 11:44:47 6 time? When I say ""these records,"" I mean the 11:44:49 7 1977 allegation about incest, bestiality, and 11:44:51 8 sex between adults and children, the 1979 11:44:57 9 letter from Attorney McGeady about his views 11:45:01 10 expressed at the session of the North American 11:45:04 11 Man/Boy Love Association, the 1983 letters from 11:45:08 12 Reverend Weston, and the 1983 letter from 11:45:14 13 Mr. Moynihan. All those records were in 11:45:18 14 existence within the files of the Archdiocese 11:45:21 15 at the time you appointed Paul Shanley pastor 11:45:23 16 in December of 1984, correct? 11:45:26 17 MR. TODD: Objection. Asked and 11:45:30 18 answered. And argumentative. 11:45:30 19 You may answer. 11:45:32 20 Q Go ahead. 11:45:33 21 A I think I've answered that question before, and 11:45:33 22 I -- and I remember the enumeration from the 11:45:37 23 way you gave it just in the previous question, 11:45:42 24 and my point that I want to be sure is also 11:45:43 122 1 recorded is that I want it to be very clear 11:45:47 2 that those records were not before me -- 11:45:58 3 Q I understand that. 11:46:01 4 A -- when I made that appointment. 11:46:01 5 Q I understand that. 11:46:03 6 A That's what I want to establish very clearly. 11:46:04 7 Q I understand that. 11:46:06 8 But those records were in the files of the 11:46:07 9 Archdiocese of Boston at the time you made the 11:46:11 10 appointment; is that correct? 11:46:12 11 A I presume they were. 11:46:14 12 Q And that many of the contents of these 11:46:15 13 records -- in fact, I believe all of them were 11:46:19 14 known to Bishop Daily? 11:46:22 15 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:46:24 16 A My presumption is that the material that we 11:46:25 17 have been just looking at was known by him, 11:46:30 18 because he seems to have responded to them, 11:46:33 19 yes. 11:46:36 20 Q He responded to the 1977 -- 11:46:36 21 A All of them, yes. 11:46:38 22 Q -- the 1977 incest, bestiality letter, the 1979 11:46:40 23 NAMBLA article from Attorney McGeady, the 1983 11:46:45 24 letter from Reverend Weston, and the 1983 11:46:50 123 1 letter from Mr. Moynihan. He responded to all 11:46:54 2 of them, correct? 11:46:57 3 A Correct. 11:46:58 4 Q And he never once discussed the subject with 11:46:59 5 you, correct? 11:47:01 6 A That's correct. 11:47:02 7 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:47:03 8 Q Looking back on it now, Cardinal Law, as you 11:47:03 9 sit here today, as you sit here today, do you 11:47:06 10 believe that you at least, regardless of what 11:47:09 11 other events had occurred, should have had the 11:47:13 12 benefit of all of this information in a report 11:47:17 13 from Bishop Daily, your personnel board or 11:47:20 14 anybody else that you were relying on? 11:47:22 15 A Earlier today you put before me Exhibit 13. 11:47:24 16 Q Right. 11:47:28 17 A And Exhibit 13, I think, addresses that issue. 11:47:29 18 Q Okay. 11:47:32 19 A And I would agree that the recordkeeping and 11:47:36 20 the institutional memory has to be improved. 11:47:38 21 That was insufficient. 11:47:43 22 Q Now, Cardinal Law, I'd like to focus on the 11:47:45 23 period from 1984 to 1990 when Greg Ford, Paul 11:47:47 24 Busa and Anthony Driscoll allege that they were 11:47:53 124 1 being sexually molested, and in certain cases, 11:47:57 2 raped by Paul Shanley at St. Jean's. 11:47:59 3 Can we agree to focus on that time period? 11:48:03 4 A Wherever you want to go. 11:48:05 5 Q During that time period, there were a number of 11:48:07 6 reports -- and I think we went over several of 11:48:09 7 them yesterday -- involving individuals such as 11:48:11 8 Eugene Sullivan and Daniel Graham, individuals 11:48:13 9 who had either been convicted or admitted to 11:48:17 10 acts of sexual misconduct involving minors. 11:48:22 11 Do you recall your testimony on that on 11:48:25 12 Wednesday? 11:48:26 13 A Whatever I said, I said. I don't recall -- I 11:48:29 14 don't have everything in my mind right now that 11:48:32 15 we were talking about on Wednesday. 11:48:35 16 Q Well, you knew in 1984, shortly after you 11:48:39 17 arrived, that there had been a conviction of a 11:48:44 18 Roman Catholic priest for rape of a child, 11:48:44 19 Eugene O'Sullivan? 11:48:47 20 A Yes. 11:48:47 21 Q I'm sorry. Pled guilty to rape. 11:48:47 22 MR. TODD: Let me interject. You 11:48:49 23 keep on saying ""rape."" Actually, that was not 11:48:50 24 the crime. 11:48:52 125 1 MR. MacLEISH: Okay. All right. 11:48:52 2 Q Well, some conviction involving -- can we agree 11:48:54 3 some conviction involving sexual misconduct 11:48:57 4 with a minor? 11:49:01 5 A Yes. 11:49:01 6 Q And then we went over Father Graham, who 11:49:01 7 admitted -- I think we had documents that 11:49:04 8 admitted in 1988 that he had been involved in 11:49:06 9 an act of molestation. 11:49:09 10 Do you recall that? 11:49:11 11 A Yes. In the late '60s or '70s. 11:49:11 12 Q That's correct. When he was a seminarian. But 11:49:16 13 he admitted to molesting a child. 11:49:18 14 A Yes. 11:49:19 15 Q But these weren't the only two in this period 11:49:20 16 from '84 to 1990 that were coming across your 11:49:23 17 desk. When I say ""coming across your desk,"" 11:49:25 18 individuals who had been accused of molesting 11:49:27 19 children. Those were not the only ones, were 11:49:31 20 they, Cardinal Law? 11:49:32 21 A They were not. 11:49:33 22 Q They also included Father Joseph Birmingham; is 11:49:34 23 that correct? 11:49:37 24 A That's correct. 11:49:38 126 1 Q They also included John Geoghan; is that 11:49:38 2 correct? 11:49:40 3 A That's correct. 11:49:41 4 Q And you knew in 1984 that John Geoghan had 11:49:41 5 admitted to being engaged in acts of sexual 11:49:47 6 misconduct with children; is that correct? 11:49:52 7 A That's correct. 11:49:53 8 Q And he was sent for an assessment; is that 11:49:54 9 correct? 11:49:56 10 A That's correct. 11:49:57 11 Q And you knew in 1989 that John Geoghan again 11:49:58 12 was accused of molestation of children and he 11:50:03 13 was sent for another assessment; is that not 11:50:06 14 correct? 11:50:10 15 A Assessment and a treatment, yes. 11:50:10 16 Q And then he returned to St. Julia's Parish; is 11:50:11 17 that correct? 11:50:15 18 A He did. 11:50:15 19 Q And then he went on to molest other children at 11:50:15 20 St. Julia's Parish? 11:50:18 21 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 11:50:20 22 MR. TODD: Objection. 11:50:20 23 Q There's allegations to that effect; is that 11:50:21 24 correct? 11:50:23 127 1 A I'm not certain about -- there are a lot of 11:50:25 2 allegations that have come forward and I'm not 11:50:28 3 certain at what point I knew of those 11:50:32 4 allegations. 11:50:32 5 Q And Father -- well, you know that John Geoghan 11:50:33 6 in 1989, I think you testified to this in other 11:50:37 7 matters, in 1989 he was sent to the Institute 11:50:39 8 for Living for some assessment? 11:50:42 9 A That's correct. 11:50:45 10 Q And then returned to St. Julia's Parish? 11:50:45 11 A That's correct. 11:50:48 12 Q With no restrictions put on him; is that 11:50:48 13 correct? 11:50:50 14 A I'm not certain. He was returned to his 11:50:56 15 assignment. 11:51:01 16 Q With no restrictions? 11:51:01 17 A I think that's probably correct. 11:51:03 18 Q No limitations on his access to minors; is that 11:51:04 19 correct? 11:51:06 20 A He was a parochial vicar. 11:51:07 21 Q And then -- as a parochial vicar, there were no 11:51:10 22 restrictions on his access to children; is that 11:51:14 23 correct? 11:51:15 24 A There would have been no -- he would have been 11:51:15 128 1 involved with children, that's correct, 11:51:18 2 teaching. 11:51:21 3 Q Then you also remember the case of Father 11:51:22 4 Ernest Tourigney, who in 1988 was confronted 11:51:25 5 and admitted that he was involved in sexual 11:51:29 6 misconduct with children; is that correct? 11:51:32 7 A I'd have to review the case of Tourigney. 11:51:35 8 Q Right. 11:51:37 9 A I'd have to review that case. 11:51:38 10 Q But you're aware at some point, and -- 11:51:39 11 A I'm aware he was taken out. 11:51:42 12 Q He was taken out? 11:51:44 13 A And we just have to review the case to see. 11:51:46 14 Q Right. He was taken out, he was assessed, and 11:51:51 15 then he was returned to ministry, is that 11:51:53 16 correct, after an evaluation? 11:51:55 17 A I would have to review the case. 11:51:57 18 Q Cardinal Law, I've only received the files of 11:51:58 19 ten individuals -- ten priests, and I've got 11:52:02 20 the files, obviously, of Father Shanley and 11:52:06 21 Father Geoghan. There are, I believe, a total 11:52:09 22 of 70 priests who are alive today -- I think we 11:52:11 23 went over this. 11:52:14 24 A It's approximately that. 11:52:17 129 1 Q Approximately 70 priests accused of sexual 11:52:20 2 misconduct who are alive today; is that 11:52:24 3 correct? 11:52:25 4 A That's correct. 11:52:25 5 Q And Cardinal Law, between 1984 and 1990, that 11:52:26 6 period -- I'm not talking about the subsequent 11:52:32 7 period -- before the first policy, can you 11:52:34 8 recall any situation where a priest accused of 11:52:40 9 sexual misconduct and went for an assessment 11:52:43 10 was not returned to ministry with full access 11:52:47 11 to children? 11:52:52 12 A No. I'd have to -- I really would have to look 11:52:54 13 at the records myself, and I'd have to have 11:52:57 14 help in giving you a full response as to how 11:53:01 15 many allegations we had received during that 11:53:04 16 period, and what action was taken with those 11:53:07 17 priests. And I would prefer to be able to do 11:53:09 18 that and get back to you with that answer. I'd 11:53:13 19 rather not just sit here -- 11:53:17 20 Q I don't want you to speculate. I want you to 11:53:18 21 just -- if you could -- we have been through 11:53:21 22 O'Sullivan, Father O'Sullivan, who went to New 11:53:24 23 Jersey; we've been through Graham, we've been 11:53:26 24 through Father Graham. Is that correct? 11:53:29 130 1 A Yes, you've been through Graham. 11:53:31 2 Q Father Joseph Birmingham, he died in the '80s; 11:53:32 3 is that correct? 11:53:36 4 A I believe it was the '80s, yes. 11:53:37 5 Q He was sent for an assessment at some point 11:53:40 6 because of allegations of molestation; is that 11:53:42 7 correct? 11:53:46 8 A That's correct. 11:53:46 9 Q Then he was returned to St. Brigid's in 11:53:46 10 Lexington; is that correct? 11:53:52 11 A That's correct. 11:53:52 12 Q And he was returned to St. Brigid's in 11:53:52 13 Lexington with no restrictions on his ministry; 11:53:54 14 is that correct? 11:53:56 15 A I will say that's correct, but I would really 11:53:57 16 prefer the opportunity to review that time 11:54:01 17 frame and give you a more accurate response. 11:54:04 18 (Law Exhibit No. 40, Memorandum, 19 7/11/96, marked for identification.) 20 Q Cardinal Law, this is a composite of some of 11:54:44 21 the record reviews that were done at various 11:54:48 22 periods of time regarding priests of the 11:54:52 23 Archdiocese of Boston. Let's start with Father 11:54:53 24 Joseph Birmingham, if we could. You'll -- if 11:54:58 131 1 you could turn -- it's page BL -- I'm sorry. 11:55:03 2 JB019. It's the -- let me go from the back. 11:55:07 3 It's probably easier from the back, Cardinal Law. 11:55:16 4 It's the sixth page. 11:55:19 5 A JB19? 11:55:31 6 Q Yes. That's correct. That's the handwriting 11:55:33 7 you recognize as Sister Mulkerrin? 11:55:35 8 A Well, I wouldn't have recognized it as her 11:55:37 9 handwriting, but I have no reason to dispute 11:55:39 10 it. 11:55:41 11 Q Well, this is a record that was produced by the 11:55:41 12 Archdiocese of Boston. Do you see where it says 11:55:44 13 Fatima -- '63, '64 incidents? 11:55:47 14 Do you see that? 11:55:50 15 A I do. 11:55:51 16 Q And do you see it's sort of cut off at the 11:55:51 17 top -- and I apologize for that; it's the way 11:55:55 18 it's arrived -- but I believe the word up at 11:55:57 19 the top left-hand corner underlined is 11:55:59 20 ""Records, Birmingham."" 11:56:02 21 Do you see that? 11:56:03 22 A I see Birmingham. 11:56:06 23 Q Do you see to the left of that, it's cut off, 11:56:09 24 but it's ""Records""? 11:56:10 132 1 A Okay. I'll take your word for it. 11:56:12 2 Q And it says Fatima, Incidents 1963, '64. 11:56:14 3 Do you see that? 11:56:20 4 A Yes, I do. 11:56:20 5 Q Then it says ""Admitted"" underneath that in 11:56:21 6 Sister Mulkerrin's handwriting? 11:56:24 7 A Yes. 11:56:25 8 Q Then -- 11:56:26 9 A And it says over there -- I don't know what 11:56:27 10 that means. Dr. Philip Quinn. 11:56:28 11 Q Yes. Dr. Quinn. We have a record on that, 11:56:31 12 Cardinal Law, where -- this was the same 11:56:34 13 Dr. Quinn that saw Eugene O'Sullivan, do you 11:56:37 14 remember that, and he sat with Eugene 11:56:40 15 O'Sullivan eight times. 11:56:43 16 Do you remember that from Wednesday's 11:56:44 17 testimony? 11:56:47 18 A I don't remember that. 11:56:47 19 Q That's fine. 11:56:47 20 Do you see down at the bottom, it says 11:56:48 21 ""1987, Institute for Living""? Do you see that? 11:56:51 22 March 25, 1987? 11:56:54 23 A I do. 11:56:55 24 Q And then it also -- there's a reference to you 11:56:56 133 1 in here above that ""April 7, 1987, resigned for 11:57:01 2 reasons of health, Cardinal - colleague - 11:57:05 3 molested. Summons on AIDS."" 11:57:10 4 That was in a letter -- 11:57:12 5 MR. ROGERS: ""Sermons."" 11:57:15 6 Q ""Sermons on AIDS."" 11:57:15 7 That was in a letter when he was at St. 11:57:16 8 Ann's Parish in Gloucester. Do you have some 11:57:19 9 recollection of that? 11:57:22 10 A I really don't. 11:57:22 11 Q So at least as of 1992, with respect to Father 11:57:23 12 Birmingham, there were records that were 11:57:29 13 available -- I understand he's deceased -- but 11:57:31 14 there were records that were available to the 11:57:33 15 Archdiocese, it appears from JB0019; is that 11:57:35 16 correct? 11:57:39 17 A That's correct. 11:57:39 18 Q And why don't you look, just since we covered 11:57:40 19 it yesterday, at the second to last page of 11:57:44 20 Exhibit No. -- what number is it? 11:57:48 21 MR. ROGERS III: 40. 11:57:56 22 Q Exhibit No. 40, the second to last page. And 11:57:58 23 this is the handwriting, I believe, Cardinal 11:58:01 24 Law, is it not, of Father McCormack? Do you 11:58:01 134 1 recognize that? Bishop McCormack? 11:58:05 2 A It looks like his. 11:58:08 3 Q You'll see in the case of Eugene O'Sullivan 11:58:09 4 what appears to be a review of certain 11:58:11 5 information, early allegations. 11:58:13 6 Do you see that? 11:58:14 7 A I do. 11:58:14 8 Q 1963 complaint. This is not dated. I don't 11:58:15 9 have the date for this record. I'll ask Bishop 11:58:18 10 McCormack about it. 11:58:22 11 But, again, here's another situation where 11:58:23 12 there are records available to the Archdiocese 11:58:26 13 of allegations going back to the 1960s. 11:58:28 14 A Yes. 11:58:32 15 Q Now, Cardinal Law, with all the records that 11:58:33 16 have been reviewed by the Archdiocese and 11:58:36 17 turned over to the Attorney General's Office 11:58:38 18 and the District Attorney's Offices, has the 11:58:42 19 Archdiocese of Boston, from the records, made 11:58:43 20 any calculations as to the number of victims of 11:58:46 21 sexual abuse that there are since you became 11:58:49 22 Archbishop in 1984? 11:58:57 23 A I don't know whether that has been done or not. 11:59:01 24 Q Do you know whether that figure is in the 11:59:03 135 1 thousands? 11:59:05 2 A I don't know what that figure is. 11:59:07 3 Q Well, have you ever thought that it would be 11:59:09 4 important to find out how many there are and 11:59:11 5 what should be done? 11:59:14 6 A Absolutely. And we are in the process of 11:59:14 7 trying to be as complete as we can in knowing 11:59:17 8 who the victims are and how best we can respond 11:59:23 9 to them. 11:59:27 10 Q Cardinal Law, I'd like to show you -- 11:59:29 11 (Law Exhibit No. 41, Photograph, 12 marked for identification.) 13 Q Can you find your answer, please? 11:59:45 14 A Can I find my answer? 11:59:46 15 Q Yes. Your answer to the complaint. 11:59:48 16 MR. TODD: It's Exhibit 1. 11:59:50 17 Q It's Exhibit 1, Cardinal Law. 11:59:52 18 MR. TODD: It's Exhibit 2. 11:59:53 19 THE WITNESS: My answer to the 11:59:55 20 complaint. 11:59:57 21 Q Could you turn to the section that we talked 12:00:01 22 about yesterday concerning negligence, the 12:00:02 23 defense of negligence that is on Exhibit 2, 12:00:09 24 page 5, where it says: 12:00:17 136 1 ""And further answering, the defendant says 2 the plaintiffs were not in the exercise of due 12:00:24 3 care, but, rather, the negligence of the 12:00:28 4 plaintiffs contributed to cause the injury or 12:00:28 5 damage complained of; wherefore, the recovery 12:00:29 6 of the plaintiffs is barred in whole or in part 12:00:32 7 or is subject to diminution."" 12:00:34 8 Do you see that? We covered that 12:00:37 9 yesterday? 12:00:38 10 A Yes. 12:00:38 11 Q And you also see that -- we went over this 12:00:38 12 yesterday, that the allegations in the 12:00:42 13 complaint about Paul Shanley abusing Greg Ford 12:00:44 14 started when Greg Ford was six years old. This 12:00:48 15 is a picture of Greg Ford, Exhibit 41. I would 12:00:51 16 ask you -- you've already, at least on 12:00:57 17 Wednesday, you indicated that you wanted to 12:00:59 18 change some of your answers. 12:01:02 19 Looking at Exhibit 41, that picture of 12:01:03 20 Greg Ford as a six-year-old child, do you now 12:01:06 21 believe that your answer in which you allege 12:01:09 22 that Greg Ford was somehow negligent for the 12:01:11 23 acts of abuse, that that answer that was filed 12:01:14 24 on your behalf should be changed? 12:01:17 137 1 MR. ROGERS: Objection to the form. 12:01:20 2 MR. TODD: Objection. 12:01:20 3 MR. MacLEISH: Go ahead. You can 12:01:20 4 answer. 12:01:21 5 A I find it difficult to answer -- 12:01:24 6 Q Okay. 12:01:28 7 A -- because I'm not a lawyer, and I don't know 12:01:29 8 what that phrase means in terms of the civil 12:01:38 9 suit that has been filed. It is certainly not 12:01:42 10 my belief that a child is responsible for abuse 12:01:50 11 that is done to him. 12:01:57 12 Q Okay. 12:02:01 13 A I don't believe that any child is responsible 12:02:03 14 for the abuse done to him. 12:02:05 15 Q Okay. Is it now -- I'm sorry. Go ahead. 12:02:10 16 A What legal ramifications and what legal meaning 12:02:10 17 is attached to what was represented by counsel, 12:02:15 18 I'm not -- I'm not conversant in that. But I 12:02:21 19 do know that my own conviction is that a child 12:02:26 20 is not responsible for the abuse that he 12:02:30 21 suffers or she suffers. 12:02:33 22 Q At your deposition on Wednesday, you indicated 12:02:36 23 some familiarity with the term of negligence. 12:02:39 24 In fact, you said at one point ""contributory 12:02:41 138 1 negligence"" on your own, without me describing 2 that term. 12:02:46 3 You have an understanding of what 12:02:47 4 negligence is, do you not? 12:02:48 5 A I do. I think I do. I have certainly a 12:02:49 6 layman's knowledge. 12:02:52 7 Q So is it now your intention to withdraw the 12:02:55 8 assertion made in your answer that Greg Ford, 12:02:57 9 as a six-year-old child, was somehow negligent 12:03:00 10 in what happened to him at the hands of Paul 12:03:03 11 Shanley? 12:03:06 12 MR. ROGERS: Objection. 12:03:07 13 MR. TODD: Objection. 12:03:07 14 MR. ROGERS: That's not what the 12:03:08 15 answer says, so I think it's a misstatement and 12:03:09 16 an inappropriate question. 12:03:13 17 MR. MacLEISH: You may answer the 12:03:13 18 question. 12:03:16 19 A I do not at this point wish to address what it 12:03:16 20 is that counsel entered until I have an 12:03:20 21 opportunity to discuss it with them, but I can 12:03:24 22 tell you what I believe and what my conviction 12:03:25 23 is with regard to the tragedy of sexual abuse, 12:03:30 24 and that is that no child is responsible in any 12:03:35 139 1 way for the abuse that he or she suffers. 12:03:40 2 Q No child? 12:03:44 3 A That that is the responsibility of the adult 12:03:46 4 who does the abusing. It could be the 12:03:48 5 responsibility of others responsible, but 12:03:53 6 certainly not the child. 12:03:55 7 MR. ROGERS: We are past 12:00. So 12:03:57 8 we agreed we'd stop. 12:03:59 9 MR. MacLEISH: You had a question you 12:04:00 10 wanted to ask me. 12:04:02 11 THE WITNESS: We can go off the 11:20:35 12 record. 12:04:04 13 MR. MacLEISH: Absolutely. We can go 12:04:04 14 off the record. 12:04:05 15 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 12:03. 12:04:07 16 We're off the record. 12:04:08 17 (Whereupon, the deposition was suspended at 12:04 p.m.) 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 140 1 Excerpt from Rule 30(e): 2 Submission to Witness; Changes; Signing.

Responding to recent accounting scandals, companies like Coca-Cola and General Electric have pledged to treat employee stock options as an expense. But Kevin Parker, PeopleSoft's chief financial officer, said that he and Craig Conway, the chief executive, had discussed the issue with the board and audit committee and decided against making a change. ''We don't believe it's a traditional expense,'' he said in an interview. ''It's a reallocation of stockholder equity.'' Mr. Parker said that 80 percent of PeopleSoft's employees had received options and that the options had ''helped align their interest and energy'' with stockholders'. PeopleSoft's senior management holds less than 12 percent of total stock options. Shares in PeopleSoft fell 7 cents, to $16.83. Andrew Zipern (NYT)",2002-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Responding to recent accounting scandals, companies like Coca-Cola and General Electric have pledged to treat employee stock options as an expense. But Kevin Parker, PeopleSoft's chief financial officer, said that he and Craig Conway, the chief executive, had discussed the issue with the board and audit committee and decided against making a change. ""We don't believe it's a traditional expense,"" he said in an interview. ""It's a reallocation of stockholder equity."" Mr. Parker said that 80 percent of PeopleSoft's employees had received options and that the options had ""helped align their interest and energy"" with stockholders'.

Network Associates, which owns 75 percent of McAfee .com, is offering 0.675 share and $8 in cash for each McAfee.com common share, or a total of $15.26 a share. That was 19 percent more than the closing price of McAfee.com shares on Monday. Since first proposing a takeover in March, Network Associates shares have lost more than half their value as the software maker discovered inaccuracies in its financial results and forecast sales that disappointed some investors. Network Associates, the maker of McAfee antivirus software, sold shares of McAfee.com, a computer-security service, to investors in 1999, when Internet stocks had higher values. The chief executive, George Samenuk, who took over in 2001, is seeking to acquire McAfee.com to clear up confusion about the companies, which sometimes approach the same customers. Network Associates in March first proposed swapping 0.675 share for each McAfee.com share, a bid that was rejected. In April, McAfee.com accepted a raised bid of 0.78 share, a value of $17.55 at the time, before withdrawing its support after Network Associates shares plunged over the next three months. A spokesman for McAfee.com could not be reached to comment on the latest offer. Shares of Network Associates fell 67 cents, to $10.34, on the New York Stock Exchange.

The loss, of $1.27 a share, includes a one-time noncash charge of $10.2 million. Despite the loss, Bluefly said it had a good quarter because its $6.8 million in net sales were 29 percent better than in the period a year earlier, and its operating loss was 65 percent smaller. Its gross margin increased to its highest level, 35 percent. The company spent about $17 to acquire each new customer -- 77 percent less than last year, but nearly twice the amount it spent last quarter. The operating loss was about $500,000 more than last quarter. In addition, Bluefly said it had secured another round of financing from Soros Private Equity Partners, which is the venture capital firm of George Soros. The 2.1 million investment follows a $1.9 million round in June, completing a $4 million financing commitment made by Mr. Soros in March. Bob Tedeschi (NYT)",2002-08-14T05:00:00+0000

A semiofficial Chinese newspaper, the 21st Century Business Herald, reported on Monday that the finance ministry found that the bank might have understated the extent of bad loans and evaded taxes.

Since the Confederation Bridge opened in 1997, linking Borden-Carleton on the island with Cape Jourimain on the New Brunswick mainland, tourists have been able to visit without worrying about ferry schedules. Prince Edward Island is a land of undeniable yet simple charms, most of which are maritime because you are never more than 10 miles from salt water. The Malpeque oysters are famous, and thanks to the flow of the Gulf Stream the island's beaches are far more swimmable than those in northern New England. And while public signs will help refresh your high school French, English is spoken everywhere.

As part of the ''standstill'' agreement, the second since July 29, Genuity will pay $50 million, according to a statement. The company also said it would no longer finance Integra, a manager of data for corporate Web sites that is 93 percent owned by Genuity. Last month, Verizon Communications chose not to buy a controlling stake in Genuity, causing a default under the company's credit agreement. The new accord gives Genuity time to renegotiate repayment of the loans. Genuity, based in Woburn, Mass., has drawn down $1.87 billion of a $2 billion credit line from banks, as well as a $1.15 billion loan from Verizon, a spokeswoman, Susan Kraus, said. Verizon had made $2 billion available, but it said last month that it would not extend the remaining $850 million, Ms. Kraus said. On July 29, Genuity said it had been given two weeks to renegotiate its credit line. Under that agreement, Genuity paid $100 million.",2002-08-16T05:00:00+0000

The drop is due to the way unemployment is measured. Excluded from the measure are people who are not working but not actively looking for work. The smaller number of job seekers led to a drop in the unemployment rate to 7.7 percent from 8 percent in June, after adjustment for seasonal factors. Typically, there is a surge in unemployment in July as young people out of school seek work, but bad economic news may have discouraged some potential job seekers, said James P.

us,'By the Hand of Mormon'," It is both fitting and ironic that at a small crossroads in the town of Palmyra, New York, four churches occupy the four corner lots of the intersection. Fitting, because the four contiguous meeting houses with their four steeples that intermingle on the skyline aptly symbolize the hurly-burly of religious sects vigorously competing for new proselytes, as Joseph Smith described the Palmyra area at the time of the Second Great Awakening. Ironic, because the embarrassment of denominational riches suggested by the intersection was not enough to provide a spiritual home for 14-year-old Joseph Smith himself. His youthful quest for a &quot;true church&quot; to join led him to a momentous encounter with heavenly beings in which he learned that no church in Palmyra&#151;or anywhere else&#151;was the true church of God.

Developed by Duncan Wong, a yoga master and martial-arts practitioner, the concept blends the fluidity of Vinyasa yoga, in which one pose flows into the next, with the strength building and conditioning of joints found in the martial arts. An hourlong class, starting in September at Equinox Fitness Clubs, (212) 780-9300, includes stretches, squats, lunges and kicks to lengthen and strengthen muscles and tendons. The routine is meant to complement an exercise regime, rather than to replace it. Although the two disciplines may seem at cross-purposes (martial arts are often associated with self-defense, while yoga focuses on finding one's own peace), the goals of Yogic Arts are in the end not contradictory. ''Vinyasa yoga is primarily an upper-body workout, and martial arts are mostly a lower-body workout,'' Mr. Wong said. ''Together they make for total body conditioning.''

It didn't stop me too much. I was already too eccentric to care. But I often wonder how many of my straight peers remained in a cycle of mediocrity because being called a fag seemed worse than a life without interests. Parents should consider this when they wonder why their children may not have any interests beyond hanging out in malls and parking lots.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; All Things in Their Boxes,"''Yesterday I was trying to fit Hedy Lamarr into Dante Gabriel Rossetti's pre-Raphaelite garden, without success. She was more at-one today with the night sky of the Planetarium,'' Joseph Cornell (1903-72) wrote in a diary entry, offering a peek at the thought process of the artist who put everything in a box. Astronomical charts, toys, clay pipes, birds, mirrors, images of ballerinas, movie stars and Medici princes all recur in his exquisitely composed shadow boxes that preserve and compress disparate worlds and memories. In the preface to her illuminating and poignant monograph JOSEPH CORNELL: Master of Dreams (Abrams, $45), Diane Waldman recounts spending the bulk of 1964 in the kitchen of Cornell's house in Queens, where he lived with his mother and invalid brother, trying to pin down information from an artist prone to drifting off in reveries. She even smuggled in a screwdriver to open his boxes in search of dates when he left the room. From the vantage point of the friendship that developed between them and her research, Waldman -- whose first museum exhibition and first book were devoted to Cornell -- interprets with a light hand the imagery of his boxes inspired by Renaissance and Dutch masters, unattainable women, Surrealism, his lost youth, Christian Science and chimney sweeps (believed to bring good luck if met by chance) without lapsing into psychoanalyzing the recluse who rarely left his childhood home on Utopia Parkway. ''What better place,'' Waldman writes in the conclusion, ''for a man with so many dreams.'' Hilarie M. Sheets",2002-08-18T05:00:00+0000

Onstage, Mr. Frangoulis favors a textured silk Valentino tuxedo, a gift from the designer. During auditions, he sticks to his lucky Donna Karan jacket, a light-colored Ralph Lauren shirt (which he believes masks perspiration under the stage lights) and Prada Sport shoes. But in off-hours, he prefers this high-contrast, tough-guy look: a DKNY black leather sport jacket ($495), black jeans by Ted Baker (about $125 at Bloomingdale's), a form-fitting white Calvin Klein T-shirt ($23 at Bloomingdale's) and steel blue suede DKNY motorcycle boots ($185). ''There are so many opera singers who are formal or puritan -- I think that's wrong,'' Mr. Frangoulis said. ''I'm a classical opera singer with pop appeal.''

Leading ophthalmologist, scientist, medical author, teacher and father departed on June 1, 2002 in New Canaan, Connecticut. He was born on May 16, 1901, in Lancaster, Ohio, to William Fredrick Pfeiffer and Louise Katherine Metzger Pfeiffer. In 1924 he earned a B.S. from Wittenberg College and in 1928 an M.D. from Ohio State University. Following his residency in Columbus in 1929 and a year of study in Berlin, Germany, he joined the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Institute of Ophthalmology in New York in 1930. What followed was a distinguished career as an ophthalmologist in private practice, an associate professorship at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and publication of numerous original medical writings and discoveries. Throughout his years of practice, Dr. Pfeiffer donated medical care to those in need. He was awarded honorary degrees from Wittenberg College, Ohio State University and Columbia University. Dr. Pfeiffer was married in 1935 to Gertrude Bard Smith who predeceased him in 1993. He was predeceased by his daughter Nancy Pfeiffer Welch and is deeply missed by his surviving children Robert William Pfeiffer of Severna Park, MD, Jean Pfeiffer Tate of Pine Plains, N.Y., and Raymond Smith Pfeiffer of Bay City, MI. He is survived by 8 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. Upon retirement in 1969 he moved from Riverdale, N.Y. to New Canaan, CT., where he resided during the winter months. Summers were spent on Hickory Island on the St. Lawrence River. Dr. Pfeiffer's interests included tennis, fishing, duck hunting, and fine wood-working. He was an active member of the Rotary Club of New Canaan. Those who worked with him over the years had the highest trust and respect for him. His integrity was impeccable.

Therefore, when I purchase a large item, I have to take a day off from work since I can't arrange for evening or weekend delivery. Also, the building manager now requires a $375 deposit until the delivery is completed. Neither of these policies was in effect when I moved in.

The 125-acre site was once flat, but it's now rolling thanks to four million cubic yards of soil dredged from the harbor during shipping channel deepening projects. The developers, Empire Golf USA, say they need a million cubic yards more. Membership fees are expected to be hefty, but the club will also offer a daily rate for the public, and Bayonne residents will get a reduced rate.

As Smith herself wrote in ''Patti Smith Complete: Lyrics, Notes and Reflections'' (Anchor Books): ''The pursuit of style has always been a spirited part of the work process. Images that inform the work or the movement of the work. Baudelaire's cravat. June Christy's careless ponytail. A raincoat  la Camus. Bob Dylan's snap tab collar. Black capris like Ava Gardner.

He was always clean and professionally groomed in what I now know is called a sporting trim, with a scissored cap of hair on his head and a pompon on his tail. He was adventurous and liked to lead me out on innocent missions just beyond the yard of my parents' summer house. I must have been too well dressed (I was a first child) in clever, jaunty little outfits, with matching knit sweaters, as I was summarily rejected from the juvenile community. But Chippie didn't seem to care about my clothes and was content to play within the confines of our property. One day he was abducted and murdered by the neighborhood bully, a flat-faced boxer who liked to chew tennis balls and, apparently, poodles. The man who owned the boxer returned Chippie in a shoe box and asked that we spare his dog as perhaps our poodle was simply too irresistible. We buried Chippie. It was the first I'd heard of heaven, and I was glad poodles were welcome there. But thereafter my mother was careful to find more neutral clothes for me to wear, and I never allowed myself to consider walking down the street with a poodle again, though I have owned and shown many of them since.",2002-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Licensed To Grill,"I wonder if the gifted but unknown illustrator -- and rabid anti-Steinbergian -- Luas Grebniets had a good cackle parodying his nemesis Saul Steinberg's most famous work. You will recall this work, a New Yorker cover, because reproductions of it hang in just about every apartment in this city. It pictures the Big Appler's world basically ending at the Hudson, with California in another solar system and Russia somewhere beyond California. Although Steinberg intended it as a satire of our provincialism, most people who say they like satire don't actually like being satirized, and so they embraced the illustration as emblematic of New York's pre-eminent, if not apotheotic, status in the world. Grebniets's mirror image looks at the globe as a Midwesterner does, picturing New York as quite a small little dot, though a noisy dot, one that, while believing itself the discoverer of all things fashionable, is frequently a dot woefully behind the American curve.",2002-08-18T05:00:00+0000

The casual restaurant, which has a roof over the tables, overlooks the ocean. The menu has been developed by Mary Fallon, who has cooked for the owner, Frank Sementa, for more than a decade. One appetizers popular with the after-beach crowd is Swamp Thing, a spinach and artichoke cheese dip served with grilled pita wedges ($6.95). A better-than-average guacamole ($5.95) also makes a great ''snackatizer'' as D'Jais calls it. Shrimp Jammers are breaded and stuffed with cheddar cheese and served with spicy roasted red pepper sauce ($10.95). Salads ($5.50 to $10.95) feature grilled tuna, traditional Caesar or a ''surf salad'' made with shrimp and Jersey tomatoes. Although you can spend more and get a very good steak dinner, the homemade pizza (starting at $6.95) and fajitas ($9.95 or $11.95) are popular, as is the crab cake sandwich ($9.95), which has two soft flavorful crab cakes on a sesame roll. A variety of styles of hamburgers ($6.95 to $8.95) rounds out the menu. Mr. Sementa, who played at the club in a local band during the 1970's, bought the establishment in 1979 and added the restaurant 12 years ago. He hopes to add more fresh seafood to the menu and eventually to remain open all year. Karen DeMasters",2002-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,President to Presidents," Ido believe my contemporaries are a unique generation of university presidents -- academic administrators with a social conscience. As I think back on it, it seems obvious why many of us, who as faculty or students were active in civil rights and the anti-war movement, made the natural progression from political action to university curricular reform. Rejecting the view that higher education should serve a predominantly elite population, we proceeded to overhaul what we perceived as an outmoded university curriculum as we struggled to open up the university to new ideas, new teaching strategies, and most of all to new populations. In my generation of young faculty, at least in the humanities and social sciences, there was a heightened commitment to the values of equity, justice and diversity and a tremendous concern for reforming the very institution that had given those of us who were not from wealthy families our edge -- the university. Our efforts at reform coincided with the articulation of an urban university agenda which a number of AASCU institutions embraced. Those campuses were invariably led, as I recall, by presidents and chancellors who saw an urban commitment as fundamental to an expanded sense of institutional mission. As successful as our generation may have been in challenging established institutional values and educational orthodoxy across the spectrum of American higher education, it seems clear in retrospect that we were quite unsuccessful in articulating a new value system to support the curricula reforms we helped to initiate. Not until very recently has higher education taken on the daunting task of identifying and institutionalizing a new set of civic and moral values to replace those that my generation helped to discard.

The depth of feeling in the videos Mr. Romanek directed comes through his deployment of color and the suggestion of violence. He does much the same thing in ''Photo,'' which opens today in New York and Los Angeles.

The software is available for $19.95 or as part of a monthly fee for one of RealNetworks' subscription services. The move continues a shift in the company's strategy, first signaled last month, when it said it would allow companies that use its software to broadcast programs over the Internet to use audio and video in a range of formats, including Microsoft's proprietary Windows Media. ''Sometimes just because your competitor wants you to do something doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,'' said Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks. ''We realized we were the only ones who could offer universal playback, and we thought consumers would really appreciate it.'' RealNetworks has come under increasing pressure from Microsoft, which gives away both its media player and server software as part of the Windows operating system.

The company, based in Amsterdam, posted a net loss of 9.3 billion euros, compared with a loss of 499 million euros in the period a year earlier, the chief executive, Ad Scheepbouwer, said at a news conference.

KPN cut the value of its mobile permits in Germany and Belgium by 4.1 billion euros.

Verizon has refused to comply with a subpoena issued under a process intended to allow copyright owners to get personal information quickly about people suspected of infringement. Internet providers are required by law to turn over such information when a copyright holder identifies infringing material on computers that they control. In this case, the material resides on the individual's personal computer. Verizon argues that the recording industry should be forced to file a lawsuit against the individual, rather than getting the information through the expedited method. Last week, the association asked a judge to order several major Internet providers to block a site in China that distributed thousands of unauthorized songs. That lawsuit was dropped yesterday because the site, Listen4Ever, is no longer operating, but record industry officials said the same approach to blocking a pirate site could be used in the future.

Net income in the third quarter fell to 202 million euros ($195.7 million), or 0.39 euro a share, from an adjusted 331 million euros, or 0.64 euro a share, in the year-earlier period, a ThyssenKrupp spokesman, Klaus Pepperhoff, said.

The agency named Sinval Zaidan Gama acting chairman for at least 180 days so the company's financial problems do not interfere with electricity supplies to Cemar consumers. A court must decide, meanwhile, what to do with Cemar's $180 million in debt. PPL said in January that it would write off its investment in Cemar, worth about $300 million.

''In the face of the pronounced downturn in telecom spending, Ciena continues to strive for a balance between sustained, strategic investment that will drive future revenues and prudent cost management that will help return us to profitability,'' said Gary Smith, the company's chief executive. The loss for the quarter that ended July 31 was $160 million, or 42 cents a diluted share, in contrast to net income of $5.7 million, or 2 cents a diluted share, for the period a year earlier.

us,"36 Hours | Black Hills, S.D.","AS western South Dakota rises gradually toward Wyoming, its seemingly endless expanse of wheat fields is broken abruptly by the Black Hills, a tangled maze of topographical features where Indians of the Great Plains battled Army troops in the 1870's. Today, grain-harvesting combines and razor-straight highways east of the Black Hills give way to a broken and wooded landscape laced with serpentine roads through pine forests and granite passes. There is more wildlife here than there is in some of the country's most famous national parks, but the area has somehow been spared the throngs of recreational vehicles and cars that choke roads in and around better-known places. The Black Hills cover a sizable corner of South Dakota, so putting some mileage on the odometer is part of the journey. This is not a trip for serious foodies, however: the local cuisine tends to be more chicken-fried steak than pan-seared scallops, so adjust your culinary expectations accordingly.

Net income for the quarter ended July 31 was 3 cents a diluted share, in contrast to a net loss of $19.3 million, or 6 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $282.3 million from $249.1 million, and operating expenses declined 20 percent. Novell has been expanding into new products after losing market share to Microsoft in operating system software. Last month, Novell bought SilverStream Software to add programs used to run Web applications. Demand for Novell's programs was stronger than expected in Europe and remained sluggish in the United States, the chief financial officer, Ron Foster, said. ''In the software world, the continuing reports are that the information-technology marketplace isn't rebounding,'' Mr. Foster said. ''The consulting business globally and notably in the U.S. has still not completely leveled out.'' Novell shares, which have dropped 54 percent this year, climbed as high as $2.78 after the news was announced. But by the close of regular trading they had fallen 9 cents, to $2.09. Excluding purchased in-process research and development, Novell said it would have earned 4 cents a diluted share in the recent period. On that basis, which does not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, Novell had been expected to earn 2 cents, the average estimate of three analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Excluding certain items, fourth-quarter profit will be less than in the third quarter because of costs from the SilverStream purchase, Mr. Foster said.

A herd of deer grazing by a head gate near sunset blends into the alfalfa behind it, until one doe peers over the embankment and her ears turn crimson with their own blood in the penetrating light. Sunrise picks out wires on a fence line that were once as tight as guitar strings but now run like tendrils from post to post.

According to this fragmentary account of her childhood, the author has repeatedly fictionalized her real life in both her children's books and her adult fiction. And it's not a very pretty story: her parents were cruelly feckless, and after her mother decreed she had to go, Fox was passed among relatives and friends in locales as varied as Long Island, Hollywood and Cuba. Her imagistic memoir, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2001, displays her ''intelligence and her exceptional eye,'' Thomas Mallon wrote here. ''Sharp observations and pieces of humor stick out from all the confusion and dread.'' Fox's recently reissued novel THE GOD OF NIGHTMARES (Norton, $13.95) follows the fortunes of a young woman who abandons her sheltered life on a rural horse farm to search for her aunt in the liberating, bohemian world of New Orleans in 1941.

In the years after it took power, the military waged a bloody campaign against leftist insurgents known as the ''dirty war,'' summarily killing, imprisoning and torturing thousands. Hundreds more disappeared without a trace. Few have been held accountable, though trials of former military officers continue to this day.",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Newark; Where Tony's Dad Bought the Cherry Vanilla,"In a 1950's flashback on ''The Sopranos,'' Tony's dad says, ''I stopped at Nasto's; got you some cherry vanilla.'' Forty-plus years have passed since that sequence, and a seemingly equal amount of time has gone by since there have been any new episodes of the HBO drama. But Nasto's Olde World Ice Cream remains a constant, and you can still get cherry vanilla. Opened in 1939, Nasto's commands the corner of Jefferson and East Kinney in the Ironbound district of Newark. Though the shop itself -- with its white-fringed blue awnings -- is rather small, Nasto's takes up a sizeable chunk of the block. In the additional square footage, Nasto's manufactures ice cream and desserts, and parks its delivery trucks as ''purveyors to hotels, restaurants, caterers.'' Still, this is no conglomerate. It's a traditional family business, and not just because there' a gratuitous ''e'' in Olde World. The proof is in the pudding, or rather, in the ice cream. On the day I visited, 24 flavors were available, as well as 3 frozen yogurts, 4 sherbets and 6 Italian ices. I tried the chocolate peanut butter ($1.75 for a cone, $3.25 for a hand-packed pint, $7.25 a half-gallon) while my friend sampled the butter almond. O.K., I never met an ice cream I didn't like. But top quality homemade ice cream like this is a rare treat. And that was just for starters. Next we tried the chocolate and lemon varieties of Italian ice ($1.25 small, $1.50 medium, $1.75 large, $2.75 quart, $4 half gallon), which were terrific. Nasto's also offers ice cream cakes, shakes, sundaes, tortoni, spumoni, tartufo, prepacked ice cream and more. What more can I say? Summer's (still) here, and the time is right for ice cream in the streets. Jack Silbert",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Each word in English had to start with a person trying to express a thought. For most words, the neologizer (or neologizers -- new words, like teenage trends or the calculus, are likely to pop up at the same time in very different places) is anonymous, although there are some exceptions. The humorist Gelett Burgess coined the word blurb in 1907. Yester-year, which sounds ancient, was in fact coined in 1870 by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who wanted to translate a French word for which he couldn't find a suitable English equivalent. Paul Lewis, a professor of English at Boston College, invented the word Frankenfood (''genetically modified food'') in a letter to The Times in 1992.

While it is true that ''riding bicycles along a busy highway in a snowstorm . . . greatly increases the probability that they would be hit by trucks,'' that does not answer the question of just how common it is in Raahe for bicyclists to be hit, and killed, by trucks in snowstorms. Has there ever been a case of even two unrelated bicyclists killed within two hours of each other in Raahe during a snowstorm? And where are the statistics showing the general probability of being hit and killed by a truck while riding a bicycle in a snowstorm?",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000
us,MOVIES: CRITIC'S CHOICE,"IT'S bad enough that Herman Broder (Ron Silver) has a sweet, subservient wife (Margaret Sophie Stein) and a possessive mistress (Lena Olin) in ENEMIES, A LOVE STORY (1989), set in 1949 New York. Then his first wife (Anjelica Huston), who was believed to have died in the Holocaust, turns up. And to top it all off, the mistress announces that she's pregnant. How does he handle all of this? ''I do the best I can,'' he says philosophically. ''It's not that easy.'' In Mr. Silver's hands, Herman does seem as much victim as perpetrator. The film, based on an Isaac Bashevis Singer novel, is poignant, atmospheric, a drama with a wry sense of humor.

Elaborate preparation, it seemed, was the key to victory. Falkenhayn might have hesitated to provide resources on a scale that met the large promises of his memo to the Kaiser or the specific needs that the Crown Prince discerned, yet what he authorized in the compromises hammered out immediately after Christmas 1915 was still a massive concentration of force. Indeed, it was the most massive yet gathered in a war that had already proved a deadlock of concentrated force. ",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Casein Dreams,"Willem Elsschot's novel CHEESE (Granta, $14.95), first published in Dutch in 1933, is a surprisingly humane farce of ambition gone haywire and Edam gone bad. Translated now for the first time into English, it's also devilishly well timed. Frans Laarmans is a frumpy, middle-aged shipping clerk on the corporate road to nowhere who stumbles into a too-good-to-be-true cheese importing scheme, but he could just as easily be the starry-eyed creator of a doomed dot-com or the duped investor in a corrupt conglomerate. Misguided Frans, who doesn't even like cheese, is ripe for seduction -- he doesn't want to get rich as much as wants to finally get some respect. ''Thirty years of servility have naturally left their mark on me,'' he observes. So while he pompously hunts for the perfect typewriter and clever telex addresses for his business, which he calls the ''General Antwerp Feeding Products Association,'' 20 tons of red-robed Edam pile up in a nearby warehouse. With whiplash speed, his plans go bust as his hot commodity turns into a (pungent) albatross he can't unload. Elsschot, the pseudonym of a Belgian advertising agency executive named Alfons De Ridder, writes with the brisk efficiency and softhearted cynicism of a man who knows the indignities of office life from the inside. His hero's earnest buffoonery only makes the abrupt, embarassing combustion of his ''cheese dream'' all the more moving. When, defeated, Frans tells of trying to ''help my cheese wound heal,'' it's both absurdly funny and bitterly sad. Elsschot possesses the rare knack for making a reader laugh, squirm and sob, all at the same time. MARY ELIZABETH WILLIAMS",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Although the state Constitution requires voter approval before the state can enter into debt by issuing bonds, the school construction bonds were legal because they were issued in response to an earlier Supreme Court ruling that schools in poor districts must be upgraded, the court said. In addition, the state is allowed to maintain a fund to finance schools, including construction costs, Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz said in the opinion.

Even Kievan and tsarist Russia, under the spiritual hegemony of the Russian Orthodox Church, did not impose a uniform esthetics on its creative artists. While the form of religious icons was strictly prescribed, painters of genius such as Andrei Rublev and Theophanes the Greek could, nonetheless, infuse the icons and frescoes they painted with a personal vision of the Christian subjects they rendered. After the 1825 Decembrist uprising against autocracy was crushed, Aleksandr Pushkin was obliged to submit his manuscripts to Tsar Nikolai I for censoring, but Russias national poet was neither silenced nor consigned to penal servitude. While it is true that Fedor Dostoevskii was arrested for participation in the radical political activities of the Petrashevskii Circle and shipped off to prison and exile in Siberia for eight years, he was eventually allowed to return to Moscow to resume his work as writer and journalist. Even though the Russian Orthodox Church excommunicated Lev Tolstoi for his heterodox views on religion, he was not kept from publishing his writings in Russia or forced into exile abroad.

I had been throwing up constantly -- sometimes as often as 12 times a day -- throughout my pregnancy, but that night something felt different. If I had had to describe my symptoms right then, I would have resorted to the familiar vocabulary of illness -- I was dizzy, my heart was racing, I felt short of breath. I guess.

What I felt was more elemental, as if my bodily organs -- mysterious, essential things I knew I had but couldn't feel -- had begun to malfunction in some subtle, unspeakable way. For the next few hours I lay on the bathroom floor throwing up, letting the tile cool my body as it shook uncontrollably after each episode, first freezing, then burning. A few hours later I got up, went into the bedroom and lay down next to my husband. I could tell from movement on the other side of the bed that he was awake.",2002-08-25T05:00:00+0000

Earlier this summer, United asked for a $1.8 billion loan guarantee on $2 billion in private loans.

Long time resident of Collingswood, NJ and for the last three years Moorestown, NJ passed away August 26, 2002 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 59 years old. Although Mr. Konecky was raised in New York City, he relocated to the Delaware Valley in 1963 and made it his home after he graduated with a BS in Mathematics from Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY. Nathan Konecky was a pioneer in the computer software and services business. After graduation he began his career working as a Programmer for Sperry Univac (Unisys). In 1968 he founded National System Analysts, Inc. (NSA) and was its CEO/President for all of its years in business. NSA provided systems analysis and programming services to the computer departments of major local companies. By the early 1980's NSA began to be known as ARMS, Inc. (ARMS). In 1996 ARMS was sold to IMI, a subsidiary of Olsen. But Nate was not finished. He carved out eight people from the sale of ARMS, added some family members and founded a new company, Acsis, Inc. (Acsis). It was his idea to run a small family business. But things didn't work out that simple. Acsis specializes in automated data collection and supply chain solutions that interface with SAP, the largest provider of integrated global computer systems. As a ''best of breed'' provider, Acsis has had tremendous success. Today, six years after its founding, Acsis employs 85 people and its software is installed at over 250 sites around the world. Nathan Konecky put together a fantastic management team and Acsis will continue to grow and flourish. Mr. Konecky was well known in the computer industry. He had been very active in ITAA (Information Technology Association of America) serving as the President of the Professional Services Sector for four years and serving on the organization's Board of Directors for eight years. Nathan has also been very active with his alma mater, Clarkson University. At Clarkson Nate had served on the School of Business Leadership Council for 12 years, had run ARMS U, a company run education program on campus, for six years, had been an Executive Lecturer and had supported the University with funding since graduating. In 1998 Nathan was awarded Clarkson's most prestigious alumni award, the Golden Knight. This award is presented to alumni who have distinguished themselves by service to their alma mater and have demonstrated outstanding career achievement, Mr. Konecky was also a 2001 finalist for Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year. Although Nathan's early background was in the technical disciplines, his forte had become leadership, sales and strategic vision. He is survived by his ''soul mate'', loving wife and life partner, Judith L. (Green Condon) Konecky. Other surviving family members include their children: Debbie and Vince Freeman, Aaron and Maureen Konecky, and Erika Wicker; their six grandchildren: David Meyers, Heather Denver, Sarah and Alexa Wicker, Shawna and Kaitlin Freeman and great-grandson Adam; their siblings: Sondra and Leon Einhorn, Stan and Rena Konecky and Michael and Cathy Graham; and the rest of their blood and extended family.

The state's largest landholding agencies still are not sure how much property they control, the report states. Auditors Kevin Johnston and Robert Jaekle said the Office of Policy and Management, the Department of Public Works and the comptroller's office had developed a new computer system to track surplus properties. Clear criteria are still needed, the auditors said, to determine when a property is no longer needed. In one example from the report, the auditors found that the Department of Transportation ""needlessly tied up"" as much as $127 million because it left out as many as 3,300 parcels of unused real estate in past inventories.

Allen, said it would sell its cable systems in Princeton, N.J., for $245 million. Spectrum Equity Investors, a private equity firm in Boston, and the cable entrepreneur Steve Simmons will buy the systems, which have about 80,000 subscribers, RCN executives said. Mr. Simmons said he would spend about $44 million to upgrade the networks to offer digital cable and high-speed Internet access. David C. McCourt, the chief executive of RCN, said, ""Because the RCN business plan was founded on building our own network in major metropolitan markets and bundling phone, high-speed Internet and cable TV, central New Jersey's systems  which were built years ago by others  were not a core part of our strategy."" Shares of RCN, which is based in Princeton, rose 12 cents, or 14 percent, to 97 cents; they have fallen more than 60 percent this year. (NYT) ",2002-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The treatment, which was developed for family and friends of car crash victims, differs from more traditional grief counseling, in part by aiming to teach survivors how to manage and control their feelings. Dr. Camille Wortman, a professor of psychology at SUNY-Stony Brook and one of the trauma specialists putting the program together, says that people who have lost loved ones in traumatic circumstances often suffer feelings of abandonment, betrayal or guilt.

At D'Fly in SoHo, which sells rings, necklaces and pins to the Wallpaper magazine generation, the jewel box is glass and steel, with recycled rubber underfoot. The store (run by Jeff Shi, who once worked uptown at Harry Winston) takes jewelry to its high-tech limit, with diamond-and-stainless steel rings by Atelier Verstraeten of Belgium (some less than $300) and steel cable necklaces by Shiri Sherf of Germany (less than $500). Most pieces are being seen for the first time in this country. And many of the pieces are architectural: if Frank Lloyd Wright had designed rings or Mies van der Rohe had done bracelets, they would have shown their wares at D'Fly. The jewelry is displayed in glass boxes whose tops ascend and descend when a sales person aims a remote control. The showcases, designed by the German firm 3deluxe, are as beautifully detailed as any of the items inside. The 3deluxe team did the interior of the store as well, dressing it up with stretched nylon constructions called ''genetic structures,'' which look like a high-school science experiment or a bubblegum-blowing contest gone wrong. ''I thought we should have a store that echoes the product,'' Mr. Shi said. ''Most jewelry stores are too conservative.'' Cushions in a seating area, above left, are made of Tempur, a high-tech foam.

Demand for Liberate's advanced television software has lagged as telecommunications companies retrench after their late-1990's spending spree. In a statement, Mr. Kertzman said that Liberate would be able to turn a profit, minus charges, in the second half of its current fiscal year.
