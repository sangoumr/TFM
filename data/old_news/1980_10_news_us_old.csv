Just beyond the elegant parks, malls and town houses is the real London of crowded, narrow streets, slums, factories and sweatshops, and the ever-present smoke, grime, noise and degradation.",1980-10-03T05:00:00+0000

Played mostly by nonprofessionals, the girls are seen at the home in which they are more or less imprisoned. There, they sabotage day-to-day occurrences as best they can, even when forced to engage sullenly in such activities as modeling clothes (they slouch) or learning the school cheer (they mumble).

This time, without John Denver, George Burns bounces one-liners off a determinedly adorable child, Tracy (Louanne), whose father is in advertising. Mr. Burns, as God, commissions the child to find him a slogan. She comes up with ''God Is Bullish on Humanity'' and ''You're in Good Hands With God'' before arriving at ''Think God,'' which is deemed infinitely more clever by everyone concerned.

Even the killer gets a saber in the back and a spike in the face, not to mention fire-extinguisher goo in the eyes. It seems to be a shovel to the head, though, that finally puts him away.

As for Nelly (Isabelle Huppert), she has a lovely smile and an even more stunning pout. She wears ingeniously skimpy sweaters and a lot of black. Sometimes she seems an utter mystery, sometimes just an ordinary bourgeois. When she and Loulou are together, they make love, go to bistros, amble down the street or linger over meals. Even if ''Loulou'' could be watched without dialogue, without subtitles, without Paris, there would be no mistaking this movie for anything other than a French film. ",1980-10-08T05:00:00+0000

Though it's primarily about Paul, Denise and Isabelle, as well as about amorous bellboys, patient pimps, lecherous businessmen, opera singers who won't shut up, modern milkmaids and total strangers, it's not a story in any familiar way. Rather it's about this particular time and place in history as reflected in a series of cockeyed ephiphanies and paradoxes. ",1980-10-08T05:00:00+0000

As comedies go this one is odd, very odd. Its characters have funny names - Cletus, Jeorge and Mrs. Bok, to name just three. Its story hinges on so many bizarre coincidences that the screenplay might as well be double-jointed. Its titles are scrawled in that blackboard-style printing that's supposed to signal mirth and never does. In this case, since the film is halfway serious, the perkylooking credits are especially peculiar. ",1980-10-10T05:00:00+0000

The film has the form of a more or less conventional melodrama, about a small Parisian theater company during the 1942-44 Nazi occupation, though the film's methods are so systematically unconventional that it becomes a gently comic, romantic meditation on love, loyalty, heroism and history. Not since Lubitsch's ''To Be or Not to Be'' has there been such a triumphantly unorthodox use of grim material that usually prompts movies of pious, prefabricated responses.

Though Richard Rush's film professes an interest in lofty questions of illusion and reality, simple trickery remains its prime concern. Mr. Rush keeps the film moving busily, sometimes entertainingly, forward. But he seldom offers his audience enough incentive to puzzle through a wild overabundance of riddles. The film's cleverness is aggressive and cool, and so its mysteries, though elaborate, remain largely uninviting. ",1980-10-17T05:00:00+0000

The film doesn't start out as a musical--it's more like a drama with an insinuating rock score. But the action is so false, the characters so unsympathetic and uninteresting, that after a while the music begins playing the only dominant role. ",1980-10-17T05:00:00+0000

Miss Bergman has published her autobiography, written with Alan Burgess and called ''My Story,'' and she has been making the usual promotional rounds. Several weeks ago, she turned up on the Phil Donahue Show, where Mr. Donahue leaned towards her conspiratorially and asked if Roberto Rossellini hadn't hurt her feelings when he left her for another woman. Miss Bergman appeared less affronted by the question than amazed. ",1980-10-26T05:00:00+0000

us,"'FARO DOCUMENT'79,'A BERGMAN REVISITATION","IT will be interesting to see whether we're still alive,'' says Ingmar Bergman, with typical sang-froid, of the year 1989. That is the year in which he plans to make another film about the island of Faro. Meanwhile, Mr. Bergman's muted, rigorously plain ''Faro Document 1979'' is the second installment of a series begun 10 years ago. The island's fortunes have improved since the 1969 film, if only because its young people are no longer so eager to leave. ''If I have to live where I can't see water, it feels strange to an islander,'' says one of the same youngsters who complained of boredom in Mr. Bergman's first installment on Faro. But another, who has moved to a city, says ''It's a useful experience to live in a crowd.'' ",1980-10-30T05:00:00+0000

These people have a way of coming back and making trouble. Nevertheless, ''The Awakening'' is a spooky, skilfully made horror film about archeologists who uncover the inscription ''Do Not Approach the Nameless One Lest Your Soul Be Withered'' and still keep on digging. There are withered souls before the adventure is over, and yours may be among them. ''The Awakening'' will give you a good scare. ",1980-10-31T05:00:00+0000
