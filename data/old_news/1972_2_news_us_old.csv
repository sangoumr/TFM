us,'The Visitors' Portrays Ordeal of a Threatened G.I.,"Elia Kazan's ""The Visitors,"" written by his eldest son, Chris Kazan, and shot in 16-mm, entirely in and around the Kazan country home in Newton, Conn., concerns the ordeal of Bill Schmidt (James Woods), an ex-G.I. who, with Martha (Patricia Joyce), the unwed mother of his baby, is threatened for 16 hours by two former buddies against whom the G.I. brought evidence of war crimes during their tour of duty in Vietnam.In the course of a routine patrol, the two former soldiers, along with other members of their squad, had first raped a young Vietnamese girl, who might possibly have been a Vietcong sympathizer, and then bayoneted her to death.It is one of the oddities of ""The Visitors,"" which is otherwise not exactly shy of exposition, that although Schmidt remains a shadowy character, the very fact that he can't explain why he turned in his two friends is one of the most interesting and meaningful aspects of the movie. It's as if it had been an unconscious impulse, a dim vestige of the kind of honor that today is as practical as an appendix.""The Visitors"" is a far from great film. It insists on saying too much about large issues when it should keep quiet and it's ambiguous when one has a right to expect explicit answers. Yet it is an extremely moving film, partly, I think, because everythingfrom the physical production to the melodramais kept in small scale, as if not to get in the way of, or to confuse, its very legitimate expression of a major American sorrow.I must emphasize, however, that I find ""The Visitors"" moving not only because I happen to share the Kazans' political and moral concerns. As anyone who squirmed through the idiocies of ""Johnny Got His Gun"" knows, the sharing of such concerns can often be a fate worse than death. Chris Kazan's screenplay sometimes has all of the grace of the Dalton Trumbo non-classic, especially in speeches that persist in spelling out simplistic points that, with any luck, we've already gotten.""The Visitors,"" however, is very much an Elia Kazan film and he is still a first-rate director, particularly of actors, in this case of four new young actors who possess the mystery and self-assurance of much more experienced performers. Especially effective is Steve Rails-back as the more murderous of the two visitors, a young man who looks like the sort of a nice, clean-cut, small-town American boy who could eat a piece of apple pie with one hand and cut a friend's throat with the other. However, I also liked Chico Martinez as the other visitor and both Miss Joyce and Mr. Woods, whose performances  mannerisms, movements, ways of touching each othermust supply explanations that Chris Kazan was apparently too busy to develop.The nominal star of the film is Patrick McVey as Miss Joyce's novelist-father, and it may be that my reaction to him is as much influenced by the unpleasant character he plays as by his performance, which does seem a bit broad even for a football-loving whisky-guzzling, right-wing fool. Says Miss Joyce at one point: ""My mother couldn't stand himand neither could his other two wives.""For the most part, the elder Kazan keeps ""The Visitors"" remarkably unfancy and untricky. There is one almost nostalgic moment that recalls Mr. Kazan's best work of the 1950's, when, as in certain scenes in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront,"" he employs highly theatrical melodramain this case, a scene in which Miss Joyce allows herself to be sexually drawn to one of the terrifying visitorsin such a way that the theatricality becomes real dramatic substance, and not a substitution for it.""The Visitors,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie, repeatedly reminded me of Sam Peckinpah's more flamboyant ""Straw Dogs,"" and although I don't think it ranks higher in any appreciable respect, I'd much rather argue about itwhat's right with it as well as what's wrong with it.",1972-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The 8hyearold Olympic president even has won a new nickname in refrigerated circles. They call him the Abominable Snowman. Even if he had wanted to look the other way, though, Avery hardly could have missed observing that the skiers did more than wax their skies. The best of them also waxed rich.

Involved are Bruce Davison, as a seemingly apolitical American archeology student caught in the literal and political crossfire; Zeev Revah, once his classmate at Yale and now an Arab leader on the run from rival, dissident Arab terrorists, and Donald Pleasence, as an Israeli itelligence officer trailing Revah and Davison in order to end the clashes.There also are Nicol Williamson, as a dourly realistic archeology professor anxious to achieve peace among the embattled; Daria Halprin, as a curvaceous Israeli student-activist amorously torn between Williamson and Davison, and Koya Yair Rubin, as the Israeli student-militant leader seeking a clandestine meeting with Revah through Davison, in order to settle all the unpleasantness.Aside from their seriousness of purpose, they are largely two-dimensional characters, with the exception of Donald Pleasence, who emerges as a convincingly human, if implacable, sleuth. A basic weakness of ""The Jerusalem File"" is perhaps underlined best by Mr. Williamson, when he snaps, ""You're playing at politics and you're no good at it.""The politics, the disparate motivations and the implicit drama of youth defeated by a world they don't want are only vaguely projected and are secondary to the chase and shoot-em-up action of ""The Jerusalem File.""",1972-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Alpine Caper,"If you go to movies for your serious skiingand given the current winter, I don't know where else you'd gothen you may wish to see ""Snow Job,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters. For ""Snow Job"" stars Jean-Claude Killy up and down the Swiss and Italian Alps, and it features surely the finest skiing south of 86th Street.If you go to the movies for tips to aid you in your larger burglaries, then you may wish to see ""Snow Job,"" in which a quarter of a million is lifted happily, healthfully, and with no worse than a little bump on the head for anyone. But it will help if you have an Alp or two handy on which to hide your loot, and also if you take it not just because it's money but becausewell, because it's there. You, too, should be so pure.But if you go to the movies just to see movies (an almost extinct vice, which I apologize for mentioning), then there is less to say for ""Snow Job,"" which succeeds well enough with skiing and stealingbut fails in such otherwise superfluous areas as writing, acting and directing.There is, of course, much careful authenticity. Like the skiing, the places are authentic: Zermatt in Switzerland; Cervinia in Italy. The people are mostly authentic too. I mean, except for his name (and the fact that he has better ways to make money) Jean-Claude Killy is Jean-Claude Killy. And his girlfriend (Daniel Gaubert) is, at least according to Warner Bros. publicity, the true-life girlfriend of Jean-Claude Killy. His sidekick, Cliff Potts, is an actor, but a snow-loving actor (Warner Bros. publicity again). And you would think that by putting all this together in a ski-resort caper, you couldn't help but fall into the real thing.But, in fact, asking this cast to do drama, even melodrama, is a little like having the stars of, say, ""Endless Summer"" play ""King Lear""and the result, off the slopes, is a certain wooden charm and petrified cheerfulness. In addition, George Englund (""Signpost to Murder,"" ""Zachariah"") directs mostly by having his actors face the camera, pause, and smile before they speakand he thus creates an atmosphere of iron-clad good humor in which crucial moments with emotion-packed lines like (Miss Gaubert to Killy) ""You know what? I might be bad, but you're worse?"" fail somewhat of their intent.Toward the end there comes a small redemption in the person of Vittorio De Sica, a supposed insurance investigator and the major monkey wrench in an otherwise perfect plot. De Sica's part is pure hogwash, and he himself brings much of the ham to it. But he is so beautiful, and so marvelously, joyously phony, and he has such a trick of turning everyone else's fixed grin into a kind of maniacal laughterthat despite the sun and the snow and the skies, he almost persuades us we are at the movies.",1972-02-03T05:00:00+0000

""The Return of Count Yorga,"" a dull, amateurish vampire brew, and catchif you've a penchant for imaginative horror""Murders in the Rue Morgue."" The double bill opened yesterday on the circuits.This is the third go at this Poe we know of. And with all due respect to Bela Lugosi, Sidney Fox and that slobbering ape back in 1932, it's the most interesting, at least artistically.First things first. The ape gets short shrift. Now he's only a key costume at a Grand Guignol theater, in the turn-of-the-century Paris, that triggers the action. All they use, actually, of the original is the title itself on the chamber-of-horror marquee.Secondly, the gimmick here is revenge, as a strange, cloaked figure from the past begins doing in former members of the acting troupe, headed by Jason Robards. The punctuation is thick Freud, moored to the scary nightmares of Christine Kauffmann, as Robard's jittery actress wife. Both the plot and the trickery mesh well until the last reel. But a tacked-on, drawn-out postscript almost flattens the fun.However, the entire film is a gorgeous eyeful in excellent color, with lavish period decor and costumes and some perfectly beautiful dream montages. And under Gordon Hessler's intelligent direction, the suspense deepens, as do some enigmatic characters. Two in particular are well played by Herbert Lom and Michael Dunn. For that matter Robards looks considerably more alive than usual, and Miss Kauffmann is quite good.The denouement is sound but fairly predictable. Curiously, it bypasses another solution, lurking right there in the wings, that would have made a marvelous, jolting wind-up. Compounding this myopia, the picture reaches over into ""Phantom of the Opera"" pasture for an old-hat showdown. But even minus Poe and our favorite ape next to Kong, see it.",1972-02-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Coast Films Shown in Whitney Series,"In movies, as in life, the West Coast has always stood for beautiful surfacesleaving the East with only beautiful souls. One remembers Hollywood, of course, but even in what comes after there seems a positive split between the spirit of East and West, and the difference is evident enough in the excellent program of West Coast Films now playing at the Whitney Museum. For these are wonderful looking movies, even when they are not very good. And when they are good, they achieve their excellence at least partly through a willingness to play with rich and beautiful surface effect.I suspect that Scott Bartlett's ""Serpent"" puts too much trust in its surface imageshandsome enough but absurdly solemnto the degree that they become portents, signifying everything and meaning very little.However, Jordan Belson, in his lovely, very brief ""Meditation,"" eschews signification and allows his formssoft expanding circular formsto exist, and to be exchanged for one another in accordance with the simplest of rhythms. Some day there may be a Jordan Belson film festival. Every movie will look pretty much like every other movie, and for Jordan Belson lovers (I am one) that will be perfectly all right.The centerpiece of the West Coast Films is Peter Hutton's 37-minute ""July 1971In San Francisco, Living at Beach Street, Working at Canyon Cinema, Swimming in the Valley of the Moon."" This is a diary film, a currently popular type, and the title tells you what it is all about. Hutton's film aspires to the condition of home movie. But it has been photographed with such attention to composition, light and deepening shadow that it looks rather like a home movie made by Matthew Brady.Such a diary can have been compiled only for publication, and you are left with the feeling that nothing in it really is as interesting as the author wants it to seem.Robert Fulton's ""Running Shadow"" and Pat O'Neill's ""Easyout"" are the best of the Whitney show. They are also the most difficult, the wittiest, the most concerned with putting their medium to work. ""Easyout"" is a kind of closed-circuit, 9-minute science fiction made up of negative transformations and unsettling superimpositions that continually seem to be communicating somethingwhich is perhaps nothing but the idea of communication.""Running Shadow,"" on the other hand, really does communicate something, about the life of forms understood as changethrough a lightning-fast succession of gorgeous natural images, and finally through the swooping and soaring of the camera itself. It is altogether the most exhilarating 10 minutes I have spent at the Whitney, and among the happiest times in recent moviegoing.",1972-02-04T05:00:00+0000

Wallis's ""Mary, Queen of Scots,"" starring two ordinarily lovely, passionate actressesVanessa Redgrave in the title role and Glenda Jackson as Elizabethin an exceptionally loveless, passionless costume drama.In spite of Schiller, Zweig, Anderson, Fraser and even Robert Bolt (whose ""Vivat! Vivat Regina!"" is now at the Broadhurst), there are, I'm sure, ways in which one might give some new excitement to this old confrontation of queendoms.Unfortunately there is no excitement whatsoever in what Charles Jarrott, the director, and John Hale, the author of the original screenplay, have put together on commission for Mr. Wallis, for whom they also worked on the Wallis screen adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's ""Anne of A Thousand Days."" ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" intends, I assume, to illuminate historyfrom Mary's widowhood in France at the age of 18 until her execution by Elizabeth more than a quarter of a century lateryet all it's really doing is touching bases, like a dull, dutiful student.I had been somewhat amused by the stately dialogue that Mr. Hale (with Bridget Boldand) adapted from Mr. Anderson's play for the screen version of ""Anne of the Thousand Days,"" but in comparison with the original stuff that Mr. Hale has written here, the earlier film sounds, in retrospect, practically Shakespearean. Mr. Hale's language is ringed with desperation, as if like people on TV panel shows, his characters couldn't ever zero in on what they really wanted to say, fully aware that they would think of proper replies tomorrow.Thus when Mary turns on the dissolute Darnley and says: ""You disgust me!"", all that poor old Darnley can say in answer is ""I disgust you!"" The feebleness of the exchanges is almost enough to induce a kind of nutty compassion.The move is not completely without historical interest. In Mr. Bolt's play, the two queens, who never met in real life, do not actually meet but they share the same stage. Schiller's version provides a single, fine confrontation scene. In Mr. Hole's screenplay, the queens meet twice, which inspires the scenarist to reach for prose heights that are usually reserved for Literary Guild selections. ""Madame,"" says Elizabeth to Mary shortly before the execution, ""if your head had matched your heart, I would be the one awaiting death."" It doesn't mean very much, but it's better than ""I disgust you!""Because both Miss Redgrave and Miss. Jackson possess identifiable intelligence, ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" is not as difficult to sit through as some bad movies I can think of. It's just solemn, well-groomed and dumb. It opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall.",1972-02-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"Although the subtitle of Philip Young's attractive collection of essays fits into comfortable pigeonhole, there is greater variety in it than the category American fiction indicates. The essays range from analysis of single works to his own involvement in the making of the modern canon. He is formidably learned as the papers on the legend of Pocahontas and Rip Van Winkle show. But what comes through more than the learning Is the man, modest, bemused, occasionally astonished at the antics of the literary profession, one who is both actor and spectator and who enjoys both roles. In fact, he may be stirring up once again the troubles that got such play in the columns of The New York Review of Books between Edmund Wilson and Lewis Mumford on the one hand and the gentlemen of the Modern Language Association on the other, over the new and authoritative texts of American writers.

She was accused of eccentricity when she was only herself. Originality, she wrote, is a byproduct of sincerity. Her style developed early and showed a firm consistency throughout. It was a style that had the rhythm and pacing of prose, but it was too tight, too condensed for prose. Her poetic mode was her natural mode with words.

Davis explains that he, like most mortals, found it difficult to warm up to Debussy's unique (take your pick) masterpiece/crashing bore. That was before he began studying the score. Pellas took him longer to learn than any other opera except, perhaps, Wozzeck, but once he had it down pat, he became a staunch champion of the work.

Neither complaint particularly provoked the unflappable maestro.",1972-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Melville's 'Bartleby' Transformed for the Screen,"In adapting Herman Melville's great tale of Bartleby the scrivener to the screen, Anthony Friedman has moved the action from New York in the 1850's to London in the 1970's. He has changed his hero's occupation from copyist to bookkeeper. He has opened things up so as to allow Bartleby walks through the city on his time off, to permit some spoken personal thoughts (beyond ""I would prefer not to""), in effect, to provide a bit of private life in order to round out the character, who is as flat as the walls of Wall Street in Melville's story. He has even gone so far as to make him a point-of-view character, whereas for Melville it had been crucial that Bartleby never furnish the point of view.I cannot imagine a less appropriate treatment of ""Bartleby,"" or one less likely to succeed. And yet this movie does very largely succeedin ways that some recent, more reverential adaptations of great books do notat least partly because it has the sense, or maybe just the innocence to make of itself something else.That something elseBartleby as modern alienated manis none too promising. But as the bookkeeper sits at his desk and prefers not to work, and then prefers not to move, and finally prefers not to cat until his preference is for the absolute discretion of death, he keeps much of his mystery. For Bartleby is proof even against the communications of Bartleby, and that is the basis of his profound appeal both to us and to the good-natured accountant who employs him.From time to time Bartleby takes walks through London, and on these walks he usually sees, in order, paper behind plate-glass windows; trash littering the streets; great flights of birds leaving bare trees; people in alleyways and under bridges, always up against walls. These sequences, which I find very moving, do a good deal to establish Bartleby in a perceptible world, though they do not fortunately, explain him.The same is true of the principal performancesboth that of Paul Scofield as the employer, which is very fine, and that of John McEnery as Bartleby, which is beautiful. Bartleby is a person very nearly at the end of expression, at the end of mere movement, and I suspect the temptation to a kind of virtuosity of strained inwardness in playing him must have been very great. McEnery not only avoids such temptation, he also finds a way of effacing his character almost into the nonexistence that is Bartleby's privilege and everyone else's dismay. It is a stunning job of acting, all the lovelier for its quietness, and the best aspect of a generally impressive film.""Bartleby"" opened yesterday at the Paris Theater.",1972-02-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'One P.M.':' Parallel Movie' Begins Run at the Whitney,"Late in 1968, Jean-Luc Godard, then in his first bloom as a post-bourgeois Marxist-Leninist filmmaker, came to America to make a revolutionary movie. Together with Richard Leacock and D. A. Pennebaker, he began shooting on locations in and around New York City on a project that came to be known as ""One A.M."" (""One American Movie"").""One A.M."" was never completed. But from some of its footage, and from footage shot while it was being made, the team of Leacock-Pennebaker have put together another film, called ""One P.M."" (""One Parallel Movie""), which opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum.""One P.M."" contains most of the cast of ""One A.M.""Rip Torn, Tom Hayden, Eldridge Cleaver, The Jefferson Airplane, LeRoi Jones, among others; and it also contains a good deal of Jean-Luc Godard directing and Richard Leacock photographing ""One A.M.,"" along with a couple of sound girls, some New York policemen, one or two producer types, and, watching in the background, Godard's wife, Anne Wiazemski, and assorted friends and relatives.To a degree, then, ""One P.M."" functions as the record of the making of a movie, and in certain sequences it may be all that is left of a movie that was not finally made. There are moments that seem to belong wholly to the rigid Godard geometry of the late sixtiesmost notably Rip Tom's lengthy wire-cage elevator ride straight up and down over the darkening Manhattan skyline, all the while mimicking words and phrases from a radical speech played on a tape recorder that he holds in his arms.But very little of ""One P.M."" is like this. For as handled by D. A. Pennebaker (I should guess, the principal photographer) the film is less an essay in radical politics or in Godardian esthetics or. Heaven forbid, in the useful craft of documentary, than it is homage to the zoom lensan optical contrivance that in the hands of bad cinematographers, to whom it mostly appeals, keeps things artificially jumping, and, at least in this case, 60 per cent out of focus.I don't know why ""One A.M."" was abandoned. There has been talk of Godard's failure to understand the nature of the movement in America. But after looking at the quality of the film work in ""One P.M."" it seems to me that the reason could quite properly have been despair.",1972-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Brando Stars in 'Nightcomers' on Baronet Screen,"Although ""The Nightcomers"" makes no attempt to re-create the style and the feeling of ""The Turn of the Screw"" (which may be the nicest thing one can say about it), Michael Winner, who directed the film, and Michael Hastings, who wrote the original screenplay, have not hesitated to ransack the Henry James novella for everything they could carry off in a thin, small notebookthe names of characters, the outline of incidents and the description of architecture.The movie, which is quite bad under any circumstances, thus qualifies as a particularly listless and greedy parody, the sort that makes no coherent comment on the work it so freely exploits.If ""The Nightcomers"" were just a little more broad, it would also qualify as another example of the kind of middle Gothic comedy turned out by Hammer Films, the company that improvises mostly on Bram Stoker and Mary Wollstonecroft Shelley.""The Nightcomers,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet Theater, insists on telling us everything we never wanted to know about the events that occurred before those in ""The Turn of The Screw"" (filmed as ""The Innocents"" by Jack Clayton in 1951). That is, how Flora and Miles, the beautiful orphans whose possession is not of the self, came to be besieged by the ghosts of Quint, the defrocked valets, and Miss Jessel, their former governess, and especially how Quint and Miss Jessel came to be ghosts in what I suppose you would call the last place.Actually, had the film made no call on ""The Turn of the Screw,"" and were the talents of Mr. Winner and Mr. Hastings somewhat less lumpy, ""The Nightcomers"" might have been a rather interesting movie, if only for the performance of Marlon Brando, which is, in a phrase James used, ""a succession of flights and drops.""There are times when this still extraordinary actor, as Quint, seems to be in another film entirely, looking like a slightly mad Ben Franklin, and then there are small, beautiful moments when Brando's intelligence creates a truly complex character. I think immediately of a short scene in which the unlaundered Quint, the terrifying idol of Flora and Miles, enchants them with the tale of how his father once sold an old nag by pasting rabbit fur over the horses' bald spots and inserting a piece of ginger in a sensitive orifice.Such moments, however, are few, since it is Mr. Hasting's idea that Flora and Miles were corrupted by their isolation in old Bly house with the ignorant Quint and the fearful Miss Jessel, whom Quint liked to tie up and beat as part of their guilt-ridden love-making. Where ""The Turn of the Screw"" deals in the supernatural, ""The Nightcomers"" trafficks in dippy Freud. As the producer's synopsis points out: ""Quint loves as he can, mingling pain with secrecy.""In addition to Brando, there are several other small, unredeeming pleasuresVerna Harvey and Christopher Ellis, who are properly placid and pretty as the children, and the handsome old countryhouse, in Cambridge-shire (according to the credits) where most of the movie was shot. Shot is not quite the right word, perhaps. Because of Mr. Winner's fondness for fast zooms into particular objects, I had the curious feeling that the movie was more or less fallen into, horizontally.",1972-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,"Warhol's 'Women in Revolt,' Madcap Soap Opera","Probably no man, not even Norman Mailer, will ever have the last word on women's liberation, but until ones does, perhaps the Andy Warhol-Paul Morrissey ""Women in Revolt"" will do. The movie is called a comedy, but it can be more accurately described as a madcap soap opera whose three manic heroines are played by female impersonatorswhich may be interpreted as the ultimate put-down of women's lib, as well as the ultimate endorsement.More particularly, ""Women in Revolt"" (as did ""Trash"") recalls Hollywood movies of the 1930's and 1940's, especially those slushy romances in which Alice Faye, Frances Langford and Patsy Kelly compromised everything except their virtue in their pursuit of husbands.Because Warhol and Morrissey deal in systematic reversals of everything, including sex, their heroines are involved in desperate attempts to get away from men. ""You're mine! You're mine! You're mine!"" cries an impetuous lover into the rather large ear of Holly Woodlawn, a high-fashion model from Bayonne, ""Oh, God,"" answers the struggling Holly. ""Women will be free!"" She's sickto the point of always looking exhaustedof being a sex object.So too is the beautiful Candy Darling, ""a society deb socialite"" from Long Island who longs to become a movie star, mostly, I suspect, because she answers everything that is said to her with ""I have a right to live!"" Jackie Curtis, however, is a furtiveliberationist, a 21-year-old virgin who hires a lover through The East Village Other ""to find out what we're fighting against.""According to Warhol and Morrissey, each liberation demands a little doom. Candy becomes rich, famous and miserable by starring in a series of Italian movies in which she neither speaks, sings, dances nor acts. Holly is last seen wandering drunkenly on the Bowery, ""making"" (says an absolutely beautiful line in the film's official synopsis) ""the sidewalks her necessity."" Poor Jackie goes back to Bayonne with a baby, having been impregnated by a former Mr. America.""Women in Revolt,"" which opened yesterday at the Cin Malibu, is not as consistently funny (and awful) as ""Trash,"" but a lot of it is as hilarious as it is dirty. The film carries no screenplay credit, so I have no idea who is responsible for the dialogue, which often is foolish and occasionally inspired in the way that good parodies must be. ""Come down off the trapeze and into the sawdust,"" Jackie says in trying to persuade Candy to join The Movement. ""That,"" sniffs Candy, ""is circus talk.""Holly Woodlawn, in the Patsy Kelly role, is very funny in short takes, and, in longer ones, so grotesque that it's difficult to watch her. Jackie Curtis reminds me a good deal of an Elizabeth Taylor stripped of that fabulous face, while Candy Darling, who sometimes looks like Marilyn Monroe and sometimes like Mrs. Nixon, and often sounds like Kim Novak, comes very close to being a real actress. Of the apparently male performers, only Michael Sklar, who was so fine in ""Trash,"" gives anything approximating a straight performance, as an actor's agent who finally catapults Candy to fame.""Women in Revolt"" is a comparatively elaborate Warhol movie with a limited intelligence, but unlike a lot of better movies, it uses almost all of the intelligence available to it. Thus, in a crazy way, it must be called a success.",1972-02-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: French Whodunit:McBain Adaptation Is at Paris Theater,"It takes a long time for a connected series of five murders to unravel and even longer for a detective to wrap it up in ""Without Apparent Motive,"" a middling-good French whodunit that opened Saturday at the Paris Theater.The picture runs only 102 minutes and is still too long, even with that many corpses. As directed by Philippe Labro, the film has a vividly crisp pictorial style that seems more intent on rolling out a stunningly beautiful Riviera rug of Nice at the expense of taut, tight, head-on narrative.Finally, with the case solved, the picture dawdlingly hangs on, then curiously shrugs itself off, along with the detective hero, played with blunt, admirable simplicity by Jean-Louis Trintignant.Yet the design of murder and the interesting denouement are both credible and original and worth the waitout. To our knowledge, this is the second Ed McBain novel transplanted from America to a foreign setting. The other was that Kurosawa thriller, ""High and Low,"" brilliantly switched to Japan.Mr. Labro, who also collaborated on the script, has extracted good, terse performances from his other players, too, especially Carla Gravina, as the hero's former mistress. And out she goes, too, as Victim No. 4 of that long-range, silenced rifle.Dominique Sanda is properly enigmatic. As for Erich Segal, that ""Love Story"" man, the American writer has a brief acting stint to do (as No. 3) and does it well, spouting perfect French.If only the picture were as succinct.",1972-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,French Love Story: A Boy and a Woman,"Since ""To Die of Love"" is a dramatization of an authentic cause clbre, it calls for more background explanation than the move at the Festival Theater provides. It opened yesterday, already bearing the laurels of a hit in its native France.But the film as presented by Andr Cayatte, the lawyer-turned-director, is both fervent in its espousal of a strange, tragic love affair and precise in its spotlighting of the vagaries of the law. His love story and the law's intransigence are compelling and stark as befits an adult view of a shattering experience.In essence, Mr. Cayatte is relating (as a complete flashback) the true saga of a 32-year-old high school teacher, who quite naturally and tenderly falls in love with a pupil, a tall, handsome, bearded 17-year-old, who appears to be a good deal more mature than his years.His parents charge her with seducing a minor despite his insistence on continuing their relationship. And it evolves basically as the story of her jailings; his incarceration in psychiatric clinics and schools and with relatives. By these methods, the lovers are kept apart legally (although they manage clandestine, bittersweet meetings) until, in final desperation, she commits suicide.As the creator of such memorable features as ""Justice Is Done"" and ""We Are All Murderers,"" Mr. Cayatte this time was inspired by the actual case that was a ""cause scandale"" in 1969, involving Gabrielle Russier, a Marseilles school teacher, and her lover, Christian Rossi. The story was detailed in ""The Affair of Gabrielle Russier,"" the book published here last year.The director has switched his locale to Rouen and he has made other changes. The young man's parents, for example, are seemingly bourgeois, adamant bookstore owners in the film whereas they were actually teachers, as was Gabrielle Russier herself. And, although her divorced husband remained close to her during her trials, he only appears fleetingly in the movie.Through the performances, direction and intelligent dialogue, what could have been a treacly romance becomes a tale of genuine love, implied sex, stultifying despair and a compassionate observation of man's inhumanity to man.In Annie Girardot, ""To Die of Love"" has its most valuable asset. Hardly the classic personification of beauty, she nevertheless projects the feeling of an intelligent girlish woman rediscovering love, ready to sacrifice herself for it. And she subtly conveys a change to despair as she is buffeted by legal ploys she cannot comprehend and by the destruction of her teaching career. It is an understated and forceful portrayal.Bruno Pradal, a newcomer who is reminiscent, of the late Grard Philipe, is equally memorable as her lover, boyish yet grown, a man affected by mental and physical turbulence he cannot fully comprehend but is ready to conquer at all costs.Mr. Cayatte also has derived natural performances from Franois Simon and Monique Melinand, as his parents; Claude Serval as a magistrate, and, among others, a covey of young, intense ""pupils"" who look as though they're ready to take part in another student protest.A poster in the modern living room of Miss Girardot's film ""home"" proclaims a Paul Valry phrase, ""living is a state of mind."" Mr. Cayatte and his convincing company may confuse us by not presenting us with the official source material, but the film delves deeply and often movingly into the states of mind of both the obdurate lawmakers and the tragic principals.",1972-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Outback' Opens:Film Evokes Ambiance of Australian Town,"Freed for a while from his teaching job at a rail stop in the Australian bush, young John Grant sets out to spend the long hot Christmas vacation with his girl, by the sea, and as close to civilization as he can get.He hops a train, the only train, to the small provincial city that is the air link with Sydneyand that is as far as he goes. He never takes the plane.And in the course of one weekend he sinks from passing visitor to drunken derelict in a place he seems as likely to escape as may the damned from Hell. The events of that weekend form the principal action of Ted Kotcheff's ""Outback,"" which opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie Theater.Since ""Outback"" is a film I mostly admire, I had better allow that it is not without flaws. But they are flawsin plotting, in Kotcheff's penchant for using five camera positions at a time where one might dothat may be, not overlooked, but safely admitted in a work that really does move from its strengths rather than its weaknesses.Among those strengths I should have to include a sense of general foreboding that crystalizes often enough into particular terror and that is not quite like anything else I can remember feeling at the movies.Certain science-fiction films come closest to it, especially those in which some evil alien presence has taken over a community that to all outward appearances remains normalwith only the slightest most fugitive hint that something somehow is hideously wrong.Here all that really shows is a society bored to its heels, forced into friendliness, addicted to stupid but good-humored gambling, and absolutely committed to beer drinkingto the extent that everyone is always effusively, oppressively drunk. The crisp snap of a pull-tab aluminum beer can may never replace the creaking door as a clue to horror, but in ""Outback"" it makes a reasonable try.There are, of course, more spectacular invocations, such as a pair of kangaroo huntsone by day, one by nightwhich are in fact real, and which may show you all you ever want to see of how two-legged animals die.But scarier for me is a scene in one of the city's great sprawling saloons, a moment of hushed, terrifying solemnity when in a kind of lunatic praise of long-departed soldiers, sailors and airmen, the drinkers are admonished over a spectral loudspeaker, ""Lest We Forget!"" I suspect that these scenes are real, too, and to have discovered them is a filmmaker's coup.The entire cast is fine, certainly including Gary Bond as the unlucky John Grant, Donald Pleasence as the alcoholic doctor who gives him bed and board, and Chips Rafferty as the local constable who, like a slightly benevolent despot, befriends him.But I especially admired Sylvia Kay as a sullen, sexually hungry housewife, and Al Thomas as her pathetically eager husband. And for the various minor actors and, I should guess, half the male population of Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, there must be credit for a screen debut that ought to put them on anybody's map.",1972-02-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"No Drums, No Bugles'","""No Drums, No Bugles,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater, is not a good movie, but it is a drama of conscience made with such obvious sincerity, with such small financial means and with such limited artistic imagination, that one would like to be kind to it, as if to someone who suffers certain very severe physical handicaps. To be kind, however, is to employ the same sort of fuzzy thoughtfulness used by Clyde Ware, the novelist (""The Innocents,"" ""The Eden Tree"") who wrote, directed and produced the film, which is his first.Ashby Gatrell (Martin Sheen) is a young West Virginia farmer who cannot bring himself to fight against either the North or South during the Civil War. In desperation, he abandons his wife and child and hunting dog and spends the three years of the war hiding several miles from home, sleeping in a cave, eating mushrooms and squirrels, having little fits of madness, and trying to persuade us that he really knows what he is doing, and that he believes in it.Mr. Ware apparently means that we should believe Ashby Gatrell, and that we should identify him with those contemporary resisters who have abandoned not only their families, but also citizenship, to escape participation in a guilty war.I, for one, however, was never persuaded, either that Ashby, as written, is a character to trust, or that his quite momentous decision is comparable to those of so many draft-age men today. Ashby, as played, often verges on the loony.The mistrust, I think, comes on early when, after watching Ashby sorrowfully witness a small battle outside his cave, we realize with shock that his family is still living nearby, as far as we know, he hasn't given much thought to their safety, even though opposing armies are roaming the countryside.The movie really falls apart when it opens its mouth. Because ""No Drums, No Bugles"" is essentially a one-character drama, Mr. Ware must employ all sorts of tricks to relay information to us. Poor old Ashby can only talk to himself so much of the time, so that most of the crucial information is fed to us through the overheard conversations of soldiers, hunters and, in one awful scene, of Ashby's wife (who also talks to herself), lamenting the woe and misery she faces (while Ashby hides discreetly behind a wall).Mr. Ware photographs most of these other characters from the knees downfrom Ashby's point of view. Thus, when they talk, it's like listening to an old-time radio drama while watching a movie distantly related to it.Although the drama of conscience never amounts to much, the movie often achieves a kind of elegiac lookthrough the haunted features of Martin Sheen and in the beautifully photographed West Virginia mountains where the film was madethat kept reminding me, unhappily, of passages from Stephen Crane, Ambrose Bierce and other, better writers.",1972-02-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Carry On Camping',"More than 900 years have passed since the Norman Conquest, and it is sobering to think that so many centuries of English history, that the slow, beneficent growth of a society so traditional and stable, that the legacy of Shakespeare, Jonson, Dryden and the likeshould have issued at last with ""Carry On Camping,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.For ""Carry On Camping,"" which boasts a fair tra-Nurse,"" ""Carry On Cleo,"" dition of its own (""Carry On ""Carry On Regardless,"" etc. etc.), really does require a settled social system, a widely accepted code of conduct, a set of values, an appreciation of class and the accents of classall of which may be ridiculed with the complete assurance that nothing will be touched. It requires as well the class and the accents of characters with names like Sid Boggle, Joan Fussey, Charlie Muggins, Bernie Lugg. Those names also take you back to the music halls, to the minor roles of Dickens, or the people of Mayhew's London.Sid and Joan, Charlie and Bernie go off on a camping holiday, pitching their tents in some sly farmer's field, where they are joined by others, including especially the high-class young ladies of the Chayste Place Finishing School. Many and merry are the adventures that follow, and in a depressed 10 minutes you could probably imagine every one of them. They all have to do with the miseries of life in the open and sex in secret. ""Carry On Camping"" is a movie that proceeds partly by pratfall but mostly by a merciless succession of double entendres, which somehow excite the prurient interest of everybody except, perhaps, the audience.""The Carry On . . ."" movies do have their loyal followers, and I know one distinguished film critic who says he admires them for their sheer vulgarity.

But at least one man, Ed Emshwiller, the independent East-Coast film-maker, makes rather a habit of it, and a magical relation between woman and tree is the controlling metaphor of a brief, lovely tribute to his wife, Carol, that opens the Emshwiller program that began yesterday at the Whitney Museum.It is a two-movie program, and ""Carol"" really serves as a kind of curtain raiser to ""Image, Flesh and Voice,"" which is a feature in length (77 minutes), though I guess not in name, and certainly not in intention. It is an extremely ambitious project (though I suspect that even Emshwiller's smallest movies are ambitious projects), and it means not to tell a story, but rather to balance its elements of image and voice in a kind of contrapuntal exercise where one always meets the other but never exactly matches it.""Flesh"" I take to be the principal theme of the filmthe state of man, or the state of man-and-womanwhich is the central interest of the images and the constant concern of voices, a vocal montage constructed by Emshwiller and sounding like a cross between conversations overheard at a swinging singles party and group therapy. Sometimes the people who talk appear on the screen, but never while they are talking. The only performers are two dancers, Carolyn Carlson and Emery Hermans. Emshwiller has always filmed dancers with close feeling for presence and movement, and Hermans and Miss Carlson are among the movie's greater incidental pleasures.There is a good deal to like in ""Image, Flesh and Voice,"" most of it, unfortunately, incidental. Emshwiller continues to prove himself a cinematographer of fine sensitivity and superb technique. At this stage of everybody else's development in experimental film, he begins to look like an outright classicist in his commitment to the human face and form, and in his fairly straight-forward recognition that we are drawn to one another by desire. As a matter of course, his movies have tended to include extraordinarily beautiful young girls, and ""Image, Flesh and Voice"" is no exception.But Emshwiller is not so interesting in his ideas, and ""Image, Flesh and Voice"" is full of ideasto the extent that almost all the images, even the young girls, serve as the visualization of ideasabout personality, human relations, time, etc. And in this function they become boring. Even the characteristic Emshwiller way of moving people across the screen descends from personal style to public expression, and I begin to miss the tree woman of ""Carol"" who also becomes a dancer and who expresses only herself, for in the obsessional space of a moving picture that is enough.",1972-02-25T05:00:00+0000

us,The Films of David Rimmer,"David Rimmer is a 30-year-old Canadian filmmaker whose work is not likely to be known to most New York moviegoers. A selection of his short films, made between 1968 and 1971, opened last night at the Film Forum in a program that should interest anyone who cares for what movies look like and who wonders where they may be going. Rimmer has adapted several of the styles popular during the last few years, and he has done so with charm as well as skill.The earliest and the latest of these films are the least impressive  the earliest (""Square Inch Field"" and ""Migration"") mainly repeating the expanded-mind imagery adventures that by now seem generic to the independent cinema; the latest (""West Coast Workprint""), a diary film about communal living in the Pacific Northwest, being a work in progress on which more progress has to be made.It is what I guess should be called middle-period Rimmer (1970 through early 1971) that I like the best. ""Surfacing on the Thames,"" loop films such as ""The Dance"" and ""Seashore"" and the storefront study ""Real Italian Pizza""all play wittily and rather elegantly with the idea of film itself, and all investigate the moving image with a kind of concentration most appropriate to a short film.Both ""Seashore"" and ""The Dance"" are loops made of old-movie footage, and they become ghostly evocations of lost energy, broken records of a life long past, as a pair of whirling ballroom dancers repeat the same steps beyond the limits of endurance, or as happy bathers timidly disappear again and again into the same line of surf.""Surfacing on the Thames,"" on the other hand, sees the great river as almost motionless, caught in a misty, monochromatic print like a Whistler paintingwhile on the surface of the film, little changes take place. Wrinkles appear, or a small smudge in one cornerand you find yourself moving between the sublime and the ridiculous without budging an inch.In ""Real Italian Pizza"" Rimmer covers six months of sidewalk life in front of a New York City pizza parlor in 11 minutes, not by speeding things up but by slowing them down in a kind of stop-action selectivity. School-children pass by, a football team passes by, panhandlers beg, some youngsters are picked up by the police, it snows, snow meltsand a cheerful, slightly crazy jauntiness prevails that may be as close as film form can come to really capturing a mood of the city.",1972-02-26T05:00:00+0000

For geography was never its strong point. More than a town or a village, or even a hamlet, Kikl was a state of mind. Its real boundaries were not in space but in time. It was an abstract of Jewish history which can only be located in the memory, the literature and the folklore of the Jews.

Pompes Funebres (written in 1944 and published in 1947, Genet's first book after leaving prison) is the most literally homosexual and perverse of his novels and the one in which Genet identifies himself most fully with the public and private evils of occupied, then liberated, France and the beautiful evil of Nazi Germany.

Rogers's office in the Department of State lies a large rectangular glass ashtray, not terribly different at first glance from many others around Washington. Etched into the crystal is an impressive seal meant to convey the majesty of the United States Government. Senators give their favorite constituents ashtrays much like this one, but this is no everyday senatorial trinket. Ringing the eagle in the majestic seal are the words Vice President of the United States, and beneath it is the replica of signature which, in very precise penmanship, reads: Richard Nixon. This ashtray is a collector's item, rarer by far in Washington than, say, a PT109 tie clasp. It says something important about William Rogers. His detractors, in fact, might argue that it says everything there is to know. It is a reminder that Bill Rogers's relationship with Richard Nixon dates back to the whistlestopping days of the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952. That's a long time for a man like Dick Nixon, who has trouble with close relationships. Indeed, Wil liam Rogers has been a good and valued friend of the President far longer than any of the other men who surround him as policy advisers.",1972-02-27T05:00:00+0000
