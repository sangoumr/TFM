Kahlo (1907-54) was a bourgeois rooted in Mexico, whose life was turned inward by physical disability; Modotti (1896-1942), of Italian working-class background, was a peripatetic militant, who turned from art to political activism. Their work was certainly dissimilar: Kahlo's intensely personal, permeated with fantasy and obsessive self-image; Modotti's concerned with formal values and down-to-earth people and objects.",1983-03-04T05:00:00+0000
us,"'TENDER MERCIES,' ROBERT DUVALL AS TEXAN","WHAT better proof can there be of the distinctiveness of Australian film-making than ''Tender Mercies,'' a film by Bruce Beresford that manages to be thoroughly Australian though it features Texas settings and an American cast? Mr. Beresford, the director of ''Breaker Morant,'' has brought a hauntingly spare look to this story, which is set on a prairie as endless and barren as Australia's. And the characters are as silent and unyielding as the landscape. Indeed, ''Tender Mercies'' has a bleak handsomeness bordering on the arty, but it also has real delicacy and emotional power, both largely attributable to a fine performance by Robert Duvall. Mr. Duvall's versatility seems to know no limit; in his role here as an over-the-hill country singer, he creates yet another quietly unforgettable character.",1983-03-04T05:00:00+0000

WHEN THE CAMERA RELIES ON PAINTERLY PRECEDENTS","In painting and poetry, as well as photography, the strategy of Surrealism is to combine seemingly unrelated things to suggest, or reveal, heretofore unsuspected connections between them, and there is a sense in which much of modern photography is Surrealist by nature. The camera records whatever is in front of its lens at the moment of exposure, and when small hand-held cameras are used outside the controlled environment of the studio, they often record odd bits and pieces that are unrelated to the photographer's main subject, yet may cast an odd light on it. Thus, in news photographs of fires, accidents and other disasters there are often people standing about looking the other way as if nothing were happening - a bizarre effect that seems to say something profound about human beings and their relation to one another.",1983-03-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"REALISM TOWARD SALVADOR, NICARAGUA","Concerned with changing military conditions, President Reagan has asked Congress to appropriate $60 million in additional military aid to El Salvador - and with good reason. With every passing month, the situation in Central America becomes more intractable and dangerous. The political, military and social trends in the region are moving in a direction unfavorable to United States interests and clearly the Administration's policies are not working. For me, this raises dire questions not only about the means that the Administration is using in Central America but also about its goals.The Administration is not only insensitive to large-scale human rights violations and lacking any historical perspective on Central America but, more important, its tactics are wholly unsuited to its goals. Washington's aid to El Salvador, even if increased significantly, is no substitute for the social reforms that would be necessary to undermine the appeal the guerrillas hold for many Salvadorans. Nor could the United States possibly provide enough aid to achieve a stalemate or defeat the revolution against the Salvadoran Government. What is Mr. Reagan's goal? It is simple enough: to prevent the countries of the region from going the way that Cuba has gone. The assumptions underlying the goal are more complex, and it is useful to untangle them. The Administration believes: * Cuba would have become a Communist state whether United States policy toward Havana during the last 24 years was benign or hostile. * Nicaragua is rapidly becoming a Communist state.",1983-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Butley, Mr. Gray's venomous teacher in the well-known play of the same name, effected his withdrawal from society in a particular way, the most dramatic his author has yet managed to devise. He attacked. He attacked mainly with his tongue, flicking out poisonously in all directions, but also with his restless, threatening, overbearing presence. He drained the air out of the commonroom that was meant to be shared with his colleagues until his colleagues, gasping for breath and for surcease, simply fled. But Butley had emptied out more than the room. Emotionally speaking, he'd emptied out his world, ridding it of friends, acquaintances, people.

INVESTIGATIONS,"Following are excerpts from ''Criminal Intelligence Investigations,'' a section of ''Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Domestic Security/Terrorism Investigations,'' issued today by Attorney General William French Smith: Domestic Security/Terrorism Investigations 1. General Authority a. A domestic security/terrorism investigation may be initiated when the facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that two or more persons are engaged in an enterprise for the purpose of furthering political or social goals wholly or in part through activities that involve force or violence and a violation of the criminal laws of the United States. In determining whether an investigation should be conducted, the F.B.I. shall consider all of the circumstances including: (1) the magnitude of the threatened harm; (2) the likelihood it will occur; (3) the immediacy of the threat; and (4) the danger to privacy and free expression posed by an investigation. b. Authority to conduct domestic security/terrorism investigations is separate from and in addition to general crimes investigative authority, racketeering enterprise investigations and international terrorism investigations. c. In the absence of any information indicating planned violence by a group or enterprise, mere speculation that force or violence might occur during the course of an otherwise peaceable demonstration is not sufficient grounds for initiation of an investigation under this section. This does not preclude the collection of information about public demonstrations by enterprises that are under active investigation.",1983-03-08T05:00:00+0000

As the gateway through which both Chinese culture and Western civilization were introduced into Japan, Nagasaki became the window to the outside world: Soon after Japan was discovered by European explorers in 1543, a long procession of missionaries and traders appeared from the West, and by the early 17th century the Portuguese, Dutch, British and Russians had established trading firms and settlements on the hills overlooking Nagasaki Harbor.

Like all European capitals, the city has of course undergone certain changes, the most conspicuous being the appearance of herds of tall buildings beyond the ancient gates. Old districts like Passy, peculiarly gripping in their dinginess, are almost unrecognizable today with their new apartment houses and office buildings, most of which would suit a Mediterranean port better than Paris. It's no easy thing to impose color on the dogged northern gray, the native Parisian grisaille, flinty, foggy, dripping and for most of the year devoid of any brightness. The gloom will have its way with these new immeubles, too, you may be sure of that. When Verlaine wrote that the rain fell into his heart as it did upon the city (referring to almost any city in the region) he wasn't exaggerating a bit. As a onetime resident of Paris (I arrived in 1948), I can testify to that. New urban architecture will find itself ultimately powerless against the grisaille. Parisian gloom is not simply climatic, it is a spiritual force that acts not only on building materials, on walls and rooftops but also on your character, your opinions and judgments. It is a powerful astringent.",1983-03-13T05:00:00+0000

Offhand, it sounds more like a sharpie conning a customer into spending some extra money. But then again, the dealer may be responding quite properly to the circumstances and requirements of this particular customer: the size of his living room, his listening habits and musical predilections.

All of which points up the fact that power ratings continue to perplex many listeners, aside from tempting eager dealers to hike the sales ticket for the unwary. The price of equipment rises sharply with increased wattage, so that added power - among other things - means greater dealer profits. But of course there is no point in paying for wattage you're never likely to use. So, at the risk of revisiting familiar ground, it may be well to review the basic guidelines for finding the hi-fi power rating suitable for any particular person and place.",1983-03-13T05:00:00+0000

us,PRACTICAL TRAVELER,"Scan the advertisements in your travel section and one fact becomes clear: charter flights will abound this spring and summer and could pare your vacation costs sharply. So if you are planning to visit a country to which charters operate from the United States, it would be foolhardy not to examine, at least, what they have to offer and to compare their fares, conditions and services with those on scheduled flights. You may like very much what you learn, or you may conclude that the saving isn't enough to overcome certain elements of uncertainty. The term ''charter'' can evoke diametrically opposite feelings among air travelers. To some it means taking a chance: risking late changes in departure arrangements, arrivals at unexpected airports, switches in hotels, misdirected baggage, no responsible person to whom to complain, and extreme difficulty - if not impossibility - in getting recourse after returning home. There is no question that such problems do occasionally arise; in fact, almost all have been known to occur on the same trip.

It must also help to account for the continuing number of recordings that are issued.

Their concerns are to see whether Washington will have the necessary political support to deploy new missiles in Western Europe, to gauge whether politics will push the Reagan Administration toward compromises and, above all, to learn how they will fare under the new leadership of Yuri V.
