The Board of Trustees and members institutions of the Catholic Health Care system of the Archdiocese of New York mourn the loss of the beloved Shepherd of the Archdiocese who has gone to his eternal rest to be with Our Lord. A defender and champion of the poor, the sick, vulnerable and all those who are marginalized. His Eminence brought Christ's healing presence to those most in need. In the way he lived his life and the grace with which he faced his death, His Eminence was an inspiration to all of those dedicated to fulfilling the Church's healing ministry through the hospitals and nursing homes of the Archdiocese's Catholic Health Care System. His commitment to life-from his staunch advocacy for the unborn to his support of the tiniest of infants who began life at Our Lady of Mercy's neonatal unit; from the AIDS patients, whom he visited in nightly unannounced visits at St. Clare's Hospital to those who suffered with Huntington's Disease and were cared for at Terence Cooke Health Care Center; from those who were ravaged with the end stages of cancer and found compassion at Calvary Hospital and the sick who were treated at St. Agnes Hospital to the elderly cared for at Carmel Richmond, Ferncliff, Kateri, Mary Manning Walsh, St. Vincent dePaul, Terence Cardinal Cooke and St. Teresa's nursing homes, -whether through his actions or his prayers, touched us all. His faith in Our Lord was unwavering. His will to serve was inspiring. As Archbishop, his reach extended beyond Archdiocesean borders. Though truly a world leader, His Eminence was first and foremost a priest who followed his calling. As concerned with those who did not have adequate health care in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America and around the world as he was with those in New York, his legacy will perhaps best be measured by the care received by those whom he did not know and who in turn may not have even known his name. Despite his extraordinarily demanding schedule he always had time for a quiet moment of counsel, praise and gratitude to those who so willingly served under him. It was an honor and a privilege to do so, and for that we are eternally grateful. Our prayers go out to the Cardinal's immediate family and his extended family of New York. As beloved as he was in life so too will he be missed in death. As we pray for his soul, we also pray that his light may continue to shine upon us all. May the Lord grant him eternal peace.

Mr. and Mrs. Marsh were married in 1953. In 1952 Mrs. Marsh became actively involved in the foundation's operation when Mr. Marsh donated three newspapers he owned to the foundation to provide a source of greater and more permanent funding. She served as president from 1952 until her retirement in 1974. The foundation grew from its modest beginning into an international organization providing assistance to people and organizations who could get help from no other source. Mr. and Mrs. Marsh established a system of agents throughout the world to extend the foundation's activities. Agents received modest monthly stipends to assist people in need. Mrs. Marsh kept in regular contact with agents, many of whom were selected during their travels. Others were family members and friends.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; A Timeless Passage,"In 1853, when the federal government authorized five Army expeditions to survey the West for a transcontinental railroad route, there was a conspicuous absentee in the command structure: John C. Fremont, whose exploits in the Rockies and Sierra Nevada had captivated the nation's imagination. But Fremont's fourth western expedition, in the winter of 1848, had ended disastrously, with 10 of his men dead of cold or starvation, and he was passed over. Undeterred, Fremont mounted his own mission, with the foolhardy notion that he would make a wintertime passage across the mountains of Colorado, Utah, Nevada and California. Fremont also brought along a New York painter and photographer, Solomon Nunes Carvalho. The expedition failed in the snowy Wasatch Range of Utah, where the men froze and starved until they were saved by Mormon pioneers. Though the effort proved nothing in practical terms, it had passed through some of the most dramatic midwinter terrain in North America, and Carvalho captured an extraordinary visual record on the fragile copper plates of his daguerreotypes. Although the images were copied on steel engravings, the actual daguerreotypes were destroyed in 1881 along with Fremont's journals in a New York warehouse fire. In 1994 Robert Shlaer, a former biologist turned art photographer, who had mastered daguerreotypy, began a four-year odyssey to retrace the four-month-long Fremont expedition in a specially equipped darkroom van. He painstakingly reproduced Carvalho's images with the still difficult old process. SIGHTS ONCE SEEN: Daguerreotyping Fremont's Last Expedition Through the Rockies (Museum of New Mexico, $45), containing 126 haunting, finely-detailed modern daguerreotypes, depicts some of the West's wildest scenery, most of it virtually unchanged after 150 years. The illustrations are augmented by many period engravings, paintings by Carvalho, and a number of Shlaer's helpful but less artistic record shots. His text freely draws on historic sources as well as his equally fascinating attempts to identify unlabeled 1853 views and to duplicate exactly Carvalho's vantage points.

Or else: the replay of unforgotten conversations, humiliating, awkward, indelible.

He conducts research, finds a piece of the blimp's cloth cover, performs tests and concludes it was that cover, coated with powdered aluminum and iron oxide (the ingredients in rocket fuel), that caught fire.

In a brilliantly circular, atmospheric narrative, Hannah's romance is interwoven with a deadly love story, set 100 years earlier, that will in turn mysteriously haunt her. In Hannah's Depression-era tale, the 17-year-old summers with her stepmother in an old Dundee schoolhouse, which proves to be possessed by a ghostly figure only Hannah sees -- a woman with ''burning colorless eyes that seemed to have no pupils.'' Hannah takes solace in the arms of blue-eyed Conary Crocker, Dundee's ''all-around wild seed,'' who charms her with lazy afternoon boat trips off deserted islands. These scary and sweet events alternate with the 1850's courtship of conventional young Claris Osgood by a taciturn fisherman named Danial Haskell; their later, horrifying marriage will scar their daughter and son and end in murder. The taut facility with which Gutcheon twines the two stories creates real suspense -- both in the exact fates of the couples and the identity of the ghost, who grows viciously vengeful. While Gutcheon cannily evokes the ephemerality of passion, she also evinces, with stark and elemental resonance, the way love and hatred shape lives. Megan Harlan",2000-05-07T05:00:00+0000

Gus passed away on Saturday, May 6, 2000, at his home in Mount Vernon, NY. Gus' twelve-year tenure at Lincoln Center was one that was particularly innovative, creative, and effective. He was the force that pushed the halls very early on into the new age of technology and implemented new hall marketing, co-production, and box office systems. From actor, to musician, to producer, to facilities director, he knew and loved the business of the performing arts. Prior to his appointment as Director of Lincoln Center's Concert Halls, Gus was the line producer for Lincoln Center Out of Doors and the Community Holiday Festival, and Co-Artistic Coordinator of Roots of American Music, which continued throughout his tenure at Lincoln Center. He was also the line producer for New York's JVC Jazz Festival, the field manager for the Grande Parade de Jazz in Nice, France, and one of three producers of the Off-Broadway play, Split Second. Gus was also instrumental in working the Caribbean Cultural Center on the Caribbean Expressions Festival. Gus played bass and sang with the Wickers Creek Bluegrass Band for the last two years. His commitment and passion will be sorely missed, he will be fondly remembered by his many friends and colleagues at Lincoln Center. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Kimberlee Kimes Fleming; their children, Joshua, Samuel, Helene Elizabeth (Holly), and John Nicholas; his mother, Clara Fleming; his sister, Dorothy Ohlendorf, and his large and loving extended family. Memorial contributions can be made to Jansen Memorial Hospice, 69 Main St., Tuckahoe, NY 10707. A memorial service will be held on Tuesday, May 30, at 4:30 PM, in Avery Fisher Hall, Broadway at 64th Street. Beverly Sills, Chairman Nathan Leventhal, President",2000-05-10T05:00:00+0000

Fed by winds gusting higher than 60 miles an hour, the fire jumped its intended boundaries, destroying about 270 homes and forcing the evacuation of 18,000 people in nearby Los Alamos.

us,Colosseum Couture,"Watching Ridley Scott's audience-immersing Roman epic, ''Gladiator,'' the first blockbuster of the summer movie season, at times feels like you have gone camping with the Versaces. The story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a soldier-turned-slave-turned-gladiator, is a study in maximalist style. The lavish costumes designed by Janty Yates -- body armor for men, body jewelry for women, body fur for everyone -- take their cues from the work of the English painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. The result is ''a Roman look with pre-Raphaelite overtones,'' Ms. Yates said last week via cell phone from the streets of Florence, where she is doing the costumes for ''Hannibal,'' Mr. Scott's sequel to ''Silence of the Lambs.'' But while ''Gladiator'' is set in A.D. 180, many of the clothes and accessories mirror current runway trends: Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), the emperor's daughter, is done up in pearl-beaded wraps and exquisite headbands that could easily be worn this summer. Her dresses, laced over the bodice, are reminiscent of the bikinis at Gucci; and armbands are just like those seen on stars like Cate Blanchett at the Academy Awards. Of course, fashion-conscious moviegoers know that period movies always say as much about the period in which they're made as they do about the period in which they're set. As for the men, the designer eschewed the embarrassingly short lengths that resulted in so many bare legs in ''Spartacus'' and ''Ben Hur'' during the last great round of toga movies. ''We made sure the men's tunics were more like Scottish kilts -- more funky and macho,'' Ms. Yates said. Where was she when Charlton Heston needed her? FRANK DeCARO",2000-05-14T05:00:00+0000

Currently, the park's eight clay tennis courts are open to the public from May to October. The rest of the year the courts are leased to the Harbor View Racquet Club. Mayor Deborah Chapin said the village was losing money on the courts. Under the proposed contract, Sportime would replace the courts and build and operate a multisport complex, spending an estimated $1.9 million and paying the village $4.5 million over the 17-year life of the contract. By law, the board can award such a contract without public hearings. But most residents at the meeting agreed with Richard L.

Delfino. Mr. Gretsas would not say what kind of added incentives the city was considering. Earlier this spring, Loews said it was no longer interested in building a 21-screen, 5,100-seat movie theater in the Town Center, which is being developed by Tishman Speyer Properties. At the same time, Loews began negotiating to build a theater in Port Chester. Company officials, however, have assured White Plains that negotiations with Port Chester have nothing to do with its decision to pull out of the Tishman Speyer development, Mr. Gretsas said.

The universe itself is about 14 billion years old and the light from this quasar was emitted less than a billion years after the Big Bang. The discovery may help solve a profound question in cosmology: when did the first light-giving objects form? For about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was a dense, hot haze of subatomic particles that hadn't coalesced into atoms. Sometime later, stars and galaxies were born; astronomers refer to the period in between as the Dark Ages. This quasar provides a new boundary to that epoch.

In 1998, the artist Kenny Scharf designed pointy-headed, one-eyed aliens for Pucci International, a mannequin manufacturer.

The mannequins are precise and tidy. No blowsy look for them. No pierced orifices. ''I wanted an uptown series,'' said Ralph Pucci, president of Pucci International, ''people you associate with Fifth Avenue and a house in Greenwich, Conn.'' Each has a personality, job and name: Hamilton, shown in a dark suit, is a silver-haired banker in his 60's; Caroline, second from left, is a gallery owner also in her 60's. Among the younger well-bred friends are Leander, third from left, a Wall Street broker; Helen, far left, an aspiring model; and Sam, an English pointer. A pit bull wouldn't do.

Chris and Deborah Latham, a clean-cut, all-American couple living in Sag Harbor, N.Y. -- he's a dentist, she's a part-time photographer -- decide to adopt a young Romanian orphan rather than have a second child on their own. Their new son, whom they call Michael, is bright and attractive and affectionate. He's also severely emotionally disturbed. The Lathams try everything from traditional psychology to homeopathy, from indulgence to tough love, in an attempt to give Michael a normal future. Michael has several terrifyingly violent episodes, alienates his friends and is thrown out of school for disruptive behavior. A child psychiatrist (who ''had been picking through human wreckage for years, and . . . knew the difference between detritus and the seeds of possibility'') reads a scan of Michael's brain and informs his parents that ''betting on Michael's chances for becoming a functioning citizen . . . was akin to buying fool's gold.'' But not until someone outside the family draws their attention to the damage Michael is doing to his sister, Caroline, and by extension to them, do the Lathams begin to think about the tough decisions that lie before them. Interwoven into the family drama is a subplot involving Chris, himself orphaned as a child, who has a big secret in his past. Though the attempt to link Chris's past with his current travails is less than successful, ''A Member of the Family'' is a nuanced exploration of what it means to be just that.

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION; Art in a Box,"Joseph Cornell made accumulation a fine art, incorporating a vast range of materials into his poetic box-constructions, collages and dossiers. Of the manifold sources in his work, Jodi Hauptman argues in JOSEPH CORNELL: Stargazing in the Cinema (Yale University, $40), ''the cinema pervades the artist's aesthetic imagination and his artistic vision,'' and to understand Cornell's art ''requires a view through the lens of a motion picture camera.'' There is no doubt that Cornell was immersed in the cinema, both as a historian and as a fan -- he owned an extensive collection of film stills and movies and created some 20 short films. Cornell's ardent engagement with film is further borne out in his ''portrait-homages'' to screen actresses like Lauren Bacall, Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr and Marilyn Monroe, and to child stars including Deanna Durbin and Margaret O'Brien. Hauptman, who teaches art history at the University of Delaware, deftly analyzes the cinematic motifs and formal devices in these portraits and goes on to probe the ambivalence underlying all of Cornell's work. His art embodies a ''confluence of longing and futility, vision and desire, distance and alienation, disturbance and bliss,'' traits that also define the voyeuristic appeal of the motion picture image. Cornell's homages to film stars are ultimately futile attempts to capture and control the ephemeral screen presences that aroused his desire. And although they are presented as tributes, these portraits are shown to be more telling as projections of Cornell's own longing than as memorials to their cinematic subjects. In addition to illuminating some of Cornell's lesser-known work, Hauptman's study hints at the artist's sublimated passions and helps us detect the faint scent of eroticism and morbidity surrounding his hermetically sealed boxes.

Of his own admission, he kept his homosexuality a secret that evening so he could ''watch the enemy at ease.''

You do and see what you want -- whether this means spending long hours on the wide, white-hot beaches, or bungee-jumping off some rugged cliff, or pub-crawling with the young and blond of the world or being massaged and oiled and herbally steamed -- and you do so without a single guilty thought of what else you should be doing.

Late last year, however, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled 6 to 1 that Mr. Morgenthau's subpoena of the Schiele paintings violated an Arts and Cultural Affairs Law passed in 1968 specifically to prevent the seizure of works of art on loan by non-residents to exhibitions in New York State. The goal of this law was to encourage the worldwide lending of art for museum shows without the threat of confiscation.

Revitalizing the City Opera was going to be a formidable challenge.

Ambitiously conceived by Richard Koshalek, the former director of the museum, the show is on its last stop after a two-year international tour. The breathtaking collection of models, photographs and drawings charts the course of 20th-century architecture and urbanism.

The exhibition's design lacks the pizazz of its contents (it is about as alive as a library), so it may lack the wide appeal it deserves.

us,Portraying Africa By Its Own Rules,"IN Jean-Pierre Bekolo's short film ''La Grammaire de Ma Grand-mere,'' the Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambety deploys a bit of French wordplay to explain the productive tension at the heart of his work. ''My grandmother always tells me to contradict my grammar,'' he declares. ''Grandmother'' (grand-mere) stands for African ancestral wisdom, while grammar (the homonymous ''grammaire'') refers to the rules and techniques of moviemaking, a historically Western, paradigmatically modern art form. Like other great iconoclasts of film, Mambety revolted against the conventions of the medium in order to express his faith in it. And like many African artists and intellectuals who came of age in the decades after colonial rule, he was preoccupied with the politics of autonomy and cultural self-determination. His career -- interrupted by 17 years of silence and truncated by his premature death, from lung cancer, in 1998 -- consists of a series of attempts to recast ''grammaire'' in the voice of ''grand-mere.''",2000-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Fateful Attractions,"Trouble is so much in the air in KICK IN THE HEAD (Doubleday, $22), Steven Rinehart's debut collection of short stories, that when, in the title story, one character reassures another, ''Everything's going to be fine,'' it registers as a particularly pathetic self-delusion. The speaker of the line is a college student fallen hard for a veterinarian. The trouble is that the doctor is a diabetic with a habit of neglecting her insulin shots. She's also a chronic drunken driver with a knack for plowing into people and property. She's also married to the student's film studies professor. Clearly, nothing about this arrangement will be fine. Some of the sharpest of Rinehart's stories are about men caught up in similarly inexplicable, often dangerous attractions: a Boy Scout's fascination with his unhinged tentmate; a high school teacher's obsession with a troubled student; a college dropout's love for his best friend's girlfriend. Rinehart has a talent for entering his stories in midstream, then revealing in small, unsettling ways just how badly things have already unraveled for his characters. A hitchhiker left stranded in the desert in ''Burning Luv'' seems worthy of sympathy until he reveals his previous experience with abandoning and being abandoned. Shortly thereafter, he casually produces a weapon, to chilling effect. A suburban insurance man in ''LeSabre'' seems merely inept until a calamitous Friday night exposes his own vulnerability. ''I'm not in control,'' he admits. ''I am miles behind.'' Rinehart's stories are full of such moments, offering a view into the ways a life can go wrong. Andrew Santella",2000-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,An Island World Next Door to a City,"IN the landscape, in the very atmosphere of islands, there is often a visceral feeling of apartness.

A sense that things are done differently on island turf; an attention to old customs and legacies; a respect for nature and a husbanding of natural resources. You feel it in Sardinia and in Sicily and on Patmos.

When she complained, the funeral director said this was not exactly the same funeral -- this time the casket was hand-rubbed.",2000-05-21T05:00:00+0000

On Tuesday, Ms. Dilks lost a coin toss to Mary Jane Oerhl, an incumbent, for the final seat on the nine-member board in the small Camden County town. Last month, Ms. Dilks and Ms. Oerhl tied with 177 votes for third place; three three-year seats were up in the election. According to the Pine Hill schools superintendent, Don Falato, neither woman wanted a recount, since it might cost them personally several hundred dollars, nor did they want a runoff election, which might have cost taxpayers as much as $3,000. So they settled on the coin flip. Ms. Dilks chose heads. County Superintendent Daniel Mastrobuono flipped. The coin landed on tails, and Ms. Oerhl was back on the board.

Wife of the late Franz Lissauer; mother of Emil; sister of Elaine Rush and the late Stephen Fraid; sister-in-law of Bob Rush, aunt of Hillary Rush; loving friend to Mark Trujillo and the many others whose lives were graced and enriched by her intelligence and taste; the celebratory way she decorated and dressed and her kindness and generosity.

But Carullo, who now holds the title of senior vice president for marketing and product development worldwide for Prescriptives, is obsessed with marrying technology to cosmetic needs. Her brain began churning over the question ''What can I put on my face to get it to look like that?'' It would be not a treatment, not a makeup, but a substance that would gather light and throw it back into the universe, just like the perfect, unblemished skin of the very young woman across the aisle.",2000-05-21T05:00:00+0000

With this in mind, Pamela Todd, a chronicler of domesticity, organized BLOOMSBURY AT HOME (Abrams, $27.50) ''by biography and geography.'' Todd, hoping ''to step behind the posed facade,'' has had the enviable task of poring over the letters and photographs of the celebrated aggregation of painters, writers and intellectuals and peering into what is left of their domains. She does a good job of extracting the gems -- the book glitters with wonderful quotations, images and anecdotes, like Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant's newborn daughter, Angelica, being observed by her future husband, David Garnett, while she was being weighed in a shoebox on Christmas Day, 1918. But the chapters, defined by addresses, jump around in space and time and hunger for a sense of narrative. Thus we are told, on several occasions, that Grant was Bell's longtime extramarital lover. Lacking direction, you almost lose sense of what place meant to the Bloomsberries; however, paintings, drawings and home furnishings by the group allow an understanding to emerge. Which is a good thing, since, as Garnett himself once said, ''Places explain people.'' Jillian Dunham",2000-05-21T05:00:00+0000

Yes, these camps are only for Hutus and are guarded by Tutsis, the twinned elements in the unstable ethnic atmosphere of central Africa.

Sometimes called timberdoodles, woodcocks are not the most graceful birds on the planet. Their eyes are spaced so far apart that you might wonder how they can see the trees in front of them. As the late winter days begin to lengthen, they throw caution to the wind, and at dawn and dusk the males rise straight up into the air some 200 or 300 feet and then spiral down, uttering a plaintive, musical series of notes. Although deterred by cold, they don't seem to be bothered by rain -- and that's a good thing, too, because this ''sky dancing'' is how they maintain themselves as a species.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; American Portraits,"In the early 20th century, a Seattle society photographer named Edward S. Curtis came up with a plan: to produce an illustrated encyclopedia that would document the lives of the Hopi, the Apache, the Cree and as many other North American Indian tribes as Curtis could persuade to cooperate with him. At the time, the American Indian population had become a source of curiosity rather than of fear; their numbers had dwindled to some 250,000 and were, Theodore Roosevelt wrote in 1906, ''on the point of passing away.'' In his introductory essay to EDWARD SHERIFF CURTIS, 1868-1952 (Taschen, $39.99), a handsomely produced collection of Curtis's American Indian photographs, Hans Christian Adam notes that there were many ethnographers who were not impressed with the photographer's grand ambitions. But Curtis, who possessed little formal education, had enough swaggering self-confidence and talent as a photographer to convince a few influential people that he was capable of taking on the project. Among those people were Roosevelt, who praised Curtis for doing ''what no other man could do,'' and J. Pierpont Morgan, who helped finance Curtis's research expeditions. During those travels, Curtis met members of some 80 tribes and made avid notes on everything from religious dances to eyewitness accounts of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The photographs in ''Edward Sheriff Curtis'' have been largely culled from ''The North American Indian,'' the title given to Curtis's 20 leather-bound, gilt-edged volumes, each of which was accompanied by a portfolio of photographs. Many of these sepia-toned photographs of, for instance, a Teton Sioux in a feathered headdress or a Piegan medicine man were widely reproduced in magazines and as individually sold works of art. Over the years the pictures have contributed to the popular perception of the first inhabitants of North America, depicting, Adam writes, ''Indians as they might once have been -- or, rather, as we might wish them to have been.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Human Resumes,"''Yesterday's thought was how did I get here, 31, 32, just this huge knot of unknowing and losing my hair,'' a telemarketer in one of Sam Lipsyte's stories laments before dialing to determine a stranger's satisfaction with a local salad bar. Lipsyte's first book, a collection of stories titled VENUS DRIVE (Open City, paper, $13), is made of such bleak portraits -- we meet the aching and nearly defeated, people who seek cold comfort in drug dens, peep shows and corporate cubicles. Lipsyte writes in a clipped manner that establishes distance from his fringe-dwelling characters, and he employs shots of dark humor to alleviate the loneliness that fills these pages. In ''Cremains,'' the protagonist moves into his dead mother's apartment and shoots up her leftover morphine while tending to the building's old women, offering to change their light bulbs. He even toys with the idea of mercy killings. ''The newspaper Hilda gets delivered would call me evil,'' he says. ''The one I buy on the corner would say it's more complicated than that.'' In the best story here, ''My Life, for Promotional Use Only,'' Lipsyte -- who writes about movies for the online magazine Feed -- creates a pitch-perfect parody of the new media world. It's a place where the narrator -- a former underground rock hero who thinks a skill-set is ''some kind of mail-order frying pan'' -- is a woeful anachronism among the ''human resumes'' who ''study esoteric forms of South American combat and go on all-deer diets.'' Not for the faint of heart (or soul), ''Venus Drive'' explores the complexity of despair with poignancy and sly wit. Christine Muhlke",2000-05-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Art Under The Influence,"For their millennial celebration, the people at the National Gallery in London decided to tap back into their origins. Founded in 1824 as a study collection, the museum was the sort of place where generation after generation of young artists studied at the feet of the masters, often copying masterworks virtually verbatim. But then something happened -- when was it? The 60's? The 70's? Young artists seemed to stop looking at, or at any rate copying from, the old masters. Indeed, for a time, if you came upon someone slaving away at an easel, dropcloth spread, face to face with a great predecessor there at the museum, you took him for a Sunday painter, certainly not cutting edge. Things have been changing again, though. Artists seem to be looking at prior art more intently nowadays, and in the spirit of that regard, the National Gallery and its guest curator, Richard Morphet, decided to lure 24 of the world's leading contemporary artists back into the museum's precincts, inviting each of them to choose one work and to respond with some creative work of their own. The sources the artists drew on for this ''Encounters'' show range from Duccio, in the early 14th century, through Monet, who was still alive when the oldest of the invitees, Balthus, was already copying Poussin at the Louvre. The contemporary artists, in turn, span three generations, from Balthus (b. 1908) through Francesco Clemente (b. 1952). ",2000-05-28T05:00:00+0000

us,QUICK BITE/Montclair; For the Love of Pita,"I must confess, yes, I really must. My conscience demands it. I took ''outside'' food into a movie theater. But how could I be expected to help myself? The scent of falafel wafting out the door of Beyond Pita on Church Street here on a warm spring evening was simply too, too much for me to resist. So I didn't. And while all about moviegoers me were grinding their teeth to nubs on last year's popcorn, I was delighting in my fat little pita of delectably fried ground chickpeas and mixed bits of cabbage, tomato and pickle doused with a piquantly complicated white sesame sauce. ''The falafel is my mother's recipe, and there's nothing like your mother's food,'' the owner, Nassar Allah Arsheed (his friends call him John), 30, said of the woman who taught him to cook in his boyhood days in Israel. Indeed, food is a matter of family, and religion, for Mr. Arsheed. His St. John sub (mozzarella, roasted peppers, romaine and sun-dried tomatoes) and St. Christopher sub (portobello mushrooms, mozzarella and arugula) are listed on the menu under ''Hala's Vegetarian Specials.'' ''I dedicated these to my sister, Hala,'' he said, adding that saints were involved here because ''we are Christian.'' The shop is too small for tables so diners eat outside on nearby benches or, like me, transport the treat elsewhere. Along with falafel and subs, Mr. Arsheed sells hummus (falafel's boiled and mashed cousin), baba gannouj (roasted and pur'eed eggplant) and breakfasts like cheese omelettes and eggs, any style. (''I don't push breakfast,'' Mr. Arsheed said. ''I just serve it because I'm here cooking anyway.'') ANDREA HIGBIE",2000-05-28T05:00:00+0000

The plan -- expected to cost the average taxpayer $40 a year -- is part of an effort to attract volunteers. The force has about 189 volunteers, compared with 220 in 1999. The idea, however, is not new. Yorktown, Mamaroneck and Montrose in Westchester County, Garrison and Cold Spring in Putnam County and about 20 departments in Rockland County have retirement plans for volunteer firefighters. In Peekskill, the plan will pay $1,455 toward each eligible firefighter's pension. The plan is retroactive for volunteers who have completed five years of active duty before this year.

Born in Roumania, he was, during the difficult years of war, a pillar of the Jewish community-their pride. Not allowed to practice the law he had studied, he went into the educational field. At the Moria Gaster School where he was principal, he was instrumental in establishing the ''Micul (Little) Gulliver'' Children's Theatre, writing and directing plays that brought so much to young and old. They all respected and loved him dearly for the gift he gave them when they needed a smile on their sad faces. He left for Israel in 1949, where his talent as a playwright and stage director was appreciated when he joined the Li-La-Lo and Do-Re-Mi Theatres. He also published his poetry in the Roumanian newspaper ''Viata Noastra.'' They were pearls of wisdom. In 1967, he came to the United States. His love for books made him choose the career of editor with the Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Division Academic Press, publisher of scientific books, where he worked for 20 years. He was a remarkable human being. His wit, his humor, his sensibility, his integrity, his modesty were unique.

Now Martin Bernier, a partner in Food Attitude, a wholesale bakery based on Long Island, has set up weddingcakeonline.com. Mr. Bernier and his partners, who include a former pastry chef at Le Bernardin, streamlined the process to keep the prices reasonable, at $4 or $6 a portion. Their showroom, at 235 East 25th Street, displays more than a dozen designs. Couples can choose the type of icing and its color: only roses are available for decoration. But what really distinguishes the cakes are the flavors and fillings: they are delicious, with combinations like vanilla-almond meringue with cassis cream and chocolate ganache or chocolate dacquoise with hazelnut cream. The cakes can be ordered with a week's notice. Visits to the showroom are by appointment only: (212) 686-4644.",2000-05-31T05:00:00+0000
