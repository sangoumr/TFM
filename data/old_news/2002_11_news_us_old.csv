Mary Tuttle Redus Johnson Kapnick of Naples, Florida, and Wilmette, Illinois, passed away on Sunday, October 20, 2002, at Naples Community Hospital. She was 76 years old. Mrs. Kapnick was born March 29, 1926, in St. Louis, Missouri, daughter of Hal Edward Redus and Margaret Bundy Redus, and was raised in Centralia, Illinois. She received a BA degree from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, majoring in mathematics, with a minor in Greek, and enjoyed her legacy as a third generation member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Mary moved to Chicago after college and worked at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank. She married Lloyd Byron Johnson, who died of cancer in 1962. She subsequently married Harvey E. Kapnick, Jr. and lived in Shaker Heights, Ohio, until moving to Winnetka, Illinois in 1970 after Mr. Kapnick's election as Chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co. Mrs. Kapnick was a pillar of support throughout Mr. Kapnick's long and distinguished business career. Mrs. Kapnick also devoted her energy to numerous civic and community organizations, serving as President of the Women's Board of the Hadley School for the Blind in Winnetka; as a Trustee of the organization now known as the Music Institute of Chicago; and as a member of the President's Council of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. In recent years, Mr. and Mrs. Kapnick divided their time between their homes in Wilmette, Illinois, and Naples, Florida. Mrs. Kapnick's greatest legacy, and primary focus throughout her life, was her devotion to her family. She created a loving environment for all her children and grandchildren, and maintained close relationships with the extended family. Her passing leaves a void in the hearts of all who knew her, which can never be replaced. Mrs. Kapnick was preceded in death by her husband Harvey only two months ago, shortly after celebrating their thirty-ninth anniversary, and her brother Robert Bundy Redus two years earlier. She is survived by three sons: David in San Francisco, Richard B. in Winnetka, and Scott in New York City, and eight grandchildren.

Deutsche Asset Management, which owns about 28 percent of Harvey Nichols, said it planned to vote against Mr. Poon's offer of 2.50 ($3.91) a share, because it was too low. Dickson Concepts owns 50 percent of Harvey Nichols, and Mr. Poon needs the approval of shareholders holding two-thirds of the stock. One option open to Mr. Poon is to restructure the transaction. He could first offer to buy the remaining 50 percent of the shares he does not already own. Once they are in his possession, he could then take the company private. Such a structure would require a lower threshold of shareholder approval. After buying Harvey Nichols in 1991, Mr. Poon engineered a turnaround before selling shares to the public in 1996 for 2.70 ($4.22). More recently, sales and profits have been disappointing. Harvey Nichols said on Friday that profit for the six months ended Sept. 28 fell 35 percent, to 3 million ($4.7 million). Suzanne Kapner (NYT)",2002-11-02T05:00:00+0000

For example, if a character got beat up in Scene 98, on every scene after 98 I make a note that he should be bloody and battered. It seems obvious, but in the midst of shooting, obvious things can get completely overlooked. If I have anything I want to remember, I write it on the back of the script pages. On this film I was using different colored ink for each take, so that when Spike said, 'O.K., I want to match to Take 2,' I could go back and see all the notes that pertained to Take 2. I also Polaroid the heck out of everything. Food causes lots of continuity problems. You Polaroid what's on a character's plate -- not only how much food but what direction are the carrots facing. I take pictures of actors at the end of each scene for their wardrobe, the specifics that could get lost, like jewelry going on the wrong hand or how far up somebody's shirt is buttoned. This movie was shot over seven weeks, but it's supposed to take place in the span of one day. And one character had facial hair that had to get longer throughout the day.

us,How to ... Hide Profits,"''The studios have evolved the definition for 'profit' so that they get back all, or as much as possible, of their investment before they share a dollar. One way is by claiming lots of distribution expenses that are chargeable against the revenues of a film. On top of that, each studio charges from 15 to 50 percent of the film's revenues as a distribution fee that comes right off the top and often has no basis in cash outlays. Studios also report only one-fifth of what they get from video sales to profit participants. It goes back to an old agreement when studios used to contract with third parties to make and distribute home videos. Now each studio has its own home video arm -- but they've kept the old agreement. Foreign taxes also come up on every audit. Studios are allowed to deduct taxes withheld by overseas distributors, even though they get a one-to-one credit for those taxes from the U.S. government. Then there are trade dues. For studios, trade dues are generally the fees they pay to the Motion Picture Association of America, mostly to fight piracy all over the world -- nothing to do with the costs of any individual film, but some portion of those fees still gets charged against revenues. Vertical integration is probably the most contentious subject. When, for example, Fox movie studios sells the TV rights for a movie to Fox TV network, do they get the best price they could, or are they selling for less to help build a corporate entity? You never really know because at every step, the same company is involved.''",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

They're also more comfortable if sexualized situations are more played for laughs than for realism -- if you're going to have a condom in a film, it's better to have it stuck to someone's foot than used as a birth-control device. And I've discovered that it really helps if the guy makes the first move in a sexual encounter. The M.P.A.A. will steer you that way, but they don't get into deep philosophical debates. And it doesn't help to refer to other movies that have gotten away with what you're trying to get away with, because they just come back with, 'Well, we probably made a mistake with that film and it should have gotten an R.'

I focus on no mitigation. I focus on stock options running through the full term. And if I can't get those things, I will often recommend to my client: Don't take the job. Because firing is very common, even if you do a good job. The company gets sold. Someone has to take a fall for something not going well. Or maybe you didn't do a great job -- but you took a hell of a risk, and you should be paid for that risk. Even if you have another job, your reputation's been hurt, you've changed your life, you've taken all this pressure, and to walk away with nothing because you got another job, it puts a premium on the guy who is willing to go sit on the beach and drink martinis and not get another job.''",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief : Nonfiction," ''Winston Churchill's reputation is at a peak,'' the historian John Lukacs writes in CHURCHILL: Visionary, Statesman, Historian (Yale University, $21.95), in which he says he sets out not to write a biography or a scholarly study, but to ''suggest some subjects that have not yet been fully explored'' -- as if such a thing were possible. Both Lukacs's book and John Keegan's WINSTON CHURCHILL (Lipper/Viking, $19.95) focus on the complexity of Churchill's character and thinking. Lukacs looks at Churchill's tangled relations with Stalin, Roosevelt and Eisenhower, at his failures, his critics, his funeral. Of the two books, his is the more Churchillian, and the more suggestive of the breadth and contradictions of the man. Keegan's is an excellent brief biography, but it suffers, as many biographies of Churchill do, from the constant, oceanic tug of his subject's long and multitudinous life against the brief span of time in which his greatness and importance shone. Keegan, primarily a military historian, has written a biography of Churchill the soldier and warrior chief, a book whose detail is most often military in nature (although we do learn in passing that Churchill, before he married Clementine, courted Ethel Barrymore). Both writers fix Churchill's greatness upon his singular role in 1940. He had many failures, Lukacs says, made many mistakes; ''then in 1940 he was the man who did not lose the Second World War.'' Without his determination, his conviction, his restless energy and relentless will, Keegan writes, ''the harvest of victory would not have been brought in.'' DAVID WALTON ",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000
us,How to ... Get a Writer to Change His Script,"''There are basically four ways producers get you to change something. The first is that they just won't turn it in to the studio. Of course, they never say it like that. They'll say, 'We just want it to be as good as possible when we turn it in.' But they mean that they won't turn it in without the changes, and because you get paid for delivering a final draft, you won't be paid until you make the changes. The second is they fire you. The third is they overwhelm you with such breathtakingly stupid suggestions that you begin to doubt your own judgment. You think, God, is it possible I'm the one not getting this? I call it the Ward 6 syndrome, after the Chekhov short story where the protagonist in the asylum is so sincere that his doctor begins to believe it's not the patient but really his own view of the world that's crazy. Finally, when they find out that you've fallen in love with the story, they can endlessly manipulate you. They know you think it's important that this actually get seen by the public.

Mary Tuttle Redus Johnson Kapnick of Naples, Florida, and Wilmette, Illinois, passed away on Sunday, October 20, 2002, at Naples Community Hospital. She was 76 years old. Mrs. Kapnick was born March 29, 1926, in St. Louis, Missouri, daughter of Hal Edward Redus and Margaret Bundy Redus, and was raised in Centralia, Illinois. She received a BA degree from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, majoring in mathematics, with a minor in Greek, and enjoyed her legacy as a third generation member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. Mary moved to Chicago after college and worked at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank. She married Lloyd Byron Johnson, who died of cancer in 1962. She subsequently married Harvey E. Kapnick, Jr. and lived in Shaker Heights, Ohio, until moving to Winnetka, Illinois in 1970 after Mr. Kapnick's election as Chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co. Mrs. Kapnick was a pillar of support throughout Mr. Kapnick's long and distinguished business career. Mrs. Kapnick also devoted her energy to numerous civic and community organizations, serving as President of the Women's Board of the Hadley School for the Blind in Winnetka; as a Trustee of the organization now known as the Music Institute of Chicago; and as a member of the President's Council of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. In recent years, Mr. and Mrs. Kapnick divided their time between their homes in Wilmette, Illinois, and Naples, Florida. Mrs. Kapnick's greatest legacy, and primary focus throughout her life, was her devotion to her family. She created a loving environment for all her children and grandchildren, and maintained close relationships with the extended family. Her passing leaves a void in the hearts of all who knew her, which can never be replaced. Mrs. Kapnick was preceded in death by her husband Harvey only two months ago, shortly after celebrating their thirty-ninth anniversary, and her brother Robert Bundy Redus two years earlier.

The lights on the tower were removed because it is being repainted. When the New York tower has its turn, it too will go dark. The towers and the rest of the bridge are being stripped for the first time of layers of paint that have accumulated since the bridge opened in 1931. The color will remain gray, and the $54 million job, to be done by 2005, is expected to last 25 years. The paint job, the most extensive that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has ever undertaken on any of its bridges, will take 35,000 gallons to cover the 2.5 million square feet of the 604-foot towers and 200-foot pillars underneath. The Jersey tower is to be finished by the end of 2003, and then the lights return. ''We had a choice to turn all the lights off, but half of something is better than nothing,'' said Jerry Del Tufo, physical plant manager of the George. ''We really view the lights as a gift to the region.'' The halide fixtures, which light up the towers like crystal, were added in mid-2000.

According to the National Wildlife Health Center, there have been no previous reports of a seal dying from West Nile virus.

Printing scripts on colored paper is big because most copy machines can't pick up words on a dark background. We watermarked the scripts, which basically means putting a big racing stripe diagonally through all the pages, and the mark has the name of whomever the script was given to, so if it's copied there's no doubt who did it. We often give the script a fake title when it's in production because we don't want people reading it. I know 'Last Action Hero' with Arnold Schwarzenegger was initially called 'Extremely Violent.' Basically, anything you're doing in Hollywood is better if fewer people know about it -- until you want everyone to know about it.

Conduct an Interview While Someone's Talking in Your Ear,"''If the interview is live, with someone in the studio, you basically listen to the interviewee with one ear and the control room with the other. The difficulty is if you're in Washington and the interviewee is, say, in London. Then the control room and the interviewee come in over the same line, so often you hear people speaking at the same time, and then you're just winging it. It's like speed reading: you basically just pick out a couple of key words, follow up on those and hope you guessed right. But usually, you're not getting that much substantive stuff in the earpiece. Mostly what you get is time cues. On the air, time flies. Let's say you've plotted out a 12-minute interview and you have six baskets of questions. Almost always you're in your second basket and 7 minutes have gone. Then you have to do triage. Which one's going to go? What's most important? And you have to do that while you're still listening to the person you're interviewing.''",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

Once the script was finished, the company had to sign off on every mention of the product in the episode to make sure that it didn't disparage the brand. We did request one change: in the original script, Kramer goes to the doctor and offers him some Junior Mints; the doctor refuses, saying something like, 'Those things will kill you.' We said we couldn't sign off on that. The writers changed it, and in the final draft, when Kramer offers the doctor some mints, he replies, 'Oh, yes, those are so refreshing.' Big difference.

Both Lukacs's book and John Keegan's WINSTON CHURCHILL (Lipper/Viking, $19.95) focus on the complexity of Churchill's character and thinking. Lukacs looks at Churchill's tangled relations with Stalin, Roosevelt and Eisenhower, at his failures, his critics, his funeral. Of the two books, his is the more Churchillian, and the more suggestive of the breadth and contradictions of the man. Keegan's is an excellent brief biography, but it suffers, as many biographies of Churchill do, from the constant, oceanic tug of his subject's long and multitudinous life against the brief span of time in which his greatness and importance shone. Keegan, primarily a military historian, has written a biography of Churchill the soldier and warrior chief, a book whose detail is most often military in nature (although we do learn in passing that Churchill, before he married Clementine, courted Ethel Barrymore). Both writers fix Churchill's greatness upon his singular role in 1940. He had many failures, Lukacs says, made many mistakes; ''then in 1940 he was the man who did not lose the Second World War.'' Without his determination, his conviction, his restless energy and relentless will, Keegan writes, ''the harvest of victory would not have been brought in.'' David Walton",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,How to ... Shoot a Nude Scene,"''Once an actress agrees to take a role that involves nudity, the Screen Actors Guild requires that the producers have her sign a nudity waiver as part of her contract. These negotiations are very specific: what body parts will be visible, if there will be nipples or pubic hair visible, if there will be touching or kissing of the nipples. I schedule these scenes for about six weeks into the production schedule, so the actress can begin to trust me and her co-stars. But you don't want it to be too near the end either, or it's hanging over your head like an operation. During preproduction and rehearsal, I show all the actors detailed storyboards of what will be shot. You go over it and over it and over it. And you have to be very blunt and gross with your language, because nothing should be a surprise on the set. But I honestly feel that if you can't do it yourself, then you cannot ask the actors to do it. When I did 'Starship Troopers,' the cast was balking about going through with a group shower scene. So I took off all my clothes. And my director of photography did also. It worked, because everybody started laughing, and then they got naked. And we didn't hear anymore complaints.''",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,How to ... Shoot in the Middle of Times Square,"''We had to close off 20 blocks - 20 blocks! No cars, no pedestrians, no public transportation. It had never been done before in Times Square. The shot I wanted is in the beginning of 'Vanilla Sky,' and it was the nightmare of a guy who is desperately lonely -- can you think of a more vivid nightmare for a guy who wants to be surrounded by people than to be alone in Times Square? Paula Wagner and Tom Cruise, two of the producers, had many conversations with the film commission and the mayor's office and the Police Department, and then I was brought in. We started rehearsing the shot in every way in side streets uptown, where we were already shooting. We even went into the middle of Times Square when it was filled with people with Tom in a baseball cap and rehearsed on a digital, hand-held camera with a ladder. Then we got the word: 'We are going to give you four hours, from 4:30 to 8:30 on a Sunday morning early in November. Work quickly. You won't get one second longer.' The morning we shot, there were about 200 people on the side streets helping block them off, and they had coffee and food to offer thwarted passers-by. As soon as the first speck of daylight appeared we did seven takes of the crane shot looking down at Tom. Then it was like 10 after 5, so Tom just ran the full extent of Times Square for about three hours while we shot him. By the end of it, people had started to stream into Times Square, and they were cheering for us. It was amazing. I actually think it would be easy to shoot in Times Square during rush hour too. And I could stand around like an old pro and say, 'I remember when we did this empty.' '' Continued on Page 32",2002-11-03T05:00:00+0000

Wolfe, said they were still in discussion with individuals and organizations that might allow the production to continue through the end of the year. To do that, the show needs $300,000. The producers said they would post another provisional closing notice today in the event that the money to keep the show open does not come through by next Sunday's evening performance.

Sales fell 1.2 percent, sending the shares down as much as 8.8 percent. Net income rose to $92.9 million, or 54 cents a diluted share, from $68.2 million, or 40 cents a diluted share, in the period a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Sales in the period ended Sept. 27 dropped to $2.73 billion, less than analysts had forecast, because of falling demand from banks and other financial services companies. Computer Sciences pared spending as corporate customers slowed purchases of add-on business to existing contracts. The company said it trimmed payroll, travel, real estate and training costs. After cutting 2,000 jobs last year and about 1,000 since August, the company further limited costs by reducing office space by 400,000 square feet, officials said on a conference call. Third-quarter profit will be less than forecast, they said. ''The tight third quarter reflects sluggishness in signing new contracts, timing of longer-term outsourcing business and a lack of a rebound in shorter-term business,'' said David Grossman, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners who rates the stock ''buy'' and does not own the shares.

If the judge, Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court in Washington, grants the delay, the restrictions would go into effect in May 2004, not August 2003. Judge Kessler ordered the restrictions last year after the same environmental groups filed a lawsuit contending that the stocks of cod and other fish were not replenishing fast enough.

A woman of many facets and accomplishments - geologist, wife, musician, sister, petroleum executive, aunt and benefactor, died peacefully on Wednesday, November 6th in Manhattan with her husband Peter A. Cheney at her side following a decadelong encounter with breast and lung cancer. Marijayne, known as ''Bitzie'' to her friends and family, characteristically approached that struggle with the tenacity, intelligence and generosity of spirit that defined her character and explained her many personal and professional successes. Marijayne was born on December 16, 1939 in Elizabeth, NJ to David P. and Margaret F. Zior, a decorated police lieutenant and early childhood education pioneer. With a Bachelor's degree in geology from St. Louis University and a Master's degree in business administration from New York University, Marijayne worked with the U.S. Department of Labor and held executive positions in the Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company and the Caltex Petroleum Corporation. More recently, she pursued select investing and consulting opportunities. She was a gifted musician who enjoyed the piano and skillfully taught the art to others including any youngsters underfoot. She was a co-op board president who successfully navigated a major building through financial peril, keeping her humor intact. She was a generous but quiet benefactor to many charities, particularly those supporting education and helping children and women in need. Her customary place was behind the scenes, lending support when it was needed most and when others might demur. More publicly, she was a sponsor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and remained active in numerous organizations, including Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Lotos Club. Marijayne took great satisfaction in family. In addition to her husband Peter of Manhattan, her sister, Dr. Diane Zior Wilhelm of Pine Beach, NJ, and her nephew and his wife, Daniel F. Wilhelm and Courtney O'Malley Wilhelm of Manhattan, were witnesses to Marijayne's countless acts of selflessness and steadfast dedication to helping others improve themselves and their lives. Her impact was felt profoundly by many who were forever changed by the experience. In recent years, her greatest joy was lavishing love on her grand-nephew, Teddy, and grand-niece, Alexandra. She introduced them to the sublime thrills of New York and bestowed on them a lifetime of affection and memories. Her loss is irreparable and we will miss her terribly. A viewing will be held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Ave. (at E. 81 St.) in Manhattan, on Sunday, November 10th, from 2-5 and 7-9PM. A funeral service will follow on Monday, November 11th, at 11:30AM, also at Frank E. Campbell. Interment will follow at a later date at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

A writing teacher at the University of Pittsburgh and the author of two short-story collections, Walton does a remarkable job of keeping his prose refreshingly free of bells, whistles and M.F.A.-program sterility while maintaining real emotional tension throughout. On the surface, ''Ride'' is as dull as your morning commute. But the protagonist's deep inner logic skews the proceedings just enough to reveal the surreal lurking within our workaday lives. A divorced former academic, Ray Maddas, now makes a living by teaching the mentally impaired how to ride the bus around Pittsburgh. As he accompanies them to and fro, he has plenty of time to reflect on his failed ambitions and troll for articles of interest in The New York Review of Books. He tells an ex-colleague now in a more ''famed repudiation of academic life'' -- advertising -- This bus work, bus teaching I think I've told you about that, don't remember when the last time I talked to you, actually it's a form of minimalism.'' Slender enough to fit in your coat pocket, Walton's book is an entirely new kind of road novel -- the literature",2002-11-10T05:00:00+0000

Her cheeks are doughy with adversity and time, but her hazel eyes are clear. Dusk is falling outside in the Voorhout, and in the dim, candle-lit velvet cavern of the presence chamber her face, breast and hands shine dimly pale against the black behind her and the black of her dress. Of the tall man standing before her, clad in scholars black broadcloth, nothing can be seen but the chaste, starched-linen gleam of his collar and cuffs. The hand which holds his black beaver hat is invisible: as she peers into the gloom, she can barely discern his face, let alone his expression. Only a sudden liquid shifting in the gloom makes her realize, with a sudden qualm, that she has been staring straight into his eyes. She turns her head away, settling the black silk scarf around her shoulders against the creeping chill of the Dutch winter, adjusting her rings. ",2002-11-10T05:00:00+0000

But nothing was as soothing as the regular dinners my parents held at our house. My sister and I would watch through the stair rails as my glamorous parents and their friends drank cocktails, listened to Sinatra and sat down to dinner. Happy chatter wafted upstairs on the heels of the fragrances of whatever was being served. My parents didn't call it a supper club, but that's essentially what it was. The food was simple -- lamb chops or steaks. My mother did the cooking (with some help).

''All of the family's possessions, all the furniture,'' Crewdson explains, ''had been left there untouched, like a kind of museum or tomb.''

CBS still ruled the ratings in the mid-1970s, but executives at RCA, which owned NBC, had high hopes for the network's aggressive and competitive new president, Herbert Schlosser, a onetime Wall Street lawyer who took over in 1974.

In studio movies, most Americans seem to live in sprawling, Spielbergian suburbs, frozen in an idyllic upper middle class existence, where the rows of identical split level houses suggest that there are no real differences in income, and indeed, no real underclass to escape from and no elite class to which to aspire.",2002-11-10T05:00:00+0000

But the vision of the wide and bending river flowing to the sea was full of hope and promise to the Tsar of landlocked Russia, riding at the head of his scouting troops. As they approached the coast he dismounted from his horse. With his bayonet he cut two strips of peat and arranged them in a cross on the marshy ground. Then Peter said: `Here shall be a town.'

Will was a man of many facets and of great accomplishment. He is remembered throughout the world by so many whose lives he touched personally and professionally. He was a scientist with a brilliant mind and a father, lover and friend with a gentle soul and generous heart. Will invented a pioneering and iconoclastic approach to enable people to experience joy and discover and live their potential. He was also a simple man, in his own words a Jew boy from Chicago. He is remembered by those closest to him as he consumed hotdogs and garlic fries with mustard stained hands gripping a scorecard, not once taking his eyes off the team he loved for so long. He lived for handball, to rhythmically move his body to the Benny Goodman orchestra, for openness and for choice, and to bring his work on FIRO, Encounter and The Human Element to people throughout the United States and the world. Beyond his immediate family so many people remember him for a life changing experience in encounter at Esalen, in time spent with him in a workshop in organizations all over the world, and through teaching and learning his transforming Human Element approach to individual, team and organization development. His comical expressions and insightful humor were always a reminder of life's joy and surprises. He was born in Chicago on December 19, 1925. He served on the faculties of Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Antioch University San Francisco, the University of Chicago, Einstein Medical School and others. During his time in the Navy, he developed the FIRO-B questionnaire, which is internationally known as one of the most widely used instruments in the field. In his life, Will wrote eight books including the best selling ''Joy'' in 1967, ''Here Comes Everybody'' in 1971, ''Profound Simplicity'' in 1979, ''The Truth Option'' in 1984, and ''The Human Element'' in 1994.

In 1972, Mr. Neaman began to focus his considerable managerial and inspirational talents on the ATS and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He became legendary for his uncommon wisdom and enormous courage. In addition to serving as ATS national president in 1977, and vice chairman of the national Board of Directors from 1989 through 1998, he was an important presence on the major committees of the national organization, and his leadership in the 1970s and 1980s created a strong base for ATS current success. A dynamic leader and valuable mentor, he also served on the boards of the ATS New York Metropolitan and Western Regions and the San Diego Chapter. He served continuously from 1973 on the Technion International Board of Governors and in 1992 became the first American to be appointed to the position of deputy chair. He was a founding member of the Technion Guardians, a group representing the highest level of support to the university. A man of vision and a believer in applied technology and in people as vital resources, Mr. Neaman in 1973 founded the Technion's Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology, which developed under his wise stewardship as chairman into a world-class think tank. Mr. Neaman was recognized for his dignified and devoted service and dedication to the ATS, Technion and Israel with the ATS Albert Einstein Award, a Technion Honorary Doctorate and the Technion Medal, the highest honors bestowed by these institutions.

A pioneer in the development of many national, state, and community organizations, died on November 14, 2002 at Overlook Hospital in Summit, New Jersey after a short illness. He was 91 years old. Born in New York City, Mr. Kemmerer lived most of his life in Short Hills, New Jersey. After graduating from Princeton University in 1933 with a B.S. in Geology, he then entered the University of Utah earning a Masters degree. As Chairman and Chief Executive of the Kemmerer Coal Company, headquartered in New York City, he expanded a family coal mining business to be one of the most successful in the West, with the largest open pit coal mine in the world. Mines were located primarily in Kemmerer, a small proud town in southwestern Wyoming, established in 1897 by his grandfather and Patrick Quealy. Kemmerer is also the home of J.C. Penny's first store, opened in 1902. Mr. Kemmerer established a Foundation for the benefit of the Town after the family sold its business to Gulf Oil in 1981. In 1992 he created a scholarship endowment for the top graduates from the Kemmerer/ Diamondville/Cokeville area high schools to attend the University of Wyoming. This unique scholarship covers tuition and all expenses. The family has sustained its ties to Wyoming with the ownership of the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Jackson and the CM Guest Ranch in Dubois. John was a World War II veteran and Chairman of many coal and financial organizations. He remained active in his family's business affairs and was a daily presence at its offices in Chatham, NJ up until the time of his death. John lost his beloved wife, Mary Liz, in July of this year after 63 years of marriage. He is survived by three children: Connie Kemmerer, Betty Gray and Jay Kemmerer and six grandchildren.

Mr. Bowden, who had access to the communications between pilots, describes how the bombardier locates the truck caravan, and with her laser guidance system directs a 500-pound bomb into the lead truck. As the caravan is vaporized, the F-15 pilot shouts down at the Taliban -- as if they could hear him from 20,000 feet -- ''You have just been killed by a girl.''",2002-11-17T05:00:00+0000

Amy Cradic, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said last week that no schedule had been set for the removal, pending a possible appeal of the judge's decision, which followed almost four years of legal wrangling.

us,"The Sun, the Mud, the Sodium","Photography tricks memory, at times so subtly we can lament losing what was never ours. In SALT LAKE (Steidl/D.A.P., $65), the emotional resonance of 57 pictures Boris Mikhailov shot near the Ukrainian town of Slavyansk on the Donets River in 1986 springs from that sleight of mind. The ''lake'' is an industrial discharge sump. ''Salt'' means alkalis, sodium compounds mined in the Donets basin. Traditionally, these salts have drawn health pilgrimages to the neighborhood for mud baths, so workers in this Black Sea rust belt find balm in the effluent from factories processing the sodium. Mikhailov follows families on a hot day, stripping to trunks and bikinis on mud banks among smokestacks, gas tanks, power-line pylons and railroad sidings; sunbathing in trash lots; and frolicking in a lagoon where foaming sodium waste flows from broken concrete ducts. Mikhailov's father was born nearby, and he cares for these plain people the way Caravaggio loved those he painted. His eye is above them, in front or behind them, even in the water; but he disappears: he edits the prints laid down here on oversize sheets of Russian paper like a movie director, and few faces in them look alert to the camera. The publisher has supplied a one-page afterword, but Mikhailov writes nothing; we make up stories as we turn the unnumbered pages, not about joy among these revelers but their satisfaction with defying a hard history and a monstrous state. But now the Soviet Union is dead, along with three centuries of Russian stranglehold on Ukraine. The era captured here is as distant as Pompeii -- a recognition that leaves us bereft. And that feeling is Mikhailov's tribute. D. J. R. Bruckner",2002-11-17T05:00:00+0000

Hoffman's is to doughnuts what Peter Luger's is to steak: a mecca, a throwback and an out-of-the-way spot to enjoy something really good. Thirty-eight years ago, Carl Hoffman bought this doughnut shop from the Grimm family. Before he died, he passed the business on to his son Clint, better known as Red, who now works with his son, Mark. Not too much has changed. Frying begins at 4:30 a.m. Choices include the knot cruller (65 cents); the cinnamon sugar-dusted jelly stick (90 cents); the coffee roll, a yeast bread studded with raisins, laced with cinnamon and deep fried (85 cents); and apple or strawberry turnovers (90 cents, available only on Fridays and Saturdays). There are also glazed doughnuts, stacked on stainless steel pegs attached to a revolving door that swings out from the bakery where Clint has just dunked them into the glazing pot. The bakery opens at 6 a.m. and is theoretically open until 12:30 p.m., but when the doughnuts are gone, the front door is locked. Beverly Savage",2002-11-17T05:00:00+0000

Now, until turning 18, a driver is restricted on night driving and on who can be in the car. In addition, in some instances a fully licensed driver is required to be a passenger. According to Derrick Stokes, a spokesman for the state Division of Motor Vehicles, the N.T.S.B. said at a National Safety Council conference earlier this month that all states should adopt a system similar to New Jersey's, which includes all the provisions the board thinks are needed to help reduce accidents and fatalities caused by young drivers.

The almost simultaneous birth of the modern idea of ''social science'' contributed additional tools to the historical enterprise and reinforced the growing belief that history could take its place alongside the laboratory sciences as an objective search for truth.

The suspects, Louis Tellone, 45; his nephew, Christopher Wheeler, 24; and Kenneth Zorns, 20, were arrested late Saturday after the death of Michael Sokolov, who was believed to be in his 70's. Investigators think Mr. Tellone, who had worked part time in the plumbing store, Mount Royale Service, drove the other men to Mr. Sokolov's home in Woodlawn, the police said. He waited in the car while they went in to steal keys to the store, where they believed money was kept in a safe, said Deputy Inspector Leonard Roppa. But they did not enter the store. The cause of death has not been determined, said Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office. Al Baker (NYT) ",2002-11-18T05:00:00+0000

Two years after rumors of its existence set the high-tech world abuzz, the Segway Human Transporter has gone on sale for $4,950 on Amazon.com, the companies said. Deliveries start in March, first come first served. The Human Transporter is a self-balancing two-wheeled vehicle that looks like an old-fashioned push-type lawnmower updated for the 21st century. Kept upright by a series of computer controlled gyroscopes, the device is compact enough to be driven on sidewalks. Segway believes it has enough manufacturing capacity to meet demand because the company relies on standard industry components from suppliers like Michelin and Delphi. However, the only promise now on shipments is that delivery will be made by August. The move puts consumers closer to stepping on the electric-powered scooters, but a variety of hurdles remain to gaining mainstream acceptance, including the vehicle's hefty price tag and a tangle of state legal restrictions.

About 200 of the cuts will be made in Dayton, Ohio, where the company is based, said Jeff Dafler, a spokesman. Workers were notified of the decision yesterday, he said. Sales of retail checkout and teller machines are faltering as corporate customers reduce spending amid slower economic growth. Cost-cutting helped NCR swing to a profit of $41 million in the third-quarter from a year-earlier loss. Sales dropped 4.5 percent, to $1.38 billion, the fifth straight quarterly decline.

The company, based in Kyoto, will sell the GameCube device, called ''Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Player,'' in March in Japan, and in May in the United States, the company said in a statement. The recommended price for the device in Japan will be 5,000 yen, or $41. Nintendo said it expected that the device would increase sales of the GameCube during the year-end shopping season. The company last month said sales of the console and Game Boy Advance would lag its forecasts as demand weakens in Japan and Europe. The device is unlikely to drive console sales, some analysts said. On Oct. 1, Nintendo cut its forecast for GameCube console sales in the year ending March 31 to 10 million units from 12 million units forecast in May. Sales of the Game Boy Advance player will reach only 15 million units for the period, compared with 19 million units estimated earlier, the company said.

Mr. Sherman played three Beethoven sonatas and the elaborate ''Eroica'' Variations on Friday night. This was part of the Rock Hotel Pianofest series.

A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken just before the midterm election found that only 31 percent of voters knew what the Democrats stood for.

Indeed, my Korean translator, a former cook in the Korean Army, waxed eloquent to me about how his unit, once stationed near here, captured a wild boar that had lost a leg to a DMZ land mine.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; What to Eat on Tuesdays,"The logic at work in Yoko Tawada's fiction is the logic of dreams. Some of the stories in WHERE EUROPE BEGINS (New Directions, $23.95), her second collection published in English, begin in an identifiable world and drift into an unrecognizable one: in ''The Bath,'' a young interpreter falls ill in a hotel bathroom only to attract the aid of a dead female hotel attendant -- a disfigured suicide victim -- who steals the interpreter's tongue and spirits her away to an abandoned, rat-infested apartment. Others avoid the known world altogether: ''Raisin Eyes'' begins, ''On Tuesdays I like to eat my father. He tastes of venison. Bread dough is what he's made of. I know he's really a woman.'' Born in Japan, Tawada has lived in Germany since she was 22, and writes in both countries' languages; eight of these works are translated from the German by Susan Bernofsky, two from the Japanese by Yumi Selden. At the center of many of her narratives is a young woman straddling two cultures, unsure which to call her own. ''I once read that the soul cannot fly as fast as an airplane,'' the narrator of ''Storytellers Without Souls'' recounts. ''I flew back and forth so many times I no longer know where my soul is.'' Several tales deal with dismemberment; characters lose not only their tongues but also ears and fingers. The butchery seems a literal representation of the more abstract condition of being torn from one culture and transplanted into another. Tawada's stories shift between the transparent and the opaque, even on the same page; they agitate the mind like songs half remembered or treasure boxes whose keys are locked within.

us,'The Cave'," The man driving the truck is called Cipriano Algor, he is a potter by profession and is sixty-four years old, although he certainly does not look his age. The man sitting beside him is his son-in-law, Marcal Gacho, and he is not yet thirty. Nevertheless, from his face too, you would think him much younger. As you will have noticed, attached to their first names both these men have unusual family names, whose origin, meaning, and reason they do not know. They would probably be most put out to learn that ""algor"" means the intense cold one feels in one's body before a fever sets in, and that ""gacho"" is neither more nor less than the part of an ox's neck on which the yoke rests. The younger man is wearing a uniform, but is unarmed. The older man has on an ordinary jacket and a pair of more or less matching trousers, and his shirt is soberly buttoned up to the neck, with no tie. The hands grasping the wheel are large and strong, peasant's hands, and yet, perhaps because of the daily contact with soft clay inevitable in his profession, they also suggest sensitivity. There is nothing unusual about Marcal Gacho's right hand, but there is a scar on the back of his left hand that looks like the mark left by a burn, a diagonal line that goes from the base of his thumb to the base of his little finger. The truck does not really deserve the name of truck, since it is really only a medium-sized van, of a kind now out of date, and it is laden with crockery. When the two men left home, twenty kilometers back, the day had barely begun to dawn, but now the morning has filled the world with sufficient light for one to notice Marcal Gacho's scar and to speculate about the sensitivity of Cipriano Algor's hands. The two men are traveling slowly because of the fragile nature of the load and also because of the uneven road surface. The delivery of merchandise not considered to be of primary or even secondary importance, as is the case with plain ordinary crockery, is carried out, in accordance with the official timetables, at mid-morning, and the only reason these two men got up so early is that Marcal Gacho has to clock in at least half an hour before the doors of the Center open to the public. On the days when he does not have to give his son-in-law a lift but still has crockery to deliver, Cipriano Algor does not have to get up quite so early. However, every ten days, he is the one who goes to fetch Marcal Gacho from work so that the latter can spend the forty hours with his family to which he is entitled, and, afterward, Cipriano Algor is also the one who, with or without crockery in the back of the van, punctually returns him to his responsibilities and duties as a security guard. Cipriano Algor's daughter, who is called Marta and bears the family names of Isasca, from her late mother, and Algor, from her father, only enjoys the presence of her husband at home and in bed for six nights and three days every month. On the previous night, she became pregnant, although she does not know this yet. ",2002-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Over six days, as cracks amidships lengthened, more than 2.5 million gallons of oil leaked from the Bahamas-registered Prestige before it finally split in two and sank 100 miles offshore on Tuesday. Debate intensified in Europe over accelerating what is a decade-plus process of phasing out tankers with unlined hulls, like that of the 26-year-old Prestige. The ship -- owned, managed, chartered and registered in four different countries -- had passed inspections earlier in the year. But officials and environmentalists said that single-layer hulls, particularly those over a quarter-century old, lack sufficient strength to carry oil safely. For the moment, there were no signs that the 17-million gallons of oil inside the bow and stern sections, which sank two miles to the sea bed, was headed to the surface. Experts said chilly temperatures at that depth probably gave the oil the consistency of chewing gum. ANDREW C. REVKIN",2002-11-24T05:00:00+0000

us,'Off to the Side'," Norma Olivia Walgren met Winfield Sprague Harrison in 1933 at the River Gardens, a dance hall just north of Big Rapids, Michigan, on the banks of the Muskegon River. When young we children were somewhat embarrassed to hear the story of our parents' probably feverish collision on a summer evening early in the Great Depression. The river has to slide past until we ourselves are in love and bent on mating with the scant ability to lift our eyelids high enough to see that it happens to nearly everyone. Norma was a very strong and somewhat irascible character and remained that way until her death at eighty-five. Winfield was obsessively hardworking, playful but melancholy. He must have been troubled at the time because he had worked his way through Michigan Agricultural College, graduating in 1932, but the convulsed economy only allowed him a job driving a beer truck and he was lucky to get that. I think I was twelve and we were trout fishing when he told me that I had nearly missed existing. One hot summer day on a hangover he had taken an after-lunch nap in the shade underneath the beer truck. His employer had driven by with a friend, seen his abandoned truck with its valuable cargo, and driven the truck off, a back tire slightly grazing my father's head. ",2002-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Brown, announced yesterday. The company, New York Rent-A-Car, based in Queens, has offices there and in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.

Each defendant faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted, and the company faces tax liabilities and penalties of about $15 million.

The President and Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center are profoundly saddened by the passing of Leah Epstein Harrison, a founder and associate director of the J. E. and Z. B. Butler Child Protection Center of The Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Leah, who joined Montefiore 35 years ago as an emergency department nurse, became the driving force behind the Child Protection Center, which has become a model program for the protection of children in the Bronx, New York State and throughout the country. A nationally and internationally recognized expert on child abuse, Leah was called upon by many government leaders to visit their countries (including Israel and Jordan), to help them set up programs to promote the well-being of children and teach the prevention of all forms of child abuse. In 1993, the New York State Legislature named her its Nurse of Distinction and in 1999, the Leah Harrison Educational Center for Child Protection was created at Montefiore through a $100,000 grant from Time Warner, Inc. Over her three - decade career, Leah was named to many federal and local committees, always with one goal, to save children from abuse. Most recently, she served on the Board of Directors of the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse New York State and was chair of the UJA-Federation Family Violence Task Force subcommittee on children. She was the first pediatric nurse practitioner to be called as an expert witness in both New York State Family and Supreme Courts. To every challenge, Leah brought intensity, tenacity, creativity, courage and dedication. She will be greatly missed by her colleagues and the tens of thousands of children who never knew her but who are safer because of her. Our heartfelt condolences go out to her husband of 33 years, Frederick, her two sons Eric and Bradley, her mother Lillian, her sister Dorothy and brothers Neil and Richard.

An electronics and entertainment giant with fingers in many pots, Sony faces a complicated digital media landscape.

That compared with a loss of 1.21 billion euros in the period a year ago, when the company took most of its 2.6 billion euros in charges for payments related to the attacks on the World Trade Center. Reinsurers sell backup insurance to other insurance companies, spreading risk so that enormous losses from natural catastrophes can be covered. The companies seek to make money both from premiums and from investing premium proceeds in stocks and bonds, so the drop in stock markets has hurt their profits. Munich Re listed investment losses of 1.6 billion euros ($1.58 billion), and expenses of 500 million euros ($495 million) for damage caused by August's floods in Germany and other parts of Europe. The company said its profit for the full year would exceed the 250 million euros of last year, despite more investment losses expected in the current quarter. &#0160;(AP) ",2002-11-29T05:00:00+0000

After initially refusing to extradite them, Georgian officials, under pressure from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, relented last month and sent five fighters back to Russia. That prompted a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights opposing further extraditions, but the court ruled this month that Georgia and Russia could resolve the issue between themselves.

us,National Briefing | Washington: Smaller Raises For Federal Workers,"President Bush said he would set raises for federal workers next year at 3.1 percent, canceling a provision in the law that would have set off an average increase of 18.6 percent. Congress had considered a 4.1 percent increase, but did not pass it, while Mr. Bush had been seeking 2.6 percent. Consumer price inflation is currently 2.1 percent, the administration said. With no specific pay increase having been signed into law, the figures for next year are set under a two-part formula that gives the president the right to override one of the parts. White House officials said Mr. Bush would not object to the basic 3.1 percent increase under the formula. But they said he would use his power to cancel the other part of the raise because it would add about $10 billion to the federal payroll next year alone. Richard W.

Croatia had asked the tribunal to annul the indictment against Gen. Janko Bobetko, a former army chief of staff who is regarded as a hero of the 1991-95 war against Croatian Serbs.
