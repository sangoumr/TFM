The nut weevil, for example, feeds only on hazelnuts; it appeared on the roof during the first half of the study but not the second. Scientists at the museum suspect that the nut weevil and other specialists are moving north, where the climate is cooler.",2015-11-02T06:00:04+0000

us,Michel Houellebecqs Submission,"Before I begin this review, I have to make a small confession. I have never read Michel Houellebecqs books. This is odd, I concede, since Houellebecq is considered a great contemporary author, and one cannot be said to be keeping abreast of contemporary literature without reading his work. His books have been recommended to me ever since 1998, most often The Elementary Particles, by one friend in particular, who says the same thing every time I see him. You have to read The Elementary Particles, he tells me, its awesome, the best book Ive ever read. Several times Ive been on the verge of heeding his advice, plucking The Elementary Particles from its place on my shelf and considering it for a while, though always returning it unread. The resistance to starting a book by Houellebecq is too great. Im not entirely sure where it comes from, though I do have a suspicion, because the same thing goes for the films of Lars von Trier: When Antichrist came out I couldnt bring myself to see it, neither in the cinema nor at home on the DVD I eventually bought, which remains in its box unwatched. Theyre simply too good. What prevents me from reading Houellebecq and watching von Trier is a kind of envy  not that I begrudge them success, but by reading the books and watching the films I would be reminded of how excellent a work of art can be, and of how far beneath that level my own work is. Such a reminder, which can be crushing, is something I shield myself from by ignoring Houellebecqs books and von Triers films. That may sound strange, and yet it can hardly be unusual. If youre a carpenter, for instance, and you keep hearing about the amazing work of another carpenter, youre not necessarily going to seek it out, because what would be the good of having it confirmed that there is a level of excellence to which you may never aspire? Better to close your eyes and carry on with your own work, pretending the master carpenter doesnt exist.",2015-11-02T10:30:08+0000

Nearly 40 years ago, Brauntuch had a flash of big-shot fame: he was one of five artists (alongside Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo and Philip Smith) included in the influential 1977 group show Pictures, curated at Artists Space by Douglas Crimp. The show came to represent the brewing movement of image-based artists  those who had a broader perspective of how we read images, and really entered the picture again, and what that means, Brauntuch says. Pictures operated as a bellwether, in stark contrast to then-fashionable Minimalism and abstraction. We came out of a time when art was not what we were doing, which is why we were doing what we were doing. His years in New York in the late 70s and 1980s were spent running up the ladder alongside his friends, like Cindy Sherman, Matt Mullican, David Salle, Goldstein and Longo, whose careers exploded onto the superstar level.

When the time comes (most likely in the next year), we will see him through to a gentle death. We have the resources to take care of him, but he is expensive  think car payment, not mortgage payment. He doesnt look like a regular dog, and people know he has a medical routine. There is a lot of unsolicited judgment, mostly in three camps: those who think we should devote the same amount of resources to charitable animal-related organizations and not an individual dog, people who think it is wrong to put a dog through chemo and people who think its morally wrong to exert so much effort on an animal.

Hastily formed separatist militias, goaded and armed by Moscow, rose up in a rebellion against a new, pro-Western government in Kiev. In the first months of the conflict, the fighting was far from Nikishino, and Oleg, then 10, spent the early summer tearing about the village on his bicycle, zipping past its old brick cottages and apricot orchards. Then, in July, scorched scraps of clothing and bits of paper with foreign writing blew through the village  debris from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the passenger jet that was shot down, killing hundreds of people whose bodies lay in fields just south of the village.

Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy  her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945.

us,The Displaced: Hana,"At 4:45 in the morning on a Saturday in early August, stars were still bright in the sky above a refugee settlement in rural Lebanon where Hana Abdullah, a 12-year-old girl from Syria, now lives.

At 5 oclock, Hana was still sleeping on her bamboo mat by the edge of her familys tent, her arms folded, her hands under her head. Her baby brother and three of her four sisters slept nearby. Many mornings Hana was up at 4 oclock. She worked in the nearby fields of Lebanons Bekaa Valley, picking fruits or vegetables, and everyone started early. But today the truck that would take her there was late. Now came its familiar rumble, next the crunching of gravel: She stirred, her mouth twitched, her eyelids fluttered. Then she was up, vertical in one swift movement, stretching, pulling on a hat from a stash of her belongings. She grabbed lunch  a tomato, and a pita she folded around a potato  and ducked outside to wait on one of the benches in front of her tent.",2015-11-05T10:55:05+0000

Currently, the Guggenheims main floorspace is devoted to a retrospective of work by Burri, the Italian iconoclast whose postwar rejection of pictorial tradition influenced Arte Povera and Neo-Dada. The entertainment at tonights gala will come via Tom Gold, the former New York City Ballet principal now leading his own company, who has unearthed November Steps, an overlooked ballet by Burris wife Minsa Craig.

The intimate gallery, which is wallpapered and homey, is filled with 50 works by the late artist. Among them is The Double Grande Jatte, her husbands homage to and spin on Georges Seurats exercise in pointillism, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Its inclusion represents a reunion for Roberta, who last saw The Double Grande Jatte when it was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, in 1971. I found it so fresh here, she remarks. When he was making it, we were in an apartment in Milan and there was a door between the living room and the studio, and the 20-foot-long mural ran parallel to the door jambs. It was in front of us all of the time and at the end, Enrico said, I understand now why Seurat died so young, from getting bored of making all of those points.

It contains the same four drugs as Stribild, but with the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate replaced by tenofovir alafenamide. The new form of the inhibitor, Gilead said, enters cells where H.I.V. replicates more efficiently, resulting in 91 percent less tenofovir in the bloodstream.

This salience has some rationale: Hunger makes food a priority, and poor people spend about half of their income on it. But hunger is, nevertheless, a symptom of poverty, not a problem to be tackled in isolation  the solution to hunger may not have much to do with the supply of food. In this rambling book, David Rieff never quite recognizes this fundamental point. Positing that the 2008 spike in global food prices marked the start of structurally higher prices, his discussion revolves around whether we should look for the solution of extra food production in technocratic philanthropy, global agribusiness or revolutionary politics. Arriving at an answer that none look promising, he asks, Where does this leave us?",2015-11-06T18:15:04+0000

It tells the story of Wayne and Kelly Maines, a good-hearted, hard-working American couple, neither rich nor poor, neither fabulous nor downtrodden, who after years of trying to conceive a baby are finally given the opportunity to adopt: infant boys, identical twins, the children of Kellys second cousin. The Maineses name the babies Jonas and Wyatt, and immediately the low expectations that come with unmet yearning give way to the more self-centered aspirations that accompany getting what you want. Fantasies of imprinting upon these inchoate beings a storybook childhood preoccupy both parents, but especially Wayne, who sees in fatherhood a chance at passing down the rites and traditions of American manhood. Still in the hospital, Wayne cradles the babies and murmurs to them as if reciting a prayer: My boys, my boys. Were going to have so much fun together, he whispers in the twins ears. Were going to go hunting and fishing and I will teach you everything I know. ",2015-11-06T18:15:05+0000

What is that urge, the desire to soak in anguish and injustice as we come of age? Whatever it is, Ashley Hope Prezs new novel, Out of Darkness, fills the need.

And fresh stains, too, like exaggerated income inequality. Likewise, the reality of the elite, exceptional American child is hardly as pristine as many parents imagine. Our gifted and talented Mandarin-speaking, travel-team-captaining, polished-in-selfies youth are often characterized by narcissism, the pursuit of achievement at any cost, toxic stress and greed: grade greed, accomplishment greed, rsum greed.

Arms and legs were falling off the rotting trunks, which made it difficult to count how many bodies were in the trailer. The stench was unbearable.

I cant imagine writing about a certain type of rifle or a type of shotgun or a certain handgun for anything, and not having any experience with it, she explains in the video. Cornwell has been known to take her research to extremes: She spent six years in a forensics lab to learn Scarpettas job and went on to scuba dive, fly a helicopter and stab sides of beef wrapped in wool, all in the name of getting things right. People now have such short attention spans that I have to try really hard to keep the suspense going, so they dont have a reason to put down my book and read 20,000 tweets instead, Cornwell told The Telegraph.

And a newspaper story saying that an official desires a cabinet job, or is under consideration, is regarded as the surest path to early retirement. Consequently, it raised eyebrows in official Washington today [Nov. 8] when Robert C. Weaver, the highest- ranking Negro in the government, answered yes, when asked whether he wanted the cabinet post of secretary of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department, still headless, comes into being at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. President Johnson hasnt indicated his choice for the new cabinet post, and wont until early next year, according to a White House announcement over the weekend.

The attorney obtained freedom for a member of the Home Guard, who had been charged with the theft of a German pistol, six rounds of ammunition and a flying helmet from a Nazi airman who had bailed out over Chatham, Kent. These articles were alleged to be the property of his majesty, but Gerald Thesiger, defending Harry Foulds, member of the Home Guard, cited the judgment of a prize court of 1748. That court had held that a subject was entitled to whatever he could take from the Kings enemies and that such property had never been vested in the crown.

us,Russia: Official Says Delayed Deal to Sell Iran Missiles Remains in Force,"Russias most senior arms executive said Monday that a contract to supply Iran with powerful S-300 air defense missiles was now active. But with no delivery date or any other details, the announcement seemed aimed more at warding off an Iranian lawsuit than a major step toward delivery of the weapon system. Sergei V. Chemezov, Russias chief arms trade executive, made the announcement at an air show in Dubai, Russian news agencies reported. The contract to deliver the S-300 was not only signed by both sides, but has already come into force, Mr. Chemezov was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. The initial contract to deliver the weapons was signed in 2007, before the current international arms embargo against Iran was established. But the deal was canceled in 2010 by Dmitri A. Medvedev, then Russias president, under pressure from the United States and Israel. In response, Iran filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract that could cost Moscow as much as five times the $800 million value of the original deal. President Vladimir V. Putin reversed Mr. Medvedevs decision in April, as a nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers began to appear likely. But the system still has not been delivered. The hitch, military experts say, is that Russia wants to keep the unfulfilled contract as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, perhaps with an eye to ending economic sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine.

The diversion, which may continue for up to seven days, will allow workers to repair and alter a major collector sewer. If we could have avoided this choice, we would have done it, Mr. Coderre told reporters. After initially approving the citys plan, the former Conservative federal government banned the city from diverting the sewage in the midst of the recent election campaign. The Conservatives were routed by the Liberal Party last month. The new Liberal government said Monday that the diversion could go ahead, provided that the city addressed concerns raised by a panel of scientists. That review found that while dumping the sewage was not ideal, it was preferable to the potential consequences of a sewer failure. ",2015-11-11T04:10:13+0000

A report by The New York Times in September found that monitoring of suicide was not coordinated between the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, and many veterans fell through the cracks because the effect of combat exposure was poorly tracked.  After more than decade of war, neither department has the data to show whether troops exposed to combat have a higher risk of suicide, and how that risk changes over time. Because of this, veterans say suicide prevention programs do not fit their needs. We simply dont know enough about the effects of combat on mental health issues among service members and veterans both during and after service, said the amendments sponsor, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado. The measure passed as part of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016. ",2015-11-12T04:14:05+0000

The 2,123-pound craft got off to a good start on its three- and-a-half-month flight to Venus, and then Tass, the government news agency, announced that it had been launched. Venus-1 was launched on Feb. 12, 1961, but its radios went dead about two weeks later. After that first failure, Soviet space engineers failed on at least four more occasions, according to American sources, to send rockets toward Venus.

It piled up, year after year, century after century, millennium after millennium. Eventually, the snow became the Greenland ice sheet, a blanket of ice so huge that it covered 650,000 square miles and reached a thickness of 10,000 feet in places. Meanwhile, in Antarctica, a similar process was well underway. There, as snow fell upon snow for years without end, the ice sheet spread out over a much vaster area: 5.4 million square miles, an expanse far larger than the lower 48 states. By the start of the modern era, when power plants and electric lights began illuminating the streets of Manhattan, about 75 percent of the worlds freshwater had been frozen into the ice sheets that lay over these lands at opposite ends of the earth.",2015-11-12T19:17:15+0000

That Mr. Snow came from art-world privilege  he was an estranged member of the de Menil collecting family  made the narrative that grew up around him all the more loaded. He was resented, glorified, dismissed and envied, often in the space of a single conversation, regarded as a genuinely troubled, politically aware poet of early 21st-century anomie or a heavily tattooed epigone of a counterculture that lost its steam long before his arrival.",2015-11-12T23:11:25+0000

Raja was working a burglary detail when he approached Mr. Joness car in an unmarked van. Mr. Raja told the authorities that Mr. Jones confronted him with a gun, so the officer fired six times, striking Mr. Jones three times as he fled. The officer came under criticism for failing to show his badge, and because Mr. Jones had acquired his gun legally. Mr. Raja, who joined the police department in April, was still in his probationary period, making it easier for the city to terminate his employment.

Theyre also competing on the hardcover nonfiction list, where Carsons book A More Perfect Union (written with his wife, Candy Carson) is No.4 after five weeks and Trumps book Crippled America makes its debut at No.5. Both men have been here before, of course, Carson with two previous best sellers and Trump with eight (most notably Trump: The Art of the Deal, written with Tony Schwartz, which spent 48 weeks on the hardcover nonfiction list in 1987 and 1988). So what do their books reveal about the candidates? Nothing we didnt know already from watching them campaign. Carson is genial and bland in advancing his model of Christian conservatism; in his latest book, a paean to the Constitution, each chapter opens with a Bible verse. And Trump is blustery and vain and entertaining. Here he is discussing his books cover, which shows him with a stern Sam the Eagle frown: Some readers may be wondering why the picture we used on the cover of this book is so angry and so mean looking. I had some beautiful pictures taken in which I had a big smile on my face. I looked happy, I looked content, I looked like a very nice person, which in theory I am. My family loved those pictures and wanted me to use one of them. The photographer did a great job. But I decided it wasnt appropriate. In this book were talking about Crippled America  thats a tough title. Unfortunately, theres very little thats nice about it. ... So I wanted a picture where I wasnt happy, a picture that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel, rather than joy. Theres nothing to be joyful about.

But a storm arises as the men depart and when eventually they wash ashore their task is no longer exploration but survival.

Kamikaze-style, suicidal defense will forever be associated with Japan. But it was Nazi Germany that actually immolated itself. While Hitler lived, there could be no negotiation. There would be no surrender, no repeat of the November 1918 armistice. The result was the devastation not only of much of Central Europe, but also of Germany itself. In the course of the war, 5.3million men would die fighting in Wehrmacht uniform. Close to a million German civilians were killed in air raids and the ethnic cleansing that followed the war. Germanys casualties far exceeded those of all of Western Europe put together. And the violence escalated as the war went on. The largest number died in the last desperate months, the worst being January 1945, when the Wehrmacht lost 450,000  more in a matter of weeks than America would suffer in all of its wars of the 20th century.",2015-11-13T16:10:40+0000

The agency called the diseases a substantial health challenge. Syphilis cases have more than tripled since 2000, and 91 percent are in men  mostly gay and bisexual men. Dr. Gail Bolan, the agencys director of prevention of sexually transmitted disease, said there was no single answer for the increase, but noted several factors. State and local spending on prevention and treatment has shrunk as screening of gay men has picked up. Many gay men start antiretroviral drugs as soon as they are infected with H.I.V., and others take Truvada to prevent infection; there have been reports that condom use has dropped in this population as a result. Although those drugs prevent H.I.V. infection and transmission, they do not prevent the spread of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papilloma virus, herpes or trichomoniasis.

us,Todd Hayness Flash and Finesse at the Film Society of Lincoln Center,"In The Other Side of Dreams, the Film Society of Lincoln Centers lovingly curated retrospective of the films of Todd Haynes, selections are paired with films chosen by Mr. Haynes that influenced them. His suburban melodrama, Far From Heaven, is coupled with Max Ophulss The Reckless Moment, which also deals with a scandalous family secret. His HBO mini-series, Mildred Pierce, is connected to Klute, in which Jane Fondas Oscar-winning role as a hardened prostitute is markedly similar to Kate Winslets devoted, hard-driving mother in Pierce. The flamboyant David Bowie-like rocker (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) in Velvet Goldmine, set in London at the height of the glam-rock era, is not unlike the androgynous rock star played by Mick Jagger in Nicolas Roeg and Donald Cammells cult classic Performance. Mr. Hayness AIDS-era parable, Safe, is paired with Douglas Sirks final Hollywood film, Imitation of Life, a critique of racial and class divisions in America disguised as a sudsy weeper.

As viewers may observe in Painting Tranquility: Masterworks by Vilhelm Hammershoi From SMK  The National Gallery of Denmark, a beautiful small exhibition at Scandinavia House, his paintings convey a distinctively modern psychological complexity. But unlike another famous Scandinavian, the Expressionist Edvard Munch, Hammershoi practiced a kind of representational painting dating back to Rembrandt and Vermeer. With their severely muted colors, Hammershois portraits and pictures of women in nearly empty rooms may call to mind the suavely subdued paintings of James McNeill Whistler.

A musician himself, Albom plays keyboards with the Rock Bottom Remainders, where his bandmates include Amy Tan on vocals and Stephen King on rhythm guitar, among assorted other best-selling authors. (We mostly listen to Dave Barry telling booger jokes, Albom has said.) The theme I was trying to build on for this book was that everybody joins a band in life, he told The Philadelphia Daily News this month. Everyone joins a band. We may not think we do, but we do. Somebody plays the lead. Somebody is the rhythm. Somebody holds down the beat. Somebody gets to solo and go all over the place, while the other person gets stuck playing the chords.

He has written eight previous books in which he fearlessly simulates identities dauntingly remote from his own  including the identities of real-life figures both dead and living  and in which plot performs a function that might fairly be described as redemptive.

His narratives exist within that depressingly vast space between the hairsplitting nuances and abstractions of academia and the vulgar simplicities of cable news pundits. A highbrow out to educate middlebrows, Winchester writes books like someone telling a good yarn around the fireplace, whether about volcanoes, Indian slums or the 19th-century American West. He is an outdoorsman who knows about such things as geology and ocean sailing, which invigorates his prose in the same way as that of another journalistic travel writer, William Langewiesche, who flies planes and also sails. And he certainly has the knack for comparison. When Winchester writes that Hawaii, deep down, in its perceived cultural essence, still evokes what was felt by Gauguin during his time in the Marquesas, it is reminiscent of the British travel writer Jan Morris describing in 1960 how the smells and landscape of the Lido in Venice ignite thoughts of Carthage and Marrakesh.",2015-11-20T17:09:36+0000

The point is this: All reading is a form of reading aloud, even when the reading is done in silence. The very act of transferring the words of another into the brain activates the inner voice, the voice that we hear when we read to ourselves. All reading is therefore a vocal performance, generally just for an audience of one.

Testimony at public hearings held by a commission led by Justice Charbonneau captivated the province and led to several resignations, including that in 2012 of Grald Tremblay, a Montreal mayor who the commission found did not adequately fulfill his role of control and monitoring his administration. Justice Charbonneau said the commission confirmed there was a real problem in Quebec and that it was broader and more deeply rooted than we believed. Its report, which is about 1,700 pages long, makes 60 recommendations, including term limits for mayors and the adoption of anticorruption legislation based on an American law, the False Claims Act.

At a news conferenceon Tuesday, several cabinet ministers said that only 10,000 would arrive by the original deadline, with the balance coming by the end of February. We want to bring them in fast, but we also want to do it right, said John McCallum, the immigration minister. Mr. McCallum said the delay was not caused by security concerns after the recent attacks in Paris. Rather, he said, it related to preparing housing and services for the refugees, who will become permanent residents upon entry. Government officials said the selection process would favor families, women who are at risk and gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people. Single men will be admitted only if they fall under the sexual orientation categories or if they travel with their parents. About 36 cities have agreed to accept Syrian refugees who are to be flown to Canada by the military, which will also provide temporary accommodations for about 6,000 people at some of its bases.

Determine north by finding the North Star, which does not set when youre north of the Equator. As seafarers have done for millenniums, you can determine about how many miles north of the Equator you are by measuring the distance between the North Star and the horizon. To do this, stretch out your arm. For most, one fist equals approximately 10 degrees; latitudinal degrees each represent about 69 miles. The farther north you go, the higher the star looks in the sky.

He dismissed President Joseph Kasavubu, named himself head of state for five years and asked Col. Leonard Mulamba to form a broadly based government. The coup was prompted by a political deadlock that had threatened to open a new chapter of violence in the Congo. It also was seen as an attempt to close an opening to the left within the Kasavubu government. The 35-year-old general said his move was not designed to impose a military dictatorship. He said he had acted to save the nation, to put a definite end to chaos and anarchy.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 26, 1965",2015-11-25T13:25:35+0000

With her first collection of stories in 1988, Bad Behavior, Gaitskill staked out her territory: love, or something, among the ruins  the ruins of self, the ruins of hope, the ruins created by cruelty, both literal and psychological. In Gaitskills work, people hurt one another for fun, for spite, inadvertently, because they can, and (as she titled a later collection) because they wanted to. In one of Gaitskills most famous stories, Secretary, which later became a film of the same name, an alienated young woman is sexually used by her boss, but finds the encounter has an array of effects. She is simultaneously dissociated, disgusted, turned on, depressed, oddly loyal to the boss and somehow liberated. It is not right, and it also awakens something vital in her. Gaitskills story doesnt prioritize one emotion over any others or draw any moral conclusions. As she wrote in a 1994 Harpers essay, On Not Being a Victim, pain can be an experience that defies codification. In that story, as in much of Gaitskills work, the heroines ability to remain aware of all uncodifiable experience, to turn it over and examine it, is how she stays alive.",2015-11-25T20:17:45+0000

The Historiques Cornes de Vache 1955, available only in platinum, is, like the original, a sober classic distinguished by its cow-horn-shaped lugs.

The fight, in which a number of students were seriously wounded, occurred on the occasion of a meeting held within the university by the extremist group, which favors independence for Croatia. The university was closed and guarded by the police so as to avoid a possible disturbance, but the moderate students  those favoring Yugoslav national unity  forced their way in through the cellar and tried to break up the meeting. The clash which ensued ended only when the police quickly restored order and made a number of arrests. The incident assumed special importance in view of Yugoslavias uncertain diplomatic relations with a number of her neighbors. The position of this country, nearly surrounded by potential foes, resembles that of Czecho-Slovakia in 1939. In the internal situation, too, there is a parallel.New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 28, 1940",2015-11-27T14:48:52+0000

Now hes back, right on cue, with The Mistletoe Inn, new on the hardcover fiction list at No.9. What draws Evans so repeatedly to Christmas? Readers prone to psychoanalyzing might find a clue on his website, where Evans describes the tsunami of misfortune that hit his family in 1970, the year he turned 8. My father lost his job and couldnt find work, and my mother began to exhibit the first signs of severe depression. My Tourettes syndrome manifested that year and I was ticking like crazy. In addition, I wet the bed every night, made worse since I shared the bed with my brother, he writes. During this dark time I had a soul-crushing fourth-grade teacher named Mrs. Covey. Ill never forget two weeks before Christmas when she ridiculed those of us who still believed in Santa with the words: Your parents lied to you. There is no Santa.

There was, however, great hope that the results would be good. In any case Professor Koch has rendered an immense service to science in connection with all kinds of infectious diseases. The minister added that it was he who prevented Professor Koch from publishing the method of preparation of his remedy, for fear that it might be badly prepared and do more harm than good.

As the high command announced a turn for the better in the tide of battle, Gen. Ubaldo Soddu, who went to Albania recently to take command at the front, received promotion by royal decree.

Authoritative quarters were denied reports that the Greeks had captured Argyrokastron, one of the Italian bases in Albania, and that Gen. Pietro Badoglio had taken up headquarters in Tirana.

In 2011, the French tourism ministry humiliatingly left the Ritz off its list of palaces (a classification for five-star hotels of special character), compelling the hotels owner, Mohamed Al-Fayed, to upgrade. Now, after three years and an estimated $227 million renovation by the architect Thierry Despont, the 142-room Ritz is ready to reopen  complete with upgraded suites, a spacious new fitness center and, unsurprisingly, an untouched Bar Hemingway.
