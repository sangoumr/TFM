One winter while she was a student at the Kuling American School, she packed snow into wooden boxes to make ice blocks and built a high-domed igloo; the following spring, she constructed a circular bamboo hut as a secret hideout. In 1942, she enrolled in the first class to admit women at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she studied with Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer and readily embraced what she described as the missionary zeal of the Bauhaus-influenced faculty.",2012-05-01T16:43:33+0000

The occasion was the Drawing Centers 2012 Spring Gala, where Weiner was being honored for his contributions to contemporary art. Ruscha, who was on vacation in Jamaica, created a three-minute tribute in the form of a parody of Bob Dylans legendary music video for Subterranean Homesick Blues with placards featuring Weiner text pieces like stars dont stand still in the sky and water in milk exists. The mash-up soundtrack, sung by Ruscha himself, was composed by the longtime Ruscha collaborator Mason Williams, while the film was shot in Ruschas studio by Gary Regester, another old friend. Weiner and Ruscha both showed at Leo Castellis gallery in the 1970s and even teamed up for a book, Hard Light, in 1978, so theres a deep personal history far beyond benefit-circuit sendups. At the end of the video, commented Brett Littman, the executive director of the Drawing Center, Ed begs Lawrences wife, Alice, to bring him into the 21st century by teaching him how to drive a car, but Lawrence is a true New Yorker and I dont think honorees are expected to do homework.

Despite the chainsaw-wielding corporate evildoer on the cover of this weeks Bloomberg BusinessWeek, the magazine presents a much kinder, gentler version of private equity. The corporate restructuring artists here are like fairy godmothers who show up to organize your closet and teach you a few time-saving life hacks. They turn inefficient manufacturing companies into hyperefficient economic engines, improving peoples work environments and maybe even saving the whole idea of North American manufacturing in the process. Theyre not out to fire people, just to eliminate waste (though sometimes that waste turns out to be people). But lets not get distracted by that. The real trouble, according to the article by Brendan Greeley, is that closets dont stay reorganized for long. Private equity, he writes, is a castle in the sand, a brief victory for order in the constant slide toward entropy. But by the time youve stopped putting your shoes back into their clearly labeled transparent plastic containers, your company has been sold to its next owner.",2012-05-01T17:14:10+0000

But just how connected even they couldnt be so sure until they reached out to 100 of their cultural heroes and, using a Playbutton as a platform, loaded their words of wisdom, favorite songs and even the occasional recipe onto the wearable MP3 devices. The artist Cindy Sherman, who claimed not to like public speaking, curated a playlist; the legendary art director George Lois read from his new book, Damn Good Advice; Pharrell Williams rapped philosophic on his personal otherness (his new record label is called I Am Other). Starting tonight, and for the next three weeks, 10 different MP3 buttons will be available to the listening public at the New Museum Store as part of CNNCTD+100. Additional buttons have been planted throughout the city at special Sound Graffiti stations. (Hint: the Jason Woodside mural on Kenmare Street between Bowery and Elizabeth has something to say for itself.) Cornejo Borthwick and Grandinettis plan is to take the project global, bringing the buttons  and their collective good will  to cities like Paris and Tokyo and adding new names to the roster along the way. In New York City people are always so competitive, Cornejo Borthwick observes. The way to succeed is to collaborate.",2012-05-01T21:20:38+0000

Muammar el-Qaddafi, and Mr. Senussi on charges of crimes committed during Libyas uprising last year. The court has issued arrest warrants for the men and ordered Libya to turn them over, but Libya has insisted that it will try them, even though it is still rebuilding its justice system. The request said Libyan authorities were making progress in investigating the cases and preparing for trials that will meet international standards. In Mr. Qaddafis case, witnesses have been interviewed and evidence of his direct involvement in killings has emerged, the document said. But the case against the intelligence chief, arrested in Mauritania in March, has been delayed, it said, because his liver disease has prevented his transfer to Libya. ",2012-05-02T03:35:38+0000

Indeed, before the conversation about Girls descended into a pointless argument about whether racial minorities are adequately represented on a program thats clearly supposed to be portraying a narrow and privileged slice of American life, the critical reaction to the show, both positive and negative, grasped pretty directly what Lena Dunhams show is doing. Its offering a fairly dystopian take on twentysomething social life, in which the comedy is dark, the sex is gross, the romance is disappointing, and the mix of nudity, jadedness and bawdy talk doesnt carry any of the aspirational frisson that was always associated with the post-sexual revolution single life on a show like Sex and the City.",2012-05-02T18:35:44+0000

us,California: Faculty Agrees to Campus Strike in the Fall," Faculty members in the California State University system said Wednesday that they had approved plans for a two-day rolling strike at campuses all over the state. The California Faculty Association, which represents professors, lecturers and librarians at the systems 23 universities, has been negotiating with administrators for new contract for nearly two years. Union officials said that the strike was endorsed by 95 percent of the 12,500 members who voted last month. The rolling strike, which would not take place until the fall, would be the largest faculty strike in the states history and would take place over two days at each campus, ultimately affecting more than 400,000 students. The state has cut roughly $970 million from the California State University system since 2008, and university officials have responded by lowering the number of students admitted and raising tuition 23 percent. The union has asked for a 1 percent raise and says that administrators have asked to freeze faculty salaries, which have not increased since 2008. ",2012-05-03T02:20:25+0000

The resolution demanded the nations resume negotiations on fraught issues like oil sharing to try to stop the violence. Russia and China, which have resisted voting against Sudan in the past, joined in the unanimous passage of the resolution. The resolution also called for both nations to remove their forces from Abyei, arguably the most iconic of numerous contested regions along the border. Last month, hostilities heated up when South Sudan captured the oil-rich region of Heglig from Sudan. It later withdrew, after Sudanese airstrikes and pressure from the international community, but clashes between the two nations continue along the border, as well as inside South Sudans territory.

A commission delegation that visited the prison and two others late last month concluded that the most worrisome problem in Hondurass prisons was that the authorities had effectively ceded control to the prisoners themselves, in part because guards were not properly trained. This has led to high levels of violence and corruption, in a context of absolute impunity, the commission said.

Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials. Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdochs British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron. She has been arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice. The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links  described by critics as improperly cozy  between Mr. Murdochs media empire and Mr. Camerons government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into the payments to public officials, the police said. The arrest was made, the police said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdochs News Corporation. ",2012-05-04T06:09:25+0000

We are fascinated, and appalled, by how quickly men and women are brought to a childlike state, curled in tight on themselves and unable to call on their own free will, sanity or morality.

Since our own daily struggle is fought against fat, we fail to see that many of the conflicts of the past were wars against hunger.

By 1938, the couple were selling the 5-cent pans for a quarter a piece. Morrison used the proceeds to buy Nay a $35 diamond engagement ring. After a stint as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, Morrison tried his hand at developing a flying disk far superior to that of a flying cake pan. Together with a butane supplier named Warren Franscioni, they created the Flyin-Saucer, but it didnt go very far until Morrison created a new version in 1955, dubbed the Pluto Platter. The disc had a bump that evoked an alien cockpit on top and the names of the planets around its rim. Wham-O, the visionary toy company known for its slingshots and, soon, its Hula-Hoops, bought the rights in 1957. Wham-O renamed the flying disc Frisbee, which Morrison didnt like one bit. Had I been consulted, Id have vehemently objected, he wrote in his account of the Frisbee business (written with Phil Kennedy),Flat Flip Flies Straight! Wham-O went on to nix the alien cockpit and planetary names, opting instead for a new, sportier disc with a stripe in the center and the words Official Pro Model on top. By the mid-1960s, there was one of everybodys roof, says Robert Rauch, president of the World Flying Disc Federation. The Frisbee was, quite simply, cool, says Tim Walsh, author of a book on Wham-O.

The format is similar to CBSs long-running summer series Big Brother, and ABC has hired many former production members from that show. On Friday CBS sent a sternly worded letter to ABC about it. The letter implies, without directly saying so, that CBS will sue ABC over copyright infringement. The letter said that CBS was putting ABC on notice that its continued development and production of Glass House exposes ABC to liability. The letter said the elements of the new show are substantially and strikingly similar to Big Brother. In Glass House, which has its debut on June 18, 14 people are chosen to live in a house all summer with cameras on them in pursuit of a cash prize  the essence of Big Brother competition. In the past copyright cases have proved nearly impossible for reality-show plaintiffs to win because, in simple terms, everybodys reality is inherently different. The total number of former staff members on Glass House is at least 18, according to the CBS letter, all of whom signed nondisclosure agreements when they worked for Big Brother. The CBS letter argued that it would be impossible for anyone who signed such a letter to help produce a similar show without breaching the agreement.

The singer-songwriter of many monikers  he has recorded music as the Palace Brothers, Palace Music, Palace Songs and Bonnie Prince Billy, among other names  has seldom gone a year without releasing a record in almost two decades. He has also been known to rerecord his old songs, making instrument-packed renditions of what were spare arrangements and turning dark, slow ballads into light, country-inflected numbers. To coincide with his new book, Will Oldham on Bonnie Prince Billy, Oldham is again releasing a new batch of his own oldies  a six-song EP called Now Heres My Plan, made up of fresh versions of songs from the Prince Billy catalog. Among the recordings, available on July 24 at Drag City, is an impossibly upbeat rendition of I See a Darkness, the beautifully bleak song off his 1999 album of the same name that was later covered by Johnny Cash. To Ben Berman, who directed the music video for the new version, above, the buoyant rendition is not incongruous with the songs subject matter. To me the song is about friendship, Berman says, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. Its about a person who is dark and morose and maybe unhappy in his life but who has a friend who makes it all worthwhile. There wasnt much of a planned concept for the video, Berman says, but the result was something of a study in contrasts: black-and-white photography in cinematic Glasgow, Scotland, plus goofball dance moves and special effects that make Oldhams and his band members eyes swirl around in opposing directions like stick-on googly eyes. We share a similar sensibility for what we find bizarrely funny, Berman says. Hes the perfect amount of weird.",2012-05-07T15:45:04+0000

If an intern performs well, it seems natural for the employer to offer a regular, permanent job. But if the intern is not up to snuff, it is much less painful to let the person go after three months than to lay off a recently hired regular employee after three months. That latter course not only hurts the worker, but also helps give the employer a reputation as an undesirable place to work.",2012-05-07T18:01:08+0000

Mr. Fairey, a longtime fan of the musician, included him in May Day, his 2010 show at Deitch Projects portraying cultural heroes of the left. Then Mr. Young, who stages an annual benefit concert for the Bridge School in Northern California, asked Mr. Fairey to create art for an album marking the concerts 25th anniversary. So the artist wasnt exactly surprised, he said at the opening of his new show at Pace Prints, when Mr. Young asked him to make a painting representing each song in his new album with Crazy Horse, Americana. What Mr. Fairey didnt expect was the intensity of Mr. Youngs involvement. For all the tracks, the artist submitted several digital mockups inspired by the narrative (none based on an identifiable original source, he emphasized). Then Mr. Young picked his favorites. Mr. Fairey said he was also surprised to learn that God Save the Queen is not just a Sex Pistols song but an old British anthem and the source of the melody for My Country Tis of Thee. His finished painting depicts the Queen and Betsy Ross sewing a combination of British and American flags; its text reads God save the land of liberty a phrase with both a dual origin and a double meaning. Neil and I talked about that, Mr. Fairey said. They left England, and basically made the same mistakes. In some respect it all blends together.",2012-05-07T19:43:02+0000

And it is that, in part: If you read the Vatican doctrinal assessmentofthe LCWR, youll find echoes of the debates that have divided American Catholicism since the 1960s womens ordination, human sexuality, how great a stress to place on Catholic social teaching versus the dogmatic aspects of the faith, and the broader question of where authority ultimately resides within the church.",2012-05-08T13:21:10+0000

us,Stone Links: Dissecting the Dismal Science,"What To Do About the Rich, a post at the Philosophers Beard, offers a unique approach to the problem of the 1 percent. Capitalism is salvageable, the author argues, as long as were willing to consider a modest proposal: getting rid of the rich. Asserting that, because their extreme economic independence from the rest of society leads to a de facto ethical independence, the rich dont have the same political interests as the rest of us, the author concludes that no-one can be both a member of our democratic society and rich. The solution? Once an individual reaches a certain threshold of democratically problematic wealth, they have a choice: give it back, for example to the charity or social program of their choice, and rejoin the rest of the broad middle class, or, leave the country, which the author points out shouldnt be much of an issue for the extremely wealthy, who have the ability to, and often do, maintain multiple residences across the globe.

Smith, a prolific Vermont inventor. Smith also invented a combination lock, a lathe dog (a machine part for shaping metal) and a lifting spring for matchboxes. His spring-clamp for clothes-lines offered an elegant model of two levers hinged so that the two longer legs may be moved toward each other and at the same time move the shorter ones apart. Smiths design was later improved by the 1887 patent of another Vermont inventor, Solon E. Moore, whose great contribution was the coiled fulcrum, made from a single wire, which joined the two grooved pieces of wood at the center of the clothespin. Moores version had the advantage of being both sturdy  it kept clothes securely on the line  and easy to manufacture.",2012-05-11T14:24:21+0000

One of Francos top aides talked of democratically chosen politicians as cloven-hoofed beasts, and anything that smacked of modernity  Rotary Clubs, Montessori schools  seemed to draw the regimes violent wrath.

(Suggested uses: beach-lounging on Santraginus V, sailing a miniraft down the River Moth, hiding from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal and, if it still seems to be clean enough, drying yourself off.) The tribute caught on, and this year people in at least 15 countries will observe May 25 by carrying towels to readings, movie screenings and other events related to The Hitchhikers Guide, which spent a cumulative 11 weeks on our paperback list. In 1981, when the first American edition was released, Gerald Jonas praised it in the Book Review. Humorous science-fiction novels have notoriously limited audiences, he wrote. They tend to be full of in jokes understandable only to those who read everything from Jules Verne to Harlan Ellison. The Hitchhikers Guide is a delightful exception. And yes, he mentioned the towels.",2012-05-11T15:48:28+0000

The agency said the driver had intended to bomb Aleppos densely populated Al Shaar neighborhood a day after two suicide bombers killed at least 55 people in Damascus. Syrian officials say the attacks vindicate their contention that President Bashar al-Assads foes are foreign-backed terrorists, while opposition figures say the government is trying to scare people. But outside experts see growing evidence that fighters from neighboring countries, possibly sent by Al Qaeda in Iraq, are joining the fight in Syria, further complicating efforts by the United Nations and Arab League to uphold a shaky cease-fire. The number of United Nations truce monitors on the ground in Syria has now reached nearly half the planned total of 300, the chief United Nations spokesman, Martin Nesirky, said Friday. Mr. Nesirky rejected suggestions that the cease-fire was near collapse. This is a plan that has the full support of the international community, he said. No one is saying this is an easy task.

One way to develop this idea is by saying that logic supplies no information of its own, because the point of information is to rule out possibilities, whereas logic only rules out inconsistencies, which are not genuine possibilities. On this view, logic in itself is totally uninformative, although it may help us extract and handle non-logical information from other sources.",2012-05-13T21:00:11+0000

A borough that people like Kate Young, Freja Beha and Sophie Theallet all call home cant be wrong, fashionably speaking, so I had to check it out for myself, Sabas says of her newest project: The Brooklyn of Fashion Insiders. Compiled by Sabas and her collective of stylish tipsters/borough residents  Maria Cornejo, Arizona Muse and Ts online editor, Jane Herman  the portable handbook celebrates and explores Kings County businesses and their cool, laid-back attitudes. Even the celebrity tattoo artists are friendly, Sabas says. (The guides cover art was created by Marc Jacobss inker of choice, Scott Campbell, who works in Williamsburg.) What struck Sabas most, though, is the boroughs wide-spreading reputation for dishing up stylishly straightforward food: I keep thinking of the words epicurean chic, something I previously identified with Europeans in the 1970s, she says. Among the restaurants that made Sabass cut: James in Prospect Heights, Romans in Fort Greene, Cafe Colette in Williamsburg and Dressler (which I personally recommended for its gorgeous dining room and elegant cocktails). But its more than just a listing of hip eateries. The guide also spotlights Brooklyns best yoga studios (Greenhouse Holistic and Shala), florists (Sprout Home and Saipua), vintage boutiques (Bogart & Moore and Erie Basin) and car services (Northside), which are handy when bridge-hopping back to Manhattan, if you must.",2012-05-14T17:11:03+0000

And then there are a couple dozen like me: urban cosmopolites eager to hear the deepest roots of the blues. Tamke calls himself a redneck, and hes attacked me because Im from The New York Times. Shouting into my ear over the music, Tamke makes me his megaphone for what he wants the outside world to know: Our races have melded together, we share everything, he says, voice trembling. We love each other. Hes squeezing my skull so hard it feels like it might pop, and its clear that hes under the influence of something very powerful. The moonshine or the music, I dont know. Finally, when it seems something is about to crack  my neck, or Tamkes tenuous hold on sanity, or both  he lets me go. Its sacred, he says, choking up. Its ancient, man. ",2012-05-17T21:25:11+0000

Ms. Mattila, right, was to have sung the role of Amelia. Karita was engaged for Ballo five years ago, and she recently decided the role was not right for her, said a Met spokeswoman, Lee Abrahamian. Sondra Radvanovsky will take on all but 1 of the 10 Amelia performances, the Met said, with the other replacement to be determined. As part of the domino effect in opera casting Ms. Radvanovsky stepped out of four performances of Verdis Trovatore, and Carmen Giannattasio will take over for her. Ms. Radvanovsky was also released by the Met from her contract to sing Elisabeth de Valois in Verdis Don Carlo in February and March because she now needs more time to prepare for future roles, the company said. No replacement was named. The announcements were part of a barrage of cast comings and goings for next year. The Met also said that Erwin Schrott would sing Dulcamara in Donizettis Elisir dAmore, a new production of the opera directed by Bartlett Sher, and that Dolora Zajick would replace Olga Borodina in three performances of Aida.",2012-05-17T22:14:38+0000

From 1883 to the end of his life in 1926, initially as a renter, he presided over his aesthetic Eden, his paradise for the innocent eye, and there created some of the most adventurous works on canvas of the early 20th century: the enveloping, hallucinatory paintings of lily pads floating on the surface of the pond he excavated for them.

us,Pacifists in the Cross-Fire,"Several miles west of Kabul, the village Qala-e Naw sits deep in the barren foothills of barrener mountains that are perennially half-sunk in cloud. The ruins of old homes strafed by Soviet gunships crowd a gravel streambed that is dry most of the year but runs swiftly with snowmelt come spring. One morning early in December, a 12-year-old girl named Gulali followed the bed for almost an hour, along with her mother and little sister, in search of dry timber to fuel their stove. When they reached a steep rise with scattered saplings near its peak, Gulali scrambled up the slope and set to hacking at some of the skinnier trunks with a hatchet. In the small community of poor Pashtun farmers who inhabit Qala-e Naw, Gulali was well liked for her prideful and precocious work ethic, and true to form, when her mother said they had enough wood and it was time to go home, Gulali insisted on felling one last tree. Seconds later, she stepped on a land mine. The explosion hurled her through the air, nearly severing her right leg and pulverizing most of the left.",2012-05-18T09:00:26+0000

Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon studying the physiology of rapid deceleration, wanted to test his rocket sled on something resembling a human. He commissioned a dummy based on plaster casts of an actual pilot. A California firm called Sierra Engineering responded with Sierra Sam, a six-foot-tall steel-and-rubber dummy with instruments in his thorax and head. Soon, it became apparent that such a dummy could have a big impact on the auto industry. With the birth of the Interstate, in 1956, Americans began driving longer distances in bigger and more powerful cars, increasing concerns about safety. In 1965, Ralph Nader published Unsafe at Any Speed, and the following year Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

Then I saw that I could combine storytelling and character from fiction, and associative leaps and consciousness tracking from poetry, and put them all together in one flexible form. In my early 30s I stumbled on the great 19th-century English essayist William Hazlitt, who turned me on to Charles Lamb and Michel de Montaigne, and from that point I was hooked.",2012-05-18T14:22:23+0000

In the late 40s, as a freshman at Howard University in segregated Washington, D.C., Morrison saw news footage of white mothers in the South trying to overturn a school bus with black children inside. I didnt know if I could turn over a bus full of little white kids, Morrison said. I didnt know if I could feel that . . . fury. And I tried very hard to. This is what I did: I said suppose . . . horses began to speak. And began to demand their rights. Now, Ive ridden horses. Theyre very good workers. Theyre very good racehorses. Suppose they just . . . want more. Suppose they want to go to school! Suppose they want to sit next to me in the theater. I began to feel this sense of  I like you, but . . . ; Youre good, but. . . .  Suppose they want to sleep with my children?! Morrison laughed. I had to go outside the species!

The graphic novel, by the cartoonist Arne Bellstorf, is already a success in Germany, and does a wonderful job of capturing the small moments of everyday life. It feels authentic, no doubt thanks to the extensive input from Ms. Kirchherr. The illustrations, in black and white with sketchy gray tones, are, for the most part, warm and inviting. Babys In Black has a couple of drawbacks: all of Mr. Bellstorfs faces have small swirls of gray on their cheeks. Its easy enough to get used to, I suppose, but this graphic tic often makes the characters look dirty (is that a smudge?) or surprised (are they blushing?). For those who know their Beatles history, the ending will be a foregone conclusion, but the story was new to me and I found the handling of Mr. Sutcliffes death quite abrupt.",2012-05-18T22:50:01+0000

us,Making Schools Work,"AMID the ceaseless and cacophonous debates about how to close the achievement gap, weve turned away from one tool that has been shown to work: school desegregation. That strategy, ushered in by the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, has been unceremoniously ushered out, an artifact in the museum of failed social experiments. The Supreme Courts ruling that racially segregated schools were inherently unequal shook up the nation like no other decision of the 20th century. Civil rights advocates, who for years had been patiently laying the constitutional groundwork, cheered to the rafters, while segregationists mourned Black Monday and vowed massive resistance. But as the anniversary was observed this past week on May 17, it was hard not to notice that desegregation is effectively dead. In fact, we have been giving up on desegregation for a long time. In 1974, the Supreme Court rejected a metropolitan integration plan, leaving the increasingly black cities to fend for themselves. ",2012-05-19T20:40:32+0000

us,Only Connect | Doug Aitkens Song1,"The artist Doug Aitken likes to bring people together. His 2006 book Broken Screen featured conversations with 26 artists, from Robert Altman to Rem Koolhaas. One of his favorite mediums is the happening, a sort of catchall for dynamic events he produces that can entail anything from live musical performances to panel discussions to line dancing. And yet in his video work, he tends toward lonely, restless souls like the insomniac city dwellers in the 2007 video Sleepwalkers (see trailer, here) or the any of the solitary animals that found themselves cooped up and climbing the walls in a remote desert motel in his 2008 piece Migration (empire). Song1, which finished a two-month run at the Hirshhorn Museum yesterday, is no exception. Only in this piece, the individual characters find a connection in the notes and lyrics of the doo-wop ballad I Only Have Eyes for You, which Aitken calls the perfect pop song. The gritty romanticism of the piece suggests searching or loneliness, but the song binds the characters together, says Kerry Brougher, the Hirshhorns deputy director and chief curator. The video, which was projected onto the windowless exterior of the Gordon Bunshaft-designed building from dusk until midnight, had a similar effect on the local community. Most nights the National Mall is a pretty desolate place after the sun goes down. It turned the museum inside out, Brougher says of Song1, noting that some nights there would be as many as 3,000 people camped out on the museum grounds, all watching together in quiet isolation.

us,Russia Demands Inquiry in Death of Child in U.S.," The United States government tried to head off a diplomatic row with Russia on Tuesday after Russian officials demanded an investigation into the death of a Russian child in an adoptive American family. American news media reported last week that Anton Fomin, a nine-year old Russian child adopted into a Nebraska family, died in a house fire while his parents were gone. On Monday, Russias childrens rights ombudsman, Pavel Astakhov, demanded an investigation, saying that American investigators had established that the child had been locked in the basement. Either the boy was punished or he was neglected and got into the basement accidentally, Mr. Astakhov said, according to RIA Novosti news service. Why the boy was locked in the basement and why he could not get out, we will ask the U.S. attorneys about this. The United States Embassy in Moscow expressed its condolences to the childs family on Tuesday, and corrected what it called unsubstantiated reports that he was brought to the United States through an adoption program. Anton immigrated to the United States with his biological parents, not through intercountry adoption, the statement said. Russian authorities have repeatedly criticized lax checks on adoptive American parents after a spate of high profile deaths involving negligent and abusive families. Last December, Mr. Astakhov threatened to demand a moratorium on adoptions by Americans after a Pennsylvania court released a pair of adoptive parents with time served after they were convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a child.

Yet a recent profile in the Guardian notes that this most anti-bourgeois of thinkers has released a book called In Praise of Love, which is apparently as much a personal memoir as it is a philosophical meditation on what many see as a particularly bourgeois virtue. According to Badiou, solving the existential problems of love is lifes great joy, and our society has confused that joy, directed towards the very being of the other with a mere sexual pleasure that fetishizes the body. Unfortunately for us, when you liberate sexuality, the problems of love remain unsolved. It would seem that the greatest love of Badious life, however, has been politics, which still makes his eyes gleam. As the piece concludes: Perhaps politics and love are not, if youre a French Maoist, so very different. ",2012-05-23T10:00:09+0000

us,Minding the Gap,"Writing in the middle of the 19th century, Karl Marx predicted that the gulf between the newly rich and the miserable urban poor, made much worse by the Industrial Revolution, would continue to widen indefinitely. This ever greater disparity, he thought, would ultimately undermine capitalism. Marx turned out to be wrong. Income inequality in Britain (and, from what we can tell, elsewhere in Europe too) began to narrow after the 1860s, and inequality in wealth peaked by the time of World War I. In America, inequality in both incomes and wealth began to lessen after the 1920s. The rich continued to live far better than the poor, but over the next 50 years the gap between them narrowed substantially.",2012-05-25T14:14:28+0000

Though she was a smart and seasoned actress who had worked in film as well as onstage, she was known mainly to Stockholm theatergoers. Her name barely surfaced in the lively public debate in Sweden over who should play Lisbeth, one of the most sought after film roles for a Swedish actress in recent memory. Moreover, the films director, Niels Arden Oplev, feared that Rapace was too attractive to portray the androgynous Lisbeth. After working through a scene with her, though, he changed his mind. When shes Lisbeth and you put a camera on her, and shes just sitting there looking at you, you think, Oh, my God, what is she going to do? he says.

us,How Roland Barthes Gave Us the TV Recap,"Among the brand-name French theorists of the mid-20th century, Roland Barthes was the fun one. (Foucault was the tough one, Derrida was the dreamy one, Lacan was the mysterious one  I like to imagine them sometimes as a black-turtlenecked, clove-smoking boy band called Hors de Texte, with the hit album Discipline n Punish.) Instead of constructing multivolume monuments of systematic thought, Barthes wrote short books built out of fragments. He was less interested in traditional coherence than in what he called jouissance: joy, surprise, adventure, pleasure  tantric orgasms of critical insight rolling from fragment to fragment. He proclaimed the death of the author and advocated a style of reading he referred to as writerly, in which readers work as active creators of a text. His critical metabolism ran unusually high: he would flit from subject to subject, defining new fields of interest (semiology, narratology) only to abandon them and leave others to do the busywork. He treated canonical French works with such unorthodox flair it drove conservative professors crazy. (Barthes first rose to prominence, or notoriety, thanks to the furor surrounding his early book about Racine.) In his inaugural lecture at the Collge de France  a sort of mission statement for the most prestigious academic post in the country  Barthes announced that he aspired above all to forget and to unlearn and proposed, as a kind of motto, no power, a little knowledge, a little wisdom and as much flavor as possible.",2012-05-25T14:17:44+0000

Montgomery was issued Patent No. 640,790 for the Fly-Killer, a cheap device of unusual elasticity and durability made of wire netting, preferably oblong, attached to a handle. The material of the handle remained unspecified, but the netting was crucial: it reduced wind drag, giving the swatter a whiplike swing. By 1901, Montgomerys invention was advertised in Ladies Home Journal as a tool that kills without crushing and soils nothing, unlike, say, a rolled-up newspaper might.",2012-05-25T14:17:46+0000

In these 12 books, children on holiday in the Lake District of England and elsewhere occupy themselves sailing, camping, fishing and playing at pirates. Contemporary readers raised on blood sport in Panem may find the series tame, but the novels are charming and well told. In the few weeks that Ive contemplated the story of Ransomes life, every mention of his name to a British acquaintance has elicited a fond smile; from every American it has drawn a blank.",2012-05-25T14:18:20+0000

Yet until Wolf Hall, her historical novel about the reign of Henry VIII, won the Man Booker Prize in 2009, she was much less well known in Britain, and in this country she barely registered at all. There may be nonliterary reasons for this: Mantel, who has been in ill health for much of her life, doesnt live in London, doesnt have a posh accent, doesnt travel much, doesnt regularly turn up on the chat shows. But another reason she isnt better known may be that shes a hard novelist to know, or at least to categorize: shes always reinventing herself. Her new book, Bring Up the Bodies, a sequel to Wolf Hall, is one of very few Mantel novels that bear much resemblance to any of the others.",2012-05-25T14:18:39+0000

us,The Countercultures Mark Twain,"Richard Brautigan burned through his short career like a rock star. Born in Tacoma, Wash., in 1935, he handed out poems on the streets of pre-hippie San Francisco, then caught an updraft in the zeitgeist with his 1967 novel, Trout Fishing in America, that even he couldnt have seen coming. Playfully elliptical, without plot or conventional characters, the book sold two million copies and transformed Brautigan into a libidinous Mark Twain for the new counterculture: a distinctly American voice that was so of its moment that it had nowhere to go but into a time capsule. By the time he ended his life in 1984, buffeted by drink and debt, he could not get an acceptable offer to publish his last novel. Thomas McGuane, a friend and sometime rival, summed up Brautigans arc succinctly: When the 1960s ended, he was the baby thrown out with the bath water. In life and death he was a moral fable for an era that invites easy moralizing.",2012-05-25T14:27:23+0000

The decision by Ms. Rousseff, which removes 12 articles from the bill, alters legislation sought by powerful agricultural groups. The bill had provoked outrage among environmentalists, some business leaders and cultural icons, especially over a provision that effectively granted amnesty to landowners who illegally deforested some areas. Responding to these concerns, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the presidents line-item vetoes ruled out amnesty. Still, Ms. Rousseffs action fell short of the expectations of environmental groups, which had wanted her to veto the entire bill. Details about the changes to the bill were sparse on Friday, with Brazils powerful Agriculture and Livestock Confederation withholding comment. The official text of Ms. Rousseffs alterations, which include dozens of suggested changes to the bill in addition to the vetoed portions, is expected to be published on Monday.

Two of Alifes founders, Rob Cristofaro and Arnaud Delecolle, have since gone on to found a design agency called New York Art Department, under the guise of which theyve taken on a new retail project: the Hole Shop at the Hole Gallery. The idea is to bring some of what we were doing at Alife, before the scene was appropriated and commercialized, and apply it to whats going on today, Delecolle explains. The merchandise includes books, T-shirts, Polaroid cameras from the Impossible Project, Krink markers and sustainable furniture made by the Brooklyn design firm Uhuru. Since taking over the Bowery space a couple of months ago, NYAD has also hosted book-release parties  the French graffiti artist FAFI dropped by last week to sign copies of her first comic book  as well as film screenings and a 24-hour-a-day curated video screen thats currently under the auspices of Luck You, a collective of teenage artists who work out of a loft in Chinatown. Continuing Delecolle and Cristofaros tradition of introducing new artists to wider audiences, on June 1 theyre curating their first show at the Hole Gallery. It will feature the work of a graffiti artist known only as Jim Joe, whose combination of anonymity, ubiquity (Jim Joes cryptic tags are all over the East Village and the Lower East Side) and epigrammatic use of social media has spurred a cult following. Jim Joe is one of those artists who have one foot in the graffiti world and one foot in something weirder and more conceptual, says Kathy Grayson, the Holes founder. Im really excited to see what he comes up with for his first gallery exhibition. Im sure that it will capture the odd humor and serendipitous, random mischievousness of what he does in public places, and I get the sense that he is sophisticated enough to make it work in a new way in a gallery space. I would definitely say that this is a very hotly anticipated show as no one knows who he is and everyone wants to see what he does next.",2012-05-30T18:00:27+0000

My father had his own business, so he worked a lot, Suarez said. Family dinner was our opportunity to sit together and enjoy her cooking: salads with tomatoes or avocados from the garden, shepherds pie and schnitzel (shes English with an Austrian background). Now living in a house with an olive grove in Lucca, Italy, Rosemarys specialties have since changed, and it comes as no surprise that her son has named his new Italian restaurant in her honor. In the space that once housed Cushmans, then Sutters Bakery, Suarez has Wade Moises, former chef de cuisine of Eataly, overseeing a kitchen that makes fresh pasta and focacce, as well as seasonal dishes prepared with ingredients grown on the restaurants organic rooftop garden. (The days harvest gets dropped down to the dining room in a basket on a block and tackle.) Its an opportunity to bring the source of the food literally a flight of stairs away from your dining table, said Suarez, who plans to give students from the local Public School 41 tours and lessons on how to turn those vegetables into lunch. Were hoping to offer generosity, camaraderie and engagement  a sense of community, he said. Theres another unusual aspect to the joint. Beyond the reclaimed wooden table tops, Suarez has gone green with a Dekar Design interior: Instead of filling space with taxidermy and black and white photos, we used nature as our dcor.

This month the designer adds yet another must-have to the mix  a limited edition long-sleeve style featuring a wiggly stripe hand-drawn by the artist Elliott Puckette, a friend of Leachs. I wanted the shirt to appear to be a canvas, Leach says. I didnt want trims or excessive stitching to interfere with the grace of the lines. Available in four colors  soft black, pink, sky blue and pool blue  the Pima cotton tees echo Puckettes preferred palette. For her, the design process began as ink on paper.
