us,The Making of E. B. White,"Modest in its size and presumptions, engaging in tone, E. B. White's ''One Man's Meat'' has resisted becoming historic, even after a nonstop run of 55 years in print. First published in 1942 and reissued in expanded form two years later, the book was unweighty by design, being not a sustained single work but a compilation of the writer's monthly columns for Harper's Magazine (which he had begun writing in 1938), along with three casual essays first published in The New Yorker. Because of this format and the format of the author's mind, the book has always had the heft, the light usefulness, of a bushel basket, carrying a raking of daily or seasonal notions, and, on the next short trip, the heavier burden of an idea. (The image owes much to White himself, whose remembered easy, unstriding walk across a pasture or down the shore road of his Maine farm remains unique, as does his touch with the homely utensils of prose.) Strewn with errands and asterisks, farming tips and changes of weather, notes on animals and neighbors and statesmen, ''One Man's Meat'' is too personal for an almanac, too sophisticated for a domestic history, too funny and self-doubting for a literary journal. Perhaps it's a primer: a countryman's lessons that convey, at each reading, a sense of early morning clarity and possibility.",1997-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Hey, Things Fall Apart","The specters of failed relationships and echoing catastrophes haunt DANGER WALL MAY FALL (Zoland, paper, $13.95), a collection of seven short stories by Lynn Luria-Sukenick, a poet who died of cancer in 1995. Typically, a protagonist (all are women) with her ''marriage gone, jobs hard to come by, bad luck,'' assesses her isolated state in sophisticated accents of mingled rapture and resignation. Thus in ''Still Life With Bath,'' an older woman puzzles over her younger lover's incomprehensible devotion and decency. ''What Is Lost, What Is Missing, What Is Gone: Scenes After the Earthquake'' draws disturbing and oddly exhilarating parallels among love lost, ''the sound of California breaking'' and the heroine's intuitive understanding of her Jewish grandmother's sufferings during World War II. And ''Do You Know the Facts of Life? (Quiz)'' offers in question-and-answer form hilarious capsule descriptions of such amusing romantic-erotic arcana as ''a state of sexual dyslexia'' and ''the opposite of an obscene phone call.'' If little happens in these stories, their elegant tone and clever imagery nevertheless give them a beguiling density; Luria-Sukenick's fiction amply compensates in intensity for what it lacks in range. Watching landscapes where ''blank-faced condos bite into the hillsides'' and observing ''the citrus slice of the Ferris wheel motionless in the morning light,'' we slip willingly inside her characters' thin skins.

us,A Head Start,"Accompanied by both well-known and unfamiliar reproductions of the artist's work, the essays in PICASSO: The Early Years, 1892-1906 (National Gallery of Art/Yale University, $60) were chosen to reflect new areas of scholarly research. Perhaps the most fascinating of these (and the most needed) pertains to Picasso's earliest training, as well as to the importance of drawing. ''The practice of drawing was at the root of everything Picasso did,'' the art historian Marilyn McCully, the book's editor, writes. Several essays consider the famous Blue and Rose periods, but from unexpected perspectives. ''Barcelona Blues,'' by Robert S. Lubar, for example, describes socioeconomic conditions in Barcelona, where the vast majority of the Blue period paintings were executed; an essay on the Rose period examines the influence of French poetry and theater. And in ''Picasso in Gosol: The Calm Before the Storm,'' Robert Rosenblum discusses the paintings done in the remote Pyrenean village the summer before Picasso painted the revolutionary ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907). McCully, who serves as a collaborating author with John Richardson on his continuing biography of Picasso, also provides a helpful chronology of the painter's life, which reminds us that the book covers him only from the age of 11 to 24. In the essay ''Gods of Art: Picasso's Academic Education and Its Legacy,'' Natasha Staller writes: ''His nascent mastery is thrilling to witness.'' Robin Lippincott",1997-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The surviving members of Led Zeppelin perform their songs acoustically or with new arrangements and pretend they're breaking new ground. But the Who, most likely because of Pete Townshend's need for intellectual justification for his every move, always come up with the most elaborate excuses: farewell tours, silver anniversaries, performances of the rock opera ''Tommy.''

Still others reinterpreted site-specific to mean functional.

During the past few weeks, it has been claimed that no designer before Versace had mounted fashion shows as large-scale theatrical productions (in fact, Kenzo, Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler got there before him); that Versace was the first to stock his front row with celebrities (although some 50 years ago, Christian Dior commanded the likes of the Duchess of Windsor, Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart); that Versace's death is to the 90's what John Lennon's was to the 70's (and yet Lennon embodied the idealism of an entire generation, while Versace stood for the cynicism that is rampant in our culture, for the money and the hype that have become the chief criteria for greatness). In the midst of all this, Versace's true contribution -- which is both less sensational and more complicated -- has gone largely unremarked. His talent, a gift for innovative cut, was eclipsed by his celebrity: by the time of his death, he was more famous for the company he kept than for the clothes he designed.",1997-08-10T05:00:00+0000

The recurring pleasant sensations involve the tart (capers), the sweet (raisins where you least expect them), the hearty (rich tomato sauces that taste of the sun) and the luxurious (marzipan and ricotta-filled pastries).

us,Picture This!,"That carefully posed studio portrait of a stiffly smiling bride and groom might look nice on Aunt Margaret's mantelpiece, but to get the real story of a wedding, you have to go behind the scenes. WEDDING PICTURES (Chronicle, $22.95), a novel with text by Jacqueline Carey and illustrations by Kathy Osborn, gets right to the quirky, complicated heart of matrimony, offering up the nuptial saga of Kip and Bonnie. Never mind that he lives in New York and she lives in Washington, and neither one wants to move. Forget that Kip's roguish older brother, George, is on his fourth wife and he's having an illicit affair with Bonnie's childhood friend Fay, or that to save money the bridesmaids have to wear fishnet dresses borrowed from a singing group called the Five Flavors. Never mind the bickering in-laws, or all that unwanted advice. Kip and Bonnie are madly in love and that's all that matters. Right? Told completely in dialogue, Carey's witty story sprints along with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, a deftly traced map of preconjugal pitfalls. And Osborn, whose artwork has appeared on many New Yorker covers, brings the chattering chorus of voices vividly to life. Will Kip and Bonnie live happily ever after? It's anyone's guess, but one thing's for sure: they'll always have their wedding pictures. Sarah Ferguson",1997-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,A Fisher Miscellany,"So skillfully did M. F .K. Fisher stripmine her biography for her essays and books that even her most faithful readers may be surprised at the gaps in their knowledge of her life. The outline is clear -- the childhood in Whittier, Calif., the young married life in Europe, the doomed romantic years in Switzerland with Dillwyn Parrish, the stint in Hollywood, the return to Europe, the graceful slide into old age in northern California -- and so is the cast of characters: the newspaperman father, the formidable grandmother, the scholarly first husband, the many unnamed lovers. But Fisher (1908-92) was an artist, not a mere memoirist, and she did not linger over facts in her quest to tell the truth. A WELCOMING LIFE: The M. F. K. Fisher Scrapbook (Counterpoint, $35) is a guide to her life that will be welcomed by her devotees; sensuous, witty and quick in pace, this collection of photographs and excerpts from Fisher's writings is at one with the spirit of its subject. Dominique Gioia, a freelance editor in San Francisco, provides a connecting narrative for her assemblage of memorabilia, which follows Fisher from cradle to grave. Gioia's prose suffers in comparison with Fisher's (whose would not?), but she is to be congratulated for her conscientious attention to biographical detail. And even her slippages in tone prove useful. Calling Fisher a single mother is accurate enough but rings oddly false for a woman who, as Gioia says, ''shunned the categorical, the reductive.''

He had left appointments at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital under a cloud, told that his research had dead-ended.

The entire community of New York University School of Medicine mourn the loss of our distinguished and loyal colleague Dr. Albert B. Haas. Over the years, his serivce to NYU as a foremost member of the faculty brought immeasurable knowledge, talent and grace to our academic programs. Dr. Haas graduated from medical school in Budapest. In 1940 after France fell to the Nazi's, Dr. Haas and his wife Sonja joined the French Resistance. The Haases were arrested and transported to separate concentration camps. Dr. Haas was imprisoned in Dachau and other camps where he was ordered to perform surgery even though he was not trained as a surgeon. Dr. Haas was able to acquire basic surgical skills by self study and assistance by other surgeons. These skills enabled him to save many prisoners. His extraodinary personal account-''The Doctor And The Damned''-was published later and received widespread acclaim. Dr. Haas immigrated to the United States and completed a residency in Bellevue Hospital. Thanks to the encouragement of Howard A. Rusk, Albert Haas joined the NYU Faculty. For over forty years Dr. Haas taught, conducted extensive research and co-authored with Dr. Rusk scientific papers on pulmonary diseases. The NYU faculty is greatly diminished by the passing of our dear friend, colleague and hero of WWII, Dr. Albert B. Haas. We are deeply saddened.

Judging from the 206 black-and-white portraits -- all taken between the late 1940's and early 60's -- in SEYDOU KETA (Scalo, $49.95), it is clear that, as an uncle explains in an afterword, the photographer Seydou Keita was ''blessed in three particular ways'': he had talent and energy, his studio (where he still lives) was located at a busy crossroads in Bamako, then the capital of French Sudan, and his city was enjoying a postwar economic and demographic boom. As one of a handful of commercial photographers there, Keita served an elite of government workers, shopkeepers, wealthy travelers, politicians, their wives and children, and strove to ''come up with ideas to please the customer.'' He succeeded. Whether working outside with a backdrop (his own lace bedspread or cottons printed with leaves, flowers or arabesques) or in his studio with props he provided (like a radio, clock, watch) or his subjects' prized possessions (a bicycle, a gendarme's uniform, a particular hairstyle), and whether photographing people in various styles of African dress or in European suits, Keita knew how to elicit confidence, portray intimate or familial ties and capture a person's nature. Unschooled and largely self-taught, Keita (who became the official photographer of the newly independent Mali from 1962 to 1977) obviously relished his subjects' beauty, dignity and diversity.

us,What Does Batman Read at the Beach?,"It's not a bird, it's not a plane -- it's not even Superman in this stylishly written first novel from Herbert Thomas. THE SUPERLATIVE MAN (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22) features a cleverly reimagined superhero who does little, over the course of the book, to earn the name. But what Superlative Man doesn't do, the author does, managing to impress and intrigue us on page after page. A curious hardboiled hybrid of 1940's pulp fiction and 1990's irony, ''The Superlative Man'' has more in common with the recent dark, retro Batman movies than with the wholesome Superman stereotype. Drugs, sex and violent death abound; people even smoke cigarettes with nary a puff of guilt. Thomas likes his noir very black -- his tough guys are sometimes so tough and his femmes so fatale that they border on the campy, but Thomas's reverence for the genre is so absolute and his rendering of it so exact that it's hard not to grant him his excesses. Only three pages in, his woebegone newshound protagonist, Harvey Gander, throws the opening punch: ''The Superlative Man killed my parents.'' Why? How? And who is the Superlative Man, really? All is revealed in good time, but not before Gander's mentor, an old girlfriend and a good chunk of Gander's ear meet unpleasant ends. Not so the novel itself, which (sadly) ends quite pleasantly. Thomas does such a good job simultaneously celebrating and perverting cliches that it's a shame to see him let his characters live happily ever after. Then again, that's good news if it means a superlative sequel isn't far behind. Liam Callanan",1997-08-17T05:00:00+0000

It's a light show in a box, able to fill a room with everything from chilly Arctic sunrises to steamy tropical sunsets. (Nine prominent designers conceived the luminaires, or floor and table lamps.) Iride, the weirdest of the models -- four tippy plexiglass tubes with snaky wires -- was on display, but sunlight obscured its effect. ''Wait, I will show you,'' Mr. Cardenas said, leading the way down to a windowless basement. He waved a remote control, and the white room decomposed into moody hazes -- pink, then orange, then yellow, green and blue. Four halogen lamps, backed by reflectors, are topped by glass filters -- red, green, blue, clear -- working like theatrical gels, the colored film clipped onto stage lights. The remote tells a microprocessor what colors to project and how brightly. It's like painting the wall with watercolor washes, but the fuzzy luminosity makes the room feel more like cloud nine. Prices are $3,600 to $6,800. The showroom is at 46 Greene Street. For information: (212) 925-1588.",1997-08-21T05:00:00+0000

His caricatures of headless legislators, dazed prostitutes and bloated war profiteers will always stand in the pantheon of satire. In THE BERLIN OF GEORGE GROSZ: Drawings, Watercolors and Prints, 1912-1930 (Royal Academy of Arts/Yale University, $50), Frank Whitford, the book's editor, makes a good stab at trying to explain Grosz -- not an easy task. Though affiliated at various times with all sorts of political and artistic movements, Grosz (1893-1959) remained independent and full of contradictions. As Whitford points out, at heart Grosz was not interested in causes. He drew and painted simply what he saw, ''the moral collapse of Germany,'' seen through the people around him in Berlin. The book also includes an essay about Grosz's political milieu by the historian Christopher Clark, some very telling comments about the artist from his contemporaries, and excerpts from Grosz's art theories, many of which have never before appeared in English translation. Draftsmanship was where Grosz's true genius lay, and this book excellently displays his trenchant line. Whitford, a former lecturer in art history at the Royal College of Art and at the University of Cambridge, provides opinionated and insightful commentary to accompany the 159 numbered images reproduced, and he helps chart the changes in Grosz's art as his works became somewhat less grotesque. Though full of dark humor, many of the images retain their power to shock. Ted Loos",1997-08-24T05:00:00+0000

To be troubled by the Poles' lack of indignation over anti-Semitic graffiti and the firebombing of synagogues is to refuse to recognize a 1,500-year-old truth. In Europe, Jews have never been accepted by the majority population as true nationals. Jews may have deceived themselves into believing that they were real Germans, Poles, whatever -- but as far as their countrymen were concerned, they were Jews. It makes little difference whether or not they are religious, whether or not they try to assimilate, whether they are accommodating or assertive, they will always be singled out for waves of persecution.

us,Lesbians in Wonderland,"Change is the one constant in Blanche McCrary Boyd's provocative new novel about sexual identity and the search for the self. Set in the early 1970's, TERMINAL VELOCITY (Knopf, $23) is the story of a prim book editor who works in Boston and the changes that ensue after she tangles with a band of radical lesbians who live in a California commune. Drawn together by their shared affinity for Artemis Foote, an insouciant artist with a convenient trust fund, the denizens of Red Moon Rising are a volatile group, particularly when they're performing their musical feminist version of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Their ranks include a dentist, a political fugitive, a columnist for Ramparts magazine, an art historian, a drug-peddling witch -- and the unlikely Ellen Burns, seemingly a happily married heterosexual, who will soon take a new lover and a new name. As it crisscrosses the country, Boyd's story moves from comic high jinks through seduction, betrayal and finally violence with a speed that at times feels dizzying. Indeed, before Ellen's reinvention is over, she will have lived the life of a fugitive on the run, witnessed a suicide attempt, received electroshock therapy in a mental ward, tried her hand at skydiving, attended Alcoholics Anonymous and worked on a late-night soap opera about ''a 'Gone With the Wind'-type family and their friendly, happy slaves.'' ''Terminal Velocity'' is not a novel for the squeamish. Despite its excesses, Boyd succeeds in closing the book on a redemptive note that is neither trivial nor saccharine. Hers is a voice that never wavers in its authority or its fierce sexual politics. Andrea Barnet",1997-08-24T05:00:00+0000

The Board, Staff and Volunteers of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center mourn the passing of our Founding President and dear friend and colleague, Irving Cooperberg. Irving had the foresight, determination, humor, and tenacity required to guide the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center through its early years. His generosity and determination played a key role in securing the building which is now the Center's home. Irving led the Center's first critical fund raising campaign, spurring other members of our community to follow his generous lead. Upon completion of his term as President (May 1987), Irving was named President Emeritus by the Center's Board of Director in 1988. Together with Lou Rittmaster, his lover of 25 years, Irving continued his fundraising efforts for the Center. Irving's wisdom and generous spirit were present in his devotion to New York's gay and lesbian synagogue, Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, where he served as Chairman for six of his fifteen years as a member of the Board. His smile and laughter overcame even the darkest hours, and he faced his twelve year struggle with HIV and AIDS with a courage none of us will forget. Through his example we learned about living and not dying with HIV. He was, simply put, a true Mensch. Our deepest sympathy and love go to his devoted lover, Lou Rittmaster. Everyone at the Center will miss Irving more than words can say, and we are forever indebted to him for sharing a vision and spirit that lights our path to a brighter tomorrow for future generations of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

In addition to his children, he is survived by his loving wife Brenda, his parents Frank and Celia Kasmir, his brother Sam, sister Susan, extended family and many loving friends. Words fail us at this time of great loss, end of suffering, and start of a peaceful rest. We can honor and celebrate a good life, full of passion during which he loved and was loved completely. His youth never left him. Cyril worked tirelessly to provide for his family and to take care of his friends. He was always there for us. He had something to teach us all. His passing will be deeply mourned, yet those who knew him can take solace in the memory of his laughter and of his expressions, both the smiling ones and the stern. He has earned a peaceful rest, yet we're sure he will revel, as he did in life, in the work and the rapture he has ahead. Funeral services will be at 10:00 A.M., Sunday at Sparkman/ Hillcrest Northwest Highway Chapel, Rabbi Gerald J. Klein officiating. Interment following at Hillcrest Memorial Park. The family will receive friends from 4:00 to 6:00 P.M. Saturday in the Funeral Home.

Medieval tapestry unicorns grace the Cloisters; a flag-pole and stockade mark old Fort Tryon. Lofty crags overlook the broad Hudson River as bedrock & history anchor the Heights to the George Washington Bridge. Walk east toward the Bronx across High bridge; gaze to the south from Sugar Hill, where trumpeters and tap dancers stepped up into the sun. Ages ago Iapetus (an older Atlantic Ocean) closed; the kiss with Africa heated a melting pot. Lava was injected in veins of rock and coagulated to form Palisade cliffs. The legacy of Algonquian life is hidden in our place names and our meals. The newcomers (first the Dutch, then English, African, Irish, German, Italian, Jewish, Chinese, Greek, Ukrainian, Armenian, Puerto Rican, Pakistani, Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, Filipino, and all) have shed blood in a thousand places, but millions live. Legends of Gotham: Father Knickerbocker, Boss Tweed, Emma Lazarus, Fiorello, the roar of the el, the blizzard of '47, Giants at the Polo Grounds. Offshore, barges ply swirling brown water near North River sewage pipes, as striped bass and shad swim up ''the river that flows both ways'': a tidal reach of the sea all the way up to Albany. Brownstone, bodega, ball court & bus stop: on warm nights in Harlem, noisy streets and quiet rooftops. Kids splash around a hydrant as lovers embrace on a Riverside Park bench and rush-hour traffic in stalled on the Triborough Bridge. Some uptown options: gospel choir on Sunday, sooty Grant's Tomb, hiphop the Apollo, ribs at Sylvia's, law at Columbia, mangos in El Barrio, peace garden in the Cathedral, rowboat on the Meer, pub-crawl the West Side, listen to poetry at the 92nd St. Y, nosh at Songbirds alight in leafy woods as a turtle lays eggs near a pond in Central Park. Grand museums flank the green with dinosaur bones and Egyptian tombs. When it snows, we ramble out to Sheep Meadow & the Great Lawn; in sunshine, to Strawberry Fields, the Lake, & the Zoo.

Gneiss but full of schist, the bedrock sparkles with mica. It bears the weight of midtown; Skyscrapers at Columbus Circle, Fifth Avenue, and Park Avenue. Attend concerts at Carnegie, ice skating shows at Rockefeller Center, Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Our eyes are drawn up to a blue slice of sky as vertical walls enclose us. 100 gridlocked taxis honk at police blockades as Fidel speaks at the U.N. Revelers jam Times Suqare on New Year's Eve, to jostle and sing as the ball drops. Buses come in (the Lincoln Tunnel) to Port Authority, trains to Grand Central. The lion-flanked public library was once a reservoir; we love the Art Deco classic Chrysler spire. From Hell's Kitchen walk to broadway, buy tickets for ''Showboat'' or ''Cats'' - hey, the Knicks won at the buzzer in the Garden! See Macy's flat parade, then gape from atop the Empire State, where mighty Kong took a fall. Diamond jewelers join fur-clad window shoppers as herds of jaywalkers cross against the light in the Garment District. Graffiti-scrawled boards near the Flatiron Building enclose pits of unconsolidated sediment Consolidated Edison must dig. Workers repair Gramercy Park cables, reroute Chelsea steam pipes, plug a burst main flooding streets by Union Square. (Tap water flows down from the Catskills in deep tunnels; garbage is hauled to a landfill at Fresh Kills.) The riverfront was filled for barnacle-crusted piers, and Minetta Brook wetlands became lots in Greenwich Village. A sweatshop horror: 146 locked-in women lost their lives in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. Watch skateboard demons cavort among panhandlers as old men play chess near the arch in Washington Square, N.Y.U. students, art film fans, coffee drinkers, & East Village poets crowd smoky joints on Saturday night; some cross (the Holland Tunnel) back out to New Jersey. Cheap gallery space is a memory in SoHo; cast-iron lofts rent high, as do TriBeCa warehouses. A bag lady seeks warmth huddled over a sidewalk grate on the Bowery, where Stuyvesant's farm once spread in old New Amsterdam. The original steal (this island, traded for $24 in beads) lies plastered in muth and concrete, obscured like the African Burial Grounds. A Lower East Side delicatessen sells good chicken soup; enjoy zuppa di pesca at the Festival of San Gennaro, or bird's nest soup in Chinatown.

us,"Hip-Hopping Onto the Late-Night Scene         n    BY LISA W. FODERARO     FOR more than three years, television executives have bemoaned the void left by Arsenio Hall, the first successful black host of a late-night talk show. They have waited patiently for someone who had the power to enthrall young African-American viewers while crossing over to a wider audience, someone capable of delivering a high-energy show that would make the two reigning princes of late night, Jay Leno and David Letterman, look downright dowdy.              Well, they may have found him, in stereo.     Earlier this month, on the same night, at the same time (11 in New York City), Keenen Ivory Wayans and Chris Spencer, both Black comedians with neat goatees and neon smiles, made their debuts from Los Angeles. In a droll nod to their syndication showdown, Mr. Spencer, whose show, ''Vibe,'' is seen in New York City on WWOR, Channel 9, pulled out a congratulatory fruit basket sent him by Mr. Wayans. As he began his monologue, chomping on a plum, he collapsed as though poisoned.     There is another new show in the wings with the potential to draw a young, multiracial audience. The basketball legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson is now taping pilots for a late-night talk show he is developing with Twenthieth Television, the syndication division of Fox Studios. Called ''The Magic Hour,'' it is scheduled to begin early next year, ideally after either Mr. Wayans or Mr. Spencer has called it a night, those involved in the production whisper.     Of the two new hosts already on the air, 39-year-old Mr. Wayans, whose show is on WNYW, Channel 5, in New York, has the edge in terms of name recognition. He was the creator and star of the Emmy Award-winning comedy series ''In Living Color'' and has also had success in films, as a star of ''Hollywood Shuffle'' and as writer, director and star of ''A Low Down Dirty Shame.''     The set of his new show is a pastiche of shape and color: no desk, just a couple of modernist couches, a coffee table resembling a giant peanut and a sprawling fish tank that glows lavender. Mr. Wayans's sartorial tastes range from Flashy to bizarre. One night he sported a shiny black jumpsuit, another night a slinky chartreuse shirt, all topped off with clunky jewelry.     Despite the trappings, Mr. Wayans has an easy way about him. He seemed preternaturally calm on opening night in contrast to one of his guests, the actor Brendan Fraser, who nearly gulped with nervousness. And Mr. Wayans loves to coax his guests into talking about sex. Pamela Anderson Lee, the former star of ''Baywatch,'' volunteered that her libido knew no bounds now that she was pregnant.     ''Has pregnancy slowed you down?'' Mr. Wayans asked.     ''Your sex drive is through the roof,'' she exclaimed. ''There are no sharp corners on any of the furniture at home.''     Then there are the off-the-wall comedy sketches and mock commercials. A public-service announcement with the message ''Smoke: because holes in throats are pretty cool'' showed a nicotine-addicted grandmother blowing out birthday candles and playing a saxophone through her neck. Another, a takeoff on commercials for exercise contraptions, advertised the ''Sexerciser'' for $29.95, with vigorous demonstrations.     ''Keenen has a big following that loves and adores him, which is a great help,'' said Charlie Parsons, a British television producer who is collaborating on the show as an executive producer with Mr. Wayans and Eric L. Gold. '' 'In Living Color' was universal in its comedic appeal. This new show has a generational appeal. The target audience is younger and hipper. Everyone is welcome.''     Mr. Parsons said that while Mr. Leno's and Mr. Letterman's shows were ''incredibly well produced,'' he believed there was ''definitely an audience that isn't being serviced by them.''     The star of ''Vibe,'' 29-year-old Mr. Spencer, is after the same audience. ''We're just trying to add some flavor to the milk,'' he said in an interview. Many viewers ''left the whole late-night arena after Arsenio,'' he added. ''There are a bunch of artists who don't get the opportunities because of the style of music they play or the kinds of jokes they tell.''     While Mr. Spencer may not have a household name, the creator of his show, Quincy Jones, does. A musician, composer, and record and film producer who has won 26 Grammy Awards, Mr. Jones has styled the show on his three-year-old magazine, ''Vibe.''     His connections have given the scenes and on the screen. An executive producer, Daniel Kellison, helped start ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and before that spent eight years with Mr. Letterman. The director, Sandra Fullerton, held the same job with Mr. Hall from 1989 to 1994.     Mr. Jones appeared for 10 minutes at the start of the first show before handing it over to Mr. Spencer. in those few minutes, he schmoozed with President Clinton about America's youth in an appearance taped at the White House. Then Mr. Jones told viewers, ''No matter what your age or race or sex, 'Vibe,' will be an equal opportunity entertainer.''     The guests that night included Whoopi Goldberg, Brandy, Anthony Edwards of ''E.R.,'' the female rap group Salt-n-Pepa and, by satellite, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee.     The choice of the relatively unknown Mr. Spencer is not as odd as it seems. He is, after all, young, handsome and very funny. ''How often is a brother given an opportunity to go into a million homes and not be arrested?'' he quipped upon first taking the stage.     A peripatetic stand-up comic, Mr. Spencer, who favors expensive-looking, trendy jackets, has appeared on MTV, ''In Living Color'' and Mr. Hall's show. He also has close ties to the Wayans family. He had a starring role in the film ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,'' which Keenen Wayans produced. And in the publicity kit for ''Vibe,'' Mr. Spencer named Mr. Wayans's brother, Damon, the comedian and actor, as one of his role models, along with Jack Paar and Mohammed Ali.     Like ''The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,'' ''Vibe'' strives for an integrated guest list. A recent show included the actress Demi Moore and the model Naomi Campbell. The studio audience is also integrated, roughly half white and half black. Only the musical guests seem one-dimensional, with the focus on rap and soul. But Mr. Spencer said he saw nothing wrong with that.     ''Hip-hop is now pop,'' he said. ''When you see Japanese kids getting their hair fried so it looks like an Afro and wearing pants falling off, that's not about acting black. That's about pop culture.''          Photos: On the cover: Keenan Ivory Wayans is host of his own late-night show. (Buena Vista Television); Chris Spencer, above right, is the host of the new ''Vibe.''

She and her late husband were early residents of Foulkeways, the first Quaker retirement community. She was graduated from Schoharie High School, age 16, and Albany School of Nursing, age 20. She was a nurse with the Henry Street Settlement House on NYC's lower eastside at the time of her marriage to Lewis A. Eldridge Jr., in 1928. The defining period in her life covered the next three years in Berlin, Germany. There she heard Richard Strauss conduct ''Solome,'' Furtwangler conducting Beethoven and Schnabel playing Schubert and Mozart. This lead to a life-long love of classical music and the German people. On return to Great Neck, NY, she studied voice with Alda Astori and later in Rensselaerville, NY, organized summer concerts. Deeply disturbed by the Second World War, she was lead to the Quaker faith. She was secretary of the New York Yearly Meeting, and the library at the Albany Friends Meeting was named in her honor. Survivors include a son Roswell Eldridge of Rensselaerville, NY, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1977, and her oldest son, Lewis A. Eldridge III, of Oyster Bay, NY, died in 1982. A memorial service will take place in September in Rensselaerville, NY.

us,Industrial Strength Bleakness,"The only thing wrong with the title of Jeff Torrington's new novel, THE DEVIL'S CAROUSEL (Harcourt Brace, $23), is that it turns out to be too upbeat. If there's a bleaker, grimier, more desperate existence than that of a Scottish auto worker yoked to the Centaur Car Company's assembly line (otherwise known as ''the Widow'' or ''the Devil's Carousel''), it would have to be hell itself - and even there, it couldn't possibly rain as much. The Centaur Car Company is clearly on its last legs, and so too are its employees. After receiving a rare sick-leave pass, one of them staggers home, only to lose his shoes and his life in the gutter outside a fishmonger's shop; a collection taken up for his widow nets a pitiful amount because there have been so many similar appeals. Another worker teeters into insanity upon learning that his years-old employee ID number has changed; a third fakes his own death, with disastrous results. Torrington (who won the Whitbread Prize for his first novel, ''Swing Hammer Swing!'') uses unapologetically blunt prose, painting the world of the factory floor in vivid, lurid detail. Occasional bouts of dark humor - frequently delivered via typescript facsimiles of the plant's renegade employee newsletter - do more to underscore the bitterness of the characters than lighten the relentlessly despairing mood. More a series of loosely connected short stories than a single narrative, the novel progresses in fits and starts, much like the factory's beleaguered assembly line. The effect perfectly echoes the fragmented lives of its subjects, making ''The Devil's Carousel'' a jolting ride. Liam Callanan",1997-08-31T05:00:00+0000

us,Seeing Themselves,"The collective identity of the French people during the world wars and the forging of that identity are the subjects of the ambitious book THE FRENCH IN LOVE AND WAR: Popular Culture in the Eras of the World Wars (Yale University, $35). Charles Rearick, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, focuses on the little people, frequently setting one of them off against an Other - the rich man, the foreigner or the cosmopolitan. The ''myth of the people,'' Rearick writes, ''has had a long history and a changing cast of characters.'' In France that cast has traditionally included such figures as Joan of Arc and Marianne, the mythical symbol of the Republic; Rearick extends the cast to include entertainers like Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Jean Gabin and Edith Piaf, all of whom, for one reason or another, served as representations of the French people in the years from World War I to the end of World War II. These became important during that period as a result of dramatic changes in French society, in which workers and the lower middle classes gained political and economic strength, thus becoming important voters as well as consumers of mass culture. Therefore they determined which images would be provided for them as much as they served as models for those images. While ''The French in Love and War'' is well researched, well documented and full of interesting details (plus more than 125 illustrations), it is annoyingly redundant. Moreover, Rearick's narrative drive frequently stalls as he devotes large chunks of space and time to explicating the stories of popular songs and films of the day. Despite these quibbles, this is a valuable and informative book that goes a long way toward proving one of Rearick's central theses, that ''inexact or distortional, the myths and symbols of popular culture still matter historically for the part they played in organizing experience and representing identity.''
