Many executives of airlines, hotels and the companies that package tours now foresee the day when virtually all vacation travel by airboth within the United States and to foreign destinationswill be by cutrate charter rather than scheduled flights. These charters are expected to open up whole new worlds for the average American in this era of increasing leisure time, but there are pitfalls to be avoidedsnags and snarls that could ruin an eagerly awaited vacation. (A list of suggestions to guard against them is presented later in this article.) A year ago the Federal Government began a progressive easing of the regulations governing charter flights, making them increasingly available to the general public. Since then charters have proliferated. In the year just ended, according to airline industry estimates, about half the travelers from the East Coast to Las Vegas and more than 30 percent to Hawaii went by charter. Of the 10 million or so transAtlantic air passengers last year, 26.5 percent were on charters, and the proportion is expected to climb sharply this year because of new regulations that allow further reductions in price.",1977-01-02T05:00:00+0000

Cambridge is a proud matriarch, often complacent in its rivalry with Oxford. Unlike Oxford, it is not overwhelmed by the pressures of industrial development in its suburbs. The peaceful villages of the Cambridgeshire countryside are less frequented than those surrounding Oxford. So, in the indignant words of a Cambridge student handbook, the colleges can maintain their 2,800 servants on rockbotton wages; tradition is preserved and the cameras keep clicking at the quaintness of it all. How long this romantic idyll or economic repression will continue is one of the town's greatest topics.

us,Screen: 'The Goalie's Anxiety':Lonely Madness,"WHEN WE FIRST see Josef Bloch (Arthur Brauss), the goalie, he is isolated in a long shot at the far end of the soccer field. The frantic activity of the game at the other end of the field has no apparent relation to him. He walks around impatiently. He wipes his hands. He is a lean man, all tendons that have been tense so long that even the most ordinary gesture seems to be a kind of tic.Suddenly the game closes in on him and Josef Bloch, who has been waiting for this moment, fails to prevent the score. He displays no impatience with himself, no bitterness, no visible emotion whatsoever. For, as we learn in Wim Wenders's superlative screen version of Peter Handke's novel ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,"" Josef Bloch has been disconnected.This precise and beautiful German film, directed by Mr. Wenders and written by him and Mr. Handke, was originally shown in New York at the Museum of Modern Art's 1972 New Directors/New Films series, but it is only now having its commercial premiere at the Film Forum, where it opened yesterday. It will be seen there at 7:30 P.M. today through Sunday, and at the same time next weekend, Thursday through Sunday.Like the Handke novel, the film will be describedincorrectly, I thinkas dispassionate, which is not to see the film, or the book for its style, which is about as self-effacing as a style can be without disappearing entirely. However, ""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" is seething with feelings that are so ambiguous, so terrifying, that like Josef Bloch, the film can recognize them only obliquely, as if trying to put a good face on things by refusing to make a fuss.""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" is a carefully composed, unhysterical record of one man's coming-apart. At the end of his last game. Josef Bloch wanders aimlessly around a Vienna that is both familiar to him and as strange as the inside of a beehive. He drinks. He plays the jukebox. He sleeps. He gets mugged. He picks up a girl and goes to her apartment at the edge of an airfield. They make love. The next morning they have breakfast. He thinks he sees ants in the teapot. He strangles her. He leaves. He buys a newspaper and gets on a bus. . . .Those sentences suggest the tempo of the film, but not its impact on the viewer who, by being required to fill in explanations the film makers resolutely refuse to give, becomes drawn into Josef Bloch's madness in a way that leaves one breathless and high. It's as exciting as any conventionally successful and high suspense film.Mr. Handke's novelshe is perhaps better known here as a playwrighthas been associated with France's nouveau roman and the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet. The methods are similar, but there is a major, crucial difference. Mr. Robbe-Grillet's novels and films seem bent on demonstrating the boredom of alienated man by turning their backs on the reader and boring him into a stupor. ""The Goalie's Anxiety"" is also about disconnection, but the novelist's impulse is furious, rather than bored. His work has the vigor of a revolutionist.Since ""The Goalie's Anxiety"" was first shown in New York, Mr. Wenders has been represented by two later films seen at the New York Film Festival, ""Alice in the Cities"" and ""Kings of the Road,"" but because neither has had the force and cool beauty of this film, I would assume he needs a collaborator of Mr. Handke's discipline and intellectual enthusiasm.""The Goalie's Anxiety"" doesn't contain one redundant shot or unnecessary camera movement. For the most part, the camera seldom moves. It is content to record the actors walking into and out of a frame, more or less in the passive manner of Josef Bloch as he regards the odd behavior of himself and of the strangers in the world around him.This simplicity, as opposed to the fancy photography and the modish fragmentation of time and image favored by Mr. Robbe-Grillet (""L'Immortelle,"" ""The Man Who Lies""), has the effect of making us see people, objects and bits of action with a clarity so stunning that they come to have for us as much menace and mystery as they have for the mad Josef Bloch.""The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick"" is a remarkable, fascinating film, one that suggests, among many other things, that the nouveau film, if indeed there is to be such a thing, will be plain, unadorned, direct, not an accumulation of fashionable mannerisms.",1977-01-14T05:00:00+0000

In his essay on Daumier, written in 1890, James speaks of the irony, skepticism, pessimism that flower most aggressively in the art of the newspaper caricature. He doubted that American journalism, although even then flourishing, as James said, on a humorous and irreverent basis, was ready for a graphic art that vigorously satirized American manners and morals He was wrong, of course.

The pound has shrunk but not the poundageto judge, at least, by the new British movie ""Get Charlie Tully.""This offering of ponderous jokes and broad acting, which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, has a sneaky appeal. It is not camp. The jokes are often old and corny, but we are not asked to laugh on the grounds that they are old and corny. We are asked to laugh on the ground that they are funny.It is refreshing. It ismaybe sentimentality is involvedtouching, like a parade of Chelsea pensioners. And some of the jokes, in fact, are funny.At the start, the arch con man, Charlie Tully, is sitting in a Buckingham Palace officenever mind howselling a gullible Italian industrialist the hand of Princess Anne for a consideration of several hundred thousand pounds. At the end, Charlie Tully is dressed as a monsignor and selling the Sistine Chapel to a pair of American tourists.In between, he is pursued by the law, by a gang of rough London gangsters and by a Mafia detachment seeking to avenge the Italian industrialist. Apart from these diversionary incidents, Tully's main concern is finding the Swiss bank number that harbors the Princess Anne bridal money. It was deposited there by an associate on whom a wall fell before he could disclose the number.As it happens, the number is tattooed, in sections, on the bottoms of four young women with whom the associate was on friendly terms. A lot of dressing and undressing takes place.As Tully, Dick Emery is energetic and sometimes funny, though his timing and mugging are such that you get the feeling that a cheering audience has been placed behind the camera. Far better is Ronald Fraser as the associate. Mr. Fraser has two owl eyes, a ginger mustache, a long nose stuffed full of adenoids and a lovely faith that things will turn out well. Unfortunately there's that wall.The movie is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"").

us,Film: Muscles Galore:Bulging Mystique,"LIKE THE HUGE LIPS grown by Ubangi women, the startlingly overdeveloped musculature of professional body-builders is apt to seem more of a deformity than an achievement to outsiders.At the least, the body-building mystique as well as its physical results have a good deal of the bizarre about them. As Arnold Schwarzenegger, the best-known of the champions, puts it, ""Some people look at you and think it's kind of strange.""Mr. Schwarzenegger is the central figure in ""Pumping Iron,"" an interesting, rather slick and excessively long documentary about the small but intensely competitive world of body-building. It opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater.In the picture's first section we see Mr. Schwarzenegger, a handsome man with a body as knotted as an especially lumpy vegetable soup, training, giving exhibitions and talking about his profession.As they practice swelling their muscles and striking posesall the time looking at themselvesthe body-builders have the self-absorbed look of fashion models. In some casesparticularly with one contender, Louis Ferrignothe mournful expression peering out of all those deltoids, triceps and latissima dorsi calls up an image that skitters around a while before it is pinned down.It is, in fact, that of the 90-pound weakling to whom the body-building ads were directed. It is not so much as if the body-builders had become muscular, but as if they had put on great muscle overcoats. The hungry face protrudes from the collar.Or, in the case of Mr. Schwarzenegger, the pleased face. The Austrian-born athlete has become rich from his profession and its spin-offs, is perpetually surrounded by beautiful women, and to cap it all, is a witty if not always convincing exponent of the body-building philosophy.The first thing the outsider realizes, watching the film, is that the object of all that weight-lifting is neither strength nor prowess, but appearance. Mr. Schwarzenegger calls himself a sculptor of his own body. ""You look in the mirror and see you need a little more deltoids to make symmetry. So you exercise and put more deltoid on. A sculptor will slap stuff on.""The second part of the film is about the world championship contest, held in South Africa, to choose Mr. Olympia.It concentrates particularly on Mr. Schwarzenegger, the titleholder, and Mr. Ferrigno, a principal challenger.The desperate intensity of Mr. Ferrigno, drilled with ferocious concentration by his father, contrasts with the more urbane attitude of the Austrian champion. At one point, Mr. Schwarzenegger practices weightlifting, using two women as barbells.But the appearance is deceptive, Mr. Schwarienegger explains with a candor that seems more appealing than it really isonce you think about ithow he ""messes up his opponents."" He talks to them. He uses the guarded camaraderie that precedes the competition to play all kinds of one-up games.One of his stories is about the advice he gave to a novice who was competing with him at Munich. He told him that the judges set great store by a theatrical delivery. He suggested that the man scream while doing his poses. Higher screams when the arms were raised. Deep screams when they were lowered.""After about four poses they dragged him off,"" Mr. Schwarzenegger recalls, laughing.Obviously, in the body-building trade it is a question of mind over muscles.The movie is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). There is an occasional expression of the kind one might expect to hear in a weightlifter's training camp or practically anywhere else.",1977-01-19T05:00:00+0000

Both parties retire from the field.Does anyone call the police or get a doctor or do anything rational? Of course not. If anyone had, there would be no movie called ""Shoot,"" the miniminded, bloodthirsty, supposedly antigun movie that opened yesterday at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters.""Shoot,"" a Canadian film directed by Harvey Hart, written by Dick Berg and based on a novel by Douglas Fairbairn, apparently hopes to be making a statement about the mayhem that can be caused by easy access to weaponry, but most of the time the film doesn't believe in itself. When one character says to another, ""I can't believe it really happened,"" it's as if the film makers were trying to disassociate themselves from the melodramatic nonsense they've concocted.Rex and his pals, including Lou (Ernest Borgnine), are portrayed as right-wing gun nuts. You can tell this because they have American flags in their dens, tell dirty stories and treat their wives badly. When Rex prepares to go hunting, he gets great pleasure slowly lubricating the barrel of his shotgun. Rex has problems all right, but passing a gun-control law isn't going to solve them.It's the conceit of this film that instead of reporting the riverside confrontation, Rex and his friends, as well as their unknown enemies, would decide to fight it out in earnest the following weekend with high-powered rifles, machine guns and bazookas, all borrowed from the National Guard. ""We're trying to prevent a slaughter,"" says Rex, ""not to start one,"" which is meant to identify Rex with various ludicrous foreign-policy statements.The overstuffed point of the film is that certain men need to fight to express themselves and that in this need there's a lesson for mankind. Perhaps, but it's a very simplistic point and a drearily foolish movie in which everyone does badly, including Kate Reid, who has a briefly embarrassing scene as the whisky-soaked, sex-starved widow of the murdered hunter.",1977-01-20T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Day That Shook World' A Quaint Film,"Despite an awesome title, ""The Day That Shook the World,"" which arrived at the Festival yesterday, is more quaint than explosive. As a dramatization of the fulminating events leading up to and including the royal murders that triggered World War I, it is a fragmented revival of the past that evolves largely as a picturesque adventure rather than portentous, persuasive history.Filmed well over a year ago on authentic Yugoslav locations, this ""Day That Shook the World"" appears to have been cut somewhat confusingly, for all of the obviously good, serious intentions of its little-known director, Veljko Bulajic, and his American scenarist, Paul Jarrico.Although they focus in captivating color on the June 1914 assassination in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his morganatic wife, Sophie, their plotters, the burning nationalistic issues and the regal machinations that led to that fateful day are touched on in a succession of brief, fuzzy intrigues. The hatred of Bosnian, Serbian, Muslim and other nationalities of Hapsburg dominance is merely indicated. And the backgrounds of the seemingly educated, mostly youthful student-conspirators are also glossed over.If memory serves, photographs of the Archduke and his spouse were portraits of a rather heavy-set, mature couple, but in the persons of Christopher Plummer and Florinda Bolkan they are a strikingly photogenic, regal and loving pair. Mr. Plummer not only adores the equally loving, stately, brunette Miss Bolkan and their three children but also carries off official duties at military maneuvers and dinners with the same brashness he evinces in a mild clash with Franz Joseph, the irascible, octogenarian emperor.Maximilian Schell plays the role of the tortured, eventually ill-fated, bearded revolutionary who trains the callow assassins, with simple, glum determination. Among the largely Yugoslav supporting cast, Irfan Mensur plays Gavrilo Princip, the young conspirator who fired the fatal shots. Like his colleagues, he is simply a harried type more involved in a series of escapes from detection by the police than in character delineation.In guiding his fairly large cast, Mr. Bulajic has succeeded in creating a good deal of melodrama, some tension and a few tepid romantic interludes. And Jan Curik, his cinematographer, has captured the scenic charms of an operetta-like countryside and the visual qualities of vintage automobiles, colorful uniforms and sham battles with toy-like soldiers in maneuvers. Unfortunately, their ""Day That Shook the World"" is a footnote to history that is rarely moving.",1977-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"Movie House, Yes, The Movie, No:Fake Feathers","IT IS DARK but the moon is stage-bright. The camera moves elegantly through very expensive foliageeven oak leaves shine like gardenia plants. We could be back in ""Rebecca"" on the road to Manderley, but no such luck. That might be fun. We are in the drunken, anxiety-ridden fantasies of Clive Langham (John Gielgud), a second-rate, 78-year-old English novelist who is having a bad night while thinking he is dying and jotting down a few notes for his next book.We are also at the start of Alain Resnais's disastrously ill-chosen comedy, ""Providence,"" the French director's first film in English that yesterday opened atand openedRugoff Theaters' beautiful new Cinema 3 on the lower level of the Plaza Hotel. Cinema 3, which has been done entirely in soft golds, beiges and grays, and is so comfortable one would like to nap there, Cinema 3 would be an unqualified smash without the picture.""Providence"" is based on an original screenplay by David Mercer, the English writer (""Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment"") who is better known as a playwright, and, indeed, in spite of all of the film's brisk, desperate cutting around among old Clive Langham's fantasies, the film has the static manner of an easily mountable but fatally empty play script.The shock of ""Providence"" is how Mr. Resnais (""Hiroshima, Mon Amour,"" ""La Guerre Est Finie,"" etc.) could have fallen for such windy pretensions. Is it because English is not his first language or could it be that he's echoing a statement made within the film by Clive Langham to the effect that ""style is feeling""?If so, the feeling of ""Providence"" is the kind of cold chic that can be easily purchased by hiring the right cameraman, set designer, composer and actors who, in addition to Mr. Gielgud, include Dirk Bogarde, Ellen Burstyn, David Warner and Elaine Stritch.To say that they are miscast would be to suggest that other people might do better, which I doubt. Each performance is as bereft of real style (meaning, point) as the material.This material is what may have you swatting an innocent Cinema 3 usher as you leave. Most of the film is composed of old Clive's ""notes"" for his new novel, which involves his son (Mr. Bogarde) who is a priggish barrister, his long - suffering daughter - in - law (Miss Burstyn), another young man (Mr. Warner) and his son's mistress (Miss Stritch), a character created out of whole cloth by Clive in the image of his own dead wife, who committed suicide.As the old man tosses and turns in his bed, drinking white wine and complaining of pains in his rectum, we see his ""characters"" as he imagines them and as they sometimes refuse to do his bidding. The old man, it's soon obvious, has imposed on these perfectly decent folk all of his own fears and guilts about a lifetime spent in philandering, selfishness, disinterest in his family, while he enjoyed a reputation as a writer he never really deserved. The structure is complicated but sadly un-complex.The setting of Clive's ""novel"" is one of those unidentified countries that, in meaning to be anywhere, is actually nowhere. Clive wants his daughter-in-law to have an affair with Mr. Warner, but she balks. The country they inhabit seems to be in a stage of seige, which could be a cheap reference to Allende's Chile, or to the death that Clive awaits.There are so many references to other films in ""Providence"" (""Rebecca,"" werewolf movies, Terence Rattigan potboilers, Hollywood films, good and bad, for which Miklos Rozsa, the composer for ""Providence,"" also did the score), that one suspects that Mr. Renais and Mr. Mercer might have some thoughts about the state of popular entertainment, though nothing emerges except a dreary demonstration.At one point, Clive says of his fantasies, ""Oh, well, if one has led a fatuous life, one might as well have fatuous nightmares,"" but the movie makers can't sidestep their own responsibilities so easily. Aside from the true feeling and intelligence that Mr. Gielgud, a magician as well as a great actor, occasionally can bring to a line, Mr. Mercer's method is to have his characters toss wanly sardonic aphorisms back and forth, while Mr. Resnais's is to make everything look alternately menacing and posh. ""Providence"" is a lot of fuss and fake feathers about nothing.",1977-01-26T05:00:00+0000
