Nine of them are gathered in this photograph, B-24 fliers who have just finished their training and are poised for their Pacific passage. Four crouch in the foreground. Blackie, their dog, holds steady for the camera between the tail gunner's legs. The fliers are fresh-faced and confident, their caps tilted at rakish angles and their flight-jacket collars turned up for maximum effect. Their picture is one of those images that makes you proud to be an American and shows you that they were, too. But this portrait, similar to so many of its vintage in so many ways, differs from them in one respect: Six months after it was taken, five of these men from the bomber called Lonesome Lady, plus a sixth who was not in the photo, died as prisoners of war when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,"MR. REAGAN, GENEVA IS NOT APPOMATTOX","The meeting between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko scheduled for early January offers President Reagan a unique opportunity to get the arms control agreement he now describes as his first priority. The Soviet Union has agreed to talk, without conditions, about ''the entire complex of questions concerning nuclear and space weapons.'' In order to agree to meet for this purpose, the Soviet leaders have had to swallow a year's worth of verbiage. They walked out of the talks on intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe when deployment of United States Pershing 2 and ground- launched cruise missiles began last November. Then they refused to set a date for resumption of the strategic arms reductions talks on intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine- launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers. Until last week, they had insisted on removal of all United States missiles from Europe as the price for their return. Does the evident Soviet eagerness to get back to the bargaining table constitute a victory for President Reagan's policy of talking tough and presenting tough negotiating demands? It may - if he knows how to be a good winner. Konstantin U. Chernenko and his colleagues are clearly concerned about having to match United States technology in a competition in space weapons. Moreover, the stagnant Soviet economy will be hard put to bear the heavy costs of an uncontrolled arms race. But it would, in my opinion, be a sad mistake to conclude that these pressures will lead the Soviet Union now to accept the United States proposals on intermediate-range and intercontinental-range nuclear weapons presented in 1982 and 1983 - proposals that the former Secretary of State, Alexander M. Haig Jr., has characterized as ''absurd'' and ''non-negotiable.''",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Horst, Irving Penn and Francesco Scavullo are featured in publications ranging from the unassuming (Mrs. Dahl-Wolfe) to the sumptuously overblown (Mr. Scavullo). This isn't to say that more traditional fare - coffeetable books devoted to glorious views of American landscapes, photojournalistic reports on exotic peoples, monographic tributes to artists of the camera - is missing. It's just that these categories no longer seem . . . well, as fashionable. That fashion should surpass both art photography and socially concerned reporting on the current scene can be taken as one more sign of the times, which seem to favor the appearance of seriousness over the truly serious and the tried and true over the new and possibly disruptive. (Most of the pictures in the fashion books have been published before, in their original incarnations as images designed to move the goods of the garment industry.) Fashion also represents an arena in which photography's artistic capabilities collide with its uses as an instrument of mass-media persuasion - an interaction these days much on the mind of cultural critics, if not book publishers. In second place in the race for the holiday dollar are books that shout ''This is America'' in beautiful color pictures of beautiful scenery. These are, as a rule, lavishly produced, splendidly reproduced, oversize and expensive. Unfortunately, also as a rule, the photographs show us little we haven't seen before.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

After World War II, there was pioneering work in wood by Louise Nevelson, Louise Bourgeois and Mark di Suvero, but wood remained so much outside the late Modernist mainstream that, for example, their work was all but excluded from the new, but historically conceived painting and sculpture installation at the Museum of Modern Art.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,ITALIANS COOK THE BOOKS AND TAX COLLECTORS SIMMER,"It was a cause that all Italian small shopkeepers could believe in - opposing the Government's efforts to get them to start paying taxes, which seemed an outrageous notion in a land known for its mistrust of the state. So one day in October, tranquility descended on central Rome, giving the usually rambunctious place the feeling of a piazza in a country town at lunch time. Shop owners pulled their shutters down and joined in a nationwide strike. Immediately, there was talk of a Government crisis. The strike protested a proposal to raise $5.5 billion in tax revenues and to close a large budget deficit by imposing new rules designed to make evasion more difficult for shopkeepers. Last year, Finance Minister Bruno Visentini noted, one million shopkeepers declared average incomes of about $3,600. Their shop assistants declared incomes of about $5,700, 60 percent higher than the boss. Something was wrong, ''absolutely disgusting,'' Mr. Visentini said. His attempt to crack down threatens one of Italy's hallowed traditions. It also raises anew an issue that economists, businessmen and workers have debated for years: How large is Italy's ''black'' or illegal economy, and what should be done about it? The term ''black economy'' is often shunned here. In a land where consciousness of the Mafia is high, it has a sinister sound. In fact, the lawbreaking extends far more broadly, including shopkeepers and restaurant owners as well as small businesses in fields such as leather and clothing.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Rather than dwell on the past, they celebrated the recovery of hope. The change had come with dizzying speed. Only in late August did the dictatorship confirm the date of the elections, lift press censorship and allow political parties to begin campaigning. In just three months, a country that used to be a democratic model for the rest of Latin America cheerfully returned to normality. But like others who have recently switched from military to civilian rule, Uruguayans expect far more from democracy - and from the centrist Government of President-elect Julio Maria Sanguinetti that is due to take office March 1 - than it may be able to deliver. Last week, factory workers, who earn $50 per month and have seen real wages halved since 1969, spoke of their hopes for higher wages and more jobs. ''The dictatorship is killing us with hunger,'' a young woman remarked as she waited to vote. ''How can we live off what we earn? Things have to improve.'' But the economy is caught in a crisis that defies easy solution. Gross domestic product has fallen by 20 percent in three years, unemployment stands at 15 percent and inflation is running at 50 percent annually. Uruguay also has a $5.3 billion foreign debt which, for a country of three million inhabitants, is higher per capita than that of Brazil, the world's largest debtor.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,ART,"THE BIBLE AND ITS PAINTERS. By Bruce Bernard. Preface by Lawrence Gowing. Illustrated. 300 pp. (Macmillan, $24.95.) This is not a reassuring title. Can this be yet another mindless anthology, superior only in the quality of its reproductions to ''The Seasons in Art,'' ''The Dog in Art'' and ''Athletics in Art''? It could be. But stick with me, because this is in fact an exceptionally intelligent and wide-ranging survey, selected and annotated by someone who knows what he is doing, and accompanied in each case by the relevant passage from the Bible. Above all, Bruce Bernard's anthology is powered by curiosity as to what painters made of the Bible, in this period or that, and what their paintings have to tell us not only about the Bible or about the period in which the pictures were painted, but about ourselves. As to that, Lawrence Gowing in his preface has much that is rewarding to say about ''the unparalleled dual value that Western society and its painters have given both to the outward, perceptible world and at the same time, in the same picturing, to what is inward and invisible, either ideal or compulsive.'' Put more plainly, there are in this book 274 paintings, every one of them reproduced in very good color, by painters who range from the accepted great masters, from Raphael to Rembrandt and beyond, to people like Leon Bonnat, Simeon Solomon and Briton Riviere, who would have been sent round to the servants' entrance even 20 years ago.",1984-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Indeed, it would be far more devastating than Washington's refusal to help during the 1975 fiscal crisis, which prompted the famous Daily News headline ''Ford to City: Drop Dead.''","Mr. Regan and some other political figures, including Manhattan's Representative Charles Rangel, see the deduction as a tax break for the rich. To end it would not affect poor people who do not use it and would, presumably, raise enough revenue that they might actually pay less in taxes. Technically that's right. But look again.

Medical authorities said a growing concern was the threat of epidemics and unanticipated health problems for the more than 50,000 people believed to have been stricken. (Page A1, Column 1.) Thousands of Indians continued to flood the hospitals of the anguished city of Bhopal two days after the gas leak from the insectide plant. Dozens of infants and children are lying next to each other, crying as they make an effort to breathe. Many victims just sit or lie on the ground. Their eyes are closed in pain, for the gas has caused a burning sensation in the eyes and distorted vision. Some are temporarily blind. (A1:2-4.)",1984-12-06T05:00:00+0000

A description of changes during the 19th and 20th centuries in the shapes of women, mainly in the size of their hips, breasts and waists - faces are ignored. Lois W. Banner identifies four types of beauty in the evolution of the American conception of the beautiful woman, including the buxom type (Lillian Russell) and the small, boyish type (Mary Pickford, Clara Bow). Our reviewer, Carl N. Degler, noting that all the types were ''drawn from the white upper class,'' called this 1983 book ''highly readable and broad ranging.'' THE PEGNITZ JUNCTION, by Mavis Gallant. (Graywolf, $6.) The novella and five short stories in ''The Peg nitz Junction'' are set in post- World War II Europe. William H. Pritchard wrote in The Book Review in 1973 that the stories were ''serious and crafted.'' In the final one, ''An Alien Flower,'' a refugee woman moves in with the narrator and the narrator's husband. Mr. Pritchard said the ''reader enters most fully into Mavis Gallant's imagination, artful and moral in 'An Alien Flower' to the extent that (the story) bears comparison with a Chekhov's or a Katherine Anne Porter's.''",1984-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Quickly, friends pass packages wrapped in brightly colored cloth and old newspapers up through windows to passengers already in their seats; farther down the platform, a straggler, struggling with a large basket containing a rooster - perhaps a fighting cock - jumps into the third-class car as the train slowly pulls out of the station, weaving its way through a tangle of tracks, creaking past old Dutch buildings with roofs of red tile and shanties with lacey roofs of tin.",1984-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Nor would it be correct to say that these new fashions are totally devoid of novelty. They are not, as the surge of shorter hemlines - midknee or above - from all the fashion capitals demonstrates. This is certainly a demonstrable departure from the longer lengths that have so dominated fashionable clothing during the last several seasons. Then, too, there is the international use of fabrics in vivid colors or vibrant prints; they have not been stylishly employed for some time.

us,IN SHORT,"Never having been the kind of fan who wanted to emulate a star, I've had some difficulty with the Michael Jackson craze. I probably had no problems with the Elvis Presley phenomenon because I was a teen-ager then, and it seemed perfectly natural for boys to adopt Presley's mannerisms and dress. Reading William McCranor Henderson's ''Stark Raving Elvis,'' then, brought back some memories. It's an entertaining novel about a teen-ager who has little going for him except his excellent, lifelike impression of Elvis. While his peers remember football games or the homecoming dance, ''Prince'' (since Elvis is the King) Byron Bluford of Portland, Maine, remembers the night in 1958 he stopped the Elks Club talent contest with his Presley imitation. Although he thinks he is doomed to spend the rest of his life on the assembly line at the local factory, Bluford so obsessively identifies with Elvis that he writes the singer's manager to say that he's ready when the King retires. After Presley dies, Bluford advances from local amateur shows to the big Elvis shoot-out in Las Vegas where he wins and receives one of the King's jump suits as well as a stint at a night club there. Dreams, however, when they become reality, are not always what we expect. The jump suit is too tight and soon Bluford is gaining even more weight, doing more drugs and surrounding himself with people who care only about his image. At this point, his face begins to ''show the kind of strain that comes from pushing too hard on the edge of youth,'' and he becomes involved in a struggle to discover who he really is. Mr. McCranor has written a funny, revealing novel that shows what happens to those who refuse to let youth go.",1984-12-09T05:00:00+0000

It touches on God, mammon and social thought, and it is both an exhortation and an indictment. Often it cites specific cases: The United States is insufficiently supportive of the International Development Association; unemployment is acceptable only at 3 or 4 percent; job-training programs should be expanded. Specifics, however, can be boring on television, although if we lose them, we lose much of the substance of the discussion.

Rusty amateur voices start practicing up for a round of hallelujahs and fa-la-las. Rock musicians study Phil Spector's Christmas album one more time; jazz players brush up on the chords of Thad Jones's ''Child Is Born'' and any carols susceptible to swing. Country and folk musicians look for well-known tunes that can use a twang. It's the annual, musical Christmas rush - and one thing to be glad of is that there's so much music appropriate to the season. This weekend, just in time to prevent overexposure to ''White Christas,'' the city's musical organizations will start cutting loose with the full range of Christmas repertory. As always, Handel's ''Messiah'' can be heard almost continuously from now through New Year's Day. One ''Messiah'' with a long-established reputation is the massive production by the Oratorio Society of New York, which gave its first ''Messiah'' in Andrew Carnegie's living room, and will appear Thursday at Carnegie Hall.

On closer inspection both ideas, of a ''Star Wars'' defense and of a ''nuclear winter,'' appear increasingly uncertain.","Even the supporters of Star Wars now emphasize the objective of defending missile silos, not cities, from Soviet attack.

The line follows a route marked by plastic piping filled with water. The idea, brought by a foreigner, is to find the contour of the land and create terraces that will save the soil and bring fertility. Elsewhere, other images prevail: highways built across wastelands that do not connect with other highways; flour mills rising up in places that cannot produce wheat; aid translated into suites of offices and fleets of cars. The conflicting pictures pose their own question: What do needy people really need? And, increasingly in this time of widening starvation in Africa, a further question arises: Who, ultimately, is responsible for answering those needs?Last week, an acrimonious dispute erupted between Ethiopia, which blamed the West for the extent of its crippling famine, and the United States Agency for International Development. The agency's administrator, M. Peter McPherson, accused Ethiopia of ''biting the hand'' that feeds it. To some, Mr. McPherson had a point. Ethiopia, arguably Africa's most rigid Marxist state, led by a regime that came to power in a series of blood-stained ''terrors,'' seems to spend more on the guns to fight its rebellious peoples in Eritrea and Tigre than it does on promoting the growth of food.",1984-12-16T05:00:00+0000

While on holiday with the Ski Club of India (the departing colonial masters are enjoying the countryside while they may), she meets Janet Rushton, an agent for the British Secret Service who confides that she has unearthed an international plot of monstrous proportions - a plot that no one else in British intelligence knows about. When Janet dies under questionable circumstances, Sarah finds herself left with a lapful of cryptic clues and unsought responsibilities. Love for Mother England and concern for the thousands whose destinies may be at stake lead her deeper into the intrigue, despite her conviction that ''people one knew did not do these things - plot and spy and lend themselves to murder.''

Among the subjects are Ingrid Bergman, Sophia Loren, Henry and Jane Fonda, Sidney Poitier, Paul Newman, Michael Redgrave and John Gielgud. In 1962 our reviewer, Alex Szogyi, called the collection ''a deeply moving experience. All essential facts are given; the interviews ring remarkably true; one is continually amazed at the hardiness of the breed.''

They said the unusual Soviet reaction involved at least 100 Soviet jet fighters, bombers and reconnaissance planes as well as surface vessels.

Mr. Chernenko had looked pale and unsteady on a visit to the bier of the late Defense Minister.

When the train pulled into the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station many of the riders got off, the tall window-opener included. When the doors closed, and just as the train started moving once more, the tall man's hand darted in, and just as quickly out of the open window whisking the fur hat off the head of the man sitting beside Miss Stock. The victim was understandably upset; his fellow passengers were at the same time dismayed and amazed at the swiftness of the action. They looked at the hatless man with sympathetic smiles. No one spoke. Then, from across the aisle, a young man reached into his pocket, leaned forward and silently offered his comb.

He taught at Cambridge University until he was 30, became the editor of Cornhill magazine at 40 and the editor of the great Dictionary of National Biography at 50, and he wrote hundreds of articles and more than 20 books. He had been a clergyman but found a few years after his ordination that he was no longer a believer and set out to knock down the intellectual foundations of belief. When he thought he had cleared the field of theologians he searched for the moral impulse among novelists and used his wit and critical penetration to make writers a moral force.

More importantly, Mr. Chace neglects to mention that Nicaragua's largest economic group (of peasants, artisans and cooperative members, comprising about 60 percent of the adult population) has benefited greatly from the Sandinistas' policies and, therefore, had every reason to vote for the Sandinista National Liberation Front, known as the F.S.L.N.

It was pleasant to learn that you expected our correspondence to be read in the international salons and boudoirs of the future.

(Freundlich Books, $15.95.) ''Season for War'' is a historical novel about 200 black soldiers who remain in the military after the Civil War. These ''buffalo soldiers'' - so called by newspaper reporters of the 1880's because of ''their bison-like carriage'' - go west to the Arizona Territory. They fight and eventually defeat the Apache nation and then herd the Indians to a reservation in Florida. Later they drift to Manila and Samar, where they fight Filipinos in the Spanish-American War. The plot that girds this action, however, involves three white Hoosiers who become involved in a love triangle. There is Henry Lawson, the rugged captain who leads the black soldiers, a war hero who has the sophistication of a boy playing king of the mountain; Edwin Carter Morrison, a war correspondent for The New York Sun whose stories have made this foolish captain into a hero; and Lucy Lawson, Henry's wife as well as Edwin's lover, a kind of kitsch Lady Macbeth who throws dinner parties on the prairie while urging the two men to promote their careers. But since P. J. Kluge's real concerns seem to be the victims of American imperialism at the close of the 19th century and the part the press played in making America's ''Manifest Destiny'' an accepted myth, these three characters for the most part emerge as merely representations of the silly, macho hero, the sensational, dishonest journalist and the repressed wife.",1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

''Mrs. Allison,'' the maid called. In the peaceful house Edward lay in his old room on the ground floor. A door opened onto the garden. He could see the rose bushes, the yellow, red, and white roses, the wilted ones, the tulip bed, the carnations, the constantly changing sky, and, beyond, hills with chestnut trees. Complete peace. Here a man could become well again. He put up with things for a few days. His mother was overjoyed to have him home. She sat at his bedside for hours at a time and held his hand. He remained reticent and often sent her away (he had a nurse) - didn't she have anything to attend to in the house? ''Let me be, Edward. Believe me, I have nothing to do. Allow me this pleasure.'' -",From ''Tales of a Long Night.'',1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"Playing the Peace Game The war game has been partially superseded by economics, the ''peace game,'' in the pursuit of national interest. If the United States is to strengthen its power . . . it must be prepared to play . . . through trade, aid, foreign investment, exchange of technology, measures to strengthen and stabilize the international monetary system - and its own economy. At the end of World War II, it was recognized that for the United States to achieve its international goals of rebuilding the world economy and preserving a secure structure of peace, high employment and economic growth would have to be maintained at home - to create the needed conditions for America's world role, to provide the resources needed by others, and to maintain an open and growing market for the goods of other countries. The world economic and financial crisis today requires a comparable effort on the part of the United States to keep its economy operating at a high level of employment, while curbing the inflation and high interest rates that have worsened the problems of others. International inflation stems from national sources, and the United States has been as great a culprit as any nation in breeding these evils. What is needed is the political courage, in the broad public interest, to curb the special- interest pressures that unbalance the budget, distort and waste national resources, including the arms race but by no means limited to the arms race.",From ''Economics in the Real World.'',1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,FROM DADDO WITH LOVE,"In his day, Rudyard Kipling was much esteemed for his way with a patriotic poem. But anyone familiar with ''The Jungle Book'' and ''Just So Stories'' will know that he derived endless pleasure, and inspiration, from children. Kipling was uncomfortable in the limelight, and his most treasured role was that of father to his three children - two of whom died tragically young. In ''O BELOVED KIDS'': Rudyard Kipling's Letters to His Children (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $16.95), Kipling's correspondence - selected and edited by Elliot L. Gilbert, the author of ''Kipling and the Critics'' and ''The Good Kipling'' - illuminates nine years (1906-1915) in the lives of two of those children, Elsie and John. Styling himself variously as ''Pater,'' ''Daddo'' and ''Thy Parent,'' Kipling cajoled, entertained and edified his ''Babes'' in hundreds of warm- hearted, totally unpatronizing letters filled with jolly sketches, puns and limericks. When John went away to school, his father prompted him, with imagination and good humor, on everything from hygiene to spelling. Kipling enlivened his letters with comforting news from home and compelling (albeit jingoistic) travelogues. Kipling's private life emerges as touchingly quotidian. He and his wife, Carrie (who is forever ailing and recuperating in these letters), spent the time between jaunts abroad tending their garden, walking the terriers, chatting with villagers, motoring about Sussex and, of course, writing letters. Contented in middle age and with the bulk of his achievements behind him, Kipling seemed happy to dedicate himself to the nurturing of his offspring.",1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

This apparent agreement, contained in papers being flown to California for President Reagan's perusal, was made known by officials who sought to end confusion over the Administraion's position. They said the Administration is prepared to be more flexible on procedural issues, which are the ostensible reason for the meeting between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8. (Page 1, Column 6.) Soviet and Chinese officials asserted that an important watershed had been passed in their long struggle to re-establish a good-neighborly relationship. The remarks were made as China's most important Soviet visitor in 15 years, Ivan V. Arkhipov, the First Deputy Prime Minister, departed for home.

us,"A LANDSCAPE ENGULFED BY BLIGHT Outside, the hills still loomed grayly through a mist of smoke and dirt and fog. A city rolled by and Danny was struck initially by how many aerials there were - hundreds and hundreds really, prodding the sky any which way - then by a subtler apprehension of the whole electrical network, the telephone poles and power lines, the huge humming ugly infra-system that usually dissolves from one's sight, and finally by a freshened perception of the ugliness of this whole Japanese countryside. There, right before his eyes, a steam shovel was tucking into another hillside. ''It's like New Jersey, south of Manhattan,'' Greg had prophesied of this terrain west of Kobe. But more accurately what this was was a hideous parody of all those old","sumie landscapes he'd seen with Carrie in the museums. A delicate mist- hung mountain landscape opening to unveil, faintly, in the distance - what? A corrugated shed, a power line, a smokestack, a derrick, a traffic-congested street, a larger-than- man-sized replica of a bowling pin. . . Here it was, spread out before him, the absolute refutation of that pervasive Japanese conviction - which he'd so much wanted all year long to believe with them - that all things could be assimilated into their remarkable land while leaving its soul intact.",1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,"Are Actors 'Cattle'? A few years prior to my arrival in Hollywood, I had been quoted as saying that all actors are cattle. I'm not sure in what context I might have made that statement. It may have been made in the early days of talkies in England, when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, they'd leave the set, I felt, much too early for a matinee, and I suspected they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theater. . . . Another reason for resentment is that I'd sometimes hear two actresses talking in a restaurant. One would say to the other, ''What are you doing now, dear?'' and the other one would say, ''Oh, I'm filming,'' in the same tone of voice as if she were saying, ''Oh, I'm slumming.'' And this raises a grievance I have against those people who come into our industry by way of the theater or as writers and who work in our medium for the money only. I think the worst culprits are the writers, particularly those who are here in Hollywood. . . . Some playwrights sign three-month contracts just in order to spend their winters in California.

The coins, like the Games, were a roaring success, netting $65 million to help develop young Americans for future Games. Now let's hope the Games don't go the way of the dies. That gloomy thought derives from the disappointing results of the International Olympic Committee's recent meeting on anti-boycott strategy. Three consecutive boycotts, led by black Africans in 1976, America in 1980 and Russia this year, have diluted three consecutive Olympics. The I.O.C. confirmed its feeble reputation by deciding to do virtually nothing. Boycott possibilities remain serious. The I.O.C. chairman, Juan Antonio Samaranch, has reported receiving veiled threats that Russia, Poland and Cuba might boycott the 1988 games in South Korea.","The executive committee wanted to penalize boycotters by excluding them from at least two future Games, a penalty with real teeth in it.",1984-12-30T05:00:00+0000

In the American South, recipes for Creole rice often call for cooking it in a vast amount of water before draining and buttering.

Despite incessant battering by developers, county and state 'improvements' and careless people, she manages to shine through her parks, her beaches and her ambience. Long Island is a survivor.'' Harriet Lesser of Woodmere, a writer: ''In 1984, Long Island was called upon to pay its environ mental dues. For the first time, garbage literally became a burning issue. Legislators and medical authorities were inundated with complaints about water pollution. In Nassau County, which has one of the highest cancer rates in the nation, the public finally began to assert itself - as evidenced by the protest over the Oceanside landfill. It had been going on for at least a decade. But the voices of the people were not heard until this year.
