The bankers liked the idea, and Crosby was a strong candidate. They had even given her an earlier loan to open Wevorces first office. But after four weeks, the bank was stalling and Crosby had yet to receive a cent. At the height of her frustration, she received an e-mail from a small group of private investors in Mountain View, Calif. They invited her to an interview and, after listening to her story, promised her $100,000 in exchange for a 7 percent stake in Wevorce. Crosby accepted on the spot.

It was an ensemble meant to announce its own modest aspirations. In retrospect, I wish Id worn a black cardigan instead of the green one, but in the eyes of Ikram Goldman, the owner of the store, the details wouldnt have mattered anyway, since the very premise of my message, to her, would be considered absurd: for Ikram, the whole point of clothing is to broadcast something bold.",2013-05-02T09:02:00+0000

us,Whats on Saturday,"9 P.M. (Showtime) SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN (2012) The director Lasse Hallstrom transforms Paul Tordays absurdist political satire  the tale of a visionary sheik (Amr Waked, above left, with Ewan McGregor) with unlimited financial resources intent on creating a recreational paradise for fishermen in a Middle Eastern desert  into a whimsical romantic comedy. Mr. Hallstrom is a shrewd commercial alchemist with a soft heart, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, and the result is the cinematic equivalent of turning salt into sugar. Mr. McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a British fisheries expert who is approached to evaluate the feasibility of the concept, which would involve either importing 10,000 North Atlantic salmon to Yemen from Britain, or using farmed salmon. Kristin Scott Thomas is Patricia Maxwell, the press secretary for the British prime minister, who seizes on the opportunity to distract the public from political conflicts and score points for her boss. And Emily Blunt is Harriet, the sheiks assistant, and the unspoken object of Freds affection, whose soldier boyfriend (Tom Mison) has gone missing in action. Whether Harriet and Fred will get together is a question that hovers over the movie, Mr. Holden said. The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt, whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the storys emotional center. And although the sheik is the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists, the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with international politics or terrorism, Mr. Holden said. It comes when those farmed salmon are finally released into the waters of their new home. Will they mill around in confusion or will they jump? It is enough to say that for this moment to be the films dramatic turning point is an indication of its softness.",2013-05-04T05:00:06+0000

But this puts Ms. Merkel in a bind, as she has to answer to German voters in September when the country holds parliamentary elections.

Zanuck (1934-2012), the Oscar-winning producer, through recollections of his childhood on the 20th Century Fox lot as the son of the studio head Darryl F. Zanuck and his wife, the actress Virginia Fox. When Richard had the chance to produce his first film, Compulsion, starring Orson Welles, he said his father told him: You know I had it a lot easier than you will have it. You have to overcome the circumstances of your birth. You carry baggage with you  I am the baggage you carry. When Darryl Zanuck was installed as chairman of the studio in the 1960s, he asked his son for a list of possible names to be appointed president of the company. Richard, above, submitted a piece of paper that read, simply, Me. Films like The Sound of Music (1965), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), M*A*S*H (1970) and The French Connection (1971) followed. But films like Doctor Dolittle (1967) and Hello, Dolly (1969) resulted in debt, and just before Christmas 1970, Richard was fired by his father. Shortly afterward his father also lost his job. This documentary, with Steven Spielberg as an executive producer, is followed at 9:45 by Driving Miss Daisy (1989), the Oscar best picture winner starring Jessica Tandy as a Southern widow and Morgan Freeman as her driver; it was the first movie produced by the Zanuck Company, which Richard and his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, founded in 1988.

At the time, the military covered its vehicles with suitcase-size splotches of green and brown. The pattern could trick the eye at a distance, but it didnt work well at close range. ONeill set out to find a better solution. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground, a test site in Maryland, he and his team put an armored personnel carrier out in a field and painted it with two-inch squares in woodland colors. From far away, the flecks seemed to coalesce into a large pattern, so that the vehicle blended with the trees behind it. The tiny squares also mimicked close-up details: individual leaves, tufts of grass and shadows on a branch. ONeills tests showed that this digital camouflage  as it would later be called  fooled the eye into seeing tank and landscape as one.",2013-05-10T11:00:24+0000

The first rediscovery took place during Leskovs own lifetime: in the 1880s, after he had suffered for years an almost total critical neglect,the young Chekhov hailed his oeuvre, declaring him a mixture of an elegant Frenchman and a defrocked priest. Leskov, Chekhov continued, was considerable.In the 1920s, the formalist critic Boris Eikhenbaum discerned Leskovs influence in the work of such diverse writers as Andrei Bely, Isaac Babel and Maxim Gorky, who frankly declared himself Leskovs disciple.And again, at the hands of critics like Walter Benjamin and Irving Howe, Leskov was the subject of yet another revival. To go back to certain earlier writers is to regain a sense of human possibility, Howe wrote. To go back to Leskov is to regain a sense of the passion, sometimes the joy, that can be part of the human enterprise. Now, thanks to this delicious new collection, the time is once again ripe for Leskovs resurgence.",2013-05-10T14:35:24+0000

The former is best served up by the Internet on demand. (You can find all of our hotel and restaurant suggestions for the stories in this issue at tmagazine.com.) And the pure version of the latter is perhaps best left to brilliant writers who promise to reward you for coming along (Edith Wharton, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Evelyn Waugh, Jan Morris). There are of course also intellectual and cultural histories of locales, in which the writer seeks to tease out the influences  historical, economic, social, stylistic, culinary and political  that make the place uniquely what it is (V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski). The type we favor at T is a hybrid of the three, in which great writing and personal narrative is done in the service of not just traipsing along with the writer who got to go on an amazing journey that we didnt, but of bringing you back a new understanding of a place that is enlightening and satisfying regardless of whether you ever plan to visit.

The two countries have said they expect the ratification process to be completed within months. The 52-year-old cleric, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment on the bombing charges by a Jordanian court in 1990. In Britain, where he sought refugee status, he has become a symbol for many in Britain of the exploitation of the countrys immigration, welfare and justice systems by migrants seeking to use Britain as a haven for terrorist activities. Mr. Othmans new pledge was met with widespread skepticism, with some legal experts saying he might be seeking to pre-empt a move favored by some in the government who have urged that Mr. Othman, currently held in prison for breaking bail conditions forbidding his use of cellphones and computers, be flown back to Jordan peremptorily, in defiance of British and European court rulings in his favor.

This was the recovery phase, and what was being recovered were corpses, the numbers spinning remorselessly forward: 700 dead became 800, then 900, with no end in sight. By Friday morning, the number had pushed above 1,000. And then, late in the afternoon, a soldier from the Bangladeshi Army, standing atop the rubble of the wrecked building, noticed an iron rod that seemed to be moving. There was a noise, a voice. Rescuers hurriedly carved a hole through a concrete pillar. Television stations in Bangladesh cut to the scene: a woman, gasping, was alive in the wreckage, nearly 17 full days after Rana Plaza had collapsed. A new number was announced: One. A female garment worker named Reshma. A survivor. A miracle. Save me! rescuers heard her shout, before they pulled her into the afternoon light, her face powdered in dust as she was placed on a stretcher.

(HBO) FAMILY TREE In this new, largely improvised series from Christopher Guest and Jim Piddock, Chris ODowd plays the down-on-his-luck Tom Chadwick, a 30-year-old Briton grappling with his identity since losing his girlfriend and his job. But when his Great-Aunt Victoria bequeaths him a chest of curios, he starts investigating his lineage to understand better who he and his unconventional family actually are. The ventriloquist Nina Conti plays his sister, Bea, who speaks through a monkey hand puppet; Michael McKean, above right, with Mr. ODowd, is their father. In this premiere episode, Tom finds a black-and-white portrait thought to be of his great-grandfather Harry and tracks down Neville St. Aubrey (Christopher Fairbank), an oddball antique photography expert. Toms best friend, Pete (Tom Bennett), meanwhile, fixes him up with a model. But what kind, exactly, no one is sure. There is a familiarity to the series, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. As in Mr. Guests films, its story is less important than the presentation of a gallery of eccentrics, ranging from mildly odd to completely loony. One result, Mr. Hale said, is that the series can feel a little loose and inconsequential as Tom unearths one dotty, inglorious relative after another. But that also means that we get to spend more time with Mr. Guests crack cast of improvisers, he added, and there are moments in each half-hour that pay off.",2013-05-12T15:37:02+0000

Veterans Affairs studies have shown that one-third of women seeking assistance have been sexually assaulted, and that more men than women are assaulted while in service. This Academy Award nominee for best documentary feature, directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering, uses interviews with retired and active service members to investigate the epidemic of rape within the military. (A female soldier in a combat zone is more likely to be attacked by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire.) Military service is often a family tradition, and the military itself, with its customs of loyalty, solidarity and shared sacrifice, can be a kind of family for its members, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. This means that the violations chronicled in The Invisible War are compounded by a deep and terrible betrayal, which ripples outward from the various branches of the service into the society as a whole. This is not a movie that can be ignored. (Above Kori Cioca, who served in the Coast Guard, and her husband, Rob.)",2013-05-13T04:15:04+0000

The suit, filed in both state and federal courts, was brought on behalf of the childs adoptive parents and is intended to restrict the practice of medically unnecessary sex assignment surgeries on infants, said lawyers with the Southern Poverty Law Center. The child was in the care of the South Carolina Department of Social Services when doctors, in cooperation with social services employees, removed the childs male genitals. The child, now 8, identifies himself as a boy, according to his parents, Mark and Pam Crawford of Richland County. They disfigured him because they could not accept him for who he was, Mrs. Crawford said in a statement, not because he needed any surgery. Increasingly, doctors and those who were born with a condition once called hermaphroditism recommend that children be assigned a gender at birth but postpone surgery until they are old enough to choose. A spokeswoman for the states Social Services Department said there would be no comment on pending legal action. ",2013-05-15T00:15:00+0000

The suits, filed Wednesday in Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division, say the closings would violate the Americans With Disabilities Act. In a complaint seeking to postpone them for a year, three parents seeking class-action status allege that the closings would pose significant disruption to special-education students. The second suit, which seeks to stop the closings altogether, alleges that they would needlessly uproot, transfer and destabilize the children. The suit further says the closings would violate Illinois civil rights law because the schools fall disproportionately in areas where the vast majority of students are black.

Inns and restaurants are bringing a clever touch to Lone Star hospitality and mythology, and with the vineyards and boutique farms (lavender, olives), some people make comparisons to Napa Valley or even Provence.

Happy, Happy, Happy takes its title from Robertsons catchphrase, and presents itself as a rustic guide to the good life  one chapter, Redneck Caviar, declares that Rule No. 11 for living happy, happy, happy is to suck the head of a crawfish (youll want to do it again and again). Part of the Robertsons charm is that they seem genuinely well adjusted, like the Waltons hairier cousins; every episode ends with a family prayer and a dinner prepared by Phils wife, Kay, whom he married when he was 16 and she was 15. If you can find a nice, pretty country girl who can cook and carries her Bible, he advises readers, now, theres a woman. She might even be ugly, but if she cooks squirrels and dumplings, then thats the woman you go after.",2013-05-17T15:32:29+0000
us,Paid to Be Good,"Linnea is a good kid from a home that lies somewhere in that wide gray zone between stable and chaotic, more dysfunctional than not  in other words, an emblematic American household. Her stepdad is O.K., her younger half-brother is pretty cool, her stepsister is a mean girl and a bully; but Linnea loves her mom, and since she cant remember her feckless, long-lost father, she doesnt really miss him. Theirs is a typical blended family, so sadly representative that the nightmare that demolishes their relative peace and turns Linnea into an unreachable, volatile teenager is a school shooting  a signature American tragedy. Suffice it to say that the details of that awful day are blood-chilling and unbearable. As survivors go, Linnea is especially unlucky. Shes earned her trauma, and she wears it like a badge.",2013-05-17T15:34:09+0000

The Knicks seemed poised to move on to the golf-playing portion of their season with an elimination game against the Indiana Pacers, but decided to stick around, perhaps just to annoy people, including their doomsaying fans.

A million golden arrows point to Neverland, and you can reach Oz by passing through a gate studded with glittering emeralds. The heft of Or else! in cautionary tales about children going up in flames after playing with matches was replaced with the incandescent beauty of What if?

More than 97 percent of the papers stating a cause for warming, the authors found, pointed to humans.

Legislators from the right challenged the constitutionality of the law before the high court, the Constitutional Council, but it was widely expected that the legislation would be approved. In its ruling, the Constitutional Council found that the law would not create a right to a child for same-sex couples, a contention made by some opponents of the legislation.

Says","One yellow fever shot confers lifetime protection and the customary booster shot given at 10 years is no longer necessary, the World Health Organization announced Friday. Yellow fever vaccine is relatively safe but causes more dangerous side effects than many other vaccines and is therefore normally given only to healthy people who are at risk. The mosquito-borne disease, for which there is no cure, strikes about 200,000 people worldwide each year and kills about 30,000 of them. Cases are increasing as deforestation increases contact with forest mosquitoes and the monkeys that harbor the virus. Only nine cases have been found in the United States over the past 30 years, all in travelers returning from Africa or Latin America, but eight were fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. Thomas P. Monath, a yellow fever expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that the W.H.O. announcement made sense for almost all vaccine recipients, but that booster shots might still be needed for laboratory technicians working with the virus and for a few travelers who had one shot many years ago but whose immunity had waned.",2013-05-17T19:56:57+0000

Eight years in the making, the show is directed by Damon Crain, a 38-year-old former gallery owner and art consultant, who discovered art glass as a child in Ottawa and amassed a large collection of antique bottles by the age of 12. At DDC, he will show 120 pieces created by the Blenko designers Wayne Husted, Joel Philips Myers and John Nickerson. Sometimes people arent sure how to live with the pieces, he said, but when they see them grouped together as a landscape, something clicks and it makes sense. Prices range from $700 for a 22-inch cylindrical vase by Joel Myers to $5,500 for a 38-inch-tall decanter by Wayne Husted.

In 2011 he won a TED Prize, given annually to a person with a bold vision to prompt global change. The result was the Inside Out Project, which challenged residents of often perilous and politically unstable environments to generate their own photographic messages  no logos or hate messages allowed  and send them to him. J R then printed giant images of the photographs and returned them to their creators, to be pasted up in a place with meaning. This documentary, directed by Alastair Siddons, follows J R as he travels the world to motivate communities to define their most important causes. More than 130,000 people have pasted messages in some 10,000 places in 100 countries, including Brazil, Tunisia, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, France and the United States.

(HBO) MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) In this storybook tale from Wes Anderson, the 12-year-old Suzy (Kara Hayward) and her soul mate, Sam (Jared Gilman), fall in love and run off, while still on an island, sending the adults in charge  Suzys parents (the Bishops, played by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand); Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton, above center); and Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis)  into a panic as a violent storm approaches. Written by Mr. Anderson and Roman Coppola (they worked together several times before), Moonrise Kingdom breezes along with a beautifully coordinated admixture of droll humor, deadpan and slapstick, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. But, she added, as in all of Mr. Andersons films, theres a deep, pervasive melancholia here too, a sense of regret evident in Mr. Bishops slouch (with his plaid pants, he is a walking John Cheever tragedy) and in the way Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look, and dont look, at each other. Adulthood can seem so desperately painful, so maybe Sam and Suzy shouldnt be quite as eager to grow up. Still, Ms. Dargis said: Sam and Suzy, while their story has the charms of a fairy tale and some of its terrors, arent playing at love. They are in love, and that is the most real thing in the world. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Coppola earned an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.",2013-05-21T05:00:05+0000

Sebring, a fashion photographer and award-winning filmmaker, used the device to create Revolution, a three-year effort on display for three days at the 69th Regiment Armory.

The device contains 100 synchronized cameras that shoot in predetermined sequences, allowing Sebring to capture form and movement from numerous perspectives simultaneously  for example, his muse, Coco Rocha, spinning and dancing (as seen in Discovery, the first clip above).

Then, this fall, he will dismantle a deconsecrated 19th-century Italian church and rebuild it at MoMA PS1 in Queens. Vezzoli finishes up at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, with a show focusing fittingly on his obsession with all things cinematic. Asked if, at 41, a global retrospective might be premature, Vezzoli says, I see this project more like a parody of a Cher farewell tour, a silly movie launch or a Fitzcarraldo experience  something extravagant and certainly not celebratory, at least in my intentions.

Players will risk injury on bumpy pitches, most of the games will be as competitive as a dust-up between Anderson Silva and Justin Bieber, and the resulting fixture squeeze will mean that there will be no time to accommodate FIFA international dates, so clubs will play a host of league fixtures without their star players, wholl be away on international duty.

us,The Men Who Would Be King,"The story of the British invasion of Afghanistan in 1839-42 (what was later called the First Afghan War) can be briefly told. A British Army entered the country in April 1839, captured Kabul and ejected the ruler Dost Mohammad Khan. He was replaced by Shah Shuja, who had been living in exile since his overthrow by Dost Mohammad and his brother some 30 years earlier. The British expected Shah Shuja to be a more pliable king, a client of their Indian Raj, and a more reliable ally against the intrigues of the Russians. But they underestimated the resentment that their presence would arouse, and inflamed Afghan hostility by their overbearing behavior. After they failed to quell an uprising in Kabul and their envoy was murdered, they agreed to withdraw. But the retreating army of British officers, Indian soldiers and a multitude of camp followers was slaughtered almost to a man as it struggled back through the Khyber Pass in January 1842. Some months later, the British returned with an army of retribution. After a short stay in Kabul, and some indiscriminate killing, they withdrew once more. Dost Mohammad returned (with their blessing) to resume his place on the throne.

(HBO) MAGIC MIKE (2012) In a role loosely inspired by his stint as a stripper in Florida, Channing Tatum (above left, with Matthew McConaughey) stars as the gyrating main attraction at the Xquisite dance club, in what Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, called Steven Soderberghs funny, enjoyable romp about male strippers and the American dream. Alex Pettyfer plays Adam, a college dropout who is pushed onstage at Xquisite. At first Adam is resistant. Then Madonnas Like a Virgin begins to throb. What happens will be familiar if youve ever seen one of those variations on the fallen-woman movie, Ms. Dargis wrote. In the past the movies were very much preoccupied with the moral regulation of women, but here the stress is on Mikes struggle to succeed as he juggles his part-time gigs (dancing, auto detailing and construction) with his desire to build custom furniture. She added: The collaboration between Mr. Soderbergh and the relatively untested Mr. Tatum is itself a gamble, one that has brought out the best in each. What could have been an embarrassing misfire hinted at by the movies misleading trailers is instead a smoothly distilled collaboration that balances Mr. Tatums heat and charm  and ambitions that are as transparent as Mikes  with Mr. Soderberghs cool, cinematic intelligence and ongoing preoccupations.

(HBO) BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (2013) Michael Douglas, above, stars as the piano showman Liberace, and Matt Damon is Scott Thorson, his chauffeur, lover and adopted son, in this film biography from the director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Set in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Palm Springs, the film chronicles the mens relationship as Liberace picks up and possesses Mr. Thorson, has him cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. Theres something uncanny, even brilliant, about Mr. Douglass impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum majors puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizards predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer. At the same time, he said, theres something limited, and limiting, about Mr. Douglass portrayal. Its brilliance feels as if it were all on the surface, a matter of expertise and professionalism. And the same could be said of Mr. Soderberghs film, he added. A cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic, its full of smart, funny details  perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglass blinding costumes  but its short on heart, or heat.",2013-05-26T05:00:07+0000

Mr. Paes issued a written apology to the city after the episode, which unfolded Sunday night when he went outside to smoke a cigarette during a meal with his wife and several others. But he qualified the apology by stating that it was unacceptable to face such insults during private moments with his wife. The constituent, Bernardo Botkay, a writer and a singer in a rock band, said he had directed his scorn at Mr. Paes because he believed that the mayors policies were benefiting a select group of real estate speculators and contributing to gentrification ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics, both of which will be held in Rio. I think it is noteworthy to be physically attacked by the mayor, Mr. Botkay said. It clearly shows that he does not have what it takes to run the city. ",2013-05-28T00:31:56+0000

An Austrian riesling would also work well, and for a full dose of umami, why not a fino sherry?

The artist Theaster Gates knows how creativity can invigorate a community. What happens when they put their heads together?At first glance, an Internet entrepreneur and an artist seem to operate in different creative spheres. Yet Perry Chen, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the crowd-funding Web site Kickstarter, and Theaster Gates, a Chicago art star-cum-urban planner, actually think they have a lot in common. Kickstarter began in 2009, and since then the site has raised more than $500 million for 40,000 projects  from Iraq war documentaries to Brooklyn restaurants  revolutionizing the way creative ideas are financed in the digital age. Theaster Gatess artistic practice, which encompasses everything from sculpture to a roving choir, is in its way just as groundbreaking. On his own block on the South Side of Chicago, Gates has engineered a miniature urban utopia, turning the once-blighted buildings that surround him into artist residencies, a library and even a cinema house that shows works by aspiring filmmakers from the neighborhood. Both Gatess and Chens work may inspire social change, but its the power of creativity, not of compassion, that spurs them from one genre-defying innovation to the next.",2013-05-30T13:00:12+0000

Tolkien has had an active afterlife; reviewing the book in The Los Angeles Times last month, Elizabeth Hand noted that it lists nine works published during his lifetime and 24 published posthumously (at least six of which have been best sellers). Hand liked the book, with some reservations:  The Fall of Arthur is a fascinating work, though perhaps more for the Tolkien completist than the casual Lord of the Rings fan, she wrote.

Studio Christofle, as its called, opened in early May and looks unexpectedly eclectic for the home of a venerable French silver company. The styling and merchandising of the 1,100-square-foot space is a result of two strategic collaborations. JF Chen antiques furnished it with pieces like a 19th century Chinese wedding armoire (now styled with Christofle candelabra, pitchers and vases) and Marco Zaninis throne-line Roma chair for Memphis.

When a nature-loving student at Cambridge named Charles Darwin read the book, it changed his life. He read passages aloud to his professors and learned Spanish so that he could follow in Humboldts footsteps.

Its a memoir with only the slightest hints of conflict or struggle, apart from an early scene in which young Lucy is attacked by a flock of geese. (I have since eaten foie gras with great enjoyment and very little guilt, she notes.) She maps out her emotional associations with her favorite foods  Venetian croissants, sauted mushrooms, McDonalds fries and so on  in a breezy clear-line style, lingering over treasured moments, like resting her hand against Richard Serras Tilted Arc during a catering gig. Between chapters, Knisley offers simple, neatly diagrammed recipes (chocolate chip cookies! pesto! sangria!). Her language, like her drawings, is precise and uncluttered: in one of the books liveliest sequences, 12-year-old Lucy and a friend wander through a little Mexican town, discovering treats like sweet corn on a stick, with hot sauce and lime, which turned the corners of our mouths red.",2013-05-31T14:50:57+0000

I love looking at 70s interiors, textiles or graphic design and thinking, If I could turn this picture into music, what would it sound like? Her songs do sound the way a Barbara DArcy room or Milton Glaser album cover looks: warm, inviting and groovy. Though shes best known as the frontwoman for the Fiery Furnaces, the Brooklyn indie rock band she founded with her brother Matthew more than a decade ago, the release of Personal Record (Merge), her second solo album next week, should solidify her identity as a stand-alone musician. Steeped in the analog sounds of Me Decade icons like Harry Nilsson, Emitt Rhodes and Caetano Veloso, the album is more mellifluous and emotionally resonant than the Furnaces eccentric work. Instead, it builds on the classic song craft of Friedbergers 2011 solo debut, Last Summer, interweaving bossa nova beats and British folk balladry with summer-road-trip rock n roll. Its as relatable  and as much a career high-water mark  as its title suggests. I dont get to hide under a band blanket, she says of flying solo.

us,Hidden in Plain Sight,"In the late 1970s, I purchased a half-dozen pocket-size paperback books that bore the name Ed Ruscha. I hadnt heard of the California artist at the time  I just liked the look of his booklets. One was bound with ribbon; the rest were perfect binds. There were no cover pictures; only widely spaced titles typeset in a serif font that I also liked to use, called Stymie Bold. The cover designs were distinct yet understated, reminiscent of small-press poetry collections. Inside were photographic records of what each title promised  Various Small Fires, Thirtyfour Parking Lots, Twentysix Gasoline Stations, Nine Swimming Pools, Crackers (with text by Mason Williams on How to Derive the Maximum Enjoyment From Crackers) and Babycakes (with photographs of, yes, a baby and cakes). They were puzzling yet clearly ironic, prefiguring many books by todays conceptual artists. The critical mass of decidedly mundane pictures gave them their allure. Marcel Duchamps ready-mades and Andy Warhols soup cans had already elevated everyday objects to the status of art, but Ruschas small books brought the ennobled vernacular back down to earth.",2013-05-31T16:47:11+0000

The 12 issues included in this edition were written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Bryan Hitch. The series was originally bought in 1999, and captured some creative magic. The heroes (Jenny Sparks, who embodied the spirit of the 20th Century; Apollo and Midnighter, crime-fighting lovers who were analogues of Superman and Batman; Jack Hawksmoor, who could communicate with and control cities) were captivating, and the artwork was exquisite. The first year found the heroes fighting bigger and bigger threats as a team. The first four issues featured a nation of terrorists who were bred to have Superman-like powers and who were bent on destroying major world cities. The middle story arc featured an invasion from a parallel word. The final four issues featured the team confronting no less than the incomprehensible godlike creator of the solar system that wanted to cleanse the universe of humanity. (The heroes won!)

Lifestyle changes underpinned demand for cars. As the postwar suburban population grew by 43 percent between 1947 and 1953, daily routines, not least those of women who wished to visit the new suburban shopping malls and plazas, increasingly relied on access to individual transport. The car and the housing booms were intimately linked, with average individual expenditure on these items tripling in real terms between 1941 and 1961. By the end of the fifties, 40 percent of American drivers were female  a far higher proportion than anywhere in Western Eu rope. As a dealer told a journalist investigating why Americans bought Volkswagens in 1955, the car was just the thing for the wife to run around town in. Two- car suburbia is where Volkswagen has made its biggest inroads. Market surveys from the fifties and early sixties also revealed that, while over 60 percent of Beetles registered in the United States served as second cars, about two- thirds of the customers who signed a purchase contract in a dealership had attended college. In short, Volkswagen attracted a foothold among the materially secure, white middle class whose members made up the bulk of suburbanites in the fifties.",2013-05-31T20:36:29+0000

us,Red Tape and White Knuckles,"Emerging from the forest under a black sky, I was met with a storm howling across the desolate plateau. The thunder moved nearer with every clap and the rain was ceaseless, coming down in sheets but the ground could no longer absorb it quickly enough and torrents of muddy water flowed past my wheels while huge chunks of the dirt road were disintegrating before my eyes. Overhanging trees and thorn bushes dangled in my path, scratching my face and ripping my waterproofs, allowing yet more rain to soak me quite literally, to the skin. This was wild, high, open country with not a glimmer of civilisation in sight; there were no people living here now, long since driven out in the civil wars slashing and burning of the villages. I longed to see some evidence of the human hand at work, just a hut or a farmhouse, a truck or car. But the only signs of mans existence were grim and sinister, in the shape of rusting tanks at the roadside and the crumbling concrete of improvised roadblocks.",2013-05-31T20:36:34+0000
us,The Stewardship of Historically Important Automobiles,"The desire to respect well-preserved great automobiles is not a new idea. For decades, closet conservators have not come out because of the pristine restoration focus that dominated the hobby. They worried that their scruffy treasure would pale on the show field. They were told a ground-up is mandatory. Was the preservation motivated by parsimony? And of course a trophy was out of the question. The mainstream seemed to abhor imperfection. While acknowledging their vehicle was technical jewelry in every way, they shamelessly changed its colors, trim, and even its design. Scores of unusual animals were sacrificed to add wow to the trim. No nut, bolt, or tie-rod arm escaped the chrome platers tank. Wire wheel spokes scintillated on the podium. Novel colors were protected with clear coat. When it was easier to replace than fix, the choice was easy. Racing damage was a badge of courage.",2013-05-31T20:36:38+0000
