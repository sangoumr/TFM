With its huge global operation and its high overhead costs, Anglo is poorly suited to manage some of the low-margin mines in its stable, especially with the gold price stagnant and showing little promise of an upswing.

Philosopher who as mentor, manager and friend guided Bob Dylan down the road from obscurity to icon in the early sixties, died peacefully on January 26th 2001 in UCLA Hospital, Santa Monica, California. On that journey he was protected and comforted by the presence and courage of his children Aerie Victoria and Jacob. He was sixty-five. Victor was the son of the respected liberal left-wing Los Angeles activists, Golda and Abraham Maymudes and the brother of August and Zicel; growing up the music and rhetoric of humanism, anti-fascism and civil rights was the food on their table. Late-sixties Victor stepped off the music stage to homestead in Northern New Mexico, his hands turned to chopping wood and carpentry, his heart to loving his family. 1986 until 1996 he returned to Dylan's side as a personal manager. The last years of his life were spent traveling and writing his memoirs. The product of that effort, ''The Joker and the Thief'' was scheduled for publication by Saint Martins Press in 2002. Above all, Victor appreciated the value of music, the poetry in a well-turned phrase. ''Song is the ultimate repository of human civilization,'' he maintained, ''it's a resting place for one heart and translates the soul of culture for all.''",2001-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Then in the 80's, poof, the Vespa disappeared from American roadways, having run up against stringent emissions regulations. Now? Jerry Seinfeld has one, and so does Christie Brinkley. And they are legal, because the new Vespas fully satisfy American emissions requirements. Available in eight fashion colors (including iridescent pearl, pearlized green and pearlized blue), the Vespa will be the way to get to the beach this summer.

The best nearby skate park is in Ridgefield, 30 miles away. The Junior League of Greenwich was aware of the problem and asked a local architect, Vincent Colangelo, at left in the photograph, to come up with a pro bono solution. He turned to his crack advisers, his son, Gian Colangelo, 12, center, and his son's friends Alex Jones, 13, right, and Luke Bace, 12, not pictured. If the Junior League and the town's Parks and Recreation Department can find a 10,000-square-foot site, preferably paved, something like a big parking lot, their skateboard park (computer rendering top) might be built. It would have curvy semicircular walls called half-pipes and shorter ones called quarter-pipes, as well as pyramids and rails, and possibly even a street spine, a ramp shaped like a pagoda roof. The design team visited the Ridgefield park, and went on the Internet to sites like www.skatepark.org for inspiration. ''The kids hand-drew 16 different ramps they liked -- an 11-foot half-pipe, pipe rails, street spines, boxes and pyramids,'' said Mr. Colangelo, who incorporated their ideas into the computer model.

With $439 million in cash and marketable securities, the company said it was fully funded until then. In the quarter ending June 2002, the company expects its revenues to match expenditures on a cash-flow basis. For the current year, the company lowered its annual revenue expectations by $20 million, to between $170 million and $175 million. It said it would cut capital outlays by $75 million, to $225 million, and predicted that its annual loss would beat Wall Street's estimates of $7.51 a share by 6 cents. For the quarter that ended Dec. 31, the company said it lost $142.5 million, or $1.82 a share, matching analysts' expectations. T. L. Thompson, chief financial officer, said Digital Island had gained only 10 customers during the last quarter, bringing its roster to 959, partly because of its decision to shed smaller customers.

The program, known as a Trojan horse, arrives in the form of a file that is attached to an e-mail message with the subject line ''hey you''; the message suggests that the attachment, ''mine.zip,'' is a collection of pictures. When the user clicks on the icon for the file, the program infects the machine. The next time the user turns the machine on and connects to AOL, the program sends the user's online name and password to a number of foreign e-mail addresses, and it sends copies of itself to every person on the victim's ''buddy list.'' McAfee's chief information officer, Doug Cavit, said nearly 200,000 infected files had already been detected on the company's Web site. (Because computers might have three or more infected files, the estimated number of machines infected so far is 60,000.) The program has proliferated quickly, with the number of infected files doubling in the last three weeks, Mr. Cavit said. He added that the program represented a new breed of ''identity theft'' attacks that try to steal information instead of damaging files or computers. John Schwartz",2001-02-02T05:00:00+0000

Silvercup, which owns property near the generator site, says it has plans to build studios, offices and apartments on that property. In the lawsuit, Silvercup said that environmental and other requirements for the generator have not been met and that alternative sites had not been explored.

She passed away on January 29 in Hemet, CA., at the age of eightytwo after a brief illness. As a leading artist with NYCO from 1948-1977, she created some of the most vibrantly acted, beautifully sung, and memorable characters in our company's history, including Octavian, Dorabella, Lucretia, Cenerentola, Amneris, Ottavia, Hansel, Jocasta, Herodias, and Oberon, as well as Elizabeth Proctor in the world premier of ''The Crucible'' and Frade in the world premier of ''The Dybbuk''. She is perhaps best remembered as Augusta Tabor in NYCO's ''Ballad of Baby Doe'', a performance immortalized in a telecast and recently reissued recording. She was a preeminent figure in twentiethcentury American opera, performing with virtually every major opera company and symphony orchestra around the world. Her support of her fellow artists was exemplary, whether as a singing colleague or as a teacher at Rice University, where she served as Artist-in-Residence for fourteen years until her retirement in 1991. We will always remember her with great affection and respect. The music world has lost one of its greatest lights.

Cropsey goes on, despite a court ruling last month that it is the property of the Hastings school district. In an appeal filed by the Hastings Historical Society, the society's lawyer, Paul Edelman, argued that Sherman Thursby, the painting's original owner, had never intended that the painting, ''View at Hastings-on-Hudson,'' be given to the school board. ''It was not given to the school board to own and sell,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''Essentially, the people of the village were the real owners of the painting. It was delivered to the school for the benefit of the people. We're only interested that it not be sold.'' The painting, on display at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, will be the subject of a Feb. 12 school board meeting. ''The board is nowhere near a decision,'' said Schools Superintendent John J.

A longtime judge in Nassau County, Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding was one of the first women admitted to practice law in New York State in the early 1920's.

Griffith made ''Birth of a Nation'' in 1915, the African-American filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, a former coal miner and Pullman porter, started making films. In them, African-Americans are portrayed with dignity in roles of authority in contrast to the typical stock characters of the day. Micheaux's genres included drama, musicals and films about social themes, and he directed over 40 films between 1918 and 1948. On Saturday Feb. 10 at 2 p.m. the Newark Museum will screen, one of Micheaux's silent films, ''The Symbol of the Unconquered'' (1920). The drummer Max Roach will provide the percussive accompaniment to the film he performed once before on television. Pearl Bowser, co-author of a book about Micheaux published last fall, ''Writing Himself Into History: Oscar Micheaux, His Silent Films, and His Audience,'' (Rutgers University Press) will also be there to discuss Micheaux and sign copies of her book. In her book, Ms. Bowser wrote that ''The Symbol of the Unconquered'' reveals the economic underpinnings of the Ku Klux Klan. Michele Parchment, manager of public programs, who also coordinates the Newark Black Film Festival, said of Micheaux, ''He is one of our silent heroes when we are dealing with African-American history.''

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  BREKKA, THOMAS THORWALD","BREKKA - Thomas Thorwald. 1928-2001. Tom Brekka died the evening of January 25th doing what he loved best, taking one of his twice-daily strolls around the neighborhood. He loved looking up into the mountains to see if there was snow on top and looking in the sky to see the airplanes he knew so well. He walked religiously so that he would stay healthy and have many years to come to spend with his wife, his 10 children and his 13 grandchildren (with two more on the way). If anything, Tom Brekka was a man who cherished children. And every child who knew him knew what it meant to be cherished. Even the neighborhood children couldn't pass him by without singing out, ''Hi Tom! Hi Tom! Bye Tom! Bye Tom!'' Tom Brekka was a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force during the Korean War, but thankfully was kept out of action so he could train other navigators at the Air Force Academy. In 1952 he married the love of his life, Patricia Flynn, and together they raised 10 children: four boys and six girls. Tom was perhaps most proud of having put all 10 children through college-he'd get a special gleam in his eye when he'd tell people ''we have 10 undergraduate degrees and four graduate degrees''-five including his own recent MBA from UC Irvine. Tom had received his Bachelor's Degree in Business, and his Doctorate of Law from Fordham University, shortly after retiring from the Air Force. Yet he always wished he had gotten his MBA. So, in 1997 he fulfilled that dream, at 70 years of age, when he graduated from UC Irvine's 21 month Executive MBA Program. He will be remembered and missed for his tremendous love and affection for all people-but especially for his own family. He always had a kind word, or a silly joke, a tickle, a smile, a hand to lend. He loved to make people laugh, and best of all, he loved to jump out at you when you least expected it. We have been so blessed to have had him as a husband, father, brother and grandfather. I love you Tom. We love you Dad. Thank you for your undying love and affection, your wisdom, your integrity, and your strength. Your belief in God and in each of us as individuals has emboldened us. You gave us the tools to live fruitful lives and we each carry a part of you in our hearts. We know a lot more about Heaven because we know you are there. His spirit lives on in the hearts of many: his wife of 48 years, Patricia Brekka, of Mission Viejo, CA; his brother, Larry Brekka of McClean, VA; his children: Patty, Tom, Rosemary, Cassie, Michael, Christine, Richard, Kevin, Maureen and Susan; and his grandchildren: Allison, Kimmie, Kyle, Candace, Marshall, baby Brekka, Aaron, Michael, Natalie, Julia, Emily, Michael, Adam, Maggie, Dylan, baby Heironimus, and all the future Brekkas. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to: The C.H.O.C. Foundation (Children's Hospital of Orange County), 455 South Main Street, Orange, CA 92868.

Heroes are profiled as well, distinguished discoverers like Allan R. Sandage, the present proprietor of the Hubble constant, and Stephen Hawking, the Delphic cosmologist of Cambridge University.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Unstuffed,"What would you do if you lost, at one fell swoop, every one of your possessions? What if a thief were to come in and take not only your television and your jewelry but your dirty dishes, your underwear, your light bulbs, even your toilet paper? This is what happens to Mr. and Mrs. Ransome, the bourgeois, habit-bound couple in Alan Bennett's sharp new novella, THE CLOTHES THEY STOOD UP IN (Random House, $14.95). It comes as quite a shock to them to discover just how much their lives have been controlled and defined by their objects, and when they are suddenly relieved of them the couple's reactions expose the irreconcilable differences in their characters: Mr. Ransome rigidly carries on as though nothing has changed, while his wife begins to feel rebellious twinges of -- dare she admit it? -- freedom and adventure. But then their paraphernalia is restored to them as mysteriously as it was taken away, and ''life returned to what Mrs. Ransome used to think of as normal but didn't now, quite.'' Their marriage, and they themselves, have subtly changed. ''The Clothes They Stood Up In'' was a best seller in Britain, where Bennett, the author of the plays ''Habeas Corpus,'' ''Forty Years On,'' ''The Madness of George III'' and countless other films and television shows, is rightly thought of as a national treasure. The book will probably not do quite so well here, for the traits personified by the Ransomes -- emotional constipation on the husband's part, an almost pathological diffidence on the wife's -- are English vices and not American ones. (Our own run on quite different lines.) But it is a witty, dark piece of work, a happy evening's read and a tantalizing mental challenge to those of us who, like the Ransomes, find their lives encumbered and their senses blunted by too much stuff.

If there is a chance for her pictures to stand relatively unfiltered, it is presented in LENI RIEFENSTAHL: Five Lives (Taschen, $39.99), a collection of stunning photographs of and by one of the 20th century's defining image makers. Riefenstahl was born in Berlin in 1902, and she gained early fame as a ballet dancer, then as a movie actress. She created her own film company before she was 30, and had a hit directing herself in ''The Blue Light'' in 1932 -- the same year she wrote a fan letter to Hitler. Her collaboration with Hitler got her on the cover of Newsweek and produced ''Triumph of the Will'' (1935). Once Germany was defeated and the Fhrer dead, Riefenstahl was arrested and her archives seized. Amazingly, after winning her legal battles she somewhat overcame the Nazi stigma with new work, particularly photographs of the Nuba tribe in Sudan. Of all her work, the stills from her documentary about the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin stand out for their dynamism and epic compositions. Though this is intended as a picture book, it contains a year-by-year chronology that is essential to comprehend the constant boldness of Riefenstahl's transformations. She was at work as recently as 1999, which may make her own will the most triumphant of all. Ted Loos",2001-02-04T05:00:00+0000

A patch of the city's shoreline became home to Lipton's first American warehouse and headquarters in 1893 when Sir Thomas, the multimillionaire Irish-born grocer, came to town. Ships bearing tea from his overseas plantations docked next to the factory where workers packaged the leaves for nearly seven decades. Sir Thomas, whose boat Shamrock lost the America's Cup five times, used to drive straight into the building's freight elevator and park his car on its roof. Though the company pulled up stakes in 1962 and headed to Englewood Cliffs, its legacy endures. The factory has been renovated into apartments and tea consumption in this country has doubled in the past seven years, thanks largely to ''ready to drink'' brews. Peter Goggi, a Lipton expert on tea, presents ''All the Tea in Hoboken,'' a historical look at the leaves and the potion it produces next Sunday at the Hoboken Historical Museum. The discussion includes a tasting of Darjeeling and Earl Grey, and is part of the museum's ongoing series, ''Made in Hoboken.'' Reservations are required (201) 656-2240.

He took her to the three-story, family-owned building she lives in now, and as soon as she walked in, she decided to take it. Tallying the view of the World Trade Center towers out the kitchen window with the magically low rent for a four-room apartment, she asked the broker about the safety of the neighborhood.

But George Scalise, the association president, warned in an interview that a high supply of chips waiting to be sold might drive growth down to as low as 10 percent in 2001, half the association's earlier prediction of 22 percent. Sales declined 2.1 percent between November and December, to $17.9 billion, which the association attributed to typical seasonal patterns. Mr. Scalise said he expected the sales channels to be cleared of inventory by midyear, offering hope for a stronger second half. The association will revise its annual prediction in June. After several Wall Street analysts issued reports echoing Mr. Scalise's predictions, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's Semiconductor Index, a composite of chip maker stocks, dropped $28.74 cents, or 4.2 percent, as Intel, Micron and Applied Materials lost ground.

He graduated first in his class and Judge Golding graduated second. We are very proud to have counted her as one of our own. Her lifelong commitment to NYU Law School is commemorated by the Golding Media Center and the Judge Elizabeth Bass Golding and Samuel Golding Student Lounge. In 1988, Judge Golding was awarded the Law School's highest honor, the Arthur T. Vanderbilt Medal. Our community is grateful for Judge Golding's years of service and her devotion to NYU. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to her family. John Sexton, Dean NYU School of Law Lester Pollack, President NYU School of Law Foundation",2001-02-06T05:00:00+0000

This year's participants include Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general and William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  ZOCK, SARA MARGARET KURR","ZOCK-Sara Margaret Kurr (private philanthropist), died in her Sea Girt, New Jersey home on January 31, 2001 after a very brief illness. She had celebrated her 97th birthday on January 19th. She was born in Bethel, Pennsylvania in 1904. She taught first to third grades in a one-room schoolhouse in Berks County, PA. After graduating from Teachers College at Columbia University, NY in 1928, she taught in the Pelham and Geneseo, NY school districts. After her marriage to Joseph A. Zock, an investment banker, she moved to New York City where she worked with her husband for many years. She became a permanent resident of Sea Girt, NJ in 1965. She and her husband were two of the oldest members of the New York Stock Exchange. She was an active member of the Sea Girt Women's Club. During her fifty plus years of marriage, she and her late husband were very private donors to a wide variety of charitable causes and community betterment projects. She and her husband traveled the world extensively, whenever possible by ocean liner. They enjoyed many round the world cruises. She became an accomplished artist in her 70's. She read her beloved Wall Street Journal every day until three weeks before her death. After Joseph A. Zock's death in 1986, she increased her private philanthropic activities. She was the driving force and principal, but anonymous, benefactor in establishing the Sea Girt Public Library in 1991. It was not until her 95th birthday in 1999 that she allowed the town to honor her generosity. She has quietly and anonymously assisted the Tulpehocken, PA area school districts in educating many deserving students and contributed to school improvement projects. She also privately helped many less fortunate individuals throughout Monmouth County, NJ. Through the charitable trusts and private foundations created by Mrs. Zock and her late husband, significant annual contributions have been made to many and varied charities, educational institutions and local government projects. Besides her husband, Joseph A. Zock, she is predeceased by her sister, Mary Kurr Roberge. She is survived by a nephew, Dr. James K. Roberge, Lexington, MA, a grand-niece, Dr. Ann Roberge Cheal and grand-nephew, James D. Roberge and five great-grand nephews. She is also survived by her longtime friend, advisor and confidant, John H. Rogicki of Holmdel, NJ. A memorial service will be held at 11:30AM on February 21, 2001 at O'Brien's Funeral Home, Route 35, Wall, New Jersey with a luncheon to follow at her favorite restaurant, The Old Mill Inn. An additional memorial service will be held in Bethel, PA on a date and time to be announced shortly. Mrs. Zock's three favorite public charities were: American Cancer Society (Monmouth County Chapter, 801 Broad St., Shrewsbury, NJ); the American Heart Association (New Jersey Chapter, 2550 US Route 1, N. Brunswick, NJ); and the Salvation Army (Asbury Park Chapter, 605 Asbury Ave., Asbury Park, NJ). Donations in her memory can be made to the local chapters listed above.

American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem are deeply saddened by the passing of our dear friend and Benefactor Karl Oberwager on February 4, 2001, shortly after his 100th birthday. Together with Susie, his beloved wife of 53 years, the Oberwagers established the Philipp Rothbart and Helene Gottheil Rothbart Endowment Fund in honor of Susie's parents, to provide scholarships and student aid at the Hebrew University. In May 2000 they traveled to Jerusalem to participate in the Benefactors dedication ceremony on the Mount Scopus Campus where their generous commitment was recognized. It was Karl's 20th visit to Israel and a true highpoint in an extraordinary life that began with his birth in Austria. Karl barely survived six years in the coalmines of Siberia during WW II. He met and married Susie in Romania and the couple eventually immigrated to the United States, where Karl rose from busboy to popular restaurant owner of the Parkway in New York City. The couple worked together until Karl's retirement in 1980. Karl will be remembered as a gracious human being and a true gentleman. He will be mourned and missed by all who knew him.

Renaults Eurodrive program arranges short-term leases of 17 to 185 days, for anyone whose permanent address is outside a European Union country. The savings come from treating the deal as a purchase-repurchase transaction, which exempts it from car-rental taxes of almost 20 percent. For comparison purposes, a 17-day lease on a subcompact Renault Twingo is $499, or about $30 a day, with unlimited mileage. The leased cars are factory-fresh: no dents, scratches or smoking odors  you get to provide those. There are 33 pickup-dropoff sites in nine European countries, and the minimum age for leasing is 18. The price includes fire, theft, collision and liability coverage with no deductible. Call (800) 221-1052 or call up www.renaultusa.com . ",2001-02-08T05:00:00+0000

That is the tantalizing question facing motorists who pass the 61 billboards on display in Los Angeles, part of a provocative new advertising campaign for the Museum of Contemporary Art. Conceived by a writer, Maya Rao, and an art director, Moe Verbrugge, at TBWA/Chiat Day advertising, the campaign borrows from conceptual art to market the art museum. Ms. Rao and Ms. Verbrugge selected the billboard locations and then wrote site-specific ''labels'' like those for a museum exhibition, as in ''Red Glowing Lights,'' top, at the intersection of Interstates 110 and 10 downtown. ''Turning the ordinary into the extraordinary,'' Ms. Zerbrugge said, ''forces drivers to look differently at their environment.'' The $1 million campaign (180 billboards will be installed in all, over six months) is well suited to the city's car culture. ''To build an audience here one has to engage with the city in a different way than in Chicago or New York,'' said Jeremy Strick, director of the museum. Whether it will lure drivers into the museum and its satellites (MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary and the new MOCA Gallery at the Pacific Design Center) remains to be seen.

The report does not suggest that most of these companies have deliberately broken their agreements with the city. Rather, it said, they have usually been caught up by changes in their industries, like consolidation in the banking and brokerage sector, or the drought of financing for Internet companies.

On the political front, critics argue that the spirit and possibly the letter of international arms agreements might be violated if the United States proceeds with such a system. Cost too is a concern. No one yet knows exactly how much even a basic missile shield would cost, and estimates run as high as $100 billion. But most challenging will be the technological hurdles, which many experts say are beyond current capabilities. How to reliably find a warhead in a field of decoys? Can a laser be powerful and focused enough to kill from a safe distance? And what combination, if any, of ground-, sea-, air- and space-based defenses will sufficiently defend against all possible threats? Following is an overview of how a missile shield might work, why the idea appeals to so many, and a brief look at other threats that no shield can deter. TOM ZELLER",2001-02-11T05:00:00+0000

But acknowledging perfection in a work of art -- especially, perhaps, in a movie -- can sometimes be a form of faint praise, even of condescension. Flawlessness involves the mastery of small proportions and brief measures, a preference for concentration over risk.

Cherished grandfather of Tyler and Allan. Born in 1928 and raised during the Depression in Hell's Kitchen, Richard ''Dick'' Clark was a proud son of NYC. He attended P.S. 51, Stuyvesant High School and Columbia University School of Architecture. His passion for life took him from winning the Silver Skates in the Speed Skating Competition at Madison Square Garden in 1957, to being a volunteer fireman in Croton-on-Hudson, to flying planes and collecting antique cars. His love of architecture led him on a 54 year career that took him from Battalion Drafting Instructor in the U.S. Army in the early 1950's, to Head of NY's World's Fair Examination Department in the 1960's, to President of Taylor Clark Architects, Inc. from 1979. In 2000, TCA merged with the prestigious firm, Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, to create Swanke Hayden Connell Architects/Taylor Clark Healthcare Group, where Dick served as a principal until his death. Richard was a published and internationally recognized expert in the planning and design of medical facilities and academic medical campuses. Serving over 100 clients during his extensive career, he directed numerous major projects including the NY Presbyterian Hospital (expansion over the FDR Drive was done in association with HOK), the NY Hospital Medical Center of Queens, the Brooklyn Hospital Center, Long Island College Hospital, and North Shore University Hospital, to name a few. He was honored by the NY Hospital Medical Center of Queens by receiving their Pacesetter Award in 1998 at a gala event. Richard was also an active and enthusiastic participant on many boards and committees including the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity, the American Institute of Architects, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of American College of Radiology, American Association for Hospital Planning, Society of Architectural Historians, and the NY Association for Ambulatory Care. He also served as a member of the board for Calvary Hospital, Bronx, NY and Lincoln Hall, Lincolndale, NY. Richard died peacefully at his home in NYC. He will be sorely missed by a great number of people. There will be a memorial service on Friday, February 16th at the Church of the Transfiguration (1 East 29th St., NYC) at 11AM. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in his name to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, P.O. Box 1275, York Ave., NY, NY 10021.",2001-02-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Great Stone Face,"Ernest Hebert, the author of five well-received novels about New Hampshire's rural underclass (the ''Darby'' series), departs from his earlier material and style in his new book, THE OLD AMERICAN (University Press of New England, $24.95). It's a historical novel inspired by the true story of Nathan Blake, a house builder in Keene, N.H., who was captured by an Indian raiding party and spirited off to Canada in 1746, during the French and Indian Wars. The rest is fiction, but the novel is always grounded in a fine historical sensibility and sympathetic imagination. Hebert's most notable invention in this book is Blake's captor, an aged Indian -- an ''old American'' -- named Caucus-Meteor. Caucus-Meteor takes Blake to his village of Conissadawaga, near Quebec city. Eventually the relationship between master and slave grows so close that the old chief makes Blake his godson and a member of the tribe. As a character, Blake is rather lifeless, perhaps because the author felt constrained by a respect for history. Caucus-Meteor, in contrast, is magnificently alive -- he is funny and brooding, by turns practical and maudlin; he thinks and plots constantly, peering into the future with the help of magic, and he is slyly disrespectful of all received wisdom and the hypocrisies of European civilization in America. He thinks he would be pleased to die, not out of depression but because he feels he's simply too old and tired to live. His face already looks like the Old Man of the Mountains, the rock formation in New Hampshire's Franconia Notch; toward the end of his life, when even his tribe thinks he's dead, Caucus-Meteor has a tattoo artist increase the resemblance (through the use of color, intentional scarring and a dislocated nose) and changes his name to Great Stone Face. There is little action in ''The Old American,'' but to share Caucus-Meteor's thoughts is itself an extraordinary adventure. William Ferguson",2001-02-11T05:00:00+0000

The answer is yes, if you're at Ibby's Falafel in Jersey City. Using a recipe created by his mother and perfected over the last 30 years by his uncle, a restaurateur in New York, Adnan Kwara is busy making converts to this Middle Eastern staple. But in the beginning, he wasn't so sure it would sell. ''When we first opened in '96, we served pizza, wings, and falafel,'' said Mr. Kwara. ''But people came just to eat the falafel.'' He took the hint and reopened the restaurant a few months later with a streamlined Middle Eastern menu. The star, of course, is the falafel sandwich ($2.50), topped with lettuce and onions and drizzled with tahini, a smoky dressing made from sesame seed paste. For a dollar more, it comes with hummus, baba gannouj or tabbouleh, and for $2 more, with all three plus fava beans and stuffed grape leaves. Shawarama, a 13-spiced Syrian version of the gyro, is an excellent choice for meat lovers, as are the chicken kebabs, which are marinated for 24 hours in garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, onions and paprika. Both are served as sandwiches for $4 or platters for $9. Pastries are made daily; the best choice is mabrouma ($1.50), a flaky nest of phyllo stacked high with walnuts, almonds and pistachios. At these prices, there's hardly a downside, unless you dislike garlic, which subtly infuses everything but the tahini. And why is this dressing garlic-free?

Soon after joining the NYU faculty, he established the world's first neurosurgery ICU at Bellevue and trained more than 60 neurosurgeons, many of whom advanced to positions of leadership at medical schools all over the country. An avid fisherman, boater and jogger, Dr. Ransohoff moved to Tampa, Florida in 1992, but never truly retired.

us,"Books in Brief: NonFiction; Finger Painting, Even","Heralded in his time as ''the only perfect landscape painter whom the world has ever seen,'' J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) worked entirely within the system -- the Royal Academy in London, to whose school he was admitted in 1789, at the age of 14, and where he taught and exhibited until his death in 1851. Yet if his resume is not exactly iconoclastic, his working methods were; they are detailed by the art critic Eric Shanes in TURNER: The Great Watercolours (Royal Academy of Arts/Abrams, $55), a book of rigorous scholarship and beauty. Shanes looks at Turner's career through the focus of his work in watercolor, a medium in which he achieved a spontaneity he never quite matched in oil. Perfect for conveying subtle atmospheric changes, Turner's watercolors set new levels of sophistication. Not one to idly watch the paint dry, early on he set up production lines, working in one tone across multiple sheets before introducing another. This helps to explain his hefty output, demanded by aristocratic patrons who would order paintings just on the basis of thumbing through sketchbooks from Turner's travels. By the mid-1810's, Turner was creating his radiant skies and diaphanous colors with a whole bag of tricks: dumping entire drawings into buckets of water, dropping down wet colors that would diffuse on the page, using anything from stale breadcrumbs to scalpels to fingers to manipulate paint into ethereal approximations of nature. Turner had his detractors, who took him to task for such liberties and carped of his inability to depict the human figure accurately. Yet mainly he was a source of national pride. One critic swooned in 1819: ''The art itself is par excellence English, no continental pencil can come near the force, freedom, and nature of our professor's.'' Hilarie M.

Certainly it is a viable approach to prepare people for actual careers -- as nurses, computer programmers, technicians of various kinds, etc. -- but this should not be done at the expense of traditional learning.

Across the board, there will be no increases, said Dennis Bone, president of the company, which is based in Newark. In December, Verizon withdrew an application to the State Board of Public Utilities that if approved would have forced most residential callers to accept bundled service packages starting at $15 per month. Verizon did ask the utilities board yesterday to deregulate rates charged to businesses with more than one phone line, asserting that dozens of companies had expressed interest in providing such service and therefore the market was competitive. But Michael Schweder, president of AT&T New Jersey, said that only a handful of companies, including his own, actually provide business phone service in New Jersey, meaning that Verizon could raise rates significantly.

The suit, filed in California County Superior Court in Santa Clara, accuses Covad of cutting service with the intent of converting DSLnetworks' customers to Covad's high-speed service. A spokesman for DSLnetworks, based in San Francisco, said high-ranking Covad executives even telephoned several of DSLnetworks' largest corporate customers directly. Covad says it disrupted the company's service for nonpayment of millions of dollars in past-due bills. Covad also cut off service to Internet Express, another service provider, for what it said was nonpayment of past-due bills. Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)",2001-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Last Samba in Sao Paulo,"The Brazilian writer Caio Fernando Abreu's allegorical novel WHATEVER HAPPENED TO DULCE VEIGA? (University of Texas, cloth, $35; paper, $15.95) follows a has-been journalist as he tracks down the story of a popular lounge singer who vanished 20 years earlier. An engaging and sometimes brilliant pastiche of detective fiction, urban soap opera and spiritual questing tale, ''Dulce Veiga'' unfolds over the course of a week as the unnamed hero navigates the social jungle that is Sao Paulo in the 1990's, with its beggars, junkies, transvestites, shattered revolutionaries, fortunetellers and social climbers. As he struggles to find the truth beneath layers of confusing signs, his journey slowly draws him away from decadent blight into a healthier, earthier life. Among the pleasures here are the author's international cultural references, his integration of Afro-Brazilian religions and their orixs, or gods, into the plot, and the felicitous, loose-limbed translation by Adria Frizzi, which maintains a lively balance between suspense and comedy. In particular, the author uses the orixs to structure the novel in an almost Joyce-like fashion, interweaving symbolic and human manifestations of the gods into the story. Dulce Veiga herself is one of these; she appears to the narrator in dreamlike visions. (The uninitiated will appreciate the glossary that Frizzi provides of some of the more unusual religious words.) Abreu, a journalist, novelist, short-story writer and playwright who died of AIDS in 1996, has created a work at once satirical and tender, silly and serene; it begins in darkness and ends advancing toward light.

A quarter-century later, when the murder of Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter forces the three of them into a heart-scorching reunion, they still carry the scars of that childhood trauma.

ROBERT P.","SHAY-Dr. Robert P., Professor Emeritus at Columbia University, and a leading scholar of the economics of consumer finance, died on January 21 in Ellsworth, Maine. He was 78. The cause was cardiac arrest after a 12 year battle with Parkinson's disease. Dr. Shay's work on the impact of interest rate regulation on consumer demand and credit availability contributed to the easing of interest rate regulation in the United States. Born in Belmont, Mass on March 27, 1922, he earned his Bachelor of Science, Master's and Doctorate in Economics at the University of Virginia, finishing in 1951. He joined the faculty at the University of Maine in 1950, where he became a full professor and head of the departments of Economics and Sociology in 1957, and founded the School of Business in 1958. In 1959, Dr. Shay joined the staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and was appointed Professor of Banking and Finance at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business in 1964, where he was an admired teacher and active faculty member until his retirement in 1989. Dr. Shay was also very active in the communities in which he lived. During his tenure at the University of Maine he was elected Selectman in the Town of Orono. After moving to Scarsdale, N.Y. in 1959, he served on the School Board and numerous other town committees. In 1994 he was named recipient of the Scarsdale Bowl, jointly with his wife Esther, in recognition of their contribution to the civic life of Scarsdale. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Esther Cunningham Shay, their three sons, Robert Shay, Jr. of Watertown, Mass, Warren of Skowhegan, Maine and Stephen Shay, of Sharon, Mass, grandchildren Elliott, Anthony, Keith, Laura, Rebecca, David and Rachel Shay, and his sister, Laura Hogan of Palm Beach, Florida.

Fifteen years and many unsuccessful ports of call later, the ship's captain, Arturo Fuentes, and his crew have disappeared, and the ship's whereabouts are unknown. ''That's the million-dollar question,'' says Kenny Bruno, a former Greenpeace employee who is considered the national expert on the Khian Sea.

Their pants fall down to reveal knock-knees and ridiculous underwear. Their bodies flop face first into dung-scented sawdust.

The song's heroine catches her two-timing lover on the telephone while he is with his other girlfriend, and naming the singer would show his new conquest that he is not free.

I would prefer not to mention that at all, let alone make it my subject, because it has little to do with the quality of his work, which is superb, as many critics have said. But it has everything to do with why he bothers people. On the simplest level, this is because, unlike many black rappers whose lyrics would outrage white America, if white America could understand them, Eminem's accent, enunciation, idiom and, to use the term of art, flow are clearly intelligible to pundits; to children, if they hear him; to everyone. On a less innocent level, it is because he comes from a world that is not supposed to exist, the world of the white underclass. On a very, very ugly level, it is because a white suburban kid identifying with Eminem is basically, as Eminem is regarded to have done, turning ''black,'' thereby muddying the pools of cultural and racial and class separation (a process that has actually been under way in popular music, with greater and lesser degrees of visibility and impact, for at least 50 years).",2001-02-18T05:00:00+0000

The hulking Hummer sport utility vehicle is basically a Persian Gulf war Humvee. What do they have in common? Well, General Motors, which bought the Hummer brand a year ago, has hired Elisabeth Vanzura, 36, the former director of advertising and marketing at Volkswagen of America and the woman responsible for the quirky award-winning ads that helped to revive Volkswagen's quirky counterculture image. (Remember the two drifters humming the German tune ''Da Da Da'' in the Volkswagen Golf ad? It started a nationwide craze.) Ms. Vanzura's task is to help G.M. turn Hummer, the automaker's first new division since Saturn, into a mass-market brand like BMW, increasing sales from 1,000 a year to more than 100,000. Ms. Vanzura says selling New Beetles is not that different than selling Hummers, because ''they're both very hip, very cool, edgy brands that are not for everyone.'' But a New Beetle slogan may have oddly foreshadowed Ms. Vanzura's move: ''Less flower, more power.'' Keith Bradsher",2001-02-18T05:00:00+0000

Guess which one will give way to the other. The answer is not what cynics (or perhaps realists) probably think, though it almost was. The tree will stay. Among the heroes are members of the Millville Memorial High ecology class, who protested when they learned the expansion of a Wawa into a ''superstore'' with gasoline pumps and added tractor-trailer truck parking would mean the demise of the white oak, which is apparently pictured on some area survey maps dating back to 1748. Expansion plans, which already had been approved by the city planning board, are being redrawn to save the tree, a type of move the company, based in Wawa, Pa., says it has never made before.

His skill, competitive personality and rakish features made him one of the best-known drivers in America and an easily recognizable symbol of the boisterous, dangerous, expensive world of stock-car racing.

us,HALIFAX GROUP REPORTS PROFIT DECLINE,"The Halifax Group indicated that second-half profit fell 10 percent as the company, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, increased spending to revamp computer systems and as the profitability of home loans declined. Net income fell to 541 million ($781 million), from 602 million in the second half of 1999. Full-year profit rose 9.8 percent. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 14 percent second-half decline and a full-year gain of 8 percent. Halifax's retail banking net interest margin, which measures lending profitability, fell to 2.12 percent from 2.25 percent and will fall about 10 percent, or about 22 basis points, in 2001, and less than 3 percent in 2002, its chief executive, James Crosby, left, said in an interview. Halifax's overall net interest margin fell to 1.76 percent and is likely to decline more because the company has cut its home loan rate. From March, Halifax will sell mortgages at 100 basis points more than Britain's base rate, now at 5.75 percent. That will shave about 34 a month off a 60,000 mortgage at Halifax's current 7.5 percent standard variable rate, said Ian Beggs, a spokesman. The new mortgage rate is also expected to lure customers who are now paying a higher rate -- the standard variable rate -- to transfer about 10 billion in mortgage balances, Mr. Crosby said. The bank has 19 percent of the overall British mortgage market. The lender, based in West Yorkshire, last year bought the insurer St. James's Place Capital and Bank One's British credit card unit to diversify away from mortgages.",2001-02-21T05:00:00+0000

Profit from operations will increase less than Kellogg's previous goal of 8 percent to 10 percent a year because of higher advertising costs, he said. Kellogg shares fell 25 cents, to $27.10.

While most retailers had their worst holiday season in at least five years, Williams-Sonoma increased profit by controlling inventory costs.

Or in a throwback to those shining examples of enlightened thought from the 18th and 19th centuries, should the conflict have been handled by a duel or by ''shunning''? Your writer seems to pine for an America that existed in the mythology of what we imagine the 19th century to have been. If manners have failed us, is it because we haven't tried hard enough?

Armed only with accounts at A.O.L. and E*Trade, the kid had bought stock and then, ''using multiple fictitious names,'' posted hundreds of messages on Yahoo Finance message boards recommending that stock to others. He had done this 11 times between September 1999 and February 2000, the S.E.C. said, each time triggering chaos in the stock market. The average daily trading volume of the small companies he dealt in was about 60,000 shares; on the days he posted his messages, volume soared to more than a million shares. More to the point, he had made money. Between September 1999 and February 2000, his smallest one-day gain was $12,000. His biggest was $74,000.

Joe served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and earned a degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University. He put his radar expertise to use when he and his young bride, Tziporah, volunteered to serve in the Israeli Army during Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49. Upon returning to New York, he joined his father's business, the Olympic Glove Company, and took the helm following his father's death. At age 35, Joe decided to study for the rabbinate. He graduated from the Jewish Theological (Conservative) Seminary and was ordained in 1966, becoming Rabbi at Temple Beth El in Waterbury, CT. Ten years later, he and Tziporah made ''aliyah'' to Safed, Israel where they founded Kehillat Shalva, the first Conservative synagogue in Galilee.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Where the Thorny Devil Dwells,"There's a stunning clarity and vibrancy in Art Wolfe's wildlife portraits that help lift THE LIVING WILD (Wildlands Press, $55) well beyond the typical cuddly-critter and fangs-of-death coffee-table fare. Part of the book's extraordinary power comes from seeing the animals in their natural habitats, often in wide-angle shots, and part of it comes from Wolfe's careful, often haunting, compositions. More than 140 species from more than 40 countries are on display in seven sections arranged according to terrain, from polar and subpolar to tropical, from island and ocean to mountains. Among the more striking images are those of the thorny devil, an improbable-looking Australian lizard covered with spines; baby spectacled caimans floating in vegetation; arresting aerial views of a lone polar bear; and a pod of 34 beluga whales in the Arctic Ocean. There is plenty to linger over in the accompanying essays from eminent scientists and conservationists like Richard Dawkins, George B. Schaller and Jane Goodall, as well as the short text blocks that describe each animal and its prospects for survival. Wolfe also includes his field notes, which provide both technical details and testimony to his patience and brio: with an alarming close-up of an elephant seal, for example, he writes: ''As I cautiously approached this three-metric-ton seal, the bull bellowed out a warning. In the cold temperature, his moist, warm breath was recorded on film. Fortunately, the smell of his breath was not.'' Inevitably, there is an elegiac quality to Wolfe's images -- particularly those of mountain gorillas and other species hovering near extinction. Yet despite the call to arms issued by the book's sobering assessment of global habitat destruction, pollution and overhunting, Wolfe still says: ''This book is not about the species we are too late to save. It is about the species that we still have time to save.'' Scott Veale",2001-02-25T05:00:00+0000

So it was with a bit of trepidation that I entered Pollo Kokorico, where Spanish is the primary language of the staff and clientele. The comfortable dcor slightly reduced my apprehension: up front, spinning rotisserie chickens and a lunch counter; in back, tables and hanging plants. Mirrors along both walls give the narrow room a spacious feel. High atop the refrigerated beverage case, a chicken figurine watches over the proceedings. Duly inspired, I ordered filetilos de pollo salteados con pimienta ($5.95), or pepper steak chicken breast (the menu listed English translations of the many Colombian and Cuban dishes). With growing confidence, I requested sopa de ajo (garlic soup). Alas, they were out of it, and my dialogue with the waitress broke down completely. Undeterred, she found another English-speaking patron, who patiently consulted on my substitute soup selection. We picked the hearty and delicious caldo gallego ($2), loaded with white beans, ham and potato. My entree, sauted pieces of chicken, green peppers and onions, with white rice and a choice of red or black beans, was also quite good.

The grounds, which grew to more than 1,000 acres with dozens of farm animals, was called the State Village for Epileptics. The house, ramshackle and ghostly, still stands, though it is to be demolished. The New Jersey Developmental Disabilities Council and the Epilepsy Foundation of New Jersey would like to renovate it and create a research center about the history of mental institutions in the United States. Norman Reim, communications director of the New Jersey Developmental Disabilities Council, spoke recently about the State Village for Epileptics.",2001-02-25T05:00:00+0000

Some science fiction writers have assumed the mantle of mythmakers to lend substance to what are essentially old adventure stories in new dress. While Wolfe underpins his far-future inventions with references to ancient legends and scriptures, he knows that myths, even at their most fantastic, are stories that once compelled belief. His great achievement is not the complex fictional universe he has shaped over the last two decades but the people who inhabit that universe, especially the reluctant believers like Patera Silk, an unorthodox priest whose faith grows more subtle with every shock to traditional dogma.",2001-02-25T05:00:00+0000

Not so lucky was Petey, the Karan family pooch, mauled to death by a swan in Central Park. Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren took a beating of a different kind, being pummeled by plummeting stock prices. But life-affirming moments were just around the corner: Lauren donated $5 million to establish a cancer center in Harlem; Gucci's Tom Ford bankrolled Alexander McQueen's own label, offering him a way out of his messy relationship with LVMH; the new retail conglomerate Pegasus put its money on the designers Daryl Kerrigan and Miguel Adrover; and the organizers of the otherwise emetic Vogue/VH1 Fashion Awards at least had the sense to deny John Galliano permission to present an award naked (he settled instead for an atomic-yellow corset accessorized with an American Indian headdress).

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Love in TriBeCa,"By turns bracing and breezy, Betsy Berne's first novel, BAD TIMING (Villard, $23.95), which is set in downtown Manhattan, charts an interracial, extramarital affair as seen through eyes of the single, 30-something ''other woman,'' a painter disillusioned by moderate success. One night in a bar, this unnamed narrator meets -- and later spends the night with -- Joseph Pendleton, the charming owner of a popular jazz club, who she knows is married and raising a son. Believing that both she and Joseph ''hailed from the dark side'' (though we also come to see her appetite for the lighter side -- she writes beauty articles to earn money, watches ''Beverly Hills 90210'' reruns and paints her loft entirely pink), the narrator becomes depressed after he gives her the brushoff. Many weeks later, however, she discovers she is pregnant, and after she informs Joseph that she is considering keeping the baby, ''Bad Timing'' hits just the right emotional tempo as the two circle and spar. The narrative suffers from a few stereotypes: the fact that Joseph is black inspires the white, Jewish narrator to make an exhausting number of flippant racial remarks; meanwhile, the narrator's overbearing mother and acerbic gay neighbor are uninspired versions of overly familiar characters. Though the plot proves to be as predictable as affairs with married men tend to be, Berne fully evokes every painful step in this one, as when the narrator first realizes that Joseph's favorite words to her are ''try, maybe and might'' -- and yet continues to hope their relationship will somehow work out.

Moody's Investors Service said in a news release that it has placed the real estate investment trust's preferred stock ''under review for possible downgrade'' because of the plans to acquire a 99-year lease on the center. A downgrade would knock Vornado's preferred stock, which Moody's currently rates baa3, into noninvestment-grade status. The move by Moody's came after Standard & Poor's said Friday that it was considering downgrading $450 million of Vornado debt because of the World Trade Center plan. If the two rating services were to lower their ratings, it would raise the cost of borrowing for the company, which is based in Saddle Brook, N.J. Last week, Vornado was named the winning bidder to run the 10.6-million-square-foot complex. It bid $3.25 billion.

The airport corporation said the fee for a 747-400 with 312 passengers would be $2,800 for two hours on the ground; a similar-size cargo plane would pay $2,675. The corporation decided against even higher fees for fear of discouraging airlines from using Inchon as a regional hub. Inchon will replace Kimpo on international flights in and out of South Korea.

Mr. Carty said in a message to American employees that the airline was still committed to retaining all of T.W.A.'s 18,000 unionized workers but it needed the unions to waive certain provisions of their contracts. If those negotiations cannot be completed by today's deadline for bids, American would not accept the contracts, he added. Keith O'Leary, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, said the union was confident it could resolve the issue in time. A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists, T.W.A.'s largest union, declined to comment. Mr. Carty also said that American was unlikely to accept certain T.W.A. leases at Kennedy Airport. American had previously committed to building a new $1.3 billion terminal at the airport.

us,Technology Briefing," E-COMMERCE ALLSTATE PLANS ONLINE SALES The No. 1 auto insurer, State Farm , tried it. Now, No. 2, Allstate , is having a go at selling policies through one of the first online markets for insurance, a California site called InsWeb . And this time, analysts say that they think the chances for success are good. ""State Farm couldn't make money with InsWeb,"" said Todd Eyler, a senior analyst at Forrester Research , ""but Allstate's agents are much more Internet friendly and enabled."" InsWeb distinguishes itself by providing customers with comparative prices for insurance from several companies. But customers who wanted to buy from State Farm had to contact the insurer and then wait, often to no avail, for an agent to reply by telephone or an e-mail message. Allstate says that it will send a quote via an e-mail message within 30 seconds, along with a toll-free phone number to call to complete the purchase of a policy. Joseph B.

But nobody at this new restaurant was praising the foie gras or the tuna steak. Here at Queen of Sheba, which opened just a week ago in Clinton, the crowd had turned out for fine Ethiopian fare: beef and lamb stews flavored with a rousing dark-red hot sauce, and wonderful vegetarian dishes seasoned with complex spice blends, all eaten not with forks but with pieces of injera, a spongy flat bread with the enticing flavor of sourdough.",2001-02-28T05:00:00+0000
