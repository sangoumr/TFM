(One of the people who sat for him said that after the first two or three sessions, Graham would worry the image until finally it became ''another Graham,'' rather than a traditional portrait.) This could be mere egomania, but in point of fact we go along with John Graham and are ever eager to find out what role he will play next. Despite his name, Graham (1887-1961) was Russian by birth, and he had more than his full share of the true Russian's ability to negotiate with the world in terms of fantasy. The face that he presented in his drawings was never the one that he saw in the bathroom mirror. It was, on the contrary, a face in which memory mated with make-believe. In ''The Model of Man,'' for instance, he sports imperial whiskers, a hero's wreath around his head and a huge columnar neck and throat. ''Outdo me, if you dare'' is the message. It is further emphasized by the fact that whereas the left eye has the fixed glare of Benito Mussolini in a temper tantrum, the right eye has the blankness of white marble. Service in the Russian Army during World War I left him with a whole repertory of martial images - the frogged dress uniform, the jaunty cap, the boisterous well-tended mustache. The present show also reveals that he drew himself as a fallen angel, complete with matching horns, and as a demon straight out of pre-Columbian sculpture. John Graham adored women. On the evidence of this show, he preferred them to be ample in form and stately in their bearing, with a touch of fat around the jawbone and a wide, clear, penetrating gaze. Big hats amused him, and he opted instinctively for poses that harked back not only to the turn of our own century but, in at least one case, to the opulent and leisured attitudes in which the great ladies of the Italian Renaissance chose to be portrayed. Yet there, too, he could not resist fantastication. A lion's head, a rather vicious-looking dog and some distinctly peculiar birds (in ''Leda'') -all were brought in to hoist the image clear of the matter-of-fact. Though it comfortably fills the ninth-floor Emmerich Gallery, this is a show that leaves us calling for ''More!'' It can be seen through Nov. 23. Also of interest this week: Goya's ''Allegory of the City of Madrid'' (Spanish Institute, 684 Park Avenue, at 69th Street): It is not every day that a major Goya comes into town. We owe the brief loan of his ''Allegory of the City of Madrid'' to the fact that since 1982 New York and Madrid have been sister cities, with all that that implies in the way of cultural exchange. Accompanied in the present instance by a group of related and elucidatory prints from the Municipal Museum in Madrid, the ''Allegory'' dates from the period during which Madrid was occupied by the French and Napoleon had named his brother Joseph King of Spain. In December 1809 the Madrid city council decided, doubtless for reasons of its own, to commission a portrait of Joseph I, as he was called, and in February 1810 Goya got the commission. Given the hatred of the French intruders that was to characterize his famous painting ''May 2, 1808,'' it cannot be imagined that Goya relished the task. What he produced was not so much a portrait of the temporary King as a personification of the city of Madrid. Majestic in scale - 8 feet 8 inches by 6 feet 6 inches - the painting made a great effect in the city hall. It was subject, however, to more than one adjustment. When Joseph I found it convenient to leave town after the French were driven from Madrid, the portrait of Joseph Bonaparte was overpainted with the word ''Constitution.'' When Joseph got to come back again, Goya painted him back in, just the same as before. Joseph then got beaten at the battle of Vitoria, and Goya painted him out again. ''Constitution'' was put in again, only to be painted out when it emerged that the new King of Spain did not care for constitutions and was never going to sign one. Not until 1826, when Goya was living in France, did another painter, Vicente Lopez, make the definitive adjustment by painting in the date of the patriotic uprising that had been suppressed by the French in 1808. These ups and downs notwithstanding, this is a painting that no one who loves Goya will wish to miss. It can be seen Monday through Saturday, from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M., through Nov. 9. Christopher James (Witkin Gallery, 415 West Broadway): Christopher James, painter and photographer, is showing 26 new paintings (one of them a 5-panel picture that measures 60 by 90 inches) on the theme of women in and out of water. As was evident in 1983, when he had a first show on this same subject, the theme is just about inexhaustible. Furthermore, waterborne women are omnipresent - or so it would seem -no matter where Christopher James happens to turn up. France, Mexico, Thailand, India, Hungary and New Hampshire - it's splash, splash, splash, all the way. Working, as he does, primarily with watercolor, James has the advantage of a medium that ebbs and flows like the water that is basic to all his images. It also has the disadvantage that it is very difficult to control when used on the huge scale that is fundamental to James's best paintings. To get the weight, the texture and the fullness of the women's bodies to rhyme with the tumult of the water is a neat trick, and one that he carries off as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Within the general theme of the pool or bath, the range of feeling is unexpectedly large, thanks to James's gift for exact observation. There is, to begin with, the contrast between the swimmers' heads, which are customarily above the water, and their bodies, which thrash around below. From the neck up, they look like Neptune's kid sisters - alert, energized, exhilarated, often superb in their looks. From the neck down, their forms are wildly distorted by the movement of the water and the play of reflection. Distortion in this case is not mockery. The combination of frantic activity with optical commotion is one that gives us a new idea of the expressive potential of the human body. The fact that limb and sinew are pushed every which way does not so much debase them as lend them a heroic strangeness, as if the bodies in question were being remade, over and over and over. Puffing and blowing, shaking and shuddering, these are human beings not diminished but magnified. It also seemed to this visitor that Christopher James has a sharp eye for the extent to which the goings-on in the swimming bath offer material for a modern mythology. There is more to these swimmers than athletics, that is to say. The painting called ''Swimming Lesson, Budapest'' has erotic overtones that suggest that something more than the breast stroke is being taught. And as for the fine-looking women who tote monumental hammers and spanners in the series of paintings that deal with the maintenance and underwater repair of the baths, they are colossal presences, as emblematic as they are redoubtable. (Through Dec. 7.) Daniel Bennett Schwartz (Armstrong Gallery, 50 West 57th Street): Last seen in New York in 1967, Daniel Bennett Schwartz is a figurative painter who works in a peculiarly timeless idiom. He can make a small variant of a painting of bathers by Thomas Eakins and not fall flat on his face, for instance, and he can compose and construct a complicated figure subject in ways that suggest a long familiarity with antique sculpture. At the same time, he can paint a sunny day on the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, with groups of young people exercising, reading or lying around doing nothing much of anything, in a way that documents our own day. When he works from a single figure, fully dressed and in close-up, the result has a look of high-grade illustration. It is the middle distance and the jumble of young people minding their own individual business that seem to suit him best. (Through Dec. 4.) Judy Tomkins (Leo Castelli Gallery, 420 West Broadway): With the exception of a wonderfully evocative image of an old-style pork store and an interior of a table laid for two, Judy Tomkins's new photographs have almost no echo of human presence - unless the picture of two trashbins, one bearing the legend ''Lucky,'' the other the legend ''Unlucky,'' may also be said to have human undertones. The other images have in common that their subject matter is spare and sparse, often seen from an unexpected angle and with discreet but fanatical attention to placing, detail and texture. A sliver of staircase, two or three little flowers, a quick sharp glance at bathroom furniture are all that is needed, when this particular finger is on the button, to bring about a memorable result.

The second and final volume of Jack Chambers's comprehensive critical bioraphy of the charismatic jazz trumpeter Miles Davis shares all of the virtues and flaws of the first. (Beach Tree/Morrow has just published a new hard-cover edition of ''Milestones 1,'' which appeared in 1983.) ''Milestones 2'' picks up Mr. Davis's career in 1960 and is an indispensable turntable companion. It encompases the breakup of Mr. Davis's paradigmatic quintet with John Coltrane and the formation of an equally influential unit with Wayne Shorter, Herbit Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams; Mr. Davis's uneasy truce with free-form jazz and his flirtation with rock and funk; his temporary retirement in 1975, and his far-from-triumphant comeback in 1981. Mr. Chambers does a commendable job of relating Mr. Davis's music to larger jazz trends. He also succeeds in conveying the forces at work in Mr. Davis's private life - his battle against the debilitating side effects of sickle-cell anemia, his fourth marriage, to the actress Cicely Tyson, and his frequent brushes with the law and with racial prejudice real and imagined. As was true of the earlier volume, there is some vital spark missing from ''Milestones 2.'' Mr. Chamberws keeps his distance from his subject - perhaps the ideal stance for a critic but not for a biographer. Denied access to Mr. Davis, who is notoriosly unfriendly to those who would write about him, and curiorusly disinclined to conduct interviews with the trumpeter's associates, Mr. Chambers has relied too heavily on secondary sources.",1985-11-03T05:00:00+0000

Quinn has been hired to follow Stillman, to prevent him from murdering his son. In the beginning the city is transparent, a place of light and air in which Quinn can stay outside of his mind's tortured concerns, concentrating on neutral details. Later is is reminiscent of that wasted city in Nathanael West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts,'' a place begging for interpretation and order.

This influence has continued unabated (except for the disruptions of war) to the present day, and forms the bedrock for any attempt to explain the recent sharp increase in popularity of non-Western music in New York.",1985-11-03T05:00:00+0000

us,  HOW ECONOMIC POLICY HAS GONE AWRY...,"Last month, Franco Modigliani was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, an honor that many economists regarded as inevitable. His research in corporate finance, monetary policy and savings cycles has laid the groundwork for much of modern economics. Last week, Kyle Crichton, editor of the Business Forum, talked with the 67-year-old Nobel laureate in his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Q. What was the reaction in your native Italy when you won the Nobel Prize? A. In Italy, they just went wild. I am well known there - I speak out on public issues. I had telegrams from the top echelons of the Government, from the President of the Republic on down. Q. Despite your prominence, you have never held a major Government post. Why not? A. The main reason is that I have been told that if you join the Government, then you cannot criticize the Government - you must support it even when you disagree. I'm not willing to do that. In fact, I resigned as an adviser to the Treasury during the Cambodian invasion, because I didn't want to advise a Government whose policies I disapproved. Q. Looking back on your career, what do you consider your greatest accomplishments? A. I would put at center stage two contributions to macroeconomics. One was the clarification of Keynes's General Theory, in my first major journal article, in 1944. I showed that Keynes's theory of wage rigidity - the notion that wages often fail to rise and fall with economic ups and downs - is what makes Keynesian economics so different from classical economics.",1985-11-03T05:00:00+0000

For some cooks, the pursuit of a single necessary ingredient is what the quest is all about, the chance to reward one's friends with an authentic national dish, Brazilian feijoada or a genuine Hungarian Szekely gulas, every element in place, the proportions balanced and the recipe evolved over long discussions with a purveyor of Brazilian or Hungarian food who still remembers what it tasted like in the old country and who has the contents on hand to prepare it that way.",1985-11-03T05:00:00+0000

There is more to his genius, however, than is revealed in the familiar patter arias or the energetic crescendos that are the focal point of his Italian finales and popular overtures.

But they depend only on themselves, unaided by religion or myth, and of course what most of them find within themselves is revelation only to themselves.'' Mr. Davies, by contrast, adheres to rather a more old-fashioned approach to art: drawing upon both Jungian myth and religious allegory, he has created a rich oeuvre of densely plotted, highly symbolic novels that not only function as superbly funny entertainments but that also give the reader, in his character's words, a deeper kind of pleasure - delight, awe, religious intimations, ''a fine sense of the past, and of the boundless depth and variety of life.''",1985-11-06T05:00:00+0000

He is taken into custody by immigration officials, who question him through a Justice Department interpreter. Mr. Medved indicates that he is not seeking asylum, according to the officials; the interpreter, Irene Padoch, who spoke with him by telephone, later disputes that assertion. Oct. 25 - Mr. Medved is returned to the Soviet freighter at 2 A.M. As the launch approaches the ship he jumps again into the water and swims ashore. Seven Soviet seaman come from the freighter, pick him up and carry him onto the ship. Some witnesses report that there was a struggle. Oct. 28 - Mr. Medved leaves the freighter and is interviewed aboard a Coast Guard cutter by officials from the State Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a doctor. He is given physical and psychiatric examinations at a nearby Navy facility and spends the night on shore. Oct. 29 - The sailor is given another psychiatric examination early in the morning and the interview resumes. He repeatedly confirms his desire to return to the Soviet Union, and is returned to the ship. Oct. 31 - President Reagan orders an investigation into the situation after hearing the conflicting story of the translator in the first interview, who says Mr. Medved told her that he wanted asylum after he first jumped ship. Nov. 3 - Three Ukrainian-American groups petition the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to keep the ship from departing until Mr. Medved can again be interviewed by American officials.",1985-11-09T05:00:00+0000

One is reminded of Renata Adler's novel ''Pitch Dark,'' in which the heroine, Kate Ennis, must choose a name similar to, yet slightly different from, her own, and decides on Alder; in both these works, the naming strategy seems to be a kind of tipoff, a way of telling the reader that the book at hand will unapologetically combine fiction and memory.",1985-11-10T05:00:00+0000

Recordings, usually originating in Europe, seem to conceal this fact, suggesting that the art of the recitalist is far from dead, that the successors of Lotte Lehmann, Maggie Teyte and Alexander Kipnis are alive, well and even prosperous.

Rudyard Kipling wearing spectacles and a mustache looked very much like my beloved grandfather, who never annoyed children by telling them if they could keep their heads and generally behave themselves, they would ''be a man, my son.'' Robert Louis Stevenson with his wispy hair and trailing mustache at one time probably looked like that sissy boy who talked about his ''nursie'' in ''A Child's Garden of Verses,'' poems chanted in derision but never forgotten by the children in my neighborhood.

In a world - the world, that is, of the Read-It-Yourself books - peopled, or creatured, by rather too many wimps, goody-goods and falsehearted cutie-pies, with cipher parents who exist silently in the background representing order at its most coldblooded, the Pigs are an encouraging bunch. They are pleasingly compact in shape, as low to the ground as Bruegel peasants. They all have extremely cheerful ears which manage to be earthbound yet suggest potential holidayish flight. The younger Pigs are occasionally perfectly dreadful to each other. But remember, they are siblings, and one of the great values of these books is their ability to dramatize the ridiculous and trivial and sickeningly frequent fights that siblings engage in every day of their lives, and yet suggest the siblings' essential fondness for each other, their dependency, their mutual good will.",1985-11-10T05:00:00+0000

It is the story of Tekla Haymanot, one of Ethiopia's great saints, who was popularly known as the saint who prayed on one leg, after his other had withered away. In fact he was one of the most able patriarchs of the Ethiopian Church and largely responsible for its 13th-century literary and monastic efflorescence. (Christianity came to Ethiopia in the fourth century, and the church there developed its own rich hagiographic tradition.) After Tekla's death, the monks at Debra Libanos, the monastery he founded, wrote down the stories they heard about him and illustrated them with brightly colored illuminations.

Since no choreographer or theatrical designer can equal the gory details that a film studio's special effects department can devise, dance's level of violence is probably rather low.

A chance encounter with Grady Fring the Kredit King leads him to New York City; he returns on a bus, meeting the former ''world's-smallest-perfect-man,'' among others. The tale's funniness derives, reviewers said in 1966, from the author's perfect ear for dialogue and ''Norwood's unstinting goodwill in a world of junk.'' BROTHERS AND KEEPERS, by John Edgar Wideman. (Penguin, $6.95.) Two brothers grow up in Pitts-burgh. The older, John Edgar Wideman, becomes a Rhodes scholar and a professor. The younger, Robert Wideman, is convicted of murder and sentenced to life. Last year their story, as told by John Edgar Wideman, was hailed in these words by Ishmael Reed in The Book Review: ''By combining his own literary skill with the candor and vitality of his brother's street style, Mr. Wideman gives added power and dimension to this book about the contrary values and goals of two brothers.''

Tribe, Harvard Law School's distinguished constitutional scholar, mentions William Howard Taft more than Ronald Reagan in this short study of the United States Supreme Court. Indeed, there are only seven references to President Reagan in the entire text. Even so, ''The Senate Save This Honorable Court From Ronald Reagan'' might have been a more appropriate and more candid title. Today's Supreme Court, Mr. Tribe notes in his prologue, is the first ever to have a majority of members over the age of 76. Mr. Tribe never comes out and says it, but his point is clear: President Reagan may remake the Court. Mr. Tribe does not talk explicitly about the President's judicial philosophy or the shape of a possible Reagan court. Instead, he combs the history of the High Court for a set of interesting but unstartling propositions that seem disconcertingly applicable to the situation at hand. A single Justice, he notes, can affect the Court profoundly. The narrow literal interpretation of the Constitution prized by conservatives is largely a myth. Most Supreme Court Justices, even Earl Warren, turn out to be pretty much what their benefactors wanted. Selecting Justices on the basis of a single issue - say, abortion or school prayer - is unacceptable. And, perhaps most important, the Senate has both a long tradition and constitutionally mandated duty to scrutinize all High Court nominees closely.",1985-11-10T05:00:00+0000

A spate of recent Vietnam novels have handled the subject in various ways, but ''Hollaran's World War'' may be the first to approach it with whimsy. Tom Hollaran is a character we've seen a lot of lately, the troubled veteran who can't adjust. Questioned about his war experience, he'll say little more than, ''Absurd. It was just stupid.'' ''Absurd'' is the word that best describes his failures back home - marriage, social life, job. Worst and silliest of all, he can't get well, despite two V.A. psychiatrists. Hollaran is likable, and his helplessness all the more poignant, because he faces his difficulties with more irony than self-pity. Yet though his road to recovery is checkered with pratfalls, the roots of his problems are serious. Like many Vietnam veterans he feels let down by the nation, but the betrayal that matters most to him is personal - his wife's desertion during his tour. That private breach of faith makes Hollaran vengeful; his confrontations with Sandra and her new lover, comical at first, soon get him in trouble with the law. Enactment of hostility is undertaken on a grander scale by Hollaran's only friend, the monosyllabic Eddie Sadowski, who builds a private war machine to wreak vengeance on the ''bozos'' who sent him into battle. Once they are harmlessly channeled, these impulses prove survivable and purgative for both men, and it is in this kind of reliance on psychiatric truism that the book is least interesting.",1985-11-10T05:00:00+0000

The year was 1926, and the mind was that of the 22-year-old John Sanford, who prefers in this narrative, despite a strong ego and distinctive opinions, to call himself ''you.''

Players Association for salaries due members of last season's team. At the bottom line is this: All of the franchise's players are now free agents, and that includes Marcus Dupree, who bolted the University of Oklahoma as a sensational sophomore running back and later signed a five-year, $6 million contract with the Breakers in 1984, when they were based in New Orleans. Dupree's contractual freedom may be moot, though, because, back home in Philadelphia, Miss., he is still slowly rehabilitating a knee that was severely damaged in the opening game of 1985. ''If it is a career-ending injury,'' says Jack Galmiche, the Breakers' president, ''Marcus will collect the remainder of his contract from Lloyd's of London.'' And if it is not, then Dupree has his sights set on the National Football League. Though not eligible for the N.F.L. draft until 1987, he would likely petition the league to accept him next year.",1985-11-11T05:00:00+0000

[Page A1, Column 6.] The Geneva meeting might produce an agreed-upon statement of ''guidelines'' providing impetus to the arms control negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Reagan Administration officials said. But they stressed that there was only a slim chance of this. [A1:4.] Moscow condemned a radio speech addressed Saturday to Russians by President Reagan, charging the broadcast showed Washington was not interested in peace. [A1:5.] President Reagan gave his support to any move to repeal a resolution adopted 10 years ago by the General Assembly of the United Nations equating Zionism with racism in a message to the Conference on Israel, Zionism and the United Nations in New York. [A1:6.] Thriving free enterprise in Canton impressed and perplexed a Soviet parliamentary delegation that visited the city. ''If this is Marxism, I must re-read Marx,'' one of the Russians is said to have remarked after seeing Western-style hotels and many other signs that Canton is pursuing an ''open door'' policy. [A1:3.] 12 judges shunned memorial rites in Bogota, Colombia, for the scores of people who died in a siege at the Palace of Justice last week. The judges, who survived the battle in which 11 justices died, said they stayed away to protest the Government's handling of the crisis. [A3:1.] Poland took a step toward freeing political prisoners that was still far short of a general amnesty, which had long been hinted at officially. The Government asked prosecutors to make a case-by-case review of prisoners who could be released. [A9:1.] National King George III was defended by his descendant, the Prince of Wales, in a news conference in Washington. He also said his wife found John Travolta a good dancer. The Princess and the actor danced at a White House dinner Saturday night. [A1:1.] An Arizona community was erased because it contained an asbestos hazard. The attractive subdivision of Mountain View Mobile Home Estates, housing about 50 families, was built on the site of asbestos factory just outside Globe, Ariz. [A12:2.] The Soviet seaman who jumped ship off New Orleans had initially ''decided somehow that he wanted to come to the United States,'' Secretary of State George P. Shultz concluded. But he defended the Reagan Administration's decision to permit the seaman to depart with his ship despite a subpoena by the Senate Agriculture Committee. [A13:1.] Irv Rubin, the new leader of the Jewish Defense League, said anti-Semitism is on the rise in the United States and that he plans to revitalize the group by training Jews and non-Jews in the use of weapons and other paramilitary activities. [A17:1.] Metropolitan A plane collision over New Jersey killed the occupants in both private planes and started fires as wreckage fell on residential and commercial buildings in Fairview and Cliffside Park, opposite Manhattan's Upper West Side. Broken power lines blacked out more than 1,400 homes in both communities. [A1:2.] The mother of a teen-age suicide has tranformed her grief into a crusade against suicide prevention among children. Anne Spoonhour's 14-year-old son, Justin, hanged himself in February 1984 near his home in Putnam Valley, N.Y. She is among the volunteers and professionals educating the public about depression among adolescents and about early warnings of suicide. [A1:1.] A high-school admissions study said New York City's selective public high school admissions system places poor and minority students at a disadvantage and ''creates the suspicion of racially discriminatory admissions practices.'' [B3:5.] Refurbishing of bridges, tunnels and airports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey would be undertaken over the next five years under a $5 billion plan now being prepared, Stephen Berger, the agency's new director, said.

us,"  MAN WAS MEANT TO FLY, BUT NOT AT FIRST","In these days of the Concorde and the space shuttle, it is astonishing to realize that, as Clive Hart's PREHISTORY OF FLIGHT (University of California, $35) reminds us, until a century ago ''by far the most voluminous notes on the theory of bird flight were made by Leonardo da Vinci.'' Mr. Hart, who teaches literature at the University of Essex in England, elegantly and lucidly explores thinking about flight and flying machines from preclassical times to the 18th century. ''The Prehistory of Flight'' is not, he tells us, a general survey of aviation - his ''Dream of Flight'' (1972) was about practical attempts at flying, and he promises a later book about the iconography of flight. Instead, this beautifully illustrated volume explores what sages through the centuries have thought about flying and how they have applied scientific principles to the problem of human flight. He tells us, for example, that some commentators, believing human flight to be inevitable, urged that all flying machines be owned or regulated by the state. Others predicted disaster and felt that if people could fly, no one would be safe from marauding aeronauts. Mr. Hart also examines several heavier-than-air inventions, including Burattini's flying dragon (whose landings, the 17th-century Italian engineer promised, would cause ''only the most minor injuries''), Swedenborg's flying saucer and Pierre Desforges's airborne gondola (which, unlike many others discussed here, was actually tested, in 1772; the pilot, the Abbe Desforges himself, escaped with only a bruised elbow).",1985-11-17T05:00:00+0000

us,  CITY OPERA'S ASTONISHING GOOD HEALTH,"The New York City Opera's 1985 season ends tonight with, as fate will have it, a performance of ''Kismet,'' a feeble new production that did nothing to advance the proposition that American musicals belong on the opera stage. Ideally and more symbolically, the company would be bringing down the curtain with one of its unquestioned successes, of which there were enough to reinforce the impression that the City Opera is enjoying astonishingly good health. To predict that the company is entering into a golden period in its history may be foolhardy, but if that proves to be too sanguine an outlook at least it must be conceded that the financial and/or artistic disaster that many skeptics were predicting when Beverly Sills took charge of the company six years ago has not come to pass. Far from it. The attendance figures for the 19-week season that began on July 5 will not be official for a while, but company officials estimate that box office held at or about 80 percent of capacity, off 3 or 4 percent from last year. The loss is attributed chiefly to a slippage on summer weekends, when many people tend to leave town or stay home next to the air-conditioner. How the figures will break down in terms of individual performances is unknown at this writing. Who knows, perhaps ''Kismet'' will lead all the rest. If so, it would not shake my faith in the taste of the City Opera audience, merely in my ability to fathom it.",1985-11-17T05:00:00+0000

us,REGIONAL TROUBLE SPOTS,"The summit participants are expected to discuss several regional conflicts, particularly in light of President Reagan's United Nations speech calling on the Russians to help resolve such wars. Many strains in American-Soviet relations have arisen over the years because of problems in other parts of the world, and regional crises have not infrequently set back progress in other areas, such as arms control. Afghanistan rrIn December 1979, more than 100,000 Soviet troops entered Afghanistan, which shares borders with the Soviet Union and Pakistan. The cause, the United States says, was Soviet dissatisfaction with the Afghan leadership and the need to prop up a leader who was closer to Moscow. The Soviet Union says its soldiers were invited to help Afghanistan fight rebels supported by Pakistan and the United States. After the Soviet troops arrived, the civil war continued, pitting the Kabul Government's forces and their Soviet allies against thousands of Islamic rebels. Efforts to find a political settlement, including the withdrawal of Soviet troops, have been conducted under United Nations auspices, but have produced no agreement. Cambodia In December 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia and toppled the Khmer Rouge Government, which had taken over in 1975 and slaughtered, it is estimated, millions of its own people. The Soviet Union supports the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Samrin, which has been battling guerrillas from a Western-backed coalition that includes forces loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former head of state; the Khmer Rouge, which is led by Pol Pot; and the non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.",1985-11-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"Music/Noted in Brief;   For Margaret Whiting, A 40-Year Look Back","There are several personal facets to Margaret Whiting's life that provide handy hooks on which she can build her performances: Her father, Richard Whiting, wrote some of the great pop songs of the 1920's and 30's; she grew up on intimate terms with the songwriters who were her father's friends, and her own singing career has covered more than four decades and has brought her in touch with a variety of performers. One of Miss Whiting's special talents is her ability to use these resources in ways that, rather than seeming to be name-dropping, add warmly revealing color to her programs. She has never done this more effectively than in her current show, written and produced for her by Jack Wrangler, at Freddy's Supper Club, 308 East 49th Street. The fact that her father wrote the songs for the only Ethel Merman show that ever flopped out of town leads her to sing a song from a revised version that finally reached New York - ''You're an Old Smoothie,'' a love song built on collegiate hip talk of the Depression years. This recalls a conversation with Miss Merman in which they find that each made her stage debut playing the same role in ''Girl Crazy,'' which leads to a song by George and Ira Gershwin that they both sang in the show: ''Boy! What Love Has Done to Me,'' a torch song that is both funny and touching in Miss Whiting's treatment.",1985-11-21T05:00:00+0000

us,"Music/Noted in Brief;   'Beehive,' Satirizing Pop Music of the 60's","''Beehive,'' a revue that weaves three dozen 60's pop songs into a tongue-in-cheek history of the decade, bursts with so much vocal talent and zany humor that one can forgive the show for seeming to have only half a brain in its head. Like its prototype, ''Leader of the Pack,'' ''Beehive'' (the title refers to the hair style) strings together songs that are funny in hindsight for their attentiveness to the fashions of the day. The show, which began an open-ended run at Sweetwater's (170 Amsterdam Avenue, at 68th Street) on Tuesday, is performed by a cast of six young women costumed in parodies of period fashions. The material has been grouped into four blocks, covering teen-age girl talk, the women of the British Invasion, soul music and Janis Joplin (skillfully impersonated by Laura Theodore). Where ''Beehive'' succeeds best is in re-creating the silly, party-loving spirit of the early and mid-60's. In the show's wittiest sequence, singers doing cartoon impersonations of Connie Francis, Annette Funicello, Brenda Lee and Leslie Gore have a singing bee, sharing their old hits. The conference climaxes with Pattie Darcy's rip-roaring recreations of two musical melodramas by the Shangri-Las. The formidable task of impersonating both Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin falls to the young pop-soul singer Peggi Blu, and she meets it more than halfway, delivering ''Proud Mary'' and ''Respect'' with power and zeal to spare. The show's musical high point is a medley of ''A Natural Woman'' and ''Do Right Woman,'' sung by Miss Blu with Miss Darcy.",1985-11-21T05:00:00+0000

The book is replete with quotes from Russian emigre teachers who never had to learn good English; shrewdly, Jennifer Dunning, a dance critic and reporter for The New York Times, doesn't clean it up. She also has good informers. The dancer Jacques d'Amboise gets at the heart of the pre-Revolutionary style that students absorbed, and still do, from their teachers. Reminiscing about Pierre Vladimiroff, he says: ''He epitomized the Petipa school, the pre-Soviet manners, that are gone now. With the Soviets, everything is big. Up.

Selznick,'' has compiled a second look at Hollywood through memos, letters and telegrams. This time it doesn't work. ''Inside Warner Bros. 1935-1951'' is a jumble of memos by actors, writers, directors, producers and Harry and Jack Warner, the heads of the studio. ''Memo From David O. Selznick'' was shaped by that great producer's obsessions and spent, for example, more than 100 pages on ''Gone With the Wind.'' ''Inside Warner Bros.'' dips in and out of more than 100 movies, often in only one or two memos. The result is a hodgepodge that contains some nuggets but only rarely any depth. Most interesting are the sections on ''Casablanca,'' John Huston and the war between art and commerce in the making of Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' and ''Streetcar Named Desire.'' An exchange of letters between B. Traven, the reclusive author of ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' and Mr. Huston, who was to win Academy Awards for writing and directing a movie version of the novel, is compelling. One is struck also by numerous angry letters from Bette Davis, one of the few actors who expressed her dudgeon on paper, and such oddities as William Faulkner trying to get out of his screenwriting contract. One of the problems with ''Inside Warner Bros.'' is inherent in the material. Casting decisions on bad or forgotten movies seem trivial decades later.",1985-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Answer:Many Austrians would agree that Innsbruck and Salzburg make the best stops on the 535-mile run from Zurich to Vienna. (If no break is taken, the journey takes close to 10 hours.) The ride to Innsbruck, Austria, with the Alps rising on both sides of the valley, is one of the most scenic routes in Europe. Innsbruck itself offers a legendary setting: the street called the Maria-Theresienstrasse seems to run into the steep slopes of the Nordkette mountain, which rises to 7,657 feet. The city is the cultural and tourist capital of the Tyrol. Salzburg, too, is much admired for its attractive setting and historic sites. Its stands at the foot of the Hohensalzburg, the medieval stronghold of the prince-archbishops who ruled the region. Guided tours of the castle are available. Other attractions include the house where Mozart was born. Another old city on the route is Linz, built on both sides of the Danube, but since it is only 100 miles from Vienna, it may not make such a convenient break in the journey.",1985-11-24T05:00:00+0000

us,SAVING 'THE LAST SUPPER',"In Curtis Bill Pepper's article ''Saving 'The Last Supper' '' (Oct. 13), Father Angelo Caccin is quoted as calling any eucharistic interpretation of Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' ''ridiculous.'' His insistence on an exclusively dramatic reading of the event - 12 men in reaction to Christ's announcement of the betrayal - has a long tradition behind it, a tradition that includes even Rembrandt, whose several variations on Leonardo's picture further dramatize the event. But there is a countertradition: In Rubens's close rendering of Leonardo's mural, preserved in a large etching bearing Rubens's name and copyright, the table is cleared so as to leave only a loaf and chalice in front of the Christ; below is the legend, ''Take, eat, this is my body. . . .'' In other words, Rubens found that the entire presentation, including all the gestures of the Apostles, might be interpreted as reactions to the institution of the eucharist.

The new television movie is not a sequel to the first, but its executive producer is also George Lucas and it also has Ewoks in abundance. Ewoks, of course, are the large Teddy bears in monk's cowls first seen in Lucasfilm's ''Return of the Jedi,'' and the nice thing about them is that they are almost totally benign. Nonetheless, there's no denying that benignity has its limits, especially on prime-time television, and tonight's appearance by the Ewoks is different than the one they made last year.

(University of Chicago, $12.95.) In 1884 four shipwrecked English sailors bounced about the Atlantic Ocean in a lifeboat for 24 days. When one became ill the captain killed him, and the survivors drank his blood, butchered his body and ate it. A famous trial ensued. At issue: did cannibalistic homicide on which survival depended constitute murder? Last year our reviewer, Sally Falk Moore, called the book ''a happy mixture of adventure story, colorful description, moral parable and legal argument.'' JULIA AND THE BAZOOKA: And Other Stories, by Anna Kavan. (Norton, $5.95.) The French-born, twice-divorced author renovated houses, raised bulldogs and for 30 years used amphetamines and heroin until her death in 1968. But Jill Robinson said in The Book Review in 1975 that Anna Kavan is interesting not for her life, but ''because her work comes through with a powerful androgynous individuality and because the stories are luminous and rich with a fresh kind of peril.'' ''Julia and the Bazooka'' contains 15 stories and an informative introduction by Rhys Davies. Miss Robinson compared Kavan's novel ICE (Norton, $5.95) to Baudelaire.

Kennedy. 168 pp. Athens: The University of Georgia Press. Cloth, $16.95. Paper, $9.95. WENDELL BERRY'S poetry is a validation of his decision nearly 20 years ago to give up the literary life in New York and seek a deeper bond with his ancestral home, a hillside farm in Henry County, Kentucky, on the Kentucky River. His straightforward search for a life connected to the soil, for marriage as sacrament and family life, affirms a style that is resonant with the authentic. The lyricism is not forced, but clearly grows out of a deep bond with the earth and its generosity, with all of nature. He mocks little except man's arrogance and destructiveness, and he can be said to have returned American poetry to a Wordsworthian clarity of purpose. Nor is Wordsworth's piety out of place in Mr. Berry's world; the rustic and the rural are honored and celebrated with seldom if ever a touch of doubt for the course undertaken, a deeply committed life.",1985-11-24T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE EVIDENCE OF THINGS NOT SEEN. By James Baldwin. (Holt, $11.95.) The worst two years in Atlanta's history were 1980 and 1981, when the bodies of dead black children turned up all over the city. In the atmosphere of panic and paranoia that grew with each horrible discovery, ''Atlanta became, for a season, a kind of grotesque Disneyland.'' So writes James Baldwin of the plague of unsolved murders that ultimately totaled 28, according to a police task force set up to investigate them. The ordeal in Atlanta, whose black leadership was slow to recognize the crisis being visited upon its poorest citizens, would seem an aptly challenging subject for a writer of Mr. Baldwin's gifts. But this slim volume will not satisfy many readers. Nor, one suspects, does it satisfy the author himself. ''I have never, in all my journeys, felt more of an interloper, a stranger, than I felt in Atlanta,'' writes Mr. Baldwin, who was on assignment for Playboy, where much of this book first appeared. There is far too much sermonizing here on the overall state of race relations in America and not enough digging into specific facts of the Atlanta murders. Nonetheless, when Mr. Baldwin steps down from the pulpit he can still bring passionate intensity to reportage, especially in an assessment of Wayne Williams, the failed music promoter whose 1982 conviction for two murders closed the Atlanta case. Mr. Baldwin derides the controversial fiber evidence that allegedly connected two victims with Mr. Williams's home in what the author terms ''an untidy trial,'' and he judges the verdict dubious.",1985-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Yes, it is. Just ask Tony Degrate, the Texas Longhorn defensive tackle who captured the Lombardi in 1984. Right from the start, there were clues that Degrate would have a tough time cutting it in the National Football League. The word from the scouts was that he lacked sufficient agility and quickness, and he was not drafted last spring until the fifth round. It was Cincinnati that chose him, and it was Cincinnati, after three preseason games, that cut him. He was picked up by Green Bay, where he played just two downs in one game last month before being dropped again. Degrate, now working as a freelance commercial artist in Austin, says that he was hurt by being drafted so low and hurt again by being dumped so quickly, but that he'll try once more next summer.

LOWENSTEIN, the one-time Congressman and longtime liberal activist, was a man obsessed, and so was Dennis Sweeney, the deranged former civil-rights worker who assassinated him in 1980. James Ryan, the author of ''Dennis,'' the new play about these star-crossed men, seems to share his subjects' single-minded passion for pursuing justice, or their own conceptions of it, to the bitter end. In ''Dennis,'' Mr. Ryan has not only absorbed the increasingly voluminous (and controversial) literature about Mr. Lowenstein and Mr. Sweeney - starting with the accounts of Teresa Carpenter, David Harris and Richard Cummings - but he has also conducted his own journalistic research.
