There will always be someone who tests positive at the Olympics, says Gary Wadler, a New York University medical professor and the chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agencys Prohibited List and Methods Committee. Somebody will do a dumb thing, thinking they can get away with it. To some athletes, apparently, doping remains an unofficial Olympic sport. Time for a tutorial on the drugs of summer.

The pearl-bearing coconut is one of some 30 surprising fruits that caused me to pencil an exclamation mark in the margins of The Fruit Hunters: A Story of Nature, Adventure, Commerce and Obsession. Though I did not rank them, I would place the coconut more or less equidistant between the orange that tastes like chicken noodle soup and the exploding variety of pomegranate (grenade means pomegranate in French), but some distance below the miracle fruit, which makes everything eaten afterward taste sweet, including boyfriends. Adam Leith Gollner possesses a talent as rare and exotic as a coconut pearl. I opened this book, Gollners first, expecting the standard nutmeat of competent nonfiction and found instead something lustrous and exhilarating. Gollners is not the sort of talent one can develop. It is genetic, physical  an exquisite sensitivity of tongue, nose and eye. He describes one variety of the stinking durian fruit as tasting like undercooked peanut butter-mint omelets in body-odor sauce; langsats are tangy-sweet detonations of citric perfection; biting into a monkey tamarind is like eating cloud. Here is the Kuching market in Borneo, through the prism of Gollners gifts: Balmy effluvia rising off the sidewalk clamp down on your sinus cavity. ...

Death, we are reminded, is always one mistake away  a shoelace caught in a net, a skiff overloaded with salmon. Fall into the 42-degree water and youll be dead in minutes.

It was yet another case of a desperate middle-aged man. Why is America so full of them? The claimant owned a large boatyard and marina in Pensacola, Fla. This location, it may be remembered, was flattened in 2005 by Hurricane Dennis. In this case the insured, a man named Otto Planck, had filed a complete-loss claim for his $2.238-million, 85-foot sailboat, the Beckys Best Boy, which, he said, he desperately tried to tow out of harms way and failed, resulting in his rescue in a life raft by the Coast Guard and utter destruction of the boat, which he claimed he saw sink with his two own salt-stung eyes. Our local insurance investigator was disturbed by the condition of a piece of the teak hull of the Beckys Best Boy that was found washed up on a local beach. The piece had been broken outward, against the curvature of the hull, seemingly from a great force, and the investigator also noted that Otto Planck had training as a Navy Seal years earlier. He knew how to blow things up, and he also knew how to survive in extreme conditions. The boat, built in 1923 for a minor British industrialist (and no doubt christened with a more stately name), was valuable but would have been tough to resell, given the extensive restoration it needed.",2008-06-01T04:00:00+0000

He equates the search for a cure with genocide  its part of a campaign to wipe out ASDs [autism spectrum disorder]  and he wants the world to know that those to whom the cure would be offered neither need it nor desire it: I speak for many when I say we are happy the way we are.A genetic difference is often adaptive and can be regarded as an advance in the evolutionary process; it is well-known that autism sometimes brings with it remarkable powers in the areas of music, art and mathematics. In the 2006 movie X-Men: The Last Stand, the augmented powers of those known as mutants are even more remarkable and include the ability to walk through walls, to move metal objects as large as Californias Golden Gate Bridge, to auto-generate fire or ice, to be in seven places at the same time, to read minds, to assume any identity, to kill with a touch, to fly like Icarus, to change the weather. These abilities are seen by many normal human beings, and a few mutants, as disabilities, as an indication that the person who possesses one of them is a freak. ",2008-06-01T22:54:09+0000

us,The Weird Sisters,"They just keep getting weirder. The ""they"" I'm referring to are the bdelloid rotifers  small transparent animals that live in damp places such as puddles, or patches of moss. Among evolutionists, these animals have something of a cult following, because they have a lifestyle that is not supposed to exist. As far as anyone can tell, the bdelloid rotifers are ancient asexuals: they appear to have been living entirely without sex for more than 85 million years. And each time we learn more details of their lifestyle, the wackier it becomes.  Evolving to live without sex is easy; all sorts of organisms do it the whole time. For example: aphids, weevils, snails, water fleas, nematode worms, scorpions, even the occasional lizard, have all been known to evolve asexuality. Instead of reproducing via eggs and sperm, asexuals can reproduce in any number of ways. For instance, some bud off a piece of themselves; the piece grows into a whole new animal. The bdelloids, like many other asexuals, reproduce by means of eggs that don't need to be fertilized.   No, evolving asexuality isn't the hard part. The hard part is making an evolutionary success of it.   In the short-term, asexuals seem to have an advantage: they don't have to waste time finding and seducing mates, but can just get on with reproducing. Not having to find a mate makes it easy for asexuals to live in transient habitats, such as puddles, for it doesn't matter if they never encounter anyone else. Moreover, because asexuals only have daughters, their populations can grow rapidly. In a sexual population such as humans, females must have, on average, two children for the population to remain the same size. In an asexual population, females only need to have one. If each female has two, the population grows. Sex, in other words, is expensive.   Yet if you look at the great tree of life, asexual groups tend to be out on the twigs: there are no great branches of the tree that contain only asexuals. In other words, no one can point to a big group, such as birds or fish, or even snails, and say, ""That's a group composed only of asexuals."" What this means is that asexuality evolves often, but rarely persists for long: asexuals typically go extinct soon after they appear.   The swift extinction of asexuals, and the absence of big asexual groups, suggests that sex is essential for long-term evolutionary success: giving up sex is a Bad Idea, a kind of evolutionary suicide.   Exactly why this is so remains unclear. But it's thought to have something to do with the fact that sex generates new gene combinations. Whereas a sexual creature like you or me inherits a unique mix of genes from our parents, asexuals are lumbered with the same set of genes their mother had. For an asexual, then, the only source of genetic novelty is mutation. (Mutations and sex are both sources of genetic variation, but they work differently. Mutations  accidental changes to DNA  are the ultimate source of genetic novelty. However, mutations tend to be harmful more often than they are helpful: they tend to disrupt genes that are already working. Sex, in contrast, takes pre-existing genetic variation and shuffles it, generating new gene combinations.)   Which brings me to the bdelloids. These animals are the great exception: a group of more than 450 species from which sex is entirely absent. How are they managing to flourish despite this epic period of abstinence? For they do flourish: bdelloids are everywhere. Go outside, collect some damp moss, and stick it under the microscope, and the odds are you'll find some. You can even find them in Antarctica.   One possibility is that they are having sex after all, just very secretly. Certainly, other supposed ancient asexuals turned out to be having sex on the sly. For instance one group of aphids that were thought to be ancient asexuals turned out to be producing males. And genetic evidence has revealed sex in several groups, such as the Placazoa (small animals that live in the sea), that have never actually been seen doing it.  But genetic evidence suggests that the bdelloids are not having conventional sex: their genomes show no sign of it. Instead, they seem to be getting up to something else entirely.   It now looks as though the bdelloids do acquire new genes from time to time  that mutation isn't their only source of genetic novelty. Yet their means of getting new genes is unlike anything previously known for an animal. Namely: they seem to pick up genes from the environment, and add them into their genomes.   The latest analysis of bdelloid genomes shows that the animals don't just have rotifer genes. They also have dozens of genes from bacteria, fungi, and plants. For instance, the genome of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga contains genes that bacteria use for making components of their cell walls. (What the rotifer is using them for is unclear.) Some of the other genes the animal has acquired are known only from a few groups of bacteria and fungi.  Which is seriously weird. Horizontal gene transfer  the technical term for when genes move sideways between distantly-related species  is common among bacteria, but extremely rare in animals. The likely reason for the difference is that bacteria have only one cell, and their genes are not sequestered in a cell nucleus, so adding a new piece of DNA here or there is easy. Animals, in contrast, not only keep their genes away from the rest of the cell, in a cell nucleus. They also have specialized sex cells  eggs and sperm. In order for a gene from a fungus to be permanently added to, say, the human genome, it must somehow get into the sex cells.   No one knows how the bdelloids pick up these genes. One idea is that it may be due to another oddity of their lifestyle: their ability to dry up and blow away. When the piece of moss they are living in dries up, these animals often dry up, too. It's a state of suspended animation  add water and, all being well, they come back to life as frisky, or even friskier, than before. (This isn't unique to bdelloids  some other small animals have evolved to endure desiccation. But most of these others can only do it at particular stages of their lives. The bdelloids can do it at any time. They can also  probably as a consequence of their desiccation abilities  survive high levels of radiation. Much higher than other animals can.) During the drying and rehydration, cell membranes may become disrupted, and their DNA fragmented. Perhaps all this makes it easier for stray bits of foreign DNA to get into the cells that will become eggs.   Some of the bacterial genes were clearly acquired a long time ago. We know this because they have evolved features that bacterial genes lack. Which suggests that getting new genes this way may be rather rare  the sort of thing that happens maybe once every five hundred thousand years or so. All the same, the occasional acquisition of foreign genes may have helped the bdelloids to their profoundly unorthodox success.   But personally, I'm glad that making a go of chastity is so difficult. For the real lesson from these weird sisters is that, for most of us, it's far better to have sex.  **********  NOTES:  The ease of evolving asexuality, and the possible advantages of sex, have been much discussed; see, for example, Bell, G. 1982.

us,Electoral Enchantment,"SANTA FE, N.M. -- He is bamboo-thin, relies on a pair of walking sticks to help him up a canyon trail, and has lost most of his vision. But at age 88, Stewart Udall, patriarch of the first family of the American West, politics division, has seen enough history to recognize a Big Moment when it's staring back at him.   ""I think we're moving into a new era,"" he said. ""There's something very pleasing and hopeful going on, a resurgence after a long drought of positive conservation sentiment.""  (Photo: Stewart Udall at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. (Credit: AP Photo/Jeff Geissler)) He was talking about love of land and passion for place, and how it can crystallize in a political shift once every generation or so. For Udall, one of only two surviving members of President John F. Kennedy's original cabinet, that time first came with the 1960 election.  Doors opened. Fresh ideas were aired. And from Udall's long tenure as secretary of the interior for both Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson came a legacy of public land protection responsible in large part for so many wilderness areas just outside Western cities.   Now, the son also rises. And so does the nephew.   Udall's next-door neighbor in the 400-year-old city of Santa Fe, his son Tom, a Democratic congressman, has a huge lead in the polling on who will become New Mexico's next United States senator, in the seat being vacated by the Republican Pete Domenici. Udall's nephew Mark, a Democratic congressman from Colorado, is a slight favorite in the open senate race in that state, for the seat opened by the retirement of Republican Wayne Allard.   Two new Democratic senators  first cousins from a family that dates to early Mormon settlers in the Southwest  does not an earthquake make. But New Mexico also has three open Congressional seats, and the presidential campaigns will spend a lot of time here in the Land of Enchantment as well.  If the West does prove to be the gateway to the presidency this year  with at least three purple states in play  the campaigns could do no better than to look at polyglot New Mexico.   Urban and wild define the New West  fast-growing cities nestled in Wallace Stegner's ""geography of hope."" The art, the history and the food of New Mexico have been commoditized, for obvious reasons. But many of its special places are intact, and owned by every American because of the Wilderness Act, which dates to the fertile years of Stewart Udall's reign as the emperor of the outdoors.  Mark Udall has climbed every one of Colorado's 54 peaks over 14,000 feet (and has come within 3,000 feet of the summit of Everest). Tom Udall is the driving force behind legislation that saved the spectacular Valle Vidal in northern New Mexico from the predations of Dick Cheney and his allies.   Not so long ago, when Western Democrats wanted to caucus, ""it was sometimes my cousin Tom and I having a beer,"" Mark Udall told Outside Magazine. Now Democrats are poised to own the West, or so goes the heady talk here at 7,000 feet.   Mountain Democrats found their way in part by rejecting the excesses of coastal Democrats, and by looking at what worked for their elders, like Stewart Udall and his brother, the late Morris Udall. The Udall name is written deep into the salmon-colored canyons and mesas of the Southwest, as prominent as a petroglyph. The family traces its lineage to John D. Lee, who was shot by a firing squad as a scapegoat for the slaughter of 120 settlers by a Mormon militia in 1857.   The leaders of the Mountain Meadows massacre were never held to account. Instead, John Lee, who was treated like a son by the Mormon patriarch Brigham Young, was offered up to the government for his role in the execution-style killings of men, women and children.   ""I have been sacrificed in a cowardly, dastardly manner,"" said Lee, just before the blindfold was slipped over his eyes. His last words were: ""Center my heart, boys. Don't mangle the body.""  From Lee, who married 11 women, came the Udall dynasty, which also includes the current Republican senator from Oregon, Gordon Smith, a distant cousin of Tom and Mark.   ""I don't like the term dynasty,"" said Stew Udall in our interview. ""We're Westerners and small-town people.""   The bolo-tied elder in the adobe house is modest about his influence. ""The Bush Administration has all by itself created a backlash,"" he said. ""They've been anti-science, and anti-environment."" That backlash, plus a longing for a clean break with the energy policies of the past, are what make him think Democrats can ride an ascendancy of ideas into office in the fall.  Republican opponents of the Udall cousins, by contrast, show how that party has faltered. The nominee in Colorado, Rep. Bob Schaffer, has been trying to explain a junket to the Mariana Islands partly arranged by the firm of the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Pictures show him parasailing while supposedly investigating labor practices. In New Mexico, Republicans just chose as their senate candidate Rep. Steve Pearce, whose hard-right rigidity is a poor fit for this year and this state.   Stewart Udall was a child in the still-frontier West of the 1920s; he struggled through the Great Depression, and fought the Nazis in World War II. Reflecting on his long life recently, he wrote a message to his grandchildren.  ""The lifetime crusade of your days must be to develop a new energy ethic to sustain life on earth,"" he wrote. ""Cherish sunsets, wild creatures and wild places. Have a love affair with the wonder and beauty of the earth.""  His intention was to give the kids something to outlive him. He didn't need to worry. The legacy is already there, in the land and the love affair that brought him to it.    ",2008-06-04T22:41:56+0000

us,Man Scales Times Building and Is Arrested,"Video   Listen to an interview with Alain Robert    Updated, 6:30 p.m. &#124; Alain Robert, a French stuntman known for climbing tall buildings, scaled the north face of the New York Times building on Thursday, ascending 52 stories to the roof and clutching a bright green banner, before police officers arrested him around 12:22 p.m. (Update: Hours later, a second man was arrested after climbing to the roof on another part of the building. For a complete account of the day's events, see the article prepared for Friday print editions.)  Police and security officials cordoned off the sidewalk below, on West 41st Street, as a crowd assembled. The words on the banner were illegible from the sidewalk, but from office windows inside the tower the slogan on the banner could be clearly read: ""Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week.""   The man later confirmed, moments after being arrested on the roof of the tower, that he was Alain Robert, a 46-year-old stuntman famous for scaling structures like the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Eiffel Tower and Montparnasse Tower in Paris.  He wore a T-shirt with his name and the address of a Web site (thesolutionissimple.org), exercise pants and climbing shoes. He had long blond hair. He used no rope, harness or parachute.    Police officers blocked off the sidewalk at the base of the building and asked members of the crowd to move along. Construction workers on a building directly across West 41st Street, facing the northern face of the building, looked on with expressions of astonishment and amusement. A crowd gathered on the sidewalk, pointing, gawking and capturing pictures and images with cellphones, digital cameras and video cameras.   ""This is a publicity stunt, it looks like,"" Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, said as she entered the building. ""There is definitely going to be an arrest.""   Wearing a backpack slung over one shoulder, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., the chairman of The Times Company and publisher of The Times, who is himself an avid climber, ducked under the police tape and examined the spectacle. He declined to comment.  Alain Robert, a stuntman, climbed the 52-story New York Times building on Thursday before he was arrested. His banner read, Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week. (Photo: Sewell Chan/The New York Times)  Inside the building, reporters and editors pressed their faces to the glass windows to catch a glimpse of the climber. He weaved in and out of the ceramic rod facade, seeming to rest on the building's exterior beams every few floors before swinging himself back out the face of the rods to resume his climb. He stopped occasionally to wave to the crowd, which included construction workers on a building across the street and others in front of the Port Authority.   Each time he took his hand away to wave, there were gasps from observers who feared he might fall.  As Mr. Robert climbed the building, police officers from the Emergency Services Unit, using a freight elevator, assembled on the roof. ""He's up to 30-something,"" one police officer radioed another. ""No, he's up to 45,"" another officer radioed back.   A security guard remarked, ""Apparently, he's a professional climber,"" and a police officer replied: ""To be honest, looking at this building, you don't have to be a professional. This building is like a ladder."" (Designed to be environmentally sensitive, the tower is sheathed in distinctive horizontal ceramic rods that are intended to diffuse sunlight, allowing natural light to enter the building while keeping out heat and increasing the building's energy efficiency.)  Around a dozen police officers were on the roof when Mr. Robert arrived there. One of them put on a hard hat, harnessed himself to the building and sat out on a beam, a couple of feet from the building, as Mr. Robert reached the top. When he got to the top, he calmly perched himself on the same beam, beside the officer, and raised his hands. The pair began talking.   Mr. Robert was placed in handcuffs and led across the roof and into a service elevator. The police officers had evidently made preparations in case he resisted, but he submitted peacefully. A Times reporter asked, ""Where are you from and why are you doing this?"" Mr. Robert said, ""France. Paris.""   Mr. Robert was taken down through the service elevator to an underground service area of the building. A reporter asked why he had chosen The Times's building. His reply: ""This is a green building, which is a fantastic step."" He proceeded to talk about global warming as the police led him away. He said he believed the news media would give more prominence to coverage of global warming if a man climbed a prominent building.  (Photo: A view of Alain Robert from inside the Times building, as he climbed it. (Photo: Matthew Orr/The New York Times))  Asked about the difficulty of the climb, he replied: ""No, the building was easy. It was just a statement. Plus, I'm a professional climber.""  He added: ""My name is Alain Robert. I did climb about 80 buildings around the world and I climbed even the five tallest.""  Then he was moved into a squad car and driven away, east on West 40th Street. He was taken to the Midtown South police precinct.   New York's skyscrapers have long been sites for death-defying stunts. In 1974, a French stunt artist, Philippe Petit, famously walked a high-wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. (Mr. Petit's feat is the subject of a new documentary, ""Man on a Wire,"" which has received critical acclaim.)  More recently, in 2006, another stuntman, Jeb Corliss, was arrested after trying to jump off the observation deck of the Empire State Building. (Mr. Corliss challenged his indictment in court. A trial judge ruled last year that as a professional jumper, he was experienced and careful enough to jump off a building without endangering his own life or anyone elses. But this year, an appellate court overturned the ruling, although it reduced the charge in the indictment from a felony charge of reckless endangerment with depraved indifference to life, to a misdemeanor charge of reckless endangerment.)  Mr. Robert is a practitioner of free-soloing, a kind of climbing done without ropes, harnesses or other external supports. (""Free climbing,"" another kind of climbing, involves no equipment to aid in the climb, but does include ropes for protection in the event of a fall.)  (Photo: Alain Robert stands on a ledge outside the building. (Photo: Matthew Orr/The New York Times))   ""Climbing is my passion, my philosophy of life,"" Mr. Robert states on his Web site, adding, ""Although I suffer from vertigo, although my accidents left me disabled up to 60 percent, I have become the best solo climber."" The Web site states that in eight years, Mr. Robert has climbed more than ""70 skyscrapers and mythical monuments around the world.""  The 52-story steel-and-glass Times building, at 620 Eighth Avenue, between West 40th and 41st Streets, was designed by Renzo Piano and opened last year. A personal assistant at Mr. Piano's architectural studio in Paris said he was traveling and not immediately available for comment.   Along with The Times, it is occupied by several law firms, including Covington & Burling, Seyfarth Shaw and Goodwin Procter. Before The Times moved last year, it had previously occupied a neo-Renaissance building at 229 West 43rd Street since 1913.  Inspector James McCarthy, the commanding officer of the Midtown South police precinct, said Mr. Robert would likely face several criminal charges, including, at the least, reckless endangerment.   Reporting was contributed by Corey Kilgannon, Eric Konigsberg, Jennifer 8. Lee, Conrad Mulcahy and Allen Salkin. ",2008-06-05T15:47:35+0000

us,"Woman in Charge, Women Who Charge","Is it a coincidence that the bubbling idiocy of ""Sex and the City,"" the movie, exploded upon the cultural scene at the exact same time that Hillary Clinton's candidacy imploded?  Literally, of course, it is. Figuratively, I'm not so sure.  And before I set off an avalanche of e-mails explaining why Hillary deserved to lose, I want to make one point clear: I am talking here not about the outcome of her candidacy  mistakes were made, and she faced a formidable opponent in Barack Obama  but rather about the climate in which her campaign was conducted. The zeitgeist in which Hillary floundered and ""Sex"" is now flourishing.  It's a cultural moment that Andrew Stephen, writing with an outsider's eye for the British magazine the New Statesman last month, characterized as a time of ""gloating, unshackled sexism of the ugliest kind."" A moment in which things like the formation of a Hillary-bashing political action group, ""Citizens United Not Timid,"" a ""South Park"" episode featuring a nuclear weapon hidden in Clinton's vagina, and Internet sales of a Hillary Clinton nutcracker with shark-like teeth between her legs, passed largely without mainstream media notice, largely, perhaps, because some of the key gatekeepers of mainstream opinion were so busy coming up with various iterations of the nutcracker theme themselves. (Tucker Carlson on Hillary: ""When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs."" For a good cry, watch this incredible montage from the Women's Media Center.)  Stephen is not the first commentator to note that if similarly hateful racial remarks had been made about Obama, our nation would have turned itself inside out in a paroxysm of soul-searching and shame. Had mainstream commentators in 2000 speculated, say, that Joe Lieberman had a nose for dough, or made funny Shylock references, heads would have rolled  and rightfully so.  But 16 months of sustained misogyny? Hey -- she asked for it. With that voice, (""When Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear, 'Take out the garbage' "" Fox News regular Marc Rudov, author of ""Under the Clitoral Hood: How to Crank Her Engine Without Cash, Booze, or Jumper Cables,"" said in January). With that ambition, and that dogged determination (""like everyone's first wife standing outside a probate court,"" according to MSNBC commentator Mike Barnicle) and, of course, that husband (Chris Matthews: ""The reason she's a U.S. Senator, the reason she's a candidate for president, the reason she may be a front-runner is her husband messed around.""). Clearly, in an age when the dangers and indignities of Driving While Black are well-acknowledged, and properly condemned, Striving While Female  if it goes too far and looks too real -- is still held to be a crime.  In a culture that's reached such a level of ostensible enlightenment as ours, calling a powerful woman ""castrating""  however you choose to put it  ought to be seen as just as offensive as rubbing your fingers together to convey a love of gold coinage when you talk about a Jew. It's nothing other than an expression of woman-hate -- and the degree to which such expressions have flourished, in the mainstream media and in the loonier reaches of cyberspace this year, has added up to be a real national shame.   Which brings me back to ""Sex and the City.""   How antithetical Hillary's earnest, electric blue pants-suited whole being is to the frothy cheer of that film, which has women now turning out in droves, a song in their hearts, unified in popcorn-clutching sisterhood to a degree I haven't seen since the ugly, angry days of Anita Hill and  the first incarnation of Hillary Clinton. How times have changed. How yucky, how baby boomerish, how frowningly pre-Botox were the early 1990s. How brilliantly does ""Sex""  however atrocious it may be  surf our current zeitgeist, sugar-coating it all in Blahniks and Westwood, and yummy men and yummier real estate, and squeakingly desperate girl cheer.  Take Miranda: a working mother archetype for an anti-woman age. She's so callous now that she won't let her nanny eat a decent meal, and so defiantly sexless that she's let her pubic hair grow in. Take Charlotte: the Good Mommy, with an angel's face and no employment, a seemingly limitless credit line and an adoring troglodyte of a husband (so short, so bald, and yet so good with the gelt). And then  please  take Samantha. At 50, she's the one girlfriend aged enough to bear the baggage of old-time, Clinton-era feminist sentiment. She's a self-centered heart-breaker, a real man-eater -- you should see how she rejects a drooping roll of sushi -- her corruption made manifest by the fact that, at film's end, she develops (gasp!) a gut.  Yes, a gut, girls, like yours and mine and that of virtually any real woman who's over 35, or has had children, or has something more important to do than full-time Pilates.  ""Sex and the City"" is the perfect movie for our allegedly ever-so-promising post-feminist era, when ""angry"" is out and Restalyne is in, and virtually all our country's most powerful women look younger now than they did 20 years ago.   Oh, lighten up, I can hear you say. Don't get your knickers in a twist.  Earnestness is so unattractive (in a woman). ",2008-06-05T22:08:45+0000

On Wednesday, a lawyer with the Justice Department wrote to Judge Conti contending that the e-mail message in question did not represent V.A.-wide practice or policy.

Maas was not the first architect to protest the unsightly sprawl that humans have left over much of the earths surface, but he may have been the first to suggest that we preserve whats left of our finite planetary space by creating vertical suburbias  stacking all those quarter-acre plots into high-rise residential towers, each with its own hanging, cantilevered yard. Imagine: Its Saturday afternoon, and all the barbecues are running, Maas said, unveiling his design for a 15-story building decked out with leafy, gravity-defying platforms. You can just reach out and give your upstairs neighbor a beer. He turned next to agriculture. Noting that the Dutch pork industry consumes huge swaths of land  Holland has as many pigs as people  Maas proposed freeing up the countryside by erecting sustainable 40-story tower blocks for the pigs. Look  its a pork port, he said, flashing images from PigCity, his plan for piling up the countrys porcine population and its slaughterhouses into sod-layered, manure-powered skyscrapers that would line the Dutch coast.

After Watergate, Dick Cheney, then Gerald Fords chief of staff, began seeking to rebuild the power of the presidency. With his election to the vice presidency and the terrorist attacks of 9/11, he found his moment, Savage says. The Bush administration has increased government secrecy, changed guidelines for classifying information, imposed greater control on career officials, claimed the power to disregard international law, established warrantless surveillance of Americans and, through the use of signing statements, effectively exercised a line-item veto on sections of legislation with which the president disagrees. (Savage, who will join The New York Times this summer as an investigative reporter, won the Pulitzer Prize last year for his reporting on signing statements in The Boston Globe.) Writing in The Times, Michiko Kakutani praised this astute and harrowing book. In UNCHECKED AND UNBALANCED: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror (New Press, $17.95), Frederick A. O.

My interest was skin-deep. I was armed with a checklist of superficialities, like the pattern created by the crinkled aluminum-mesh panels that clad the exterior; the seals that surround the flush-mounted, irregularly shaped windows; and the visibility of the structural steel in the tall glass wall that connects to the older building. The next day, in Ohio, I would be on a similar mission at the Glass Pavilion of the Toledo Museum of Art, a low-slung transparent structure by the Japanese architecture firm Sanaa. Marc Simmons, a founder of the New York-based facade-engineering-and-design consultancy Front Inc., which worked on both the Walker and the Glass Pavilion, instructed me to pay special attention in Toledo to the seams between the large glass panels. Crucially, if imperceptibly, every joint was occupied by a clear gasket that shielded the adhesive inside a panel from reacting chemically with the silicone seal joining the panels.

Charmed, he instantly resolved to learn this fascinating language. It was the first step in a project that would absorb Needham until his death in 1995, turning him into one of the foremost Western authorities on China, dedicated to reminding the world that the Middle Kingdoms decline into backwardness and turmoil had been preceded by centuries of extraordinary creativity  including crucial inventions like gunpowder, printing and the compass, all mistakenly thought to have originated elsewhere. The vehicle for these and countless other revelations was to be a work addressed, as Needham put it, to all educated people. The first volume of Science and Civilisation in China, published in 1954, has never gone out of print. Eighteen volumes were released during Needhams lifetime; there are now 24, with more still to come. ",2008-06-08T04:00:00+0000

The three-year pact includes more money for Internet work. A team of negotiators reached an agreement with studios, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, last month, and Saturdays vote was the final step before a full membership vote. Meanwhile the leadership of the Screen Actors Guild, which represents about 120,000 members and is stuck in its own talks with producers over a contract that expires June 30, has called the other unions agreement inadequate and has decided to start a campaign against the AFTRA contract, Variety reported. Since about 44,000 actors are members of both unions, a lack of support for the AFTRA deal  something SAG leaders are encouraging  could help SAGs attempt to win a better deal. SAG will hold a rally at its Los Angeles headquarters on Monday, and a town hall meeting is planned for Wednesday. The Writers Guild of America, which was supported by SAG during its recent strike, has urged its members to attend the rally. The AFTRA board said in a statement that it would view any attempt by SAG or its leadership to undermine or interfere with our ratification process as a violation of both the law and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Constitution. ... The Milken Institute, an economic research organization, has released a report that found the three-month Writers Guild of America strike that ended in February resulted in a loss of more than $2 billion, pushing California into a recession and costing 37,700 jobs, Reuters reported.",2008-06-09T04:00:00+0000

Clint Eastwood made two films about Iwo Jima that ran for more than four hours total, and there was not one Negro actor on the screen, he said at the time. In the interview with The Guardian, the British newspaper, Mr. Eastwood defended the historical accuracy of his movies, saying that black troops were not involved in raising the flag at Iwo Jima. The story is Flags of Our Fathers, the famous flag-raising picture, and they didnt do that, Mr. Eastwood said in the Friday interview.

us,Meet the Intraterrestrials,"Some weeks ago, I wrote about microbes in the air and their possible role in helping clouds form, in causing rain and in altering the chemistry of the high atmosphere. This week, I want to go in the opposite direction and plunge down into the earth. For many bacteria live deep in the oceans and deep in the earth, far from light, far from what we normally think of as good, comfortable places to live.   For example: the bottom of the Mariana Trench. This is a seam on the sea floor in the northwestern Pacific, not far from the island of Guam; it's where the Pacific plate is sliding under the Philippine plate. The ocean is deeper here than anywhere else in the world: the seabed is 11 kilometers (almost 7 miles) below the surface of the sea. Yet even here, where the pressure of the water would crush you or me, there are bacteria. Some of them won't grow at all unless the atmospheric pressure is at least 50 megapascals (around 7,000 pounds per square inch), and they grow better if the pressure is greater  70 megapascals (more than 10,000 pounds per square inch). For comparison, the pressure at sea level  the pressure we have evolved to bear  is 700 times less.   Then there are the ""intraterrestrials""  the organisms that live in rocks deep in the earth, the creatures of the ""deep subsurface biosphere."" Bacteria have been found in rock samples taken several hundred meters below the sea floor, even when the sea floor itself is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) below sea level.   We don't know how many organisms are living in this (to us) alien environment. But based on what's been found in rock samples so far, the numbers are likely to be gigantic. One recent study found between 1 million and 1 billion bacteria per gram of rock (a gram is 1/28 of an ounce). It may be that a large proportion  perhaps as many as a third  of all bacteria on Earth live in rocks below the floor of the sea. That would be a lot of bacteria.  Until recently, it was assumed that the chemical alteration and decomposition of rocks in the ocean crust was due purely to elemental forces  the circulation of seawater, the grinding of rocks against one another. But increasingly, intraterrestrial bacteria are suspected of making a contribution, too. Shards of volcanic glass from basaltic rocks hundreds of meters beneath the seabed show grooves and etchings that appear to have been made by bacteria.   Volcanic glass? When molten basaltic rock wells up from deep in the earth and meets cold water at the bottom of the ocean, the heat is quenched and the rock hardens. As it does so, it forms a characteristic shape known as a pillow basalt  for it looks as though someone has stacked up a pile of rocky pillows. (Every year, around 20 cubic kilometers -- around 5 cubic miles  of new basalt forms at the mid-ocean ridges  the places where the sea floor is spreading apart as tectonic plates move away from each other.) Glass forms when the rock cools so fast that crystals don't have time to take shape. Thus the edges and rims of pillow basalts are often highly glassy; indeed basaltic glass is an important component of the top layers of the oceanic crust.   Bacteria of the deep biosphere can't get energy directly from sunlight, but they can get energy from a surprising array of other sources, including iron, manganese, sulfur or nitrogen compounds, methane and hydrogen. Indeed, bacteria collected from the deep biosphere show an enormous diversity of metabolic activities. And in chiseling away at rocks, in leaching out minerals to consume, and by excreting waste products, they alter the chemical composition of rocks  and also the composition of the seawater that circulates through the pores and fractures in them. Perhaps  though no one yet knows for sure  they do so on a grand scale, contributing substantially to the composition of rocks and oceans. Experiments suggest that deep biosphere bacteria may accelerate the weathering of basalt rocks by a factor of six compared to physical or chemical forces, especially at the low temperatures that prevail in much of the seabed.  And here's something nifty. By altering the chemical composition of rocks, the bacteria may alter the magnetic properties of rocks as well.  Basaltic rocks newly arrived at the sea floor give off a strong magnetic signal. This is due to titanomagnetites  iron oxides that contain some titanium  that are present in the rocks. As a result, the mid-ocean ridges often feature a zone of high magnetization known as the central anomaly magnetization high. The strength of the magnetic signal fades as you move away from the newest rocks  as you move from the mid-ocean ridges towards the coasts. (The new rocks are gradually pulled away from the ridge by the spreading apart of the ocean plates; a rock's distance from the ridge is thus a reflection of its age.) Soon after basalts arrive at the sea floor, then, they lose some of their magnetism. Why?  A recent series of experiments that looked at the loss of magnetism of young basaltic rocks shows that bacteria may greatly accelerate the loss. Rock slices were kept for 355 days in vials of seawater with or without bacteria. The bacteria in question were strains of Desulfovibrio  bacteria that give off hydrogen sulfide much as we give off carbon dioxide. Hydrogen sulfide interacts with the iron in the rocks to form iron sulfide; in doing so, it destroys the magnetic signal. And after 355 days, the rocks kept with bacteria gave off a lower signal than the rocks kept in seawater alone. Bacteria, it seems, can efficiently reduce the magnetic signal of young rocks.  No one knows, yet, how significant such effects are. Moreover, we're only beginning to make an inventory of who's down there  the identity of most intraterrestrials remains mysterious. But given their vast numbers, and the range of their activities, these small organisms from the weird world of the rocks below the sea will probably turn out to have a big-time influence on the composition of the oceans and the rocks of the seabed.   **********  NOTES:  For bacteria of the Mariana Trench, see Kato, C., Li, L, Nogi, Y., Nakamura, Y., Tamaoka, J. and Horikoshi, K. 1998.

us,Godless,"This Father's Day, one of most popular pastors in America will open his megachurch to homosexual dads, an event that would usually signal an extreme weather alert from old guard Republican evangelical leaders.  (Photo: Rick Warren. (Credit: Alex Wong/Getty Images for Meet the Press)) But by welcoming gay fathers into his Southern California flock, Rick Warren, author of the ""The Purpose Driven Life,"" is not just living up to the highest standards of Christian fellowship, he's turning the page on a particularly embarrassing part of our politics.   Just to refresh: it was televangelist Pat Robertson who predicted ""earthquakes, tornadoes and possibly even a meteor"" would hit Orlando for inviting gays to Disney World, and Rev. John Hagee who blamed Hurricane Katrina on a vengeful God angered over a gay pride parade in New Orleans. And they did this even without Doppler radar.   The fact that these people were taken seriously about anything other than, say, what color socks to wear on bingo night, tells us something about how far we've strayed rom the pulpit into the town square.   Over the last 30 years, church and state have become far more entangled than any of our fair-minded founders and their better successors -- including some chiseled on Mount Rushmore -- envisioned.   The good tidings from Warren's Saddleback Church come at a time when Barack Obama has ditched his incendiary ex-preacher, and John McCain has separated himself from the apocalyptical Hagee.   It's a start, but how about a clean break? Let's go Godless for the rest of the campaign.  I know, it's not going to happen, with Obama courting evangelicals this week and McCain trying to figure what makes Catholics in the Rust Belt tick.   But for a moment, imagine no religion, as John Lennon sang.   Forty-eight years ago an Irish Catholic presidential candidate said this about a bedrock principle of his:  ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.""  And, ""I believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affair.""  That was John F. Kennedy, of course, sounding light years removed from Mitt Romney, who declared this year that ""freedom requires religion,"" and Mike Huckabee, who called himself a ""Christian leader"" and advocated amending the Constitution to follow Biblical principles. Both men are being touted as running mates for McCain.  ""Where we are today is almost the antithesis of Kennedy's time,"" said David Domke, a professor of communications at the University of Washington and co-author, with Kevin Coe, of ""The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America.""   Not so long ago, politicians could talk about national defense or currency fluctuations without having to mention Him. But since 1980, the total number of references to God in major presidential speeches has jumped 120 percent over the preceding half-century, Domke and Coe found.   ""It's the verbal equivalent of an American flag lapel pin: few notice if you do it, but many notice if you don't,"" Domke and Coe wrote in a recent essay in Time. Domke, by the way, is no tweedy secularist; his wife is a Presbyterian minister.   Obama has been the more overtly God-centric candidate in this campaign, perhaps because of the whispers that falsely paint him as a Muslim, or interchangeable blondes on Fox News who interpret playful hand gestures with his spouse as ""a terrorist fist jab,"" as E.D. Hill said on air.  At a meeting with prominent Christian leaders on Tuesday, Obama discussed his ""personal journey of faith,"" as one participant recounted. That, alone, goes against Kennedy's dictum of keeping it private.   Teddy Roosevelt, a McCain hero, was prescient on this point as well. He argued against putting, ""In God We Trust,"" on the currency in 1907, saying it cheapens the divine. ""It not only does no good,"" he wrote, ""but it does positive harm.""  (Photo: Ted Haggard. (Credit: AP Photo/Erik Stenbakken, New Life Church)) To their credit, some ministers have learned from their fallen fellows of the cloth. Four years ago, Ted Haggard's phone number was on speed dial at the White House, and he regularly boasted of his political clout as head of the 30-million-member National Association of Evangelicals.   Then came his admission of patronizing a gay prostitute and buying crystal methamphetamine, a two-fer in the hypocrisy sweepstakes. It also made for one the strangest images on television -- a smiling Haggard in his S.U.V., with wife and kids, talking about meth and massages from a buff male escort.   On the plus side, Pastor Ted is now welcome at Rick Warren's church on Sunday.  Joel Osteen, the feel-good Texas optimist who is perhaps the nation's most popular minister, and Warren have both disavowed politics this year. They will not endorse a candidate, allow politics in the service, or issue thinly disguised election ""guidelines,"" hint, hint.   Bless 'em.   Now let the politicians pick up the cue, following advice of one of Teddy Roosevelt's Rushmore face mates.  ""Say nothing of my religion,"" said Thomas Jefferson. ""It's known to my God and myself alone.""  **********  POSTSCRIPT: Following news of the plan by gay fathers to attend Saddleback Church this coming Sunday, the church's pastor, Rev. Rick Warren, has issued a statement clarifying the church's role. ""We did not invite this group, and I will not be meeting with them,"" he said, adding that he had a previous commitment and would not be in church on Sunday.  ",2008-06-12T02:40:44+0000

Mr. Levien, a designer based in London who created the piece with Nipa Doshi, his Indian-born partner, explained that it fuses an Indian way of sitting with the European typology of a sofa. Because the backrest is made up of cushions of varying sizes printed with metal foil patterns on the back, it is suited for placement in the middle of the floor, rather than against a wall.

The bill, owed to the Clothiers Company of Worcester for uniforms worn by the royalists in the battle, was left unpaid when Charles fled the country, and it remained unsettled after he returned to claim the throne in 1660.

us,Pure Tyranny,"Righteous indignation is so easy, so pleasant, when you can sit back and fling it overseas.  I had that edifying experience on the D.C. Metro Wednesday morning, reading in the Times about the Muslim women in France who are going to cosmetic surgeons for hymen replacement surgery so that they can bleed as seeming virgins on their wedding nights.   It's a practice that has, apparently, become relatively common in the immigrant communities of Europe. But, of course, it seems like hair-raising news in a country like ours, where a young woman's right to do with her body as she sees fit has, for decades, been enshrined as perhaps the most essential part of her God-given human dignity.  As my 11-year-old says, Yeah, right.   Right after I finished reading the Times piece, I called the French Embassy to find out under what conditions French social security would pay for the hymen-restoration procedure. (It's ""mostly done in private clinics and in most cases not covered by tax-financed insurance plans,"" said the Times article; ""Oh la la!"" said the receptionist to whom I relayed my query.)  I then started rifling through my desk. And there, beneath a report showing paid family leave to be on the decline, beneath a Newsweek article on a new children's book, ""My Beautiful Mommy,"" that tells the story of a mom who becomes even prettier after a nose job and a tummy tuck, I found the story that the hymen news had immediately brought to mind.  It was also from The Times, from May 19, and featured 70-odd girls, of ""early grade school to college"" age, with their fathers, stepfathers and fathers-in-law-to-be, at the ninth annual, largely evangelical ""Father-Daughter Purity Ball.""   ""The evening, which alternated between homemade Christian rituals and giddy dancing""  and which culminated, for at least one father and his daughters, with a dreamy walk in the night around a lake, ""was a joyous public affirmation of the girls' sexual abstinence until they wed,"" said the Times article.   ""From this, it's only a matter of degree to the man in Austria,"" I'd scribbled across the first page.  The ""man in Austria,"" of course, was 73-year-old Josef Fritzl, who was around that time also making headlines after it was discovered that he had kept his daughter, Elisabeth, 42, locked up in a cellar for 24 years, during which time he'd raped her regularly, and had her bear him seven children.   (""It was a lovely idea for me, to have a proper family  down in the cellar, with a good wife and a couple of children,"" he said in his confession.)  Fritzl, a self-described ""man of decency and good values,"" had imprisoned his daughter after she began staying out all night and drinking. ""I had to create a place where I could keep Elisabeth by force if necessary, away from the outside world,"" he confessed.   ""Fathers, our daughters are waiting for us,"" Randy Wilson, one of the ball's organizers, said at the Colorado Springs ""Purity"" event. ""They are desperately waiting for us in a culture that lures them into the murky waters of exploitation. They need to be rescued by you, their dad.""  I don't want to take this analogy too far. I don't mean to imply that there's any equivalency between Josef Fritzl's acts and the Purity Ball. Fritzl's actions were uniquely horrific, and I am not accusing the men who danced in Colorado Springs of any crimes. But there is nonetheless a kind of horror to their obsession with their daughters' sexuality. There is a dangerous boundary violation contained in their vow ""before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity."" And there is even greater danger to the fact that this particular aspect of the nationwide ""abstinence movement"" has not been broadly denounced as the form of emotional violence against girls that it indisputably is.  Judith Lewis Herman, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, whose work with and writings on incest victims in the 1980s revolutionized the understanding of the crime and its perpetrators, believes that incest, like rape generally, has to be viewed within a wider context of power relations. Incest, she says, is ""an abuse of patriarchal power,"" a criminal perversion of fatherly control and influence. It is perpetrated, in many cases, by men who present themselves as the guardians of the moral order. And it isn't always physical; in her 1981 book (with Lisa Hirschman), ""Father-Daughter Incest,"" she writes that the violation can be emotional, too, as when a ""seductive father"" oversteps his boundaries and goes places he never should in his daughter's head.   ""Something I need from dad is affirmation, being told I'm beautiful,"" said 19-year-old Jordyn Wilson at the ball. ""If we don't get it from home, we will go out to the culture and get it.""  Sexual abuse  judging by statistics mostly based upon reports of incest  has greatly decreased in our country in recent years. From 1992 to 2003, substantiated cases went down 40 percent, according to the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire. Lisa Jones, a research professor at the center, says she thinks the impressive decrease isn't just due to changed reporting patterns or data collection methods. ""We feel like it's very suggestive of a likelihood that there's a real decline,"" she said.  There are many possible reasons for this improvement. But one, I think, that has to be considered is that girls' and women's status has risen. Acceptance of sexual assault and insult has declined. In a world where girls and women are stronger, ""abuses of patriarchal power"" are less tolerable, acceptable, and possible.  Or should be.  In highly secular France, the reaction to the drama over young women's virginity playing out in Muslim communities has been public and profound. Justice Minister Rachida Dati recently had to fight off calls for her resignation after she upheld a ruling by a regional court that had annulled the marriage of two French Muslims because the bride turned out not to be a virgin.   Our condemnation of cultural practices and beliefs in our own country that violate girls' and young women's dignity and most intimate personal boundaries should be no less total. For, when it comes to female chastity, much of what passes for ""protection"" is nothing less than sick. ",2008-06-13T03:37:58+0000

Later, he called for a singalong on One (Blakes Got a New Face), describing the process as if it were unfamiliar. He sang the line and the roar of the audience response nearly knocked the band over. He didnt ask for a louder one. But the bands drummer, Chris Tomson, was wearing a Phish T-shirt, and had attended the first Bonnaroo, Mr. Koenig said to a wave of applause.

The Squaw Man was also remade as an early talkie in 1931, during a period in which all of Hollywood, and DeMille especially, was struggling, often pathetically and disastrously, to make sense and cinema out of the newfangled dimension of talk.

Then in 2006 the city relocated the theater across the street, to the corner of Ashland Place and Lafayette Avenue, as the site was reconceived as a kind of public gateway to the cultural district. Now the city has moved the theater to the north to make way for a private developers tower that will be largely residential.

You have to swing with the punches, he said. Its not as wonderful as being on the corner, but its great to have your theater and be in a cultural district, and were going to make it work. Three years ago the city unveiled a design for a glass and stainless steel building designed by Hugh Hardy and Frank Gehry to house the theater.

us,Equal Parenting: Divide and Conquer,"So much of the conversation here the past few days has been about couples who divide household chores. It brings to mind a memory about how things probably shouldn't work.  When my firstborn was an infant and I was in the middle of a sleep-deprived, hormone-fueled meltdown, my husband, Bruce, made some comment, probably benign, about how having a baby means having no time for yourself. I took this as a declaration of war. I stormed off to make a very detailed chart of how much time each of us spent with our son, as well as how much time we each spent working, doing family-related errands and being alone. Then I flung the chart at him. It actually made me feel a little better, but it didn't measurably fix anything.    The power of lists depends on how you use them. And the discomfort so many of us feel about the approach of many couples in this article, I think, is a fear of my first kind of list. The kind that is built on resentment and that creates obligation.  ""They divide a the laundry into, 'You have to do the colored, and I have to do the white'?"" Nicholas Bakalar wrote on this blog.   ""These are two grown-ups talking? Sounds like a pair of 8-year-olds arguing over whose turn it is to walk the dog.""  And a reader named Dee echoed that sentiment, writing, ""Keeping score is a relationship killer, especially if you are in it for the long run.""  But what I realized during the months I spent with these couples is that they didn't use their lists (mental or physical) this way. Instead of creating bickering, their lists ended it. They decided what stuff went in whose basket of responsibility, and they trusted their partners to do what was in his or her bucket. They also learned to keep their mouths shut if something wasn't done exactly ""my way."" Then they forgot about it. It was taken care of. They had a lot of conversation upfront, yes, but they eliminated even more conversation down the road.  And to those posters who asked, ""Well, what if someone has a bad day or is sick or just plain tired?"" Common sense says you pick up the slack for your partner, no? Again, I don't live this life, I am just reporting on it, but these were not militant households here. Yes, they adapt to circumstance.  This isn't for everyone. I'd feel ridiculous dividing laundry into darks and whites. But it seems to work for Marc and Amy, which means that in their house it's a good idea. And that's the entire point here. Not that everyone keep charts or lists or does things the way any one of these couples do. But rather that we should all take some more time to think about how the division of labor evolved in our own relationship and decide in a focused and deliberate way whether or it exists because it make sense for us, or because it just kind of worked out that way. To each his own. But make sure you know what your own really is. ",2008-06-16T15:47:52+0000

Two years after Vatican officials urged a boycott of the film The Da Vinci Code, based on Mr. Browns blockbuster novel, the Rome diocese said Monday that two churches had been declared off limits to film crews for Angels & Demons, the Da Vinci Code prequel, The Associated Press reported. Msgr. Marco Fibbi, a spokesman for the diocese, said that the film does not conform to our views and treats religious issues in a way that contrasts with common religious sentiment. Permission to film inside Santa Maria del Popolo, above, and Santa Maria della Vittoria, both in central Rome, was denied in 2007, but the situation did not become crucial until now because production of the movie was delayed by the writers strike. Angels & Demons reunites the director of The Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard, and its star, Tom Hanks, with Mr. Hanks reprising his role as the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon in a story that involves a papal conclave, the cult of the Illuminati and a high-tech threat to the Vatican. Mr. Brown, an executive producer of both films, published Angels & Demons three years before The Da Vinci Code.

Lawyers for the government of Montgomery County, where the Barnes has been since its founding in the late 1920s, appeared before the judge, Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans Court, in March to request that he reopen the case. Judge Otts 2004 ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion. The judge said at the time that he considered the move to a downtown location the only viable alternative to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But opponents contend that the collections financial troubles have been overstated and that new ways to raise money to prevent a move have emerged.  James R.

It was during this decade, they say, that the consequences of the end of the cold war first unfurled, including the economic, political, and security challenges created by globalization; the rise of nonstate actors; the threat of weapons of mass destruction; the dangers that emanate from weak or failing states; the possibilities and limits of international institutions; and questions about whether and how to use Americas preponderant power to meet global responsibilities.

us,Equal Parenting: Whats in a Last Name?,"One surprise while writing this article was how most of the women had taken their husband's last name. While that is clearly the norm in the country as a whole, I would have guessed that this subgroup, which had made equal sharing their priority, would be more likely to keep the name they were born with or create something hyphenated with their spouse.  Of the three dozen or so couples I interviewed for the article, however, only about 10 of the women kept their names and only one, a lesbian couple, hyphenated theirs. Names are intimate and personal reflections of how we present ourselves to the world, and the decisions of these couples make clear, in the words of Amy Vachon, how ""there is no perfect choice.""   Changing your name feels unequal, she says. Not changing it means not being seen by the world as an automatic unit. Hyphenating works, at least for a generation, but can be long and cumbersome. Using one name for work and another at home means never remembering who you are. Giving baby boys Dad's last name and baby girls Mom's last name? He taking her name? Creating something new from scratch? All possible and all with their own complications.    Amy changed her name because the one she had when she met Marc wasn't actually hers. She had been married before, at 20, and hadn't thought about any other option then. By the time she divorced, she felt more like her married name than her birth name (I just can't use the term ""maiden name"" with a straight face, folks), and when she married Marc, she couldn't see entering that marriage with her ex-husband's name. So she became Vachon and thought of it as practical rather than unequal. (She also happens to like the name. For those who have asked, it's pronounced Vah-shon.)  As for me, my byline was Belkin long before I met my husband. My boys both have Belkin as their middle name, so that at any important legal occasion in their lives they will remember where they came from. And I added my married name as a third name to my passport and driver's license and such because I never wanted to be standing outside an emergency-room door trying to prove my kinship to my husband or child inside. (Yes, I tend to worry about these things, and yes, they were more of an issue 20 years ago than they are now, because a potpourri of choices has become more common.)  A reader asked a question along these lines this week that I would love to throw out here for conversation. The couples she knows who are hyphenated, she says, seem, at least from her vantage point, to share parenting more equally. Her theory is that the conversation and compromise that lead a couple to hyphenate probably also make them more purposeful about sharing other things. As far as I know there are no studies of this question (if there are, please let me know), but your thoughts from the real world would be welcome. ",2008-06-17T19:26:22+0000

us,Darwinmania!,"The party is about to begin.  (Photo: Charles Darwin. (Richard Milner/European Pressphoto Agency)) In a week or so, the trumpets will sound, heralding the start of 18 months of non-stop festivities in honor of Charles Darwin. July 1, 2008, is the 150th anniversary of the first announcement of his discovery of natural selection, the main driving force of evolution. Since 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth (Feb. 12), as well as being the 150th anniversary of the publication of his masterpiece, ""On the Origin of Species"" (Nov. 24), the extravaganza is set to continue until the end of next year. Get ready for Darwin hats, t-shirts, action figures, naturally selected fireworks and evolving chocolates. Oh, and lots of books and speeches.  But hold on. Does he deserve all this? He wasn't, after all, the first person to suggest that evolution happens. For example, his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, speculated about it towards the end of the 18th century; at the beginning of the 19th, the great French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck made a strong case for it. Lamarck, however, failed to be generally persuasive because he didn't have a plausible mechanism  he could see that evolution takes place, but he didn't know how. That had to wait until the discovery of natural selection.   Natural selection is what we normally think of as Darwin's big idea. Yet he wasn't the first to discover that, either. At least two others  a doctor called William Wells, and a writer called Patrick Matthew  discovered it years before Darwin did. Wells described it (admittedly briefly) in 1818, when Darwin was just 9; Matthew did so in 1831, the year that Darwin set off on board HMS Beagle for what became a five-year voyage around the world.   It was a few months after returning from this voyage that Darwin first began to consider seriously the possibility of evolution, or the ""transmutation of species."" At this time he knew nothing of Wells's and Matthew's accounts of natural selection; indeed, both accounts languished in obscurity until after the ""Origin"" was published. (After the ""Origin"" appeared, Matthew wrote to a magazine to draw attention to his statements on the subject; he then proceeded to put ""Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection"" on the title pages of his books. This annoyed Darwin.)  By 1858, Darwin had spent more than 20 years studying plants and animals and thinking about evolution. He had filled notebook after notebook with his thoughts on how evolution works; he had, in 1844, written a short manuscript on the subject that was to be published in the event of his untimely death; and he had discussed evolution with a few close friends. But he had published nothing. (He had, however, published books on several other subjects, including an exhaustive study of barnacles, both living and extinct.) Then, in June of that year, Darwin received a package from a young man named Alfred Russel Wallace; in the package, Wallace enclosed a brief manuscript in which he outlined the principle of evolution by natural selection.   What happened next is famous in the history of biology. On July 1, 1858, Wallace's manuscript, as well as a couple of short statements on natural selection by Darwin (a segment of the 1844 manuscript, and part of a letter he'd written in 1857), were read at a meeting of the Linnean Society in London. The meeting had been organized by some of Darwin's scientific friends to establish his priority in the discovery.  Of the material presented that night, the manuscript by Wallace is, in some respects, the more impressive: it is clearer and more accessible. Yet it is Darwin we celebrate; it is Darwin who, like a god in a temple, sits in white marble and presides over the main hall at the Natural History Museum in London. Why?  The reason is the ""Origin."" Without the publication of the ""Origin"" the following year, the meeting at the Linnean Society could well have passed unnoticed, the Darwin-Wallace statements going the same way as those by Matthew and Wells. Indeed, the meeting had so little impact at the time that, at the end of the year, the president of the Linnean Society said, ""The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear.""   This is one of my all-time favorite quotations (and I am fond of using it) because it shows how, at the time, little significance was attached to the Linnean Society meeting. We see that meeting as important now because of what happened next: it galvanized Darwin into writing and publishing the ""Origin.""  And the ""Origin"" changed everything. Before the ""Origin,"" the diversity of life could only be catalogued and described; afterwards, it could be explained and understood. Before the ""Origin,"" species were generally seen as fixed entities, the special creations of a deity; afterwards, they became connected together on a great family tree that stretches back, across billions of years, to the dawn of life. Perhaps most importantly, the ""Origin"" changed our view of ourselves. It made us as much a part of nature as hummingbirds and bumblebees (or humble-bees, as Darwin called them); we, too, acquired a family tree with a host of remarkable and distinguished ancestors.  The reason the ""Origin"" was so powerful, compelling and persuasive, the reason Darwin succeeded while his predecessors failed, is that in it he does not just describe how evolution by natural selection works. He presents an enormous body of evidence culled from every field of biology then known. He discusses subjects as diverse as pigeon breeding in Ancient Egypt, the rudimentary eyes of cave fish, the nest-building instincts of honeybees, the evolving size of gooseberries (they've been getting bigger), wingless beetles on the island of Madeira and algae in New Zealand. One moment, he's considering fossil animals like brachiopods (which had hinged shells like clams, but with a different axis of symmetry); the next, he's discussing the accessibility of nectar in clover flowers to different species of bee.   At the same time, he uses every form of evidence at his disposal: he observes, argues, compares, infers and describes the results of experiments he has read about, or in many cases, personally conducted. For example, one of Darwin's observations is that the inhabitants of islands resemble  but differ subtly from  those of the nearest continents. So: birds and bushes on islands off the coast of South America resemble South American birds and bushes; islands near Africa are populated by recognizably African forms.  He argues that the reason for this is that new islands become colonized by beings from the nearest continents, and that the new inhabitants then begin evolving independently. He then asks: can animals and plants from the continents get to new islands, especially those that are far out at sea? To investigate this, he conducts experiments to see how long seeds from different plants can remain immersed in saltwater and still begin to grow. In short, he tests his reasoning over and over again.  He is also, in some respects, surprisingly far-seeing. The ""Origin"" does not just expound natural selection. It contains a wealth of additional ideas and hypotheses, some of which Darwin went on to elaborate in other books. Among them: sexual selection. This is the idea  and it remained controversial until recently  that males in many species are burdened with showy ornaments like enormous tails because the females of their species have, by repeatedly picking the showiest males as their mates, caused them to evolve them that way.  This is not to say that the ""Origin"" is flawless, or that Darwin was right in every respect. It isn't, and he wasn't. Nor is the book a definitive account of how evolution works. It wasn't even definitive in his lifetime: he published six editions, revising, sometimes heavily, from one to the next. (In the third edition, which appeared in 1861, he introduced a historical sketch in which he discusses his precursors, including Matthew and Wells.) Yet his knowledge of the natural world is so immense, and the scrutiny to which he subjects his ideas is so thorough and scrupulous, that the ""Origin"" presents a grand new vision of the world. A vision that, as far as possible given the knowledge available at the time, he worked out in every detail. A vision that changed the world forever.  Let's party!  **********  NOTES:  The historical events described here can be found in any biography of Darwin; I drew on Janet Browne's -- Knopf, in two volumes, ""Voyaging"" (1995) and ""The Power of Place"" (2002). The anecdote of Matthew annoying Darwin can be found on page 109 of ""The Power of Place""; the quotation from the president of the Linnean Society can be found on page 42 of the same volume.

Father!'""  William Faulkner, ""Barn Burning""  I could not attend my 25th high school reunion in New York this spring. It was the night of my daughter Julia's 11th birthday party. But, this month, there came a consolation prize: an alumnae event in Washington D.C., featuring a William Faulkner class taught by one of my all-time favorite English teachers.  The event brought together a couple dozen women ranging from their early 20's to ages that made it impolite to dwell too long on the graduation years marked on their name tags. We gathered in the living room of a beautiful house in Georgetown while a waiter circulated serving drinks and canaps.  We all came in clutching copies of Faulkner's 1939 short story ""Barn Burning,"" scanned copies of which had been e-mailed to us in advance, and as the room filled up, I was gratified to see that I wasn't the only one to have gone at the story with a busy pen, highlighting, bracketing, scribbling in the margins. Someone else's notes, semi-legible (was it cheating to have read them?) were visible all around the sides. The words ""objective correlative"" appeared right above the first line. They'd given me an unexpected shiver of pleasure.   We were provided with pencils, embossed with the name of our old school. There were blue exam books, too, the contemporary version of the smaller blue booklets into which we'd once poured our ambition and drive. It was a self-parodic touch. It made us laugh.   ""Sherwood Anderson told him, 'write what you know.' So Faulkner went back to Oxford, Mississippi.""  Mrs. Sagor, our teacher, gray-haired now and more delicate-looking around the eyes, was otherwise exactly as I remembered her from 25 years earlier when, I realized with a shock, she'd probably been about the age I am now. She had the same ebullient energy as before, the same sense of urgency, the same way of dropping her notes as the excitement within her rose, the same ability to draw all of us in the room into the shared conviction that what we were doing in that moment  analyzing the actions of 10-year-old Sarty, the sharecropper's son who betrays his tyrannical, hate-filled, arsonist father in order to escape the crush of his family's poverty and exclusion  was the most vitally important task we could ever encounter in all our lives.  And, as I looked around the room, at these women raising their hands, with their serious looks and reading glasses, I thought: Please, let me stay here forever.  I find, these days, as I wend my way through my early 40's, that I spend a lot of time mulling over some middle-aged version of the question of what I want to be when I grow up. Only it's really not so much about ""what"" as it is about ""who""; late in life, I've come to some realizations about Making Choices and the impossibility of Having it All.   These realizations don't turn around the usual poles of work and family, but rather, embarrassingly, around a series of much greater banalities: the impossibility of having pedicures at the same time that you're meeting deadlines, of wearing unstained clothes when you haven't the time or the inclination to buy a full-length mirror, the basic fact that sustaining a thought and applying a full face of makeup  without, say, forgetting one eye  are mutually exclusive. At least for me. With middle age, these things have become much more important than they ought to be.   That these extremely basic, excruciatingly obvious truths took nearly 43 years to lodge in my head may or may not be linked to the fact that, at some point along the way, something happened to turn me into the kind of a person for whom the words ""objective correlative"" could send a thrill of pleasure down the spine.  ""Faulkner's favorite subject,"" Mrs. Sagor said, was "" 'the human heart in conflict with itself.' ""   ""Hit's big as a courthouse,"" Sarty thought, contemplating the landowner's stately mansion ""with a surge of peace and joy whose reason he could not have thought into words, being too young for that.""  I went through high school thinking they went together  exquisite real estate and exquisite literature. Not because they did for me  I grew up in a tiny, rent-controlled apartment in a building that had seen better days  but because they seemed to for my teachers and classmates. Some day, I thought, without actually thinking it, taking the bus every day to the Upper East Side, it would all be mine  the books and the pre-war built-ins, the floral upholstery and ""the spell of this peace and dignity,"" to borrow words, once again, from Sarty.  Why did I think this (without the actual words, being too young for that)? Because I was in Mrs. Sagor's class, and that made me special. She actually said it once: we were ""the crme de la crme."" There was a girl named Jane in my class who never earned a grade under a 96  from what I could see, spying over her shoulder. I was not as smart as that. But I could discern, right down to the very core of my being, the many layers of meaning contained in things like the sound of the sharecropper's foot, dipped in horse droppings, ""as it came down on the boards with clocklike finality, a sound out of all proportion to the displacement of the body it bore.""  I could inch my grades up from the low 90's to a solid 95. And so, all was due to me.    ""What are you going to do with your life?"" my cousins, a New Jersey dentist and his wife, asked me soon after college.   ""Read and write,"" I answered, with no small degree of smugness.  They laughed. ""How are you going to live on that?""  We were all just one generation removed from the Lower East Side.   My father always thought of himself as lower-middle-class, a child of the Depression  he'd been a City College student then, actually  long after the Depression was over and his circumstances had changed. We were not wealthy; my father drove an old car (proudly, defiantly, thumbing his nose at ""planned obsolescence""), but we were not, by any reasonable measure, lower-middle-class. My father, by the 1980s, had not been lower-middle-class for almost a half-century. True, he'd told my mother that the food he'd had in the army in World War II was the best he'd ever tasted in the early decades of his life. But he'd earned a Ph.D in 1948. From the University of Chicago. Since 1961, he'd spent his days writing and seeing patients in an office on Gramercy Park, entering every day through a lobby that smelled like roses.  He paid for me to have the privilege of sitting in a classroom by the East River, watching the ice float by in the winter while Mrs. Sagor taught excitedly of objective correlatives and pathetic fallacies and Gerard Manley Hopkins (""Manley Hopkins!"" we would shriek behind her back, being 16) and W.H. Auden.  "" 'The past is never dead. It's not even past,' "" she quoted Faulkner, that night in Georgetown.  ""I remember every word you ever taught me,"" I told her. I had counted the weeks, the minutes  or was it the decades?  until I would have the chance to say it.  ""Yes, we still make the girls memorize poetry,"" she said.   But that wasn't, of course, what I meant.  I would have liked, that night in Georgetown, to have added my voice to the discussion about Sarty and his father, Abner Snopes. I would have liked to have said that Sarty's betrayal wasn't just conveyed by his actions; it was contained in his voice, in the slippage of speech from ""Pap"" to ""Father,"" from the unschooled language of home to the traitorous language of distant, educated adulthood, where the ""lettering which meant nothing to his mind"" had sorted itself into lyricism and loss.  ""He did not look back,"" Faulkner wrote.  But I did not raise my hand. I tried to do it  Mrs. Sagor's eyes rested, for a moment, expectantly upon me  but I could not get the piece of arm above my elbow to rise.  I have been hit, in recent years, with freakish, episodic, bouts of shyness that literally leave me struck dumb.  That would not have been acceptable in high school. We were taught that, when we got out in the ""real world"" with the boys, we'd have to raise our voices. We were taught to speak strongly  no girly curleycues of doubt making the end of declarative sentences turn up into questions. (""Are you asking me or telling me?"") No Valley Girl ""likes"" or ""you know's."" (""Like what?"" ""No, I don't know."")  There was a voice I heard at the school. In the ladies of the Administration it was a kind of a lockjaw (my friend Juliet, her hair magenta, dried chicken bones in her ears, mocked it mercilessly), but in the girls it was modernized, less an accent than a series of accents on punched-up syllables, so that sentences came out syncopated with self-confidence.   If you were smart, and you wanted to be liked out in the Real World, you learned to temper your voice with a veneer of more pleasing self-doubt.  ""Modulate your voice,"" my father told me. ""A man doesn't want an intellectual sparring partner,"" he warned. ""He wants comforts.""  I'd learned to speak  to emit opinions and to argue them  at the dinner table. Night after night, starting in my late childhood, it was me and my father locked in combat, fighting for the definition of my world.  ""At least they're talking to each other,"" my mother would tell her friends.   My father's doctoral thesis was on the color preferences of psychiatric groups. Womanly women, he found, liked colors like pink. Manly men liked colors like brown. In my office now, I have his copies of the ""Collected Works of Sigmund Freud"" and ""Feminine Psychology"" by Karen Horney and the Old Testament, all heavily annotated, even the Bible underlined and bracketed, the very Word reworked by his own sense of significance.  He was horrified by the 1960's. (""I'm not a square; I'm a cube,"" he said, circa 1970). His horror hardened in the 1970s and 80s, grew seasoned by bitterness in a world that increasingly rejected his most basic ideas, and by the 1990's, he'd largely retreated into a private, secret world of anger and fear. Most awful to him was that ""hateful, horrible women's lib"" I'd picked up in that girls' school.  Part of him was proud of me. Another part told me that I didn't belong there. But this was the one place in my life where I ever felt that I truly belonged.  There are times when the simple act of growing up requires a betrayal. Sarty knew it; I lived it. When you have a parent both adored and maddening, their madness encases you, defines and delimits you. When you cut the umbilical cord, opening your mouth to find your voice, you find that you are out in the cold.   What safety there had been in those blue pages, I remembered, running my fingers down the cover of an examination book that I was taking home as a souvenir.   It has been with me, in my bag, amidst the checkbook and the crayons, the forgotten school notices and 10 types of headache medication, ever since. ",2008-06-20T01:01:50+0000

A 17th-century painting titled Rembrandt Laughing, below, sold by the British auction house Moore Allen & Innocent in October for $4.5 million, has been confirmed by art experts as an authentic Rembrandt self-portrait worth $30 million to $40 million, The Associated Press reported. The anonymous British buyer, thought to be John Morton Morris of the London dealers Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox, appears to have received quite a bargain despite paying roughly 1,500 times more than the auction houses estimate of $3,100 for what it thought was a work by a Rembrandt student or imitator. Ernst van de Wetering, who leads the Rembrandt Research Project, wrote a 23-page analysis attributing the work to Rembrandt, and he said the low valuation might have been based on photographs that did not convey the paintings quality. The self-portrait, which had belonged to an English family for more than 100 years, will hang in the Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam through June 29, on loan from the buyer.",2008-06-20T04:00:00+0000

The shootout followed a chase along the freeway, also known as California Route 91, around midnight after police officers spotted the car of a 40-year-old man wanted after he fled the scene of a shooting of a police officer at an Anaheim hotel on Sunday morning. Sgt. Rick Martinez said two officers had responded to a call about a man exposing himself to guests from the window of his room at a Best Western hotel about a mile from Disneyland. When the officers arrived, the man, who was not identified, was getting into a car. Shots were fired, and one officer was shot in the thigh. The suspect was next seen driving on the freeway about midnight Sunday. While chased by the police, he crashed and ran from his car, Sergeant Martinez said, then exchanged shots with officers and was killed. A woman who was in a nearby car was wounded in the elbow and lower abdomen, the officer said; she was expected to be released from a hospital. EDWARD WYATT",2008-06-24T04:00:00+0000

The demonstrations led Mr. Lee, who took office in late February, to ask Washington to revise the original agreement on beef. In a new accord unveiled on Saturday, the United States agreed to export beef only from cattle younger than 30 months, to allay South Koreans fears of mad cow disease. Protest organizers vowed to keep rallying until Mr. Lee agreed to a complete renegotiation of the pact. ",2008-06-25T04:00:00+0000

us,The Petro-Manipulators,"Anyone who lived on the West Coast during the phony energy crisis of 2000 and 2001 cannot help thinking of Texas and two of its worst products  Enron and a politician not named George Bush  as gas creeps up toward $5 a gallon this summer.   What happened during the great energy heist at the start of the new century was like an extended bad dream, part ""Twilight Zone"" and part ""Chinatown,"" the extraordinary 1974 film about water manipulation and long-buried secrets.   The price of energy spiked  tenfold, a hundredfold  despite low demand. Californians became the most efficient users of power in the nation, and still suffered through dozens of rolling blackouts. None of it added up.   And into the worst energy crisis since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 came Vice President Dick Cheney, blasting conservation as a sissy virtue and saying the nation needed to build a new power plant every week for the next 20 years.   The administration's neglect was breathtaking, a harbinger of what was to come when a natural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, would do to Louisiana what a man-made disaster had done to California. We now know, of course, that the problem eight years ago was caused by manipulation by Enron and other speculators who gamed a faulty system, sticking it to Grandma Millie while laughing at how easy it was to rob 40 million people.   Now consider the present dilemma: oil doubling over the last year, gas at $4.50 a gallon in places and the oversized influence of speculators in a market where few used to tread. Big investors are free to run up oil futures contracts thanks in part to former Senator Phil Gramm. He is the Texas Republican who co-sponsored the so-called Enron loophole in 2000 at the behest of what was later found to be one of the nation's biggest criminal enterprises.   Enron may be gone, but its legacy lingers in the work done by politicians who did its bidding. And Gramm, who once told corporate contributors, ""I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics, and that's ready money,"" is now the chief economic adviser to Senator John McCain.   Gramm's role in helping to unleash energy speculators has been well-documented in recent months, and Senator Barack Obama has made an issue of it. Both Obama and McCain have called for closing the loophole. But just how big a role that kind of global gambling plays in the overheated commodities market is only now coming to light.   Testifying before the Senate on Wednesday, the ever-knowledgeable Daniel Yergin blamed speculation for part of the run-up. Yergin, an author and the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, pointed to numerous other causes, as have other experts.  But he also noted that 2007 may have been the peak year for oil demand in the United States. In other words, the world's largest energy consumer has reached the height of its gluttony, and will be using less oil from here on out.   Keep that in mind when thinking of the parallel to California. Less demand from the biggest consumer, yet record high prices. Why? Yes, tight supply during the end stages of the 200-year reign of fossil fuels, higher use by China and India, and global troubles all contribute to the bloat of oil prices.   But market manipulation seems obvious.  Over the last five years, investment in index funds tied to commodities like energy and food has gone from $13 billion to $260 billion. At the same time, the prices of those commodities have risen 200 percent.   Take away the excess speculators who are in the market purely for the ride, and oil prices could drop by half. That's the view of Michael W. Masters, a hedge fund manager who's been advising Congress this year.   ""There are no lines at the gas pumps and there is plenty of food on the shelves,"" said Masters, whose testimony has been widely discussed in financial circles but rarely in the political realm. What has changed, he said, is the presence of big speculators making futures bets.  ""If Wall Street concocted a scheme whereby investors bought large amounts of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices in order to profit from the resulting increase in price, making these essential items unaffordable to sick and dying people, society would be justly outraged,"" he said.   This testimony came before a committee chaired by Senator Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential candidate who is now one of John McCain's biggest boosters. If you want to see the effects of McCain's top financial adviser, look no further than the hearing run by McCain's top ally in the Senate.   With five months to go, it looks like energy will dominate the presidential campaign. Nutty ideas will abound, from the gas tax holiday to $300 million prizes for wonder batteries.   And just as in California eight years ago, the oil industry's most devoted politicians will use this troubled time to advance a tired agenda  more drilling for the last of the nation's oil, in distant, fragile corners of the earth.   If nothing else, we should remember the lesson from that debacle: When something smells this bad, look for rotten fish as well. ",2008-06-25T22:43:51+0000

us,Q&A: Scalia's Gauntlet,"The Supreme Court's decision today declaring the District of Columbia's ban on handguns unconstitutional is producing a wave of reaction. The New York Times has asked several lawyers and legal historians to comment on specific aspects of the case.   Steve Wermiel is adjunct professor and associate director of the Marshall-Brennan Constitutional Literacy Project at the American University Washington College of Law.     Q. In Slate, Dahlia Lithwick refers to what she called your ""rather brilliant observation"" asking why none of the dissenters in today's decision cautioned the majority that it ""will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed."" Can you explain more?    A. Use of that phrase is partly serious and partly flip. Justice Scalia used those words (hence the quotation marks) in a very strident dissent on June 12 when the Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo Bay detainees have a right to go to federal court to challenge their detentions. My initial point is that it seems appropriate for the justices Scalia was criticizing in the detainees' case to throw that line back at him when he has written a decision that will facilitate the possession of handguns by individuals.  Answering on a more serious (perhaps less flip) level, whether it is individuals shooting others in self-defense or those committing crimes having easier access to weapons, it does seem likely that more people may be killed using handguns as a result of the newly declared Second Amendment right. At the very least, it seems more likely that people will die from the constitutional right to own firearms than from the constitutional right of an enemy terrorist to challenge his detention in federal court.

us,Q&A: The Ratifiers and the Second Amendment,"The Supreme Court's decision today declaring the District of Columbia's ban on handguns unconstitutional is producing a wave of reaction. The New York Times has asked several lawyers and legal historians to comment on specific aspects of the case.   Brian Frye, a lawyer in New York, is the author of ""The Peculiar Story of United States vs. Miller,"" an article published in the New York University Journal of Law & Liberty, Vol. 2, 2007.  Q. What was your reaction to today's Court decision, based on what you know about the history of the Second Amendment?   A. I am not an authority on the ratification and early history of the Second Amendment, so I will refrain from commenting on the Court's opinion and dissents in that respect. That said, it does seem that the Court's opinion overemphasizes the role that personal self-defense played in ratification. It is probably true that a common-law right to own weapons for self-defense existed at ratification.   But the prefatory clause suggests that the need for collective self-defense through the militia, rather than individual self-defense, prompted ratification of the Second Amendment. Of course, it appears that the ratifiers assumed that the Constitution guarantees common-law rights as well as specifically enumerated rights. So while they may not have understood the Second Amendment right to directly guarantee the right to own weapons for self-defense, they would have understood it as consistent with that right.   Q. How do you see today's decision in the context of the last big Second Amendment case before the court, in the 1939 Miller decision, which more or less allowed states and localities to adopt gun control measures?  A. The Court affirms the D.C. Circuit's holding that the Second Amendment, under Miller, guarantees a right to own weapons ""in common use at the time,"" which now includes handguns. I would suggest that the Miller holding is more closely tied to militia service. I suspect that a slightly more accurate characterization would be that Miller held the Second Amendment guarantees a right to own a weapon suitable for militia service, in order to ensure that members of the unorganized militia are familiar with the use of such weapons and possess then in the event militia service becomes necessary. I'm not really qualified to say what sort of  weapons are suitable for militia service, but it is certainly conceivable that long guns are suitable and handguns are not.  Q. Why do you think it has taken the Court so long -- the last decision was almost 70 years ago -- to rule on a Second Amendment case?  A. I suspect that the Court has taken a long time to hear a Second Amendment case because the constitutional validity of gun control laws was a controversial question lacking a burning need for resolution. Miller provided a workable resolution, effectively  permitting state and local gun control based on state and local preferences. Gun owners are politically powerful. Accordingly, they are rarely the target of unreasonable regulations. Perhaps the District of Columbia regulation was sufficiently unreasonable that the Court felt obliged to step in.

us,Q&A: Jack Rakove on Heller and History,"The Supreme Court's decision today declaring the District of Columbia's ban on handguns unconstitutional is producing a wave of reaction. The New York Times has asked several lawyers and legal historians to comment on specific aspects of the case.   Jack N. Rakove, a professor of history, American studies and political science at Stanford University, won a Pulitzer prize for ""Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution."" He was the lead author of a historians' amicus brief written in support of the District of Columbia's position.   Q. In reading the Heller decision today, what leaps out at you?   A. The two main opinions differ enormously in how they think about which elements of history help most in understanding the original meaning of the Second Amendment. Justice Scalia's opinion has remarkably little to say about the drafting of the Amendment or the constitutional debates of 1787-1789. By contrast, Justice Stevens' dissent focuses tightly on the immediate context within which the value of ""a well-regulated militia"" and ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" were actually discussed.   Scalia replies that ""It is dubious to rely on such history to interpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre-existing right, rather than to fashion a new one."" Scalia similarly claims that ""most [Americans] thought"" the right was ""even more important for self-defense and hunting"" than it was as an antidote to the danger of a standing army. Scalia's history depends on a deep background understanding of the right that presumes its content and purpose were only slightly affected by the events of the Revolution or the distinct way in which the Militia Clauses of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution became controversial during the ratification debates of 1787-1788.   Stevens's history, by contrast, says that the true (and really the only) subject under active debate when the Amendment was framed was the militia. The legal rights of individual Americans to own and use firearms remained a matter of state and local regulation, it suggests, and no one at the time understood that the adoption of the Amendment would modify their authority in any way.    Scalia's historical basis for asserting that his interpretation was the one that was ""widely understood"" at the time remains unclear. The best-known statement of an avowedly individual right to own and use firearms came in a document issued by the minority Anti-Federalist delegates to the Pennsylvania ratification convention. Their ""Dissent"" was issued early in the ratification campaign, and could have become a rallying point for the Constitution's critics. Instead the ""Dissent"" quickly became an object of Federalist ridicule precisely because its idea of protecting a right to ""hunt and fowl"" seemed too trivial to merit constitutional recognition. Thereafter the discussion of the right to keep and bear arms was concerned almost exclusively with the militia, which is why I continue to find Scalia's argument historically deficient  Q. How sweeping is the ruling?   A. As an endorsement of the ""individual right"" view of the Amendment, the decision is about as sweeping as it could be. Never one for understatement when it comes to castigating his fellow Justices, Scalia minces no words in endorsing an unequivocal interpretation of the essentially private activities the Amendment was meant to protect.   But because today's ruling is so open-ended, even vague when it comes to laying down the appropriate standards for regulation, it will be years before the impact of the decision will be known. By then, the composition of the Court will have changed, and a Court that could toss aside the 1939 precedent of the Miller case so casually might follow suit with Heller as well.  Q. Why has it taken so long for the Court to take up a Second Amendment case?  A. Controversy over the meaning of the Second Amendment is a relatively modern phenomenon. It took the transformation of the National Rifle Association from an organization primarily concerned with promoting the safe and skillful use of guns into an active advocacy group bent on opposing all forms of firearm regulation to give the Second Amendment any salience in constitutional debate.   At that point, it became something of a touchstone issue for conservative legal activists and some federal judges with impeccable right-wing credentials, like Laurence Silberman of the D.C. Circuit. A handful of cases and opinions endorsing the individual right interpretation and challenging the conventional view of the Miller case created enough dissonance within the federal judiciary to make it possible for the Supreme Court to take on the issue.   But of course, the fact that today's opinion took the predictable 5-4 form of so many other issues of recent years could not possibly mean that the political preferences of the Justices had anything to do with the outcome.

us,Of Mice and Women,"I spent last week at M.I.T.  You don't know me well enough to know how funny that statement is.  I am someone, you see, who dropped science after 9th grade. Who dropped math after 10th. Who studied an accumulated 18 years of foreign languages, but has never set foot in a lab.  So it was an education. To put it mildly. But, predictably enough, I probably didn't get out of my week-long science course precisely what I was supposed to be taking in.  I was attending a journalism workshop called ""Frontiers of Brain Science."" The other participants were all real science writers, people who don't have to rack their brains to remember the meaning of the word ""ion.""  I was there because I thought that, given the fact that I am writing a book on children's mental health issues (yes, I know I promised never to bring that up again), I ought to know a little more about the brain.  What I hadn't realized is that ""brain science"" is far from synonymous with psychiatry. Locating, identifying, computationally modeling ""qualia""  what we might call subjective experience  remains to this day the elusive final frontier of neuroscience.  (Though it can be done: one of the most fascinating things I learned, last week, is that you can actually see, via a visual representation of the electrical activity of a rat's brain, what it is ""thinking."" You can recognize a recurrent pattern of mental activity  what it looks like in the rat's brain when the rat is running through a maze and what it looks like when the creature is thinking over the sequence afterward, as rats apparently do. ""These animals are three- to six-months-old and their experiences are only what we've given them,"" Matt Wilson, a professor in M.I.T.'s department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, told us. In other words, scientists can read rats' minds because they know what they put in them.)   At M.I.T., I learned a great deal about neurons, dendrites, action potentials, the localization of function, visual perception and transcranial magnetic stimulation.   I learned that you can make a mouse ""depressed"" by dunking it repeatedly in cold water, by giving it electrical shocks over and over again, by subjecting it to ""chronic forced swimming,"" or making it experience ""social defeat,"" by putting a mean mouse in its cage. The latter method is the best way to test antidepressants, because after such a negative social experience it takes a mouse three weeks of drug therapy to recover, an interval that neatly parallels the amount of time antidepressants take to reach their optimal effectiveness in humans.   But let's move on.  I also learned a great many things about my own brain at M.I.T.   I learned that I can take copious notes without understanding a word.   I learned that I can take copious notes while falling asleep.  I learned that I can jerk myself out of sleep by attempting to translate my notes into French. (If you don't know a word, just add an ""e"" at the end.)  I learned that I can take copious notes on paper while writing utterly unrelated notes on the inside of my hand.  And I learned that, no matter where I go, no matter what I learn or try to do, my mind always runs along the same old grooves, much like a rat that has been trained, all its pitiable life, to run one eternal maze. And that all the thoughts in my own one-track rat-trap of a mind lead back to  Hillary Clinton.  Here's how:  At M.I.T., we were mostly spoken to by men, various kinds of men, of different ages and with different speaking styles, and we interacted with them with typical reportorial formality. Some were more popular with us than others; some were more engaged with us than others. Some spoke right over our heads; some reached even me with perfect clarity.  Something very different happened, however, on the two occasions when we were spoken to by women. The atmosphere in the room changed. We all became more familiar. We asked more questions. We interrupted more. We made sounds of assent or dissent; we questioned methods, concepts, base assumptions. It was as though, with the women, the boundaries dissolved. We were all immediately drawn into relationships.  How much of this had to do with the fact that the women tended to speak more relationally (""I think,"" ""I feel""), I don't know. I don't know if it was created by the fact that the women  to varying degrees  turned the story of their work into personal narratives.  I know that there was no conscious desire on anyone's part to talk back to them or treat them with less respect. But one woman in particular, Rebecca Saxe, a young, dynamic professor of neurobiology at M.I.T. who gave a riveting presentation on social cognition  ""how we reason about the desires and intentions that motivate others' actions""  was interrupted so much by her super-engaged audience that she didn't have time to get through essential portions of her talk.   I did not ask questions of this amazing young woman. I was struck, once again, with one of my crippling bouts of shyness, and besides that, I was too busy writing down her every word and wondering why on earth I had never taken science and whether my daughters might attend M.I.T.   Maybe I could send them to do summer study, I thought. (Once they'd both learned their multiplication tables, of course.) Maybe I should sport little wire glasses and wear my hair in a long braid. Or buy Birkenstocks.  ""What did you think?"" I breathed to a fellow female fellow, as we filed out of the classroom for lunch.   ""I have a crush on her,"" she said. The women around us made approving noises.  ""It was her passion and energy and approach that was infectious,"" she later explained in an e-mail. ""I really had an emotional reaction to her, and found myself day dreaming about being her friend.""  What is this thing we so often do, when confronted with an impressive woman? Why do they, in particular, set off such a Pavlovian rush of emotion? Why, for women in particular, do they set off this me/not me engagement, this game of my friend/not my friend, this eternal, sometimes infernal play of positive or negative mirroring?  Men do a version of this with women, too  though I think it plays out more in terms of validates me/doesn't validate me, which may amount, in slightly altered form, to much the same thing. I don't see them doing it with other men. I don't hear of men getting ""crushes"" on other men because they're impressed with them. They don't seem to get so flooded with the desire to be them, to try on their skins; they don't appear to be constantly testing their identities against another man's example, calling into question, at the drop of a hat, their clothing style or hair or general sense of being in the world.  My husband, Max, has no interest in spectator sports. But he can survive office conversations about the Washington Redskins without feeling that his very selfhood as a man has been called into question. The fact that Barack Obama is barely seeing his children this year is not setting off a cultural conversation on modern working fatherhood. I don't think that any man, in the Clinton years, felt personally implicated, defined or not-defined as husbands and fathers, by Bill's intimate affairs.   Which brings me back to Hillary.  I have long been convinced that the heart of the endless cultural brouhaha about Hillary turns around this me/not me business, the fact that her face, her life, her choices, her style have had, for some reason, to serve as a funhouse mirror for millions of American women (and men).  One of the biggest criticisms of her in the race for the Democratic nomination was that she entered it as a wife-of; and, like Geraldine Ferraro before her, that ""of-ness"" proved toxic.

Fully clothed among them stood some relics of Olympics past: Scott Goldblatt, who won a gold medal in the 2004 Games, wore an aqua sport coat and a striped tie and was doing on-air commentary for Swimnetwork.com; Mel Stewart, who won two golds and a bronze in 1992, wore the same goofy get-up, working as Goldblatts sidekick. Meanwhile, Dara Torres, who won the first of her nine Olympic medals in 1984, a year before Michael Phelps was born, stripped off her baggy T-shirt and sweat pants, revealing a breathtaking body in a magenta Speedo. She pulled on a cap marked with her initials and prepared to swim. Torres is now 41 and the mother of a 2-year-old daughter, Tessa Grace. She broke her first of three world records in 1982, at 14, and she has retired from swimming and come back three times, her latest effort built on an obsessive attention to her aging body.

In areas where fewer than two generations ago the I.B.D. incidence might have been as low as 1 in 10,000, it was now 1 in 250. A defective gene couldnt spread that quickly, he reasoned. It had to be something in the environment. But what? Stumped, Weinstock tried turning the question around.

And there were no locals in sight either. The town has housing enough to support a population of 3,000, but fewer than 1,600 live here, and every year the number drops. Rocco Falivena, Lavianos 56-year-old mayor, strolled down the middle of the street, outlining for me the towns demographics and explaining why, although the place is more than a thousand years old, its buildings all look so new. In 1980 an earthquake struck, taking out nearly every structure and killing 300 people, including Falivenas own parents. Then from tragedy arose the scent of possibility, of a future. Money came from the national government in Rome, and from former residents who had emigrated to the U.S. and elsewhere. The locals found jobs rebuilding their town.

I asked Giambi about those possibilities for Sundays Times and he used words like cool and awesome to describe how he would feel if he was selected.As Giambis average deteriorated, he said that Long had told him to stop worrying about statistics.

He would be like, Awesome, three out of four at-bats, a line drive or a hard-hit ball. Thats how we were breaking it down. He was like: Look at it, youre doing great. I know the numbers dont show it, but you are. He told me to just keep doing the same things and Id start to get out of this.Long was right.
