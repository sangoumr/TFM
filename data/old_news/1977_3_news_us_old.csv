One guesses that the editors of Playboy Press or somebody exerted their influence on Bruce and Benenson to insert chunks of tired pornprose into their literary endeavor, in order to appeal to a typical strokebook readership.

us,Fassbinder Hits the Mark Again In a Pessimistic 'Mother Kusters',"Mrs. Kusters is one of those people strangers take to be prototypical, though secretly she's far from ordinary. She simply appears to be. She's short, stocky, middle-aged, soft-spoken, nave and inclined to be optimistic as she presents the world with a face that looks as if it had been shaped in modeling clay that fell to the floor before the features had been firmly set. People she doesn't know call her Mother Kusters and assume that she is Everywoman, which she isn't.Mrs. Kusters is the sort of exception to the rule about the common person that was the inspiration of so much left-wing literature of the Depression about worms that turned, about little guys who fought heroically (and often futilely) back.In the indomitable presence of Brigitte Mira, the German actress, she's also an essentially comic, idiosyncratic life-saving force that separates Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Mrs. Kusters Goes to Heaven"" from most other agit-prop drama that you've ever seen.If you weren't already aware that Mr. Fassbinder, the 31-year-old German director (""Ali,"" ""Fox and His Friends,"" ""The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,"" etc.), refuses to make movies that are like anyone else,'s, you have a far from solemn obligation to go to the New Yorker Theater where ""Mother Kusters"" opened yesterday. This fine film, which is being given its New York premiere, is the initial attraction in the first reasonably complete Fassbinder retrospective we've ever had here.In addition to revivals of six Fassbinder films already seen in New York, the retrospective will include six Fassbinder works, dating from 1969 through 1976, that have never before been given theatrical showings locally. They are not all equally successful. They include a couple of films that look like clever doodling, but they also include one, ""Effie Briest,"" that is as beautiful as anything that Mr. Fassbinder has done. Taken together, they constitute the most remarkable, original group of films made by a single director anywhere in recent years.""Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven"" is Mr. Fassbinder's contemporary variation on a 1929 German film, ""Mother Krause's Journey to Happiness,"" directed by Piel Jutzi, which, as far as I can tell, was never released in this country. The screenplay of that film, which some sources (incorrectly, it seems) have attributed to Brecht, was set in the Berlin slums, and the title referred to Mrs. Krause's suicide after her daughter had been seduced and her son arrested for theft.Mr. Fassbinder's pessimism is far more complex. ""Mother Kusters,"" which Mr. Fassbinder wrote with Kurt Raab, who often acts in Fassbinder films and is sometimes their art director, is a furious morality tale that's been slightly bent. Set in contemporary West Germany, it's about Mrs. Kusters, a working-class housewife, who answers the door one evening to be told that her husband, Herman, has, that afternoon, run amok at his factory, murdered the boss's son and then committed suicide. Why would old Herman do such a thing?Mrs. Kusters can't imagine. ""He never complained,"" she says. ""We just lived our life day by day. He was too good for this world."" Her daughter-in-law (Irm Hermann), who's preoccupied with her pregnancy and a promised vacation in Finland, says, ""Sometimes he looked tired, but all he ever said was, 'We're not getting any younger.'""When it's learned that old Herman had been told he was going to be discharged, an extremely chic, elegant Communist couple (Karlheinz Bohm and Margit Carstensen) swoop down on Mrs. Kusters. They persuade her that Herman's act was revolutionary, ""in a way,"" and proceed to use her in an election campaign.All Mrs. Kusters wants is that her husband's name be cleared of smears that appeared in the tabloid press. She puts her faith first in the Communist Party, because she likes the friendliness of the meetings, and when the Communists don't help, she joins an anarchist whose ""party"" consists of himself and his girlfriend. They, too, fail the widow, which leads to an ending that some people interpret as Mr. Fassbinder in a gentle mood, though the way I read it, it's far more bleak than sentimental.As a social critic, Mr. Fassbinder is skeptical of all prefabricated solutions. His sympathies are with the left, but he doubts everything except the will to survive. All other impulses, he seems to be saying, can be co-opted and exploited by the Establishment.""Mother Kusters"" is a witty, spare, beautifully performed political comedy that, according to an early synopsis I have, was supposed to end with Mrs. Kusters being gunned down by the police. Nothing so wild happenswhich makes me wonder about the system of checks and balances that is at work within the artist. The original ending of his ""Ali"" also was to be a murder instead of the reconciliation that now ends the movie.It's not, I think, that Mr. Fassbinder has gone soft but, rather, that he sees a gradual, peaceful accommodation to outrageous circumstances as the worst surrender of all.",1977-03-07T05:00:00+0000

For those slender emerald spears, lightly tipped with violet, bring with them green and easy taste of springtime. In these days when availability often seems to be prized for its own sake, asparagus of sorts are with us the year round. But to true buffs, these imports are tougher, less flavorful, less joyous in the pleasures they afford. Nor are canned or frozen impostors considered satisfactory substitutes by those who value the verdant spring freshness of the originals. Better by far to eat asparagus several times a week, if not every day, while they are in season, enjoying them in myriads of ways, and then to forget them until next year's crops come to market, as it does between late February and early March. Beloved by the ancient Greeks who named this vegetable aspharagos, and by the Romans, who dried them so they could have them throughout winter, asparagus come in for a variety of delectable treatments in countries around the world. Europeans, for the most part, prefer white asparagus, achieved by growing the stalks under mounds of earth so the sun does not strike them to produce chlorophyll.

us,'Islands in the Stream' Meanders Out of Control,"As played with fine, disciplined intensity by George C. Scott in ""Islands in the Stream,"" the film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's posthumously published novel, Thomas Hudson is a perfectly realized late-Hemingway hero; that is, he's an idealized projection of the way Hemingway wanted to see himself. Hudson is strong, wise, secure, and though he is aware of lossesthose that could have been prevented and those that were inevitablehe is not thrown by them.The time of the film, which was written by Denne Bart Petitclerc and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, is the summer of 1940, shortly before the United States entered the war. Thomas Hudson, a successful sculptor, twice married, twice divorced, lives in comfortable isolation on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. He has reached a carefully maintained accord with himself  which means working well, eating and drinking well, fishing well, having friends who are good company but who don't interfere with his emotional machinery.This particular summer begins edgily with the arrival on the island of the sons he hasn't seen in four yearsTom, 19 years old: David, 14, and Andrew, 10. They descend on him as ciphers except for their associations to lives and women he has abandoned or who abandoned him. The summer, though, becomes something quite splendid.The boys fish and swim and fight, and come to appreciate themselves as well as their father, whose satisfaction in them contains a kind of terrible radiance. He gets to know and love them, but now they represent a loss that is not so easily dealt with.This is more or less the first half of ""Islands in the Stream,"" which opened yesterday at the Coronet Theater. It's a film that begins so well, with so much genuine feeling that, as it goes on, sort of petering out, one starts wishing one could control it. Two-thirds of the way through, the wish is desperate. It is like sitting in the back seat of a car that is going gently, but unmistakably, out of control. At the end, after you've run into the tree, you aren't hurt, only very impatient.Mr. Petitclerc, a journalist and novelist who apparently has had the blessing of Hemingway's widow, Mary, in adapting the novel, has been understandably free in his work, though neither he nor Mr. Schaffner has used his freedom very interestingly. The novel, which I like and which contains some of Hemingway's most moving and funniest work, is awkward screen material, but in their changes the writer and the director have simply exchanged one sort of awkwardness for another.They haven't tightened a sprawling novel to fit the screen, they've let it sprawl in other directions, with very little grace and no feeling. ""Islands in the Stream"" is a movie in which a climactic death scene has less emotional impact than an earlier encounter between father and son while tinkering with an outboard motor.Especially unrewarding is the film's concluding sequence, in which Thomas Hudson and his faithful rummy of a friend, a Petitclerc invention played by David Hemmings, attempt to run through the Cuban Coast Guard to deliver some German Jewish refugees to sanctuary in Cuba.The concluding sequence in the book, no less melodramatic, is about Thomas Hudson's confrontation with the crew of a German U-boat. The film's invention, watered down ""To Have and Have Not,"" seems almost opportunistic, as if the appearance of Jewish refgees would guarantee the film an emotional response lacking in the book.It doesn't work. Somewhat better is the central sequence in the film, when Claire Bloom, looking taut and tired as Thomas Hudson's first wife, the only woman he ever really loved, turns up on the island to mull over the past. Not all of Hemingway's dialogue can actually be spoken, but this sequence contains some marvelous lines that suggest depths of feelings that the film doesn't know what to do with. The former lovers, now middle-aged, go to bed together. They bicker, drink, remember the old days when they were poor in Paris. Says the wife, ""How could we all have been such good friends, and had such a lovely time, and had it turn out so badly?""That sense of loss is what ""Islands in the Stream"" is all about, something that the film explores most successfully in the initial sequence with the boys and their father. I'm aware that film criticism should be more than an inventory of a film's parts, but ""Islands in the Stream"" is such a mixture of good and bad that it's impossible not to see the trees instead of the forest.Everyone's performance is more or less defined by the material. The young actors who play the sons have very decent moments, especially Michael-James Wixted, as the troubled middle boy. Mr. Hemmings is even better than his material, but Gilbert Roland as an ancient sea captain and Susan Tyrrell as Bimini's chief hooker are enough to snap the imaginations of even the most kindly disposed.",1977-03-10T05:00:00+0000

So does the movie: a very talented effort at very little, a sinewy jaw closing on a noodle, a fashion pose masquerading as a position.""City of the One-Night Stands"" is the theme song of the film, written and directed by Alan Rudolph and produced by Robert Altman, his mentor. Like ""Shampoo,"" it is about the greed, boredom and decadence of a small, rich and talented cluster of West Coasters. But ""Shampoo"" said, in effect: These are some lives. ""Welcome,"" with far less vitality and with more style than wit, says: This is life.It doesn't make the case. It is a picture that has the smell of a coterie, of inside allusions and illusions, of private jokes or, ratherbecause there are few jokesof private hangovers. The film is a very rich man in beautiful clothes telling you what a bad night he's had. You are sorry, but it was his night.""Welcome"" begins with Carroll Barber (Mr. Carradine), after three years of drifting in Europe, returning to Los Angeles. The return is engineered by his father, Carl (Denver Pyle) a self-made millionaire who wants to bring him into his business. The bait is the offer by a pop singer (played by Richard Baskin who, in fact, wrote the film's songs) to record one of Carroll's pieces. It is a phony offer; paid for, in fact, by Carl.Carroll, rich, languid, untouchable, drifts through, drinking Southern Comfort out of a pint bottle, driving an expansive car with one hand, and sleeping with a succession of frantic women.Why are they frantic? Susan Moore, an agent (Viveca Lindfors) is frantic because she is aging and life is all grappling and no grasp. Ann Goode a real-estate woman played with a kind of defeated enthusiasm by Sally Keller-man, is frantic because her husband sleeps around. Karen Hood (Geraldine Chaplin) is frantic because her husband, Ken, a comically ambitious assistant to Carl Barber, is totally wrapped up in himself.The men, incidentally, are equally frantic, but have a little more breathing space. They need to score instant successeswith sex, work, lifestyleand flee intimacy. Thy love their wives, but play around on Christmas Eve.We see these things in episodes, sometimes clever, usually well-acted, but excessively contrived. Harvey Keitel as a man twisted out of all shape by the need to succeedhe bounces like Silly Puttyis funny and grotesque, but never touching. Sissy Spacek has a perfectly polished role as a live-in maid who does her vacuuming topless, and entertains clients when Carroll Barber goes out. She adds a corrosive kind of humor to the movie, but no life.The only figure that does have lifein other words, she is not defined completely at her first appearance, but goes on changing  is Karen Hood, played by Miss Chaplin. She rides around in taxis, talking to herself: cultivates an interesting cough, and rather endearingly attributes to Benjamin Franklin, not Goya, the phrase about the sleep of reason producing monsters.The role, as written, is more winsome than moving, but Miss Chaplin gives it a genuine wildness, and a rhythm that sounds like static and feels like electricity. In her absurdly miscalculated relationship with Mr. Carradine she is far better than anything else in the movie.And Mr. Carradine is worse. Perhaps it is the director's fault more than his, but he sinks the film. We see interminable shots of him staring out windows, drooping around, driving. He is sullen and laconic, and we get dreadfully tired of him. He is the equivalent of the Poor Little Rich Girl. His deadness is supposed to be the film's judgment upon the hyperactive life of its characters. But except for Miss Chaplin, the characters are neither alive nor interesting. Mr. Rudolph is mowing down lead soldiers.The songs are a particular torment. The music whines, the lyrics complain, and Mr. Carradine sings them with a kind of hushed writhing, like a worm dying at the bottom of a barrel.",1977-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The film, directed by Michael Pressman and written by David Kirkpatrick and Mark Rosin, opened yesterday at the Cinerama 2 and other theaters on a bill with ""New Girl in Town.""""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"" stars Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones as the two young women who successfully manage their heists without anyone's being seriously injured until near the end. An ironic end-credit card attempts to recoup the film's earlier, lighthearted cynicism and almost succeeds.Like every other low-budget, regional melodrama of this kind, the movie is virtually constructed of automobile chases in which every shot of the lead car turning a corner, hitting a bump or swerving to avoid a truck must be repeated by a shot of the pursuing car dealing with the same set of circumstances. Instead,??? of increasing suspense, this sort of duplication cuts suspense in half. Why don't movie makers learn?""New Girl in Town"" is set largely in Nashville, where it was apparently made, and tells the sad story of a once-sweet little farm girl named Jamie Barker (Monica Gayle)???, who climbs to the top of the country-and-western ladder by sleeping with or being raped by the right people.When she reaches her goal, Jamie realizes such success is just a sham. She has paid too high a price for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and the blue bird of happiness should have listened to the handwriting on the wall.

The members of the 400 had gone to Newport first, causing a colony of artists and writers to flee in some horror, and while there were Catholics among the 400, there were no identifiable Irish Catholics, the first Irish Catholic of great prominence in Newport being Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs, the daughter of James Fair of the Comstock fortune.

Equally, this book, based on letters and documents previously unused, is the inside story of the founding of the modern German Empire, compounded of the new world of capitalism and an older world of feudal privilege.

us,'Nasty Habits' of Nuns in Politics,"The nuns at the Abbey of Crewe are in a swivet. The old Abbess Hildegarde has died 30 seconds prematurelybefore putting her signature to a declaration of intent that Sister Alexandra should succeed her. A contested election is in the offing: Sister Alexandra, handsome, aristocratic, obsessed with power and sense of mission (""Unless I fulfill my destiny, my mother's labor pains were pointless""), versus Sister Felicity, who, while carrying on a madcap affair with a Jesuit brother, draws the support of the younger nuns with her promises to turn the convent into a ""love-abbey.""The furious Alexandra instructs her two most trusted associates, Sister Walburga, the prioress, and Sister Mildred, chief of the novices, to fix upon a planwithout Alexandra's knowledge, of course.That plan is to steal Felicity's love letters and publicize them in order to discredit her. Unfortunately, the two Jesuit seminarians who are commissioned to carry out the theft bungle it. They're caught in the act. At first it's all explained as simple high spirits. Nobody pays much attention. Alexandra wins the election by a landslide.Then, slowly but inexorably, the word of the strange procedures at Crewe begins to leak out. Stories appear in the press. The Abbey, it's reported, is bugged. Rome becomes interested. Felicity leaps over the wall with her Jesuit lover to appear on television to promote her cause with the determination of a pop singer plugging her autobiography. What to do? Late at night, in the Abbess's elegantly cloistered quarters, Alexandra, Walburga and Mildred discuss possible scenarios.Because most of us know the ending of the Watergate scandal, we know the ending of ""Nasty Habits,"" the screen adaptation of Muriel Spark's 1974 satire, ""The Abess of Crewe."" Thus our attention must be held not by what happens, but how it's done. Approximately half of ""Nasty Habits,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema 2, is very funny. The other half is anywhere from awful to merely poor, which isn't good enough for a movie like this any more than it would be for a bottle of wine.The most peculiar thing about the film, which was written by Robert J. Enders and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, is that even as it utilizes great chunks of Miss Spark's marvelous dialogue (I like particularly Alexandra's talk to the nuns in which she defines the difference between ""a lady"" and, with a sneer, ""a bourgeoise""), it also calls attention to the fragility of the novella, emphasizing the ways in which Miss Spark's comic conceit is least effective.Take Sister Alexandra as written by Miss Spark and as played by Glenda Jackson (in her best role in years), she's a supremely interesting comic character  witty, clever, quick-minded, erudite, the sort of woman who, because she is the mistress of great traditions, can bend them. The gulf between Alexandra and the Whittier-educated President she's meant to satirize is funny in the book. On screen, it simply serves to make the satire silly.We root for Alexandra. We cheer her brilliantly devious responses to Rome's criticism about the bugging. It's a paradox, she says airily. The Scriptures, she points out, tell us ""'to watch and pray,' which itself is a paradox since the two activities cannot effectively be practiced together, except in the paradoxical sense.""Miss Jackson as Sister Alexandra is great fun, but the film that contains her moves uneasily between high comedy and conventional low comedy about a bunch of nuns doing things that are supposed to be funny because nuns are doing them. It's as simple-minded as Leo McCarey's ""Bells of St. Mary's,"" updated without sentiment.The film's setting has been switched from England, the setting of the book and where most of the film was shot, to Philadelphia, perhaps to explain the presence of such American actresses as Geraldine Page and Anne Jackson, who play Haldeman and Ehrlichman types and who match Glenda Jackson's stylish performance line by line, gesture by gesture. I also very much liked Anne Meara as the Gerald Ford of Crewe Abbey.Nothing, though, can explain or make palatable the casting of Melina Mercouri as the abbey's Henry Kissinger and Sandy Dennis as a John Dean sort. Miss Mercouri has the touch of a bull elephant tap-dancing on the floor above.Miss Dennis, mugging outrageously and badly, gives the kind of performance that, 40 years ago, would have sent her to bed without her supper. It's rude, show-offy and, worse, it's incompetent. Watching her do a double-take is like watching a small tug trying to work the QE2 into her Hudson River berth in a gale. It's long and boring.Mr. Lindsay-Hogg has allowed Miss Dennis to go for the easy laugh at the expense of undermining the legitimate performances of the other actresses, including Susan Penhaligon, who plays Sister Felicity, and of the actors like Eli Wallach, Rip Torn and Jerry Stiller, who have small roles as church fathers.Apparently afraid that movie audiences would miss the point, the director and Mr. Enders, who was the film's producer as well as writer, have added lines not in the book (""You won't have Sister Alexandra to kick around anymore"") that eventually coarsen Miss Spark's work, making it sound less witty than desperate in the manner of an extended television sketch.",1977-03-19T05:00:00+0000

Today's reprise of this old favorite stars Naura Hayden, who, being an erstwhile actress, would probably welcome the billing. Miss Hayden's book is called (with an unacknowledged bow to Dr. David Reuben, the gray eminence of the selfhelp game) Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Energy but Were Too Weak to Ask. The book was published last September, and Miss Hayden hit the road the following month, with stops in most major cities. The message she brought to the anemic folk of Detroit, Chicago, L.A., etc was simple: You Can Be More Energetic! How? Better nutrition is the nub, Miss Hayden says. First, cut out the liquor, coffee, ciggies (as she calls them; she's the kind of writer who says 'cause a lot), sugar and other junk. Second, eat betterhighprotein foods, salad, fruits. Third (the secret ingredient, the sizzle in the steak), drink daily Miss Hayden's magic milkshake, a confection of brewer's yeast, powdered lecithin, skim milk, safflower oil and other things; also take lots of vitamins (Miss Hayden pops 120 assorted capsules every day herself).",1977-03-20T05:00:00+0000

She became pregnant, married the man who loved her (Robert Alda) and never told him he wasn't the father of their daughter (Meredith Baxter Birney).The trouble with ""Bittersweet Love"" is not with the questions raised by the unlikely but innocently incestuous relationship resulting from the marriage of Miss Turner's daughter and Mr. Lansing's son: Should the pregnancy be terminated? Can the marriage continue? Should it?It's simply that despite the earnestness of the cast, inspiration seems to have died with the posing of the problem. Right to the end, the young couple remain two Nice People who have been given a Terrible Problem. What they haven't been given is sufficient depth of character to make anyone care long or profoundly about them.The PG rating seems primarily attributable to the movie's theme: incest.",1977-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Man on Roof',"AT about 2 o'clock on a March morning in Stockholm, a hospitalized police inspector named Stig Nyman is slashed to death in his room with a bayonet.So begins ""Man on the Roof,"" a bloody but keen-eyed, unsparing and absorbing, multilayered Swedish film that opened yesterday at the Plaza.Written and directed by Bo Widerberg, who is probably best remembered here for ""Elvira Madigan,"" ""Man on the Roof"" is based on ""The Abominable Man,"" one of the novels in the highly praised Detective Martin Beck series by the late Per Wahloo and his wife, Maj Sjowall. What elevated these novels beyond the traditions of the genre was a master plan by the authors to use them as the basis for an exploration of society, and director Widerberg remains faithful to that intent.On one level, ""Man on the Roof"" stands as a simple mystery. Who killed Nyman and why? But to discover the answer, it is first necessary to know who Nyman was. A policeman, of course. But what is a policeman? One man's brute, it seems, is another's estimable protector of society's decent people. And finally, when the killer is revealed and begins one of those familiar killing sprees on a roof that drew spectacle-thirsty crowds and ringmasters in the form of importunate television newsmen and squads of specially trained and equipped police and their helicopters, the film becomes a study in the rationality of response.As mysteries go, ""Man on the Roof"" is not a difficult puzzle. Straightforward, routine police procedures, carried out in a matter-of-fact way by sometimes weary men, yield the answer.What invests this film with seriousness and a claim on our attention are the characters themselves. They inhabit a real world, and Widerberg sketches them, their environment and their relationships swiftly and deftly. That is true even of some of the few who appear for a matter of seconds, disappear never to be seen again and probably could be dispensed with in the name of brevity.The chief roles are played remarkably: Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt as Beck, with an economy and grandeur reminiscent of Gabin as Maigret: Einer Ronn as his little chief assistant, with a vertical furrow between his brows that speaks volumes; Sven Wollter and Thomas Hellberg as the two younger detectives who mix like oil and water.But behind it all looms Widerberg. ""Man on the Roof"" may suffer from a slow section in the middle, but over its length, the director displays several varieties of excellencefrom the conjuration of horror by a single eye seen peering through a dark curtain; to the affectionate depiction of a city as background; to the succinct revelation of character; to the concoction of excitement, terror and suspense in the climactic stage. Not the least of his excellences is his willingness, at a time when it seems that technique is everything and coherence nil, to treat his audience to ideas as well.",1977-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Scottish Childhood,"""My Childhood"" (55 minutes) and ""My Ain Folks"" (48 minutes), which opened at the Film Forum yesterday, are, in effect, a single autobiographical feature film in which Bill Douglas, their writer and director, recalls his childhood in a small Scottish mining community after World War II. The films, photographed in black and white, have an intensely naturalistic look, but Mr. Douglas's interest is less in event than in remembered feelings of loneliness and desolation.The principal characters are a little boy named Jamie (Stephen Archibald), the Douglas surrogate, an older boy named Tommy (Tommy Hughie Restorick), who may be either Jamie's half brother or first cousinthe film never bothers to make that clearand the boys' grandmother, who raises them by letting them do pretty much what they please. She's neither cruel nor without love, just old and forgetful.Mr. Douglas's method is as austere as the life he portrays. Jamie, who looks exhausted, with deep circles under his eyes, never cries and seldom smiles. He has already accepted the unfortunate facts of his lifehis illegitimacy, his mother's mental illness and the presence of his father, a weak, not unpleasant sort of man who lives across the street with a dominating mother.""My Childhood"" and ""My Ain Folks"" evoke a world of such bleakness that even the sunlight looks chilly. Affection is something that is distantly remembered or found by chance, as in Jamie's friendship with a German P.O.W. The end of the war, which brings peace to everyone else, simply means that Jamie loses his only friend.I can admire Mr. Douglas's discipline. He recalls all this without a bit of sentimentality. Yet after a while the unremitting gloom comes to be a reverse sentimentality, a sort of angry self-pity that is as off-putting as phony melodramatics. Like Jamie, we in the audience long to run away to some place warm, where people talk to each other and, occasionally, even laugh. The film's emotions are as bottled up as Jamie's.""My Childhood"" and ""My Ain Folks"" will be shown at the Film Forum tonight through Sunday at 7:30 and at the same time next week, Thursday through Sunday.",1977-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Thomas's films are definitely ""pleasant,"" which means they are so cheerful and engaging that they come dangerously close to being sentimental. They please. They amuse. They appreciate the uses of irony.Yet they never once surprise you with the comic perspective one gets in the Truffaut comedies. Antoine Doinel, the complete outsider, passionately aspires to join the bourgeoisie, whose manners and customs he studies with the dedication of a loony anthropologist. The bourgeoisie, seen through Antoine's admiring eyes, is simultaneously exotic and hugely comic. Mr. Thomas makes films about people who already belong, who have no idea that any other sort of existence is possible. Their view is limited.Such a film is ""Les Zozos,"" Mr. Thomas's first film, a sweet-natured comedy about several months in the lives of some teen-age boys who are neither better nor worse than they should be. Mr. Thomas knows perfectly well that they'll all grow up to be somewhat stuffy and to the right of centerknowledge he seems to accept with a sort of benign shrug.""Les Zozos,"" which was included in the Museum of Modern Art's 1973 New Directors/New Films program, opened yesterday at the Jean Renoir Cinema, and follows by two years the commercial release of the directors second film, ""Don't Cry With Your Mouth Full."" It's so decent and well-meaning that to criticize it in any way is rather like returning a birthday greeting unopened.""Les Zozos"" is about two friends, Frederic (Frederic Duru), a would-be ladies' man, and Franois (Edmond Railard), a shy sort who admires Frederic's worldliness as, in the course of the film, he begins to understand Frederic's shortcomings.This insight comes slowly, gently, as the two boys carry out their various romantic maneuvers, first with a couple of pretty girls who live near their boarding school, and then, most hilariously, when they make a trip to Sweden, whose girls, Frederic has been told, are notoriously easy marks. The Swedish excursion is a disaster for both boys. Franois is incapecitated by food poisoning and Frederic by his inability to understand the language. When a pliant young woman invites him home, he thinks she is telling him to go home.All of the performances are attractive in the low-key way of the entire film. Annie Cole, who played the ripe young heroine in ""Don't Cry With Your Mouth Full,"" has a small role of a girl who, for reasons that are never adequately explained, can't get a boy of her own. As was ""Don't Cry,"" ""Les Zozos"" was photographed mostly in landscapes of such idealized beauty that after a while one longs to see evidence of a little pollution.",1977-03-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Airport '77,' Starring a Jet, Fails to Maintain High Level","In ""Airport,"" based on Arthur Hailey's novel, a Boeing 707 jet proved its durability by surviving the explosion of a bomb with scarcely a wobble of the wings. In the sequel, ""Airport '75,"" a Boeing 747 jumbo jet was brought safely home to base after a collision with small private plane. Now, in the second sequel, ""Airport '77,"" which opened at a number of theaters yesterday, a Boeing 747, converted into what is described as a ""prototype executive aircraft"" but looking more like a flying Beef 'n Brew, crash-lands at sea, sinks into 100 feet of water and remains almost as airtight as a diving bell and a lot safer than your own living room.But, some wag is sure to ask, can a 747 boil an egg? Probably not. The Boeing genius has its results, though you'd never know it from this series of popular, immensely silly films that look like reclamation projects for elderly actors.Never, of course, does anything happen to these Boeing aircraft that could conceivably be attributed to equipment failure. The lunacy of man is responsible with such consistency that one begins to feel a quasi-religious emotion in the presence of such perfect planes. You sense the world would be a much better place if people retired and put their destinies on automatic pilot.The tiny story of ""Airport '77"" concerns a rich art collector, played by James Stewart, who invites a planeload of friends, other art collectors and art critics to the opening of his Palm Beach museum. En route from Washington to Florida, thieves attempt to hijack the plane to get its cargo of paintings, but succeed only in crashing everyone into the ocean. Most of the picture is occupied with the passengers' panic, resolution and heroism as Navy divers attempt to raise the plane by huge floats.The characters include the stalwart pilot (Jack Lemmon), his fiance (Brenda Vaccaro), a frisky, pretty art patron (Olivia De Havilland) whose loyal black maid (Maidie Norman) is among the few people killed, an old (very old) flame of Miss De Havilland's (Joseph Cotten), assorted bratty children, an estranged married couple (Lee Grant and Christopher Lee) and a blind musician (Tom Sullivan), who plays cocktail piano and sings ""Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder.""The film was directed by Jerry Jameson, most or whose experience has been in television, but ""Airport '77"" looks less like the work of a director and writers than like a corporate decision.""Airport '77,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly bloody sequences involving passengers and furniture they bump into during the plane's crash-landing.",1977-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,'Eagle Has Landed' on Screens With Lively Splash of Adventure,"""The Eagle Has Landed,"" directed by John Sturges, is a good old-fashioned adventure movie that is so stuffed with robust incidents and characters that you can relax and enjoy it without worrying whether it actually happened or even whether it's plausible.The time is late 1943 and the adventure concerns the efforts of some German commandos to kidnap Winston Churchill and carry him back to Berlin, in ordersays the filmto allow Hitler to negotiate peace with the Allies.Michael Caine plays the leader of the raiding party, a German paratroop officer whose credentials as a humanitarian are established early n the film when, en route to Germany from the Russian front, he attempts to save a Polish Jewish woman from mistreatment by Nazi soldiers. With the exception of Heinrich Himmler (Donald Pleasance), all the Germans in the movie are decent felows, the sort who risk their ives to save the world's less fortunate when they aren't kidnapping the world's leaders.These Germans include Anthony Quayle as Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, who has a very funny scene early in the picture, when he describes a strategy meeting with Hitler that sounds a bit like a Darryl Zanuck story conference, and Robert Duvall, as the German officer whose job it is to make a feasibility study for the raid.Most of the film, though, is set on the beautiful Norfolk coast of England, where the German raiders, disguised as Free Polish troops, settle down to await Churchill's arrival on a weekend rest visit. Mr. Caine's chief accomplice is a fast-talking Anglophobic Irish patriot played by Donald Sutherland with great dash and a brogue that seems to rise and fall according to a mysterious inner timetable.Among other characters are a sweet English girl (Jenny Agutter) who falls in love with the Irishman, and an American Army officer (Larry Hagman) who's such a nitwit he almost wins the day for the Germans.Tom Mankiewicz's screenplay, based on a novel by Jack Higgins, is straightforward and efficient and even intentionally funny from time to time. Mr. Sturges (""Bad Day at Black Rock,"" ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corrall"" and ""The Great Escape"") obtains first-rate performances building the tension until the film's climactic sequence, whch, as you might suspect, concludes with a plot twist.With so many failed suspense melodramas turning up these days, it's refreshing to see one made by people who know what they're about and, in that knowledge, have no delusions of grandeur. The film opened yesterday at Columbia Premiere theaters.""The Eagle Has Landed,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), ends with an extended battle sequence that might frighten very small children who have never been exposed to prime-time television.",1977-03-26T05:00:00+0000

In recent years, this rapidly growing metropolis of 2.6 millionCanada's second largest urban concentration after Montrealhas acquired an international reputation as the country's liveliest city. The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, bringing ocean traffic to this Lake Ontario port, massive mineral discoveries and a tidal wave of immigrationevery second Torontonian is foreign borncontributed to the metamorphosis from a staid citadel of Victorian conservatism to a center of the arts, entertainment and sports, as well as a commercial hub. The skyline expresses the innovative spirit of today's Canada. Newer buildings like the twin structures of the City Hall and the 72story Bank of Montreal Buildingthe city's tallestas well as the towers of Royal Bank Plaza have facades of reflecting glass that mirror the surroundings and the passing scene, giving the impression of huge tapestries suspended in the air. Following the latest eruption of skyscrapers, the municipal administration reined in the developers with a regulation that requires special dispensation to erect a new building more than 45 feet tallabout five stories. Thus quiet residential sections, with gracious old homes along streets lined with venerable shade trees, survive in the heart of the inner city. The sound of the jackhammer is far from stilled in the city's six boroughs, each under a separate government, that make up metropolitan Toronto, called Metro. Nonetheless, the overall impression is of a green city that, in the words of Toronto social scholar Marshall McLuhan, is not yet devastated by progress.

You met him, talked to him, were inspired by him, said one of his disciples, and the next day you found he had fled. He would turn up in Paris, Rome or New York, in Boston or among the Italian Alps, searching for new tufts and threads of metaphysics, taking something from everywhere to assimilate into his patchwork idealism. In other times he might have been looked on merely as an eccentric. Certainly his philosophical system was intensely personal and incapable of being dressed up objectively and imparted to others. But as the Evangelical religious movement in Britain disintegrated before the advance of Darwinism, there arose a great need for such prophets, dedicated to plain living and high thinking, from whom those who still had the habit of belief, without its substance, could recharge their hopes.",1977-03-27T05:00:00+0000

About halfway through the movie, John holds up a bank in California and steals $5,000 as well as the television crew's camera and sound equipment, thus to continue photographing his story himself.In its preoccupation with the movie camera and with the notion that the camera must be able to capture truth, ""Off the Wall"" recalls Jim McBride's classic send-up of cinma vrit, ""David Holzman's Diary,"" about a young man who became so obsessed with photographing his life he could no longer live it.""Off the Wall"" is neither satiric nor funny. It's as earnest and unsurprising as a term paper. As John wanders from California to New York and back again, he keeps attempting to get a fix on where his head is at.When he fails, he gets mad and kicks television sets, refrigerator doors and Coke machines. Looking at a naked light bulb, he lunges at a poetic truth, wondering if he could stare at the bulb until it goes out. ""It'slikethe opposite of enlightenment,"" he muses.

The threepunch knockdown of a manager by a player may not be unprecedented in the maior leagues. Doors can be closed. But there were no doors near third base where Lenny Randle showed he was a better candidate for the Golden Gloves than for a Golden Glove. Baseball historians can't seem to recall an incident quite like it. Dave Boswell, then with the Minnesota Twins, had a chance to flatten the manager but Billy Martin punched him out on the sidewalk outside a Detroit bar in 1969, after the pitcher had slugged Bob Allison, a teammate. Other managers and players have snarled at one another without swinging. And in 1925 Babe Ruth was supposed to have picked up little Miller Huggins, the Yankees manager, and held him by the heels off the back of a moving train while threatening to drop him onto the tracks. That incident never really happened, according to several Yankee players of that era. But that same year Babe Ruth almost punched Miller Huggins.",1977-03-31T05:00:00+0000
