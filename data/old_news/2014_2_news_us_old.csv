The United Nations secretary generals office said Friday that Mr. Bloomberg would be responsible for nudging cities around the world to take steps to combat climate change, helping to raise political will and mobilize action among cities in the months before a climate summit meeting that is scheduled to take place in New York in September. The United Nations climate agenda has been entangled in arguments between rich and poor nations over who should more urgently take steps to reduce carbon emissions. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg set a citywide goal to slash emissions by 30 percent by 2030. He tried to penalize taxi owners who did not use fuel-efficient hybrid cars, but the courts blocked that effort in 2011, calling it a de facto regulation of emissions standards  a power that, under existing laws, belongs to the federal government. Reuters first reported the news of Mr. Bloombergs appointment early on Friday. I cant think of a person better suited for this important new role, Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

(HBO) EPIC (2013) The spirited 17-year-old daughter (Amanda Seyfried) of an eccentric scientist (Jason Sudeikis), trying to prove the existence of a nearly invisible kingdom, ventures into a lush forest and shrinks to two inches, the better to ride on the backs of hummingbirds, in this animated film inspired by William Joyces childrens book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs. There, she meets the leader of the Leafmen (above, voiced by Colin Farrell), an army of ecowarriors committed to saving their environment from the evil Boggans, who want to turn it into a wasteland. Beyonc Knowles provides the voice for the Leafmens ruler, whose 100-year reign will end when a flower pod bursts under a full moon to reveal the new queen; Christoph Waltz is the leader of the Boggans, who cruise on flying rodents; and Steven Tyler is the distracted yellow caterpillar in charge of recording the forests history.

Its important to note that Woody Allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence. So why publish an account of an old case on my blog? Partly because the Golden Globe lifetime achievement award to Allen ignited a debate about the propriety of the award. Partly because the root issue here isnt celebrity but sex abuse. And partly because countless people on all sides have written passionately about these events, but we havent fully heard from the young woman who was at the heart of them.

For his setting, he chose an empty house in Rutland, Vt., that had caught his imagination, and for our part we decided to pair him with well-known actors, a departure for Crewdson, whose mysterious, haunting images until then had all featured anonymous subjects. Our hope was to bring a new twist to celebrity portraiture and produce some unusual images. One of the actors cast for the Dream House portfolio was Philip Seymour Hoffman. He agreed to go up to Rutland on a Sunday in August. I remember thinking, as we were driving to meet up with him at our rendezvous in a shopping center parking lot, How will we know which car he is in? But there in the big empty lot, in one lone car smack in the middle of it, was a man reading The New York Times. Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to make an entrance. ",2014-02-03T23:39:57+0000

As an American treaty ally, Thailand has been critically important in helping to reduce regional tensions and provided balance to the growing military assertiveness of China by championing trade and economic integration partly through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Sunday, protesters disrupted the vote by blocking the distribution of ballot boxes to polling places in about 11 percent of the countrys electoral districts. Because Thailands Constitution requires that 95 percent of parliamentary seats be filled before a new government can be formed, the disruption means the country will remain in limbo for months as election authorities try to conduct elections in those districts where protesters prevented a vote from taking place.

(Starz Cinema) RUST AND BONE (2012) Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), a former prizefighter fleeing with his young son (Armand Verdure) from a bad situation, arrives in Antibes, on the Cte dAzur. At a club where he works as a bouncer, he meets Stephanie (Marion Cotillard, above, with Mr. Schoenaerts), a trainer for a Sea World-like amusement park. Then she loses her legs in an accident with a killer whale and calls him, thinking he might help rouse her from her despair. A plot summary of Rust and Bone might suggest a maudlin, therapeutic fable of healing, and in many ways  or, lets say, in hindsight  the movie is just that, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But its conventional, sentimental essence (which is overtly revealed only at the end) is effectively complicated, indeed almost undone, by the jagged textures of the filmmaking and the naturalistic intensity of the performances. He added: The removal of Ms. Cotillards legs  including in scenes in which she wears a bathing suit or nothing  is surely one of the most impressive special-effects feats of the year, and a reminder that digital cinema is not all about accessorizing wizards, monsters and superheroes. But the greater marvel is Ms. Cotillard herself, an actress of limitless bravery and supernatural poise, who is both beauty and beast. Mr. Schoenaerts is her perfect foil and complement, as large and coarse as she is small and delicate, and also as tender as she is tough.",2014-02-04T06:00:01+0000

Seeger was inspired artistically throughout his lifetime by the force of the mighty, meandering river, and it was Seeger that the British graphic designer Nick Hand initially had in mind when he decided, in the spring of 2012, to log about 550 miles biking through the region to interview and photograph members of its artisan community.

Filmed mostly in the 1970s in some of the places where the killing was planned and carried out, Shoah, released in 1985, relies on face-to-face, after-the-fact testimony rather than archival footage or dramatic reconstruction. It is thus simultaneously about the imperative to remember and the inadequacy of memory.

Parliament allocated about $676 million for the cleanup, and police officers or soldiers will conduct antidumping patrols.

(Starz) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (2013) Nine years after rekindling a romance (Before Sunset) in Paris that began nine years before that (Before Sunrise) in Vienna, Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke, above, with Ms. Delpy) are now in Greece, at the end of a summer vacation with their twin daughters (Jennifer and Charlotte Prior) and the son (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) he left behind in Chicago. Jesse wonders if they could move from Paris to the United States to spend more time with his son. Celine sees his question as a demand to make it happen. And so they will fight about this and the meaning of love, the nature of time and the difference between men and women  throughout the course of a day. Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight are modest, charming movies that together add up to the great romantic epic of a generation defined, in the popular mind and our therapists offices, by hedged bets, easy ironies and perpetual confusion, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this trilogy from the director Richard Linklater. Celine and Jesse can get on your nerves almost as much as they get on each others, Mr. Scott added. We have known them, and they have known each other, for a long time now, but we dont know, from one moment to the next, what their future will be, or what it is that keeps them going. That kind of uncertainty, a scary fact of life, is something most movies avoid. We prefer the magical thinking of neat endings, tidy plots and clear character arcs. Before Midnight is a wonderful paradox: a movie passionately committed to the ideal of imperfection that is itself very close to perfect. ",2014-02-07T06:00:01+0000

Diplomatic missions, business delegations and tourists have filled Yangons hotels since the countrys military government began transferring power to civilian leaders in 2011. The spotlight continues this year as Myanmar, also known as Burma, takes on the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. For now, though, as the road map for laws and reforms is being drawn, the city remains in a kind of urban time warp, still awaiting a much-needed capital infusion to fuel what it hopes to be its renaissance. Golden pagodas, colonial-era buildings, traditional shop houses and moldering jazz-age mansions form a low-rise fabric unique to Asia, the whole stitched together by tree-lined avenues swarming with buses and cars. While ethnic and religious tensions simmer along Myanmars borderlands, including in remote Rakhine State, where there have been recent outbreaks of religious violence, Yangon is far from these areas. Still, time will tell whether the city will reclaim its former status as a cosmopolitan capital.",2014-02-07T15:22:36+0000

His wife and frequent creative collaborator, Catherine Martin, known to everyone as C. M., lies curled beside him atop a flax-colored linen duvet. Four assistants occupy chairs around them, all holding laptops. Each of the young people who gather under Luhrmanns big top has a fantastical back story, at least in his telling. One went to Eton and speaks perfect Chinese; another has a grandpappy who created a little firm called the C.I.A. All have areas of concentration  communications, for example, or moving Baz through time and geography  and all have been trained in the Bazmark way, which means that they carry portable tape recorders to capture his directives and strive always to anticipate his needs.

Charlie McDonnell, a local priest, says that 50 years ago, most climbed the mountain on Reek Sunday, the last Sunday in July. But now, people visit the site every day. Some climb for spiritual reasons, barefoot and clutching rosary beads (Mass is celebrated frequently at the peak), others for their physical health. Even before St. Patricks famous ascent, the mountain was a pagan holy spot. Patrick claimed the mountain for Christianity, Father McDonnell says. But we welcome everybody to the mountain.

I was inspired by y-y girls from the 60s, like Franoise Hardy, the makeup artist Gucci Westman saidof the tomboy-ish look she created backstage this afternoon. Her muse is accessible and cool, Westman continued, but has a contemporary edge and toughness. In the makeup chair, that translated into a modern cat-eye with a strong, geometric shape. The eyeliner goes straight out, and doesnt follow the lash line, which makes it slightly different, Westman explainedof her technique, which involved topping Revlon ColorStay Crme Gel Liner with Revlon ColorStay Liquid Eye Pen. To clean up the edges, Westman relied on an angled Q-Tip when necessary; she left the rest of the face relatively bare. The eyeliner is meant to be your one trick, she said. This is not a high-maintenance girl. Indeed, the British model Georgia May Jagger paid Westman the ultimate compliment by describing the finished look as quite normal  its actually something I would wear out.",2014-02-08T01:35:10+0000

(HBO) 42 (2013) Chadwick Boseman, above, portrays Jackie Robinson, a shortstop for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro leagues, a four-sport athlete at U.C.L.A. and an Army officer during World War II. Harrison Ford plays Branch Rickey, the president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers who selected Robinson to become the first black major leaguer of the modern era. But when Rickey calls his new player superhuman, what he means is that Robinson will have to rise above ordinary temptations in the face of prejudice and hostility to become a flawless exemplar of his race. While 42, Brian Helgelands new film about Robinson, gestures toward the complicated and painful history in which its subject was embroiled, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York York Times, it is blunt, simple and sentimental, using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson. He continued, In other hands  Spike Lees, lets say, or even Clint Eastwoods  42 might have taken a tougher, more contentious look at the breaking of Major League Baseballs color barrier. But Mr. Helgeland has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring. Though not accurate in every particular, the movie mostly succeeds in respecting the facts of history and the personality of its hero, and in reminding audiences why he mattered.

Legs, by the German artist Hans-Peter Feldmann, questions, with an erotomaniacs attention to detail, advertisings ravenous commodification of beauty. The 73-year-olds work, an obsessive appropriation of everyday objects  from photographs of unmade beds to the front pages of 250 newspapers dated Sept. 12, 2001  is in line with that of American conceptualists like Richard Prince and Dash Snow. And yet, he has trouble explaining his ideas: When they asked the Austrian composer Bruckner what inspired his masterwork Te Deum, he said it came to him while . . . eating a cheese sandwich. Feldmann frankly loves sitting in a cafe and admiring the pretty passers-by, but says that the best legs he knows belong to Ursula, his wife of more than 40 years. Is it sexist of me to focus so much on a womans legs? he wonders. I dont know. Ask the great inventor in the sky.",2014-02-09T14:00:18+0000

Fittingly, the inspiration turned out to be a fashion sketch the designer penned himself in advance of the show. To bring it all to life, Palau etched a deep side part with his comb and saturated strands in Redken Control Addict 28 High-Control Hairspray before wrapping them firmly around the head. Its like a very low sweep-over, like a mans hair, he remarked (otherwise known as the comb-over; who knew it could look so cool?). Palau then patted on a Redken Shine Flash 02 Glistening Mist for some sheen, and pulled strands into a slim ponytail, which was later tucked out of sight into the models clothing. To reinforce this idea of hair-as-fashion-illustration, he also painted away the part lines with makeup to prevent any skin from showing, and gave the models who closed the show  including Karlie Kloss, Jacquetta Wheeler and Joan Smalls  a blast of colored hair powder for an ultra-matte effect, like ink set to dry on paper.",2014-02-09T17:06:01+0000

The X Factor completed its third season in December, drawing 6.2 million total viewers for its finale. Before the series premiere in September 2011, Mr. Cowell said that if the show did not pull in 20 million viewers, it would have to be considered a failure.

But on Friday night, a group of mostly stern-looking police officers became sudden celebrities by covering Get Lucky, Daft Punks Grammy Award-winning record of the year shortly before the opening ceremony of the Winter Games from Sochi, Russia. The performance by the Ministry of Internal Affairs choir of Get Lucky went viral: It has been seen about 750,000 times since NBC posted it online. The choirs reward: an appearance on Monday morning on NBCs Today. The incongruity of the choir, dressed in evergreen uniforms accented by yellow braided cords, performing the slightly racy song (Shes up all night for good fun/Im up all night to get lucky), doubtlessly accounts for its appeal. The two lead singers were the stars (a baritone joined them later); some others bobbed their heads but did not get funky, while others looked uncomfortable at their surreal dip into dance music. Rolling Stone labeled the police choirs rendition incredible and noted the officers hilarious old, goofy man dancing at a wedding reception dance moves.

On Diane von Furstenbergs runway in Tribeca yesterday, the relative endurance of the day fit in well with the designers theme. The collection was inspired by Russian ballerinas, the hairstylist Orlando Pita said backstage. So naturally hair was whisked up into a bun. But Pita noted an important distinction: Diane wanted the models to look like they were in rehearsal, rather than in performance. Conveying that sense of unfinished, dashed-off elegance came down to misting BioSilk Dry Clean Shampoo on fine hair for body or rubbing BioSilk Silk Gel Medium Hold on thicker strands for control, and piling everything up into a high ponytail. The length of the tail was then twisted and wrapped around the base, and slightly spread out with the fingers to create a wide, round shape secured with a cupful of bobby pins. But just when the bun began to look too stage-ready, Pita pulled this last step: The trick is to put finishing spray on your brush and comb back the hair vertically, he said, demonstrating the technique around the crown. This makes it look like someone has taken her fingers and combed her hair up. It lent a subtle rawness, which did seem quite en pointe.",2014-02-10T16:42:48+0000

Backstage at 3.1 Phillip Lim this afternoon, hair pro Paul Hanlon whipped models manes into tousled, sporty-slick styles reminiscent of Bruce Webers O Rio de Janeiro book from the 80s, but with a durability that would allow the dos to withstand the rigors of the runway (and several hours worth of afterparties). When you see those pictures, somebodys gone in and done the hair, and its a moment. This is 3-D, the models are walking and moving, and you dont want anything to fall out, Hanlon explained. Perhaps that was his full-disclosure reason for applying what he admitted was an excessive amount of styling fixers: He first brushed through volumizing mousse for body, then massaged on a root booster to help form a pompadourish flip. Next he saturated strands, section by section, in Moroccanoil Treatment Light to create a wet, separated texture all over, and combed Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream through on the front before pulling the hair tight on the sides and high on the top. To finish, Hanlon doused it all with hair spray. The maximalist approach went over well, creating a modern vibe that model Maggie Jablonski described as punk, but artistic and beachy. The only drawback: how to wash out all that product? Just follow Jablonskis directive: Stand and watch it melt away in the shower.",2014-02-11T00:30:23+0000

Backstage, the makeup artist James Kaliardos described the inspiration as the time when you sort of romanticize things like movies and fairytales that stick with you, and affect the way you see beauty. The Rodarte princess, however, is all grown up and has a dark side to her as well. Providing that much-needed edge: a pair of iridescent lip colors done in rich shades of mauve and lavender. Kate and Laura are so into makeup, and the subtle differences in color, Kaliardos said about the Mulleavy sisters, noting that they spent hours deciding on the final palette. The models skin tones largely dictated which of the two shades they would wear, but the application technique was the same: Kaliardos lined the mouth with either Nars Velvet Lip Liner Pencil in El Agua (a deep rose, to be released in the fall) or Nars Eyeliner in Mambo, a reddish brown, and then filled in the lips with a corresponding hue (Nars Lipstick in Dominique Audacious and Deborah Audacious, respectively; both available in the fall). Lastly, he topped everything off with a custom blend of glitter  rose and gold mixed into a base of lipstick and gloss  packed on the mouth with a small makeup brush for precision.

Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims had occupied this building at the beginning of 1850 and while the exterior was not especially prepossessing, with its simple brick facade, the sanctuary looked very elegant. The hall, with a seating capacity of more than 2,500, boasted the largest pipe organ in the United States at the time.

(Starz Cinema) THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY (2007) Jean-Dominique Bauby, a 43-year-old French magazine editor and something of a playboy, had a stroke in 1995 that left him with a condition in which he retained vision, hearing and a functioning mind but was almost completely paralyzed. He told his story in a book that he dictated to an assistant by blinking. In this film from the artist Julian Schnabel, Bauby is played by Mathieu Amalric; Emmanuelle Seigner is Cline, the longtime partner he has recently left and the mother of his three children; and Marie-Jose Croze is the speech therapist who teaches him to use his left eyelid to communicate. The phrase triumph of the human spirit hovers over The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, along with a swarm of other empty, uplifting clichs, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But Mr. Schnabel and the screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, have other themes in mind  among them, limitation, constraint and incarceration  Mr. Scott said. (Both men were nominated for Oscars.)

Where pages had been inert and clogged with text, they now had wiggle room, and it was thanks to Eichs language  called JavaScript. Elements could slide around or blink in response to user input.

These days, at a smaller venue on the Lower East Side called Old Man Hustle, the pool of audience members and participants might be 30 (though many now know one another). Miller, who considers her open-mike nights the last vestiges of bohemianism in downtown New York, attributes the decline to gentrification and the Internet, where people can more easily get their fix of performance art by up-and-comers. There isnt the incentive that we had in the 90s to get out the door and actually do something. But for Daniel Gallant, director of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which introduced open mikes in 1973, social media has been a boon: The performances generate more viral activity online, he says.

His latest, Cell (new at No. 11), is his 28th hardcover best seller since Coma made his reputation in 1977. Cook started his career as a practicing doctor, but eventually devoted himself more and more to writing, where the malpractice premiums are presumably lower. From the start, he has applied himself studiously to his craft. Its easier to get a book published if its going to be a best seller, he told an interviewer in 1977, so I went back to some old New York Times best-seller lists and tried to find books that came from theretofore unknown writers, to try to determine what kind of book had the best chances of making the list. I found the mystery-thriller genre seemed to do this best. If that approach seems more robotic than inspired, well, so can Cooks prose  Cell may be the first thriller to open with an entire paragraph about insulin molecules. (Rapidly infiltrating the veins, they rushed headlong into the heart, to be pumped out through the arteries.) Then again, Cook doesnt make great claims for himself as a writer.

She wasnt the only one blowing past her limits during that risky era, but as Judith Mackrell puts it in Flappers: Six Women of a Dangerous Generation, she was an audacious female forerunner preceding a collective surge in expectation. Women on the verge demanded more from life than marriage and motherhood. Joining Cunard in her restless experimentation were the outrageous actress Tallulah Bankhead, the brazen aristocrat Diana Cooper, the electrifying jazz dancerJosephine Baker, the Polish-Russian painter Tamara de Lempicka and Americas ber-flapper, Zelda Fitzgerald. They shared an edgy ambition and a taste for immoderation that led them crashing through the public psyche, sometimes brilliantly, sometimes not, but always on toward emancipation  or at least on to the next great party.

us,"Lego Movie Tops Box Office, With About Last Night Strong Second","Bookended by Valentines Day and Presidents Day, the weekend was a strong one for Hollywood, despite a flatlining Winters Tale and worries that winter storms in parts of the United States would keep moviegoers on their sofas. Certifying itself as a full-blown phenomenon, The Lego Movie (Warner Brothers) will take in a projected $60 million between Friday and Monday, for a two-week domestic total of roughly $140 million. About Last Night (Sony), one of three 1980s-era remakes to arrive over the weekend, was expected to be the No. 1 newcomer by selling a strong $30.2 million in tickets. Co-starring the popular comedian Kevin Hart, About Last Night cost $13 million to make. Third-place RoboCop from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony was a disappointment considering that it had a production budget of at least $100 million; if analyst projections hold, the science-fiction remake will take in $25.1 million over the long weekend, for a total since opening on Wednesday of about $30 million. (A Sony spokeswoman noted that RoboCop is performing very strongly overseas, where it has taken in more than $70 million since opening earlier this month.) The Monuments Men, also from Sony, was expected to be a solid fourth, generating a projected $17.3 million, for a two-week total of about $46 million. Analysts estimated that Universals poorly reviewed remake of Endless Love would take in about $15.2 million, which is fine for a lightly marketed movie that cost about $20 million to make. But Akiva Goldsmans Winters Tale (Warner) bombed badly, taking in a projected $8.5 million.

More than 60 percent of the severe flu cases in the United States this season have been in people 18 to 64 years old  about double the usual rate, they said.

The main flu circulating this season is H1N1, the swine flu that caused a pandemic four years ago. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, chief of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that only a third of people ages 18 to 64 were vaccinated as of November, compared with nearly two-thirds of children and elderly people.

Startled by Stravinskys pounding rhythms and Nijinskys salacious choreography, the well-heeled philistines in the audience roared with disapproval while the connoisseurs, the happy few, tried shouting them down. One of the most memorable accounts of that first night was written by the American critic Carl Van Vechten, who allied himself decidedly with the latter camp, reporting that a kindred soul in the seat behind him was so carried away that he began beating a tattoo on the critics head with his fists. My emotion was so great, Van Vechten wrote, that I did not feel the blows for some time. Sharing his box was another pillar of the avant-garde, Gertrude Stein, who remembered certain details differently  as well she should, Van Vechten assured her.

All of Cantors fiction (including Great Neck, his un-gadgety novel of the American 1960s and 70s) pulls the readers mind through sensitive history: atom bomb tests at Alamogordo; the Cuban revolution; the events of 9/11; and, in Forgiving the Angel, Stalins gulag and Hitlers death camps.",2014-02-21T16:27:55+0000

St. Vincent. From a distance, it looked a bit like a toothbrush or perhaps one of those hand-held, skin-firming wands. Nope! Turns out, it was one of three new Masterclass Makeup Brushes from M.A.C. Launched this winter, these newfangled tools perform all the usual beauty tasks  blending eye shadow, smudging eyeliner, buffing foundation into the skin, saturating the lips with color  albeit with a supercool design unlike that of a traditional brush. The most noticeable difference: The head and handle point toward the face, rather than away from it, which allows you to actually see what youre doing in the mirror without hands getting in the way (imagine that!). Another plus: The densely packed synthetic bristles  or, rather, cosmefibres  evenly disperse makeup particles over the face, sans streaks. Oh, and the rubberized handles are just comfy to hold, which is key for a busy makeup artist like Regan Rabanal, who spent hours painting faces at numerous New York Fashion Week shows, including Zac Posen, Cushnie Et Ochs and Badgley Mischka.",2014-02-22T05:00:00+0000

The network used its platform of the Winter Olympics to tease out the announcement on Saturday, running a brief promotion. The news release that followed on Saturday night confirmed a few details: Tim Kring, who created the original Heroes in the 2006 television season, will be back as the executive producer. Before that, NBC is to create a digital series that will introduce the new story and characters. (Some original cast members may return.) Jennifer Salke, NBCs president for entertainment, said in a statement that most details about the new version would be appropriately shrouded in mystery. Exactly when the show might appear is not known. Perhaps NBC will wait to see how the most immediate progenitor of the idea, Foxs revival of 24, fares this summer.

Lehane, who is 46, spent six years working in the Clinton White House, battling the ethical scandals that seemed to confront the administration every day  typically by discrediting the accuser or leaking a document to undercut an impending news story critical of the president or the first lady. Now Lehane uses similar strategies  opposition research, attention-grabbing antics, the crafty manipulation of old and new media  for groups like this one, the Consumer Attorneys of California. The campaign to raise the cap on damages for pain and suffering in medical malpractice suits, which was set at $250,000, might have been handled legislatively, but much high-impact law in California is made at the ballot box, in the form of well-publicized voter initiatives.

The all-American banal-bizarre spectacle of the video (synthetic sunsets; slow-motion galloping stallions; the nippleless ingnue) is a freakish act of creation and destruction by appropriation, what Saltz deems part of a collective cultural fracturing. Saltz is riffing on Freuds description of the uncanny as nothing new or alien, but something familiar and old-established in the mind and which has become alienated from it only through the process of repression.

Here, let me help, he says: You put this thing on the back of it. Watching him snap the pieces together, Senior observes that Clint plumps with life, like a diabetic whos finally been handed a sucking candy. Then he notices her noticing him, and offers a sheepish-sounding explanation: Im biased about Legos, he says. Theyre what I played with when I was little. The scene will resonate with anybody whos watched The Lego Movie  half of America, in other words  which likewise features a father passionate about his Lego creations. (The movies success has spilled over onto the best-seller list; a junior novelization, Lego, the Lego Movie, remains at No. 3 in its fifth week on the childrens middle-grade list.)",2014-02-28T16:29:38+0000

us,Passages to India,"In 1671, the East India Company sent 20 single women to Bombay, each supplied with an allowance of 300, a new set of clothing and a simple directive  to find a company-approved mate within a year. In those early days, Anne de Courcy remarks, marriage was often undertaken with the sort of rapidity usually confined to spotting a business opportunity and pouncing on it. But as she follows the long history of what came to be known as the fishing fleet, which supplied a steady cargo of potential brides to generations of expats, it seems clear that the official coupling of a man and a woman in British India, despite an often hastily applied gloss of romance, continued to be conducted in distinctly commercial style. By the 19th century, potential wives were paying a bond of 200 for the privilege of sailing off to a strange land to ally themselves with a virtual stranger. And pity the poor soul who  despite a ratio of three or four men to every woman, inspiring tales of proposals offered at funerals and engagements announced as husbands lay dying  failed to drag the humblest prospect to the altar. Put on a ship back to England, she would now be dismissed as one of the Returned Empties.",2014-02-28T16:31:00+0000

Rather than a tale of transgender magic realism, however, this is the story of a young Mexican girl who grows up in a rural mountain community in the Pacific state of Guerrero  a land of red insects and women  not far from Acapulco. Although named after Diana, Princess of Wales  the saint for betrayed women  Ladydi is called Boy by her mother, Rita. Turning girls into boys  or at least making them ugly  is a matter of survival on the mountain. Girls get short haircuts at the ugly parlor; Ladydi even colors her teeth with black and yellow markers to make them look rotted. All the drug traffickers had to do was hear that there was a pretty girl around, she says, and theyd sweep onto our lands in black Escalades and carry the girl off. ",2014-02-28T16:32:05+0000

But the question at the heart of Bury This isnt about the possibilities brought by advances in forensic science but about the possibilities of language in the face of the ugliest truths.

In a classified memorandum titled Exploitation of German Scientists in Science and Technology in the United States, the Joint Chiefs of Staff described these men as chosen, rare minds whose continuing intellectual productivity we wish to use. Such intellectual spoils were not to fall into Soviet hands. In 1945, Operation Overcast (renamed Operation Paperclip for the paper clips attached to the dossiers of the most troublesome cases) began. More than 1,600 Germans were secretly recruited to develop armaments at a feverish and paranoid pace that came to define the Cold War. ",2014-02-28T16:33:03+0000

The murderer gives up without a fight, and that, youd think, should be that  except for the fact that the killer, Rose Wilson, is a 14-year-old prostitute (looking 16, feeling 12) and one of the men she stabbed to death was the pimp who had hired her out to service eight men.",2014-02-28T16:33:46+0000

Feminist themes and generous amounts of Renaissance Faire-style potted history make her storytelling all the more suggestive. Eerie and powerful acts of nature signify undercurrents of mood the way irregular minor chords in the background music tell us how to feel during ominous scenes at the movies.

us,Just Say Nein,"Joachim Fests fascinating memoir about what it was like to come of age during the years of the Third Reich is unusual because its central character is not the author but the authors remarkable father. Johannes Fest was the middle-class headmaster of a primary school in suburban Berlin, a pious Catholic and father of five, a cultural conservative who revered Goethe and Kant, and a loyal German patriot  a dyed-in-the-wool Prussian, in Fests words  the kind of person who might have been expected to become an active supporter of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialists. In a foreword by Herbert Arnold (a professor emeritus of German studies at Wesleyan University who has also supplied informative notes throughout the text), the elder Fest is described as tailor-made for a career with the Nazis. And yet some quirk in his personality made him a fierce Weimar republican, ready to sacrifice himself, even his family, to principles he knew to be right even as everyone around him was yielding to mass hysteria. Not I, a best seller in Germany when it appeared in 2006, the year of the authors death at age 79, is a memorable tale of lonely courage, stoic endurance, self-imposed hardship and a life lived amid ubiquitous, all-encompassing danger: Even innocent-sounding remarks could be life-and-death matters.
