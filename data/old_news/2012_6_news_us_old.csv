Restaurant meals present a small battle every time, because while the other children may or may not choose soda, and may or may not finish it, this child chooses soda every single time and drains the cup (often before dinner is served) every time as well. The battle? She wants to be served in a big kid cup because she says, rightly, that she never spills (in part because her grip on the cup resembles that of Gollum on the ring). I insist on a baby cup, not because of the lid, but because of the size: just the right amount of soda for someone of her small stature. ",2012-06-01T00:12:39+0000

Afridi was denied legal representation. He was tried under the Frontier Crimes Regulation, a draconian code governing Pakistans tribal areas but not Abbottabad, where he was operating.

And it also acknowledges Akira Kurosawa, the forms spiritual godfather, whose film Yojimbo inspired Leone and his colleagues to see westerns as cynical samurai films.

Brown and Sharpton met years later at various events, but it was in 1973, backstage at Newark Symphony Hall, when they truly first connected. Browns son Teddy had recently died, and Sharptons father had walked out on the family when he was still a boy. I became a replacement for Teddy, Sharpton said, while Brown became the father I lost. The only memories I have of doing things with my father are going to the Apollo to see James Brown. In 1982, Brown and Sharpton flew to Washington to lobby President Ronald Reagan on behalf of a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. On the way there, Brown said: Do me a favor. I want you to style your hair like mine. By the time they reached Washington, Sharpton recalled, I had my hair styled like his, and he promised to keep it like that for as long as Brown was alive.",2012-06-01T14:10:15+0000

There were no stars, no concerts; just everyday folks paying homage to the Godfather of Soul (and so much more) in person. As we laid him in state at the Apollo Theater, we took a moment to absorb this extraordinary show of support. I remember walking the streets of Harlem and shaking hands with many gathered outside the Apollo that day, and Ill never forget a writer who came up to me and said he was shocked by the sheer numbers of people, and taken aback by how much of a revered figure James Brown was. People were often surprised at his relevance, but James never doubted his own significance, or the fact that he was a historic figure and an undeniably game-changing artist. His showmanship and art altered the music world. But James didnt bring blacks to the mainstream; instead, he brought the mainstream to blacks and made them appreciate and internalize black music and culture themselves. The One: The Life and Music of James Brown, by RJ Smith, is the first book to capture this remarkable reality. ",2012-06-01T14:11:23+0000

us,Riffs,"Some of my favorite music writing of the last decade has turned up in novels: the precise absurdist riffs and def(t) beats of Paul Beattys Slumberland; the beatific polluted surf tones of Thomas Pynchons Inherent Vice; the deceptively quiet way music saturates Mary Gaitskills Veronica as a fateful promise that turns into a blinding curse; the measured obsessive-compulsiveness traced by Dana Spiottas Eat the Document and Stone Arabia, testaments to how damaged people can use music to map the world and the scars it leaves behind. These books gauge how music penetrates (or reinforces) our defenses. In very different ways, they confirm what a woman I love once told me: the intimacy and raw power of music can be more dangerous than sex. ",2012-06-01T14:24:11+0000

Yet ever since, in its various guises of museum, ceremonial court and tourist attraction, the palace  the French call it a chateau, although it is not a fortified castle  has remained a symbol of French grandeur.

Like the books that resulted from those trips, JERUSALEM: Chronicles From the Holy City (Drawn & Quarterly, $24.95) isnt exactly reportage. Its a series of brief strips, many only a page or two long, depicting his experiences caring for his kids, seeking opportunities to draw local landmarks without being interrupted by soldiers, and trying to comprehend how the residents of a heavily contested territory live day to day. Delisle, a former animator, has a knack for visual shorthand (his self-portrait is a few jauntily canted lines with dots for eyes) and for drawing environments: religious shrines and settlements, but also grocery stores, playgrounds and checkpoints  lots of checkpoints. The cultural and physical barriers among the Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities in and around Jerusalem, and the compromises and work-arounds the citys residents have been forced to devise, become the source of dark but gentle comedy: absurdity teetering on the edge of tragedy.",2012-06-01T14:27:36+0000

Kraft, the Canadian-born founder of Kraft Foods, lay not in artisanal cheesemaking but in taking a milk-based product and making it long-lasting, consistent in quality and easy to slice. In 1916, after a series of experiments at his Chicago boardinghouse, the former grocery clerk received a patent for process cheese: a sterilized product made by heating Cheddar at 175 degrees for 15 minutes while whisking it continuously. The invention helped turn cheese into a shippable commodity with a longer shelf life  and transform Krafts company into a cheese empire. Jamess brother Norman, who became Krafts head of research, wanted to make things even easier for the consumer by precutting the cheese into slices. The idea was easier to conceive than to execute: process cheese was packaged and sealed while still fluid and hot, and cutting hot cheese was like trying to slice molten lava.",2012-06-01T17:52:01+0000

People tend to lump the two nighttime soaps together, but aside from the characters habit of resolving major conflicts in the swimming pool, the two shows couldnt be more different. Dynasty constructed a fantasy of domestic royalty and jet-setting escapism, offering a portrait of the rich as diamond-strewn, evening-gown-clad ghosts drifting from their private jets to their enormous mansions as servants rushed about carrying silver platters. Dallas, by contrast, stayed firmly rooted in middle-class American values, presenting a picture that was more Big Boy breakfast buffet than Breakfast at Tiffanys. With its cowboy hats and flocked wallpaper and Hatfields-versus-McCoys-style feuds, Dallas was as provincial and preglobal-economy as it gets. Even Southforks dcor, with its dark paneling, garish paintings and low ceilings, mirrored the claustrophobia of the country club: cramped, wall-to-wall carpeted spaces packed with small-minded people lugging their gigantic egos around behind them like overstuffed golf bags.",2012-06-01T18:26:01+0000

The 7-to-4 decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, came in a lawsuit filed in 2004 by the Karuk Tribe of Northern California. The tribe had argued that some types of mining on the Klamath River, including suction dredging and motorized sluicing, posed risks to coho salmon, a federally protected species. Coho are important to the tribe for cultural, religious and subsistence reasons. The Forest Service had argued that the Mining Act of 1872 prevailed over the Endangered Species Act.

The Catholic Campaign, an arm of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that is devoted to reducing poverty, has stopped financing groups that run astray of Catholic positions. Nicole Mosher, executive director of Compaeros, said a fund-raising campaign had netted more than $60,000.

Phillips has worked with the actress and tabloid goddess before, on a 90-second video for Neville Wakefields Commercial Break, which had a very brief run during the 54th Venice Biennale. And his studio is lined with several larger-than-life paintings of Lohan that came directly out of that particular project. But dont call Lohan his muse. Lohan, Phillips insists, is his collaborator as much as anyone in the stellar cast of people who worked on the film, including the legendary surf filmmaker Taylor Steele; the professional surfer Kassia Meador, who performs mesmerizingly as Lohans body double; the editor Jay Rabinowitz; and Thomas Bangalter, one half of the electro duo Daft Punk, who composed the ominously swelling score. As the trailer implies, First Point is at once a surf film and a film noir, an exploration of the California dream and the Hollywood nightmare, worlds that Lohan doesnt have to pretend to straddle on screen. But no doubt the question on everyones lips when First Point has its premiere next week at Art Unlimited, the curated section of the Art Basel fair, will be: Is it art? And that is just fine by Phillips. Its just like in my paintings, he says. Because of the actor and the popular culture dimensions of the project, it will give people  especially people in the art world  a real sense of instability with regard to my intentions. Is it a film? Is it an art video? It refuses to announce itself as either. ",2012-06-04T13:00:53+0000

Dionne on The Diane Rehm Show for a discussion of his engaging new book, Our Divided Political Heart, which is both a meditation on the individualistic and communitarian strands in American political thought and history, and (as you might expect, given the author) a lament that the contemporary Republican Party has tilted the contemporary balance dangerously toward a radical individualism. My main criticism of his thesis (also perhaps predictably) was to question Dionnes tendency to equate community with government, given the way expansions of state power tend to crowd out more personal and/or voluntary forms of common life (civic, religious, familial), replacing human-scale interactions with bureaucratic process and leaving society more atomized than before. To which he responded that while this can happen, it doesnt have to happen: Government can strengthen local communities as well as weaken them, partner with private groups as well pre-empt them, and fill in the gaps left by purely voluntary effort as well as take those efforts place. Conceding that reality, I nonetheless tried to press Dionne a bit more on whether given where we are now, with a large-scale and costly welfare state having become a permanent feature of our national life even as more local and personal forms of community have attenuated, the conservative-communitarian suspicion of state power might not be more relevant than the liberal-communitarian view of the state as an instrument of social solidarity.",2012-06-05T19:14:59+0000

Inmates released from prison in 2009 spent an average of 2.9 years  or 36 percent  longer behind bars than offenders released in 1990, the report found. The additional time cost taxpayers more than $10 billion. In Florida, the average time served rose by 166 percent; in New York, 2 percent. Eight states showed decreases in the length of prison terms, according to the report, which analyzed data from the federal governments National Corrections Reporting Program. Adam Gelb, director of the centers Public Safety Performance Project, noted that the variation among states followed no evident regional pattern, reinforcing the idea that state policy choices, often driven by particular crimes or circumstances in that state, drive the size and cost of the prison population, rather than data and research about whats most effective in reducing crime.

BP sought the e-mails from the scientists, Chris Reddy and Richard Camilli of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, to help prepare its defense in a lawsuit brought by the federal government. In an op-ed article in The Boston Globe, the scientists said they had given the company more than 50,000 pages of documents and data before the company also demanded the e-mails. They said they worried that BP would use the e-mails to falsely cast doubt on their conclusions. Our concern is not simply invasion of privacy, but the erosion of the scientific deliberative process, the scientists wrote. BP said the subpoena was in no way an attack on science.

Fewer than 700,000 borrowers are enrolled in the program, in part because registration is complicated. But beginning Sept. 30, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Wednesday, most borrowers will be able to electronically import data directly from the Internal Revenue Service onto their application, letting them complete the application at one sitting, without going through their loan servicer.

Sorting out this new landscape may well involve asking the kind of questions experimental philosophy is currently asking about everyday moral intuitions. And at the very least, ethicists and engineers will have to get used to the idea of working closely together. The article also suggests it will be necessary to determine whether the designer, the programmer, the manufacturer or the operator is at fault if something goes wrong. But if responsibility can ultimately be assigned to a human being, its unclear why we would need to scrap the good old fashioned moral system we already have in place.

I want to be sympathetic to her struggles, but though Ive tried, Ive never felt an attachment to her. She has been an intermittent presence and not always a pleasant one. Is it ethical to decide not to carry on this relationship? Or does someone elses desire for connection, which perhaps comes out of a strong wish to be part of a family, outweigh my personal preference? J.G., NEW JERSEY",2012-06-07T19:41:35+0000

The documents contained details about the budget, strategy and donors to the institute, which disputes that global warming is under way. The statement said the Pacific Institutes board of directors had accepted Dr. Gleicks apology. By saying that its investigation confirmed Dr. Gleicks account, the institute implicitly backed his assertion that he was not responsible for creating a document labeled a fake by Heartland that was disseminated along with other genuine ones.

In collaboration with Herms, 20 of the artists abstract color studies have been translated into silk scarves in signed, limited editions of seven each. Couleurs de LOmbre (Colors of Shadow), as the collection is called, is a moving tribute to the lowly Polaroid, which faces imminent extinction. (Sugimoto in fact exhausted his last batch of the film to make the images.) Herms, on the other hand, developed new inkjet technology in order to faithfully recreate the subtle gradations of intense color. Where the original Polaroids are small and precious, the scarves are large  just over 55 inches square  and dynamic, playing with light in ways the artist had never anticipated. Though at around $10,000, you might think twice about actually wearing one. Its serious art for me, Sugimoto says, with a nod to Herms.

Id been cooking it sort of like pasta, in 3 parts water, then draining it and letting it dry out in a towel-covered pan. Ordinarily, this is a good way to obtain very fluffy grains, and you get a lot of volume too. But lately Ive been finding that my quinoa is soggy  more waterlogged than fluffy  when I cook it this way, even after it rests under the towel. Are the grains different? I dont know. Whatever the reason, I decided to change the grain-to-water ratio and followed the directions on my Alter Eco quinoa packages (Alter Eco is a company dedicated to fair-trade foods, and they import red, rainbow and pearl quinoas). I cooked the pearl and the red quinoas in 1 1/2 parts water and the rainbow in 2 parts water. The black quinoa in the rainbow mix takes a little longer to soften and requires a little more liquid to be properly hydrated. The grains were tighter and less moist than quinoa cooked in abundant water, and the yield was not as great because the grains dont swell as much. But I liked the results, especially for salads, which were the destination for my quinoa experiments.",2012-06-08T15:29:49+0000

Yet with subjects including the Civil War, international espionage, Navy SEALs and the most trusted man in America, the lists new titles throw off a decidedly masculine funk. The Civil War book is Jeff Shaaras Blaze of Glory, a novel about the Battle of Shiloh that hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 7 and contains one character as notable to literary historians as military ones: the Union general Lew Wallace. Blamed for the battles heavy casualties after he was late with reinforcements, Wallace went on to serve as governor of the New Mexico Territory before becoming, like Shaara, a wildly popular historical novelist. (His Ben-Hur, published in 1880, was the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, and has never gone out of print.) Shaara, a former coin dealer who started writing after the death of his novelist father, told a Florida newspaper recently that he tries to grab his audiences right away: A very good friend of mine who is not especially a reader said to me, If you expect me to read your books, youve gotta hook me in Chapter 1.

Like most professors devoted to teaching, he has no interest in telling undergraduates what to think, but he does want to draw them toward a sense of skepticism about the status quo and to a feeling of wonder about the natural world. College, he tells us, is a time to learn to make connections among seemingly disparate phenomena, to see things from anothers point of view and to develop a sense of ethical responsibility.

Members of Ms. Millers Gallim Dance compressed or stretched their bodies to extremes, returned to form and started all over again. Presented in conjunction with the Gotham Dance Festival that concluded over the weekend, the production did offer a glimpse into a new direction for Ms. Miller, whose dances, up to this point, have been energetic but unoriginal. They take much from Gaga, a movement practice created by the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin.

The background to the study is the striking fact that even as traditional marriage has declined in the United States  marriage rates tumbling, out-of-wedlock childbirth climbing, and cohabitation becoming as respectable as wedlock  the evidence has mounted for the institutions importance to the well-being of children. A happy childhood is possible in many different environments, of course. But a growing body of research indicates that no other parental arrangement, from single motherhood to cohabitation to shared custody, affords as many social, economic and emotional advantages as being raised by two biological parents joined in a lifelong commitment. (Isabel Sawhill from the Brookings Institution and Kay Hymowitz from the Manhattan Institute have both had good recent pieces elaborating on some of these themes.)",2012-06-11T16:06:54+0000

With the recent opening of Graymarket, a by-appointment-only boutique-cum-gallery dedicated to dead-stock clothing made by designers like Paul Harnden, Carpe Diem, Carol Christian Poell and Katie Gallagher, its time to add artisanal clothing to that list. The Graymarket founders, Wei Du and Alex Kasavin, met online, where artisanal clothing fans buy, trade and spend many, many characters analyzing the provenance and lineage of their limited-edition obsessions. Buttonholes, stitching, dye lots  these kind of things are taken very seriously, Du says. People try to find out exactly what tannery the leather in a jacket comes from. Many artisanal clothing designers work in black, the better to emphasize the tailoring and technique that goes into each garment, and thats reflected in the goth cast of many of the clothes on Graymarkets racks. But Due and Kasavin stress that theyre not purists, a stance theyve underlined both in the tongue-in-cheek name they gave their shop  its a reference to goods being traded legally but not via the distribution channels intended by their manufacturers  and in the stock they carry, which includes the work of both small-scale, cult studios and boldface names like Balenciaga, Givenchy and Alaa, designers that not all artisanal enthusiasts would accept as legit.

Lip balms to $100 for a handmade necktie by Forage to $150 for a Thomaspaul wool shawl, and top out at $425 for a pearl and pyrite necklace by Carolina. Besides carrying items a traveler would expect, like a stylish toothbrush, James said it was important to bring in a few things that made no sense, like a gold leather Websters dictionary or Harry Allens gold pig bank  things that are interesting and lovely, but we thought, honestly, Who will buy this in an airport?

Addictive actions are often thought to undermine the will. But can we think of them more simply as representing nothing more than capricious changes of mind? There is a view of temptation and the will, tracing back to Platos Protagoras, that takes them to be just that. It is an elegant theory, as it makes no use of the thorny notion of akrasia, or weakness of will. Alan Brody argues at Philosophy Now, though, that we can find another view in Plato that also refuses the concept of akrasia while still respecting the way addiction disrupts agency, in particular our capacity to regulate our actions. The view is this: when one acts on an addictive impulse, ones will remains intact. It is, rather, the capacity to judge what is the best course of action that fails one; the addictive course momentarily appears to be the best available.What Rorty Wrought: Santiago Zabala marks the five year anniversary of Richard Rortys passing with this tribute in Al-Jazeera. Rorty ought to be the model for 21st century philosophy, Zabala argues, owing to his eclectic approach to philosophical method and the capacity it gave him to transcend narrow debates within Anglo-American philosophy and see the way philosophy might figure productively in the broader intellectual and political life of America and Europe. But politics should also inform philosophy: If you take care of freedom, Rorty says, truth will take care of itself. For Rorty, truth ought to be conceived not as correspondence to a mind-independent reality, but pragmatically, as consisting in those conclusions an open and free community might arrive at in the long run of inquiry.

Tomorrow, the Bellport-Brookhaven Historical Society on Long Island will unveil A Bellport Tale, a new exhibit of photos that Weber took when he resided in Bellport in the 1970s and 80s. Everyone knew each other, Weber said of the quaint bayside village. You could knock on any door and just invite a neighbor over to be part of a photography sitting. It was as easy as borrowing a cup of sugar. The images in the exhibit come from a shoot that appeared in British Vogue in 1982 called Under Weston Eyes. Starring Talisa Soto and the male model of the moment, Bruce Hulse, that story was styled by Grace Coddington and inspired by the work of another photographer, Edward Weston. He took things that were very personal to him and let us see into that world, Weber said. I thought it would be interesting to do a series of pictures of my own imaginary family, living together in the dysfunctional, neurotic, beautiful way that families do. The exhibit (on view through Sept. 3) includes many memorable images, but perhaps none is more evocative of a quiet life on the bay than that of a shirtless Hulse, sitting on the stern of a boat, cigarette in hand, wearing calf-revealing baggy trousers, rumpled socks and dress shoes.",2012-06-14T13:00:29+0000

I love to dress a dinner table in colorful prints the way I dress myself, says Albou-Mechaly, who is now expanding the brand to include home goods. My idea of fashion is not to be only about clothes but about living well. Paul & Joe La Maison is making its first foray into design with a three-print collection of kitchenware: cherry blossoms, kittens and Asian-inspired koi motifs. The brands DNA is all about the happiness in colors and prints, so this feels like a natural extension, she says, which is another way of saying that La Maisons prints are derived from the current season and past collection hit makers. As a woman and a mother, I am constantly thinking about women and the clothes and things that they need in their lives: practicality and appeal, she adds. The collection includes everything from porcelain dinner plates and linen dishcloths to butter dishes, egg cups and even charming lunch boxes. And, with everything priced between $30 and $150 (similar to its sold-out 2006 Target collaboration), customers can afford the luxury of changing their home dcor as often as they change their mood and clothes. Theres no trend to it, Albou-Mechaly says. Mixing pieces and decorating your kitchen with them is fun. The designer also suggests swapping tired hostess gifts (wine, flowers, desserts) with a La Maison item, since each piece comes beautifully packaged in a matching print box. Arent American kitchens needs different from those of French kitchens? Albou-Mechaly begs to differ: We are the American kitchen, English kitchen, French kitchen, Italian kitchen  its just the taste that is different.

Another is that this psychological thriller (or perhaps, psychothriller) about an American writer down on his luck in Paris and maybe out of his mind creates a sense of dread that builds and builds though never resolves, even in the final fade out. It doesnt have the kind of payoff that details who did what and why, which is a problem only if you demand tidy endings. If youre up for some narrative drift, you can just go with the ambiguous flow created by the Polish-born filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski, who I suspect is a fan of Antonionis Passenger.

The status of personal prelature, similar to a diocese without specific boundaries, was introduced during the Second Vatican Council and until now has been given only to the conservative Opus Dei movement. The proposal was made during a meeting between Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the Society of St. Pius X, and Cardinal William J. Levada, the Vaticans chief doctrinal officer, to discuss elements of the doctrinal preamble that the group must accept before reconciliation can be reached. Bishop Fellay promised to respond in a reasonable amount of time. The group does not have canonical status in the church. In 1988 Pope John Paul II excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the groups founder, as well as four bishops he consecrated without the Vaticans approval. ",2012-06-15T03:39:06+0000

Coronels husband, who was not present for the birth, is a legendary tycoon who overcame a penurious rural childhood to establish a wildly successful multinational business. If Coronel elected to leave the entry for Father on the birth certificates blank, it was not because of any dispute over patrimony. More likely, she was just skittish about the fact that her husband, Joaqun Guzmn, is the C.E.O. of Mexicos Sinaloa cartel, a man the Treasury Department recently described as the worlds most powerful drug trafficker. Guzmns organization is responsible for as much as half of the illegal narcotics imported into the United States from Mexico each year; he may well be the most-wanted criminal in this post-Bin Laden world.

Part of Project1Voices second annual event 1 Voice, 1 Play, 1 Day, the reading was chosen to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Baldwins death. Set in Harlem in the 1950s, The Amen Corner, like Baldwins first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, explores the role Christianity plays in the lives of African-Americans. The New York reading, which will be performed on Monday at 7 p.m at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, is to be hosted by Norm Lewis (below, of The Gershwins Porgy and Bess) and directed by Walter Dallas with Lillias White, Chuck Cooper and Adriane Lenox starring. Speaking in a telephone interview, the Project1Voice founder Erich McMillan-McCall said that the goal of the annual reading was to help preserve the legacy and tradition of black theaters for future generations, adding, By creating awareness and reigniting what I call lesser-known classics by African-American playwrights we can get people to realize that there is a voice that is missing, and that is the voice of many minority professionals.

When the $2.2 billion solar thermal plant known as Ivanpah is completed  sometime next year, if all goes according to plan  nearly 350,000 mirrors on 3,600 acres will reflect light onto boilers. Steam will power turbines, which will generate electricity that flows to California homes. It will be the largest such plant in the world. These solar workhorses of the desert, says V. John White, an analyst in Sacramento and an advocate for renewable energy, can produce a lot of high-quality energy in the way that other renewable energies cant do. And there are only a handful of places on the planet that have solar radiation that good. But some opponents have criticized the Obama administration for pushing solar projects that dont pan out. The solar-panel maker Solyndra declared bankruptcy last year despite receiving $528 million in federally guaranteed loans, while BrightSource Energy, one of Ivanpahs developers, has benefited from a similar $1.6 billion government loan.

us,Florida: State Is Sued Again Over Voter Purge ," A second lawsuit was filed in federal court in Miami on Tuesday against the State of Florida over its search of voter rolls for noncitizens. Several civil and voters rights groups joined in the suit, which says the search violates the National Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act. The groups said the review discriminates against minorities and is prohibited within 90 days of an election. Florida has a primary in August. The state is also being sued by the Department of Justice. Earlier this year, the state sent names of 2,700 possible noncitizens to county election supervisors, who were advised to write those people, asking them to offer proof of citizenship or risk being dropped from the rolls. But the list, compiled by comparing voter rolls to a drivers license databank and overwhelmingly singled out minorities, was found to be flawed. The state has asked the Department of Homeland Security to allow it to use an immigration database to verify the list, but the federal government has not done so. As a result, Florida is suing Homeland Security over access to the database. The civil rights groups say they hope their suit deters other states from conducting similar searches.

As a student at Stanford in the early 1930s, he had come out to his classmates as temperamental, code for homosexual. In 1934, having dropped out of Stanford and moved to Los Angeles to try a career in pictures  and having already begun to hone his identity as sensualist and agitator  he joined the Communist Party. Around 1936, he turned up at a Halloween party dressed as the demise of fascism.

The dishes, the statement said, were being handed out to bribe voters; their seizure was approved by the Tbilisi City Court.

us,Paris Does Brooklyn,"Growing up in the Paris suburbs, David Obadia, 23, was obsessed with Nike Air Jordans and the American street-wear brands Supreme and Stussy. Meanwhile, his best friend, Nelson Hassan, 22, was more drawn to the avant-garde looks of Comme des Garons and Raf Simons. No wonder, then, that upon graduation from business school and fashion school, respectively, the duo started their own label, Brooklyn We Go Hard, named for the Jay-Z song. We like everything about Brooklyn, including Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Dr. Browns soda and the Nets, Obadia explains. (He assures that theyve both been there several times.) Brooklyn brings together the mainstream and the underground, which is what we want to do with the clothes. They started in 2010 selling simple white T-shirts embossed with gritty images of New York taken by a handful of Paris photographers, but they gained steam last year when they introduced an elbow-padded sweatshirt (about $140), soft cotton on the inside and nubby wool on the outside, with the motto Brooklyn Parle Franais embroidered across the chest. The sweatshirt got picked up by Colette in Paris, Antonioli in Milan, Urban Research in Tokyo and Opening Ceremony in the United States, and has been worn by the likes of Kid Cudi, who sported it at the Hunger Games premiere, as well as Olivier Nakache, the director of the recent French box-office record-breaker Les Intouchables. (Can you help us get the sweatshirt on Jay-Z or anyone from the Nets? Hassan asks.) Later this month, theyll show their first full collection at the Paris mens Capsule show; the collection includes pieces that would look right at home on the lazily fashionable young men of Bedford Avenue, including chambray shirts with baseball stripes ($100) and reversible cotton knit sweaters that droop on a skinny torso as raffishly as a cigarette from the lips of a Marais bobo ($164). The guys are making the clothes in conjunction with a magazine they publish that, in charmingly bad English, helps foreigners understand such Brooklyn characters as boricuas and Lubavitchers.

The world is Judiths miniature recreation of the land of milk and honey that she believes will come after Armageddon. Touchingly, it is just a cleaned-up version of her working-class neighborhood, comprising tiny gardens and snowmen and clay model figures on which she eventually enacts a shameful voodoo. Its no wonder Judith spends all day in her room. She is abnormally isolated  constrained by her fathers religious fundamentalism, which dictates that she sit out school assemblies and accept as her social circle the motley members of her church group, with whom she wanders through town trying to evangelize.

No doubt some terrorists have thought about whether they could pull off an attack, Jonathan Evans, MI5s director general, told an audience in London. But the Games are not an easy target, and the fact that we have disrupted multiple terrorist plots here and abroad in recent years demonstrates that the United Kingdom as a whole is not an easy target. British officials will deploy a security force of more than 25,000 for the Games, and Mr. Evans cited the extremely generous security assistance given by friendly countries, an allusion to an Olympic security unit run by F.B.I. and C.I.A. officials. He said security officials had assessed the current threat of a terrorist strike in Britain as substantial, meaning that an attack is a strong possibility. But he noted that the threat assessment was one notch lower than it had been for most of the period since the 2001 attacks in the United States. There is no such thing as guaranteed security, he said. But I think we shall see a successful and memorable Games. ",2012-06-26T02:07:14+0000

Behas 2009 memoir, The Whole Five Feet: What the Great Books Taught Me About Life, Death, and Pretty Much Everything Else, in which he sets out to spend a year reading the Harvard Classics, is being diverted, along with him, into another, much more personal project. The book I intended to write, he tells us, was essentially a comedy, about a feckless, somewhat lost young man who shuts himself away from the modern world. But when he learned that his adored aunt had terminal cancer, his reaction to her suffering created a very different book: his love for her became both his subject and his inspiration. On the way to a radiation treatment, when he asked permission to write about her, she gave her approval. Hearing the pleasure in her voice, Beha confesses, was one of my happiest moments. . . . I allowed myself to think that, no matter what happened . . . I could save her in some way if I got everything down just right on the page.",2012-06-29T16:08:36+0000

Winter always seems to be looming. Or summer. Somebody will probably divulge a secret to a horse or a child. Mishandled, these western standbys can seem like threadbare, dime-novel clichs. Handled deftly, these conventions are the stuff of American myth. The line is finer than one might think.

By affirming a limited and limiting reading of the Congresss Commerce Clause powers even as he upheld the individual mandate for other reasons, Will wrote, the Chief Justice rejected a constitutional rationale for the mandate  that was pregnant with rampant statism, and laid the groundwork for a future in which the judiciary returns to its pre-New Deal habit of viewing congressional actions with a skeptical constitutional squint, searching for congruence with the Constitutions architecture of enumerated powers. From the left,Chait made a version of the same point, worrying that a Roberts-led Court would now be able to advance a much more limited understanding of federal power by a process of slow constriction, rather than one suddenly and transparently partisan attack.

He is expected to be sent soon to New York. The defendant, Minh Quang Pham, 29, traveled to Yemen and took an oath of allegiance to the affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, received training from the group and provided it with expert advice and assistance in photography and graphic design, an indictment says. It also says that in April 2011, he worked with an American citizen in Yemen on the propaganda effort, and met with another American as well. The indictment does not identify the Americans, but their descriptions suggest they might be Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical Muslim cleric, and Samir Khan, who helped to produce Inspire, an English-language online magazine published by the group in Yemen. Both men were killed in a drone strike last September. ",2012-06-30T02:58:52+0000
