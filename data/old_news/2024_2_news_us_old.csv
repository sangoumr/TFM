I Missed a Cruise and the Cruise Line’s Own Travel Insurance Won’t Pay.,"After graduating from college in 2022 and working for a year, I used my bonus and some of my savings to book a nine-day Mediterranean cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line for my partner and me. Our $7,657 cruise package included airfare from Atlanta to Barcelona, Spain, via Newark, and Norwegian’s own BookSafe Travel Protection Plan, which included travel insurance and also allowed me to “cancel for any reason” for a 75 percent credit. Weather delayed our first flight, we missed the connection, and United Airlines could not get us to Barcelona in time to embark. I called Norwegian and agents suggested I buy last-minute tickets on a different airline, but I don’t have that kind of money. And even if I did, there were no direct flights to later ports, and I was unwilling to risk missing another connecting flight. So we spent the night in the Newark airport, paid for a return flight to Atlanta the next morning and canceled the cruise and remaining air legs. I got $1,184 back right away from Norwegian, and then an additional $232 back (for my return flight) from travel insurance when I filed a trip delay claim, but a trip cancellation claim for the cruise was denied outright. I feel I should at least get the 75 percent credit — otherwise what was the protection plan for? Can you help? Ivy, Atlanta",2024-02-01T10:01:25+0000

If I have to endure the season’s early sunsets and freezing temperatures, at least I can make it cozy (and complexion-flattering) inside. Scented candles can grow cloying after a few hours, so I prefer scented matches — they still lend a sense of occasion to lighting up, but their smell won’t linger long enough to give you a headache. The yuzu incense matches from Hibi are my favorite — the brand was created by Kobe Match Company, which has been producing matches in Japan since 1929. Each one lasts about 10 minutes, and a pad for safe burning is included in the box. I also like Bohème’s Marisol fragrance — its notes of cardamom, clove and sandalwood are infused into extra-long matchsticks. For a touch of old-world charm, Buly is a classic choice: The brand’s perfumed matches come in eight signature scents and are housed in beautifully illustrated boxes. Any of these options would make a charming Valentine’s Day gift paired with a whimsical candle from Wednesday Company.

us,New York Distilling Company Moves Down the L Line,"New York Distilling Company, one of the oldest craft distilleries in New York City, is moving and introducing a new whiskey. Opened in 2011, this distillery made Williamsburg, Brooklyn, its home until last year. In March it will open a new facility, three times the size of the original, in Bushwick. The new distillery will open for 90-minute tours, with a fee and reservations required, beginning on March 1; it will eventually open a new public cocktail bar and tasting room, but it will not be called the Shanty, as it was in Williamsburg. In addition, it is retiring its longstanding Ragtime Rye and replacing it with Jaywalk. The new rye is distilled from Horton rye, a grain varietal with roots dating back to 17th-century New York that the distillery has nurtured, growing it in the Finger Lakes region, over the past eight years. “This is the rye we have been dreaming of for 13 years,” said Allen Katz, the distillery’s co-founder. Three ryes will be bottled under the Jaywalk label: straight rye, a blend of 6-, 7- and 8-year-old ryes and 92 proof ($50 for 750 milliliters); bonded rye, 100 proof ($55 for 750 milliliters); and heirloom rye, cask strength, so named because it’s made from 100 percent Horton rye ($119 for a 700 milliliters). The new whiskies are robust and complex in their flavor, not merely spicy like many ryes. They will all be available starting Feb. 15 from Bottlerocket, in Manhattan, Brooklyn Wine Exchange and Gnarly Vines, in Brooklyn, and online. ROBERT SIMONSON",2024-02-05T17:35:26+0000

The newest one, open later this week, is his first that is not rooted in his native Mexico or even Cuba, like his Cuban-style diner, Coppelia. It is Italian. “My cooking background is French, my restaurants are Mexican but there’s a place in my heart for Italian,” he said. “I’m ready to cook my own interpretation.” His ode to Italy, named for the Italian sour cherry, looks to Roman cooking and that of coastal areas. It has moved into the Upper East Side townhouse space occupied until last year by the Simone. But unlike the garden-level predecessor, his restaurant, with 60 seats, will occupy two floors and will add a bar in the almost summery setting with light colors accented with green downstairs. Upstairs, a more opulent room is done in a ruby palette; both areas will offer the same menu. Louis Skibar, a frequent partner, is a co-owner. To begin, the restaurant will serve dinner featuring various supplì, like arancini; baked clams with salsa verde; bucatini carbonara with duck guanciale and duck eggs; pappardelle with Sunday gravy and beef cheeks; and suckling pig agrodolce.

David has also, in a more colloquial sense, played himself. “Curb” sends up his celebrity, rendering him a tetchy caricature whose showbiz success has granted him time enough at last to enjoy the pettier things in life. This “Larry” is a gadfly who goads others, and himself, into fits of rancor. Yet he’s also gregarious, the type for whom every car ride is an occasion to discuss, say, the serenity of gardeners or a possible link between the words “yoga” and “yogurt.” In “Curb,” discomfort has always been made tolerable by such frivolity, and by the knowing mischief of David’s performance. At its heart is the signature of David’s screen persona: his own irrepressible laughter. ",2024-02-07T10:01:54+0000

Still, my son and I have developed a loving relationship over texts and phone calls. (We live 3,000 miles apart.) So, I was thrilled to be invited to his stepson’s wedding — though also nervous, given his wife’s letter. My son assured me I would be seated with his siblings, but I was placed at a distant table with his friend. I was also excluded from a family outing and the photos posted on Facebook.

Until recently, upmarket lodging in the Italian capital usually meant an ostentatiously decorated pile meant to evoke the city’s 16th- and 17th-century palazzi, stuffed with gilded furniture and vague nostalgia. Over the past year or so, an entirely new breed of luxury hotel has emerged, one that pays tribute to the modernist architects who remade much of Rome in the Rationalist style in the early-to-mid-20th century. The Bulgari hotel, for example, opened last summer in a hulking 1930s government building designed by the prominent Trieste-born architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. And the Edition hotel moved into a bank partly attributed to Marcello Piacentini, the architect responsible for the EUR district, the neighborhood of massive edifices constructed under Mussolini. Other notable new offerings take their style cues from 21st-century Scandinavia, deftly blending northern design aesthetics with Italian Renaissance art and Roman artifacts.

us,Why We’re Living in an Age of Twins,"THE GREAT LOVE (or should I say, loves) of my preadolescent years in India was a pair of identical Danish twins. Charlotte and Christina were the most exotic things the British School in New Delhi had ever seen. They appeared like two beams of Nordic sunshine during those final days of India’s Socialist isolation in 1990 — blond, elfin, androgynous and (it has to be said) tantalizingly interchangeable. Charlotte was the extroverted one, impish, funny; Christina was quieter, a touch glacial. I was a Charlotte man, but went out briefly with Christina, which may have only meant a few slow dances to Guns N’ Roses’ 1991 hit “November Rain.” I was aware even then, at that age when so much is felt and so little articulated, of there being something compelling in giving my tween heart to one twin while going out with her double. Identical twins have it rough. As soon as we see them, fetishizing their likenesses and dissimilarities, we turn them into proxies for ideas. We revel in our ability to tell them apart, as if it were up to us to impart individuality unto them. We marvel at the sureness of our eye, treating them like human trompe l’oeils. We hardly stop to consider the actual reality of identical twins before extracting metaphorical power from them. There lies a chasm between biological fact and the captivating game of mirroring and doubling that we, as humans, love to play, where likeness has the inverse effect of drawing attention to deeper differences.",2024-02-12T10:00:50+0000

Removing the seafood factor, as in plant-based sushi, is a game changer. Creativity with often commonplace ingredients like carrots, lentils and coconut is required, and there are no rules. A fine example is this new omakase counter in the Sanctuary Hotel near Times Square. The setting is a library, its shelves lined with leather-bound, gilt-embossed volumes and knickknacks; the 10 seats at the polished wood counter are well upholstered with backs. It’s the work of SimpleVenue, the group that is responsible for the modestly priced, high-speed Sushi by Bou. Previously there was an Omakaseed in Plant Bar in NoMad. It closed, replaced by Trust Bae. The Omakaseed has now relocated to the hotel, where it offers an 11 course plant-based tasting for $60 and 15 courses for $100. Ryan Chon and Camdyn Healey are the chefs in charge. The items likely to be served on beautiful little plates, blocks of glass and the like will depend on seaweed “caviar,” charred king oyster mushrooms, tofu with chile crisp, smoked carrot tartare, udon noodles with miso, and shredded hearts of palm. On the drinks list are creative cocktails and more sake than wine. (Opens Wednesday).",2024-02-13T18:01:40+0000

Many of the busts are by unknown artists and share a common aesthetic: attenuated features and graceful lines. It’s no coincidence that Moralioglu — a purveyor of romantic silhouettes made from sumptuous fabrics — begins each design sketch with a face. “The pieces that I’m attracted to have a slight illustrative quality to them,” he says. “There’s a strange correlation between the way I draw and the way some of the busts look.”",2024-02-14T10:01:05+0000

They call their tapes “Sweded,” explaining the time it takes to supply films by claiming the copies have to be imported from Scandinavia. In Gondry’s fantasy, the community responds well to this homespun cinema: Not only does demand go up, but store patrons begin to participate in making the movies. Gondry’s theory, he has said, was that “people would enjoy films better if they shot them themselves.”",2024-02-14T10:02:32+0000

And in medieval and early modern Europe, when impure blood was believed to unbalance the humors of the body and cause disease, the creatures were seen as solicitous helpers, ever ready to relieve a patient of their unwelcome plasma. As the British medical historians Robert G.W. Kirk and Neil Pemberton wrote in their 2013 book, “Leech,” the worms were long celebrated as a gentle alternative to the lancet and became known, during the so-called leech mania of the early 19th century, as “the tools of the physician who cared.” In 1828, the French hospital system alone prescribed tens of millions of leeches, for conditions ranging from insomnia to smallpox.",2024-02-16T18:12:56+0000

us,The Wine Shop Millesima USA Doubles in Size for Its World-Class Selection,"Upon entering the new Millesima USA wine shop, relocated earlier this month from a few blocks uptown, you’re in a no-frills array of shelves, racks and bins in a well-lit windowed setting. Emphasizing Bordeaux, Burgundy and Italy, with other major regions, including Spain, the United States and Australia, represented as well, there are pedigreed bottles into the low three figures. But that’s before you step into the soaring circular central core of the store, like a Guggenheim rotunda of wine they’re calling the forum. Even if you’re not in the market for premier cru Burgundies, well-aged first-growth Bordeaux, tête de cuvée Champagnes and sought-after Italian wines priced into the thousands and stacked to the ceiling, it’s worth visiting this section to view it, like an oenophile tourist, as you might a collection of fine art. And they’re all for sale. Originally opened in 2006 by a family-owned company founded in Bordeaux in 1983, and which does most of its business online, it was successful as a neighborhood wine shop. Now, more than double the size, with a world-class inventory, and offering futures (an opportunity to reserve rare wines in advance), the Upper East Side store steps into the gaping carriage trade void left after the venerable Sherry-Lehmann Wine & Spirits sadly plummeted, then failed. As for the spirits side of the alcohol business, they only carry a token selection.",2024-02-20T16:14:18+0000

The bar, shelves and lockers throughout the place have restricted the spirits offerings mostly to those that are made from agave, like tequila and mezcal from Mexico, and sugar cane, mainly rums produced globally. Cachaça, another sugar cane spirit, is included. Marshall Minaya, a partner and the beverage director, and the head bartender, Carlos Kennedy-Lopez, worked to develop drinks to showcase the various spirits. The food is Mexican, by the chef Carmelo Calixto, and offers many of the usual suspects: guacamole, empanadas, tacos, enchiladas and carne asada.

us,Yoga and Energy Healing in a Former Hudson Valley Mansion,"When the Ranch at Malibu opened in 2010 as a luxury health resort on 200 acres in California’s Santa Monica Mountains, its approach was somewhat radical: Guests signed up for a full week of group hikes, fitness classes, spa treatments, nutrition consults and communal, organic meals without caffeine, gluten, soy or dairy. The goal, says its founder Alex Glasscock, was “for people to mentally and physically reset and recharge.” On April 15, a second location, the Ranch at Hudson Valley, is scheduled to open near Tuxedo Park, N.Y., in a slate-and-stone lakefront mansion surrounded by state parks. Glasscock hopes the 25-room property, which he describes as “like a big, luxury dorm,” will facilitate connections between those who stay. Guests will do yoga under the ornate plaster ceiling of the former ballroom and, in Glasscock’s ideal world, come to dinner in their pajamas and robes. This new outpost offers a few additional treatments including colonics and energy healings — which incorporate techniques such as hypnosis and sound therapy. In winter, guests can sled or snowshoe, and in summer there’s paddleboarding on the lake. The Ranch has also relaxed a few of the restrictions: You can book three nights at the Hudson Valley property instead of the seven required in Malibu, and, in concession to the most common request of all, caffeine is no longer taboo — organic Nicaraguan coffee is served at breakfast in both locations. Reservations open Feb. 21; rooms from $3,280 per person for three nights including accommodations, meals and programming; theranchhudsonvalley.com.",2024-02-22T14:00:26+0000

us,A Watch With an Irresistible Tick,"Time ticks by silently but, in the arcane universe of mechanical watches, sound is the ultimate achievement. While chiming clocks were pioneered in the 1600s, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that the apparatus was perfected in miniature. Squeezing in the more than 100 additional components necessary to have a modern-style wristwatch strike with pinpoint accuracy and rich, clear peals — each watch sounds subtly different — is considered the height of horological craft, and most companies abandoned such complex models long ago. But a few holdouts continue to make such timepieces. Among them is Omega, whose new numbered-edition Speedmaster marries the Swiss brand’s stopwatch chronograph feature with a minute repeater, enabling wearers to press a button that triggers a series of tones to signal the minutes, tens of seconds and seconds. The unique combination, housed in an 18-karat gold case with an aventurine dial and rose guilloche subdials, is arrestingly beautiful while ringing every bell.

The expansion of government-subsidized housing loans meant that cheap space was also easy to come by, as New York had a then-ample stock of residential and industrial buildings. In the following decades, which saw the birth of Abstract Expressionism, followed by Pop Art, followed by minimalism — all locally grown movements — the city also became the capital of what we now call the art world, a multibillion-dollar, mostly unregulated global economy of galleries, auction houses and fairs that has grown without interruption through wars, recessions and two pandemics.",2024-02-26T10:03:03+0000

us,A Designer’s Endlessly Versatile Clothes,"Growing up in North London, Charlie Constantinou was a serious piano student who aspired to a career as a composer. But when, as a teenager, he landed a part-time job at a sneaker store, he became enamored with avant-garde streetwear by designers such as Jun Takahashi of Undercover and Nasir Mazhar — the latter of whom, like Constantinou, is a member of the city’s tight-knit Cypriot community. Soon, Constantinou was dreaming up a collection of his own. The creative process, says the Tottenham-based 25-year-old, felt surprisingly familiar: “It’s very much about world building; I get the same feeling from composition.” After studying design at London’s Central Saint Martins, he launched his namesake brand in 2022 when the influential retailers Ssense and H. Lorenzo bought pieces from his master’s degree collection. In the short time since, he’s developed a clearly defined style informed by both ancient history (spiral motifs taken from Cypriot ceramics) and futurism (astronaut-style boots), expressed largely through the use of quilted expandable nylon, a high-tech version of the textile that can stretch and contract to a dramatic degree. He’s drawn to the crinkly look of the fabric, and to the fact that it can accommodate a wide variety of body types: Many of his pieces are one size fits all and, while billed as men’s wear, are meant for people of all genders.",2024-02-27T10:00:35+0000

And the spiny iguanas that look so at home among the tropical shrubs are in fact invasive, descendants of pets imported from South America in the 1960s; sometimes in the winter, they fall frozen from trees, landing on car windshields. Indeed, Miami often seems engaged in a battle against its own wild, swampy environs — a conflict that plays out with growing urgency in the city’s architecture.

For his spring 1999 collection, he reinterpreted the look of Ali MacGraw’s character, the pool-lounging daughter of wealthy parents, in the 1969 film “Goodbye, Columbus,” inaugurating hooded anorak dresses and introducing playful giraffe spots, a new iteration of his signature animal prints. “I’m always searching for the perfect balance of timelessness and excitement,” the designer says.",2024-02-28T10:01:00+0000

us,Why Are Grapes Suddenly Everywhere?,"Grapes have been associated with pleasure since ancient times, a symbol of Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry. These days, clusters of plummy Concords, oval autumn royals and dusky kyohos are decorating dinner tables, doubling as cornucopian decorations and low-effort snacks. “You can get a beautiful, imperfect drip and drape from grapes,” says the interior stylist Colin King, 35, who overflowed a marble urn with abundant mounds of them for the launch of his furniture collection, a collaboration with the Future Perfect, in New York this past fall. Although he uses green grapes for daytime parties, for evening events he prefers the “moody, sensual vibe” of dark varieties — like the attenuated, oblong moon drops that the artist Laila Gohar, 35, mixed with red globes and flames to form an edible monolith for the recent opening of the Essentiel Antwerp clothing store in New York. The chef Mina Stone, 42 — who runs Mina’s, the cafe at MoMA PS1 in Queens, and is a go-to caterer for art gallery dinners — favors Thomcords, a sweet, seedless hybrid she often serves with dessert to “provide heft and a colorful backdrop” for daintier confections. She also likes to roast grapes alongside seared duck breast. In London, the pastry chef Claire Ptak, the owner of Violet bakery, offers what she calls fragolina cupcakes, named for the fragola (Italian for “strawberry”) grapes that she cooks down, then purées and adds to the buttercream frosting. The fragolas “taste like a berryish Concord,” says Ptak, 49, who tops each cake with a small cluster of fruit. The frosted treats “transport you back to childhood when you take the first bite,” she says, “and then you realize they’re also very grown-up.” — Lauren Joseph",2024-02-28T10:01:51+0000

That was where her parents were born, and for her, the idea of a Palestinian home had become a lodestar. In 1988, when she was 15 and protesters had taken to the streets to challenge Israeli occupation in what would become known as the first intifada, she told a local news reporter in Northern California, where she lived at the time, that if she were there, she, too, would be throwing stones at the tanks. “I would feel obligated,” she said. The news segment portrayed Tamara as being “caught between two worlds” — an American one, in which she rehearsed “Bye Bye Birdie” at school, and a Palestinian one, in which she spoke Arabic and struggled to reach relatives back home. She finally moved to the West Bank in 2005, as the region teetered on a precarious peace.

The experience has been on the actor’s mind recently as he finishes his forthcoming memoir, a mix of stories, anecdotes and poems scheduled to come out this fall. In a recently completed essay, he describes chasing a flock of sheep with two of his children when they were young on Scotland’s remote Isle of Skye. (His son, Trevor, and eldest daughter, Eden, both from his first marriage to the actress Alice Adair, are now 36 and 31.) To their horror, one of the fleeing animals broke its back. “It’s about what had to transpire for the next hour,” says Brolin, 56, from his writing hut in Malibu, Calif., a gift from his wife of nearly eight years, the photographer Kathryn Boyd Brolin, 37, who modeled it after ones used by the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. “It’s the clearest, most emotional thing I’ve written.”",2024-02-29T10:01:06+0000

In the 1970s, Alejandro Jodorowsky was thwarted in his attempt to turn his elaborate vision into cinematic reality. In 1984, David Lynch was forced to cram volumes of lore into two hours, and the result was an ugly-beautiful disaster. In the latest foray, Denis Villeneuve has created an engrossing, believable world, smartly dividing the first book in the series into two parts. “Dune: Part One” was a critical and box office hit when it was released in 2021, and now “Part Two,” which opens in theaters nationwide on Friday, is poised to pick up where the last film left off.

There will be highlights, analysis, commentary and, depending on when you tune in, maybe a funny bit. (On Mondays, he and his sidekick, Stanford Steve, deliver “Bad Beats,” a Letterman-style compilation of the plays behind the week’s most brutal gambling losses — the meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer that busted bettors on the “under,” the late fumble and pointless touchdown that prevented the winning team from “covering.”) Van Pelt likes to say that he just tries to be himself on air. If we take him at his word about that, it’s safe to say that he is thoughtful, wry, self-aware and occasionally sentimental. Also, that he is not aggressive, obnoxious or particularly opinionated, which makes him a rarity among today’s sports-media personalities.",2024-02-29T10:03:44+0000

Today Criterion uses the closet as its stockroom, housing films by some 600 directors from more than 50 countries — a catalog so synonymous with cinematic achievement that it has come to function as a kind of film Hall of Fame.

This Exhibition Has an Idea,"The Hawaii-born artist Toshiko Takaezu was known for her ceramic works that redefined the genre with their “closed forms,” as she called them — sealed vessels whose hidden interior spaces were meant to activate the imagination. Next month, Takaezu’s life and work will be the focus of a major retrospective at the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City, Queens. “Toshiko Takaezu: Worlds Within” will present over 150 pieces from private and public collections around the country, co-curated by the art historian Glenn Adamson, the museum curator Kate Wiener and the composer and sound artist Leilehua Lanzilotti. (A 368-page monograph, published in collaboration with Yale University Press, will accompany the exhibition.) Visitors will be able to see a collection that spans seven decades of Takaezu’s career, from her early student work in Hawaii in the 1940s to immersive, monumental ceramic forms she produced in the late 1990s to early 2000s. “Takaezu was also a weaver and painter, and often constructed multimedia installations where her ceramics, textiles and paintings operated together,” says Wiener. To play off this idea, the curators organized the show chronologically, incorporating each of these media into various sections, inspired by Takaezu’s own installations. Sound will also play a role. In her ceramic pieces, Takaezu would often place a dried fragment of clay within her closed form vessels, creating a musical rattle. For this exhibit, Lanzilotti (a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in music) has developed a series of videos offering insight into the sonic elements of Takaezu’s work — and visitors can hear those rattles firsthand via an interactive display.
