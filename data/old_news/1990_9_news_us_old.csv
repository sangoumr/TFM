In 1939, David Sarnoff of RCA, a pioneer in the development of the television industry, hailed the infant medium as ''a new art so important in its implications that it is bound to affect all society.'' As J. Fred MacDonald sees it, television has indeed affected American society in the intervening half-century, but not in the way its more idealistic proponents had foreseen. ''One Nation Under Television'' is largely the story of how a noble dream - the notion of network television as a tool for education and enlightenment - has been corrupted by corporate greed, Government indifference, programmers eager to pander to the lowest common denominator and viewers more interested in being tranquilized than in being challenged. Today, he notes, the networks' longstanding dominance of the airwaves is being dramatically eroded by the growth of cable and home video - and, perhaps, by the audience's growing indifference to what they have to offer. Mr. MacDonald, a professor of history at Northeastern Illinois University and the author of several previous books on broadcasting, has a fascinating story to tell, and he has amassed a prodigious amount of information. But he is more skillful as a researcher than as a storyteller; his prose tends to be dry and lackluster. And by attempting to recount the 50-year history of network television in 335 pages, Mr. MacDonald leaves himself little room for treating any aspect of his story in depth. He jumps so quickly from subject to subject that reading ''One Nation Under Television'' eventually becomes as unsatisfying as watching the tube in the company of a compulsive channel-changer.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

The authors contend that outmoded state laws, and a system of Federal entitlements that funnels water to farmers at prices substantially below market value come monsoon or drought, breed waste and shortages. With fully three-quarters of Westerners living in urban areas, can the region afford to continue allowing 80 percent to 90 percent of its available water to go to agriculture, especially when it is used to irrigate pasturage and low-value crops like alfalfa? Joining a chorus of experts, the authors assert that the equation should be balanced by making water subject to market forces. Allowing water to rise to its highest economic use, they say, would benefit the environment as well as cities, since the value of rivers, lakes and wetlands, in terms of tourism and recreation dollars, would have to be factored in. Although ''Overtapped Oasis'' goes a long way toward simplifying byzantine material, it ultimately bogs down in legal intricacies. The analysis also occasionally operates at cross-purposes. Mr. Reisner and Ms. Bates advocate gradual reform of legal codes, yet, in their criticisms of the current system, they underscore the need for more radical change.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Well, said President Bush, who can handle such matters better than John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff? So there was Mr. Sununu in the Kremlin last week, ostensibly carrying out a scheduled visit to help Soviet leaders organize ''paper flow'' and the like. But when word of the Sept. 9 Bush-Gorbachev summit came yesterday, speculation was rife in Washington on what part Mr. Sununu played in setting it up. The White House was sketchy on his role, but one news report said that a trip that had been viewed as signaling ''a diminished role for Mr. Sununu'' now seemed to be ''a diplomatic success'' that would make him ''the toast of the town.''",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Imagine being the star of a so-so cable television sitcom that's taped in the same studio where ''The Honeymooners'' was shot back in the 1950's. To Sandy Bayard, the narrator of Tom Leopold's second novel, ''that's like doing spin art in Picasso's house.'' Sandy can't help it if he's a jerk, but at least he'd like a little credit for being the first to admit it. Always quick to try for a laugh with his inexhaustible reservoir of pained sarcasm, he's a fast talker with a ''guilty, glass-jaw heart'' who's plagued by fear of monogamy (''Relationship jail!'') and the nagging suspicion that maybe he's not such a nice person after all. Unfortunately, before ''Somebody Sing'' has got very far, its readers will be inclined to agree with Sandy's darkest fears: his manic patter soon wears paper thin, exposing the needy, self-hating character behind the comic mask. Describing his long-suffering girlfriend and his childhood nanny, a poor black woman in need of open-heart surgery, Sandy reveals a distasteful penchant for sexual and racial stereotyping, all supposedly in the name of humor. While his backward attitudes may indeed reflect a troublesome strain in today's comedy, this does not make the sentiments he expresses any less offensive. No matter how many goofy turns the plot takes, it can't shake the phony ring of that faux-sensitive narrative voice. By the time Sandy reaches his personal epiphany at the novel's end, he has long since exhausted the patience of his audience.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

These spare, poetic stories were written during the 25 years that Stanislaw Benski was director of a Warsaw nursing home whose elderly residents included some of the last of Poland's Jews. Many of the 16 stories, deftly translated by Walter Arndt, are set in the nursing home; all tell of the anguish of surviving the Holocaust, of the struggle to recreate a life while tormented by memories. Benski (who died in 1988) reveals his characters' pain quietly. In ''The Tzaddik's Grandson,'' a woman named Rose, upon seeing a baby, says, ''I had three children. Three wonderful boys. By now I could have had grandchildren.'' In ''On the Corner,'' blind Abram visits the Warsaw district where he lived before the war, lovingly describing it as his friend Haskiel leads the way; Haskiel does not have the heart to tell him that his familiar landmarks have vanished, that nothing of the old neighborhood remains. In ''Missing Pieces,'' we also learn of a hunchback who saves a Jewish family by hiding them in a trench under his latrine; a widow who takes in a crippled Jewish girl who has jumped from a Treblinka-bound transport; a policeman who risks visiting a young Jewish woman sequestered in a windowless attic, making her realize that ''one could be glad of something after all, that one could miss another human being, that one could dream pleasurable dreams.'' Then there is the guilt-ridden Jewish couple in the title story, who spent the war outside Europe but decide to write new histories for themselves as if they, too, had known the horrors of the German occupation and the camps. I finished this book in one sitting, moved by the characters' tragic experiences, yet coming to know them as people with a full complement of human strengths and weaknesses.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

us,  Married to the Beats,"OFF THE ROAD: My Years With Cassady, Kerouac, and Ginsberg. By Carolyn Cassady. (Morrow, $22.95.) In August 1947, 24-year-old Carolyn Robinson found her boyfriend, Neal Cassady, naked in bed with his estranged wife and his friend Allen Ginsberg. The next year - on April Fool's Day - she married Cassady, and she spent the next 20 years amid the neurotic heroes of the Beat Generation. In ''Off the Road,'' Ms. Cassady confessionally chronicles their weird and wild escapades, which involved promiscuity, jail sentences and haphazard careers, as well as experimentation with marijuana, hashish, LSD and peyote. In 1952, Jack Kerouac moved into the Cassadys' New York City apartment. While still married to Neal, Ms. Cassady had an affair with Kerouac and became, in the words of Allen Ginsberg, Jack's ''Ideal Mother Image, Madwoman, chick and ignu.'' (''The last word,'' the poet explained, ''means a special honorary type post-hip intellectual. Its main root is ignoramus.'') While living with the Cassadys, Kerouac finished writing ''On the Road,'' which immortalized Cassady in the character of Dean Moriarty. The Cassadys eventually divorced, and Neal Cassady died in 1968, at the age of 43. Nearly two years later, at the age of 47, Kerouac died. This sometimes pathetic story culminates with one of Cassady's other wives calling Carolyn for Neal's ashes, then deciding to bury them in Kerouac's grave. Ms. Cassady, passive to the end, agrees to the odd request. Unfortunately, the author offers very little insight into her masochism and self-destructive tendencies. It's hard to swallow her portrayal of herself as a victimized good girl among the bad-boy beatniks and their harem. Still, ''Off the Road'' is rich with gossip, historically significant photographs, intimate memories, unpublished letters and - alas - bad poetry from the Beats.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

Designing devices to withstand such blows has always been compromised by the inability of man-made tools to mimic natural electric fields, which have as much as 100 million volts. Now the Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., has developed a lightning simulator that can simulate an extremely severe cloud-to-ground direct strike. It can deliver current to a large test object with peak power and speed very close to the most extreme levels found in natural lightning. The Sandia lightning simulator relies on a proprietary ''crowbar'' switch, which evolved from the lab's fusion power program. The switch is filled with sulphur hexafluoride gas to hold off the high voltage and is triggered by a laser pulse.",1990-09-02T05:00:00+0000

A stubby little trio near the end, with arms crooking into right-angled frames, was interesting but seemed somehow out of place. But ''Repeater'' is an engaging, satisfying piece. It is dedicated to the memory of Philip Salvatori, a charming and witty Martha Graham dancer who died in 1987. It is clear that Mr. Good has been influenced by Mr. Cunningham's style of dance. But he uses that style as a springboard rather than a crutch in ''Repeater'' and in ''Spry Dave,'' a trio performed in silence. There is a look of arbitrariness to the way the two dances are plotted. There is a tinge of comedy to the ''Spry Dave'' trio, whose dancers assume some quietly eccentric shapes.

Rather, they underscore a view of the world as a highly precarious place, where the arc of a life may be suddenly and irrevocably altered by a random occurrence, where happiness and domestic calm are highly provisional - subject to accidents, bad luck, unexpected passions and unforeseen twists of fate. An idealistic man befriends a crazed, homeless man, then realizes that his act of good will has awakened fears and resentments in his wife and son (''Shelter''). A 12-year-old boy accompanies his older brother and his girlfriend to a lake where a car has fallen through the ice, and he has a glimpse of the perils and uncertainties of the grown-up world that awaits him (''Snow''). A woman who realizes that she loves her husband's best friend develops an irrational fear of prowlers that keeps her awake at night.",1990-09-04T05:00:00+0000

If the writer has been in a good position to observe the process at close range, or has even come close enough to want to flee, so much the better. The protagonist of Mr. McMurtry's ''Some Can Whistle'' has made it so big in television that he can afford to retire back to Texas. In any case, the appeal of Hollywood as a lively backdrop and a prime source of raw material has never been greater. And we've obviously come a long way since F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Last Tycoon.'' Ms. Rossner, whose novel ''His Little Women'' has a narrator whose father was once the head of a movie studio, refers to ''the romance that has made Hollywood America's Buckingham Palace, those stars our kings and queens.'' But show business looks a lot less rosy when seen through the eyes of a tough guy like Spenser, Mr. Parker's Boston-based private eye. In ''Stardust,'' Spenser is hired to protect a television star named Jill Joyce, and if Mr. Parker's portrait of Jill as a feisty, wine-guzzling nymphomaniac lacks any verisimilitude, his feeling for on-the-set ambiance during location shooting is dead-on.",1990-09-05T05:00:00+0000

Money: The $8-a-barrel rise in oil prices since the invasion, combined with the two-million-barrel-a-day increase in production by the emirates and the Saudis, means added profit to them of $3 billion a month, a third of that from the U.S. alone. That windfall should be for protection, not profiteering; all money generated by the blockade of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil should be escrowed in the Overthrow-Saddam Fund. 2. Arab participation: The states to benefit most from the realignment of the Arab world are Egypt, our ally, and Syria, our bedfellow. Cairo should put 50,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia soon if it wants to assume Arab leadership; Damascus should mass its 4,000 tanks on its Iraqi border to force Mr. Hussein to split his forces. 3. European troops: Turkey, a NATO member, has a long border with Iraq. NATO forces should be moved quickly from facing the Soviets to NATO's southern flank to face its new military-economic threat. Ships, planes and French tokenism are not enough; unless NATO nations are willing to put soldiers on the new front line, the U.S. will speed its NATO drawdown. 4. Soviet double-gaming: Mr. Bush should tell Mr. Gorbachev to choose sides. A thousand Russians are even now teaching Iraqi troops how to use the most modern Soviet equipment to kill Americans; not only should they be withdrawn forthwith, but the largest army in the world should participate actively in the world police action.",1990-09-06T05:00:00+0000

One example is an adult child who resists a parent's move to a new community because the child would not be able to ''take care of'' the parent in an emergency.",1990-09-06T05:00:00+0000

That Mr. Quinton, in his own way, creates a memorable Marguerite is good news, not only for the revival, but for the Ridiculous Theatrical Company's future. Though not perfect, the production proves once and for all that Ludlam created a style that was not ultimately dependent on his flamboyant, brilliant presence both on the stage and behind the scenes - a style that, for all its extravagance, seems both enduring and surprisingly malleable. As much as Mr. Quinton has learned from Ludlam, the kind of energy he gives off when performing is quite different. Where Ludlam invented an insouciant camp style of physical caricature that crackled with a maniacal spontaneity, Mr. Quinton, using the same vocabulary, imparts an air of considered, classical precision. Mr. Quinton's air of underlying austerity - the sense that his every gesture, right down to the twitch of an eyebrow and the curl of a cherry-red lip, is not wasted - lends a very different tone to this production.",1990-09-07T05:00:00+0000

Less self-consciously literary than his previous works, ''East Is East'' uses its author's hyperkinetic language and gift for wild invention to create a rollicking, old-fashioned tale full of cartoony heroes and villains and deliciously satiric incidents. It's a pastoral version of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' peopled with dumb rednecks, scheming litterateurs, dotty Southern aristocrats and one Mishima-obsessed sailor from Japan. That sailor, Hiro Tanaka by name, has fled Japan in search of his American father - a bearded, long-haired hippie who had a brief fling with Hiro's Japanese mother before heading back to the States. Mocked as a half-breed in Japan, Hiro dreams of joining America's melting pot. He feels that ''he had to blend in with the masses, find himself a job, an apartment with Western furniture and Japanese appliances, with toaster ovens and end tables and deep, thick woolly carpets that climbed up the walls like a surging tide. Then he'd be safe, then he could play miniature golf and eat cheeseburgers or stroll down the street with an armload of groceries and no one would blink twice.''",1990-09-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Review/Art;   De Kooning: Masterworks From a Master Painter,"The one major chapter of de Kooning's career missing from the show is the celebrated series of black-and-white paintings from the late 1940's, perhaps the grittiest and most metaphysical works de Kooning has done. William O'Reilly, a co-director of the gallery, said he wanted paintings from this series but could not borrow them (many are fragile). Without them, de Kooning appears more pastoral than urban, with a voluptuousness, a feeling for the lewd, unexpected (and sometimes unwanted) presence and for the improbable juxtaposition that is commonplace in the pastoral tradition. For Salander O'Reilly, which has never before done a de Kooning show, this selective mini-retrospective serves several purposes. This is primarily a painting gallery, and de Kooning is a very good argument for the unceasing necessity of painting. In addition, the show will help the gallery, which represents contemporary abstract painters for whom the medium of painting is the message, to present contemporary figurative work: few artists have explored and tested the language of painting more exhaustively than de Kooning, whose figurative inspiration has remained intact.",1990-09-07T05:00:00+0000

His works betray the influence of artists like Gerrit van Honthorst, although it is an accomplishment of this exhibition to make clear that the relationship between Wright and the Northern Caravaggist painters has been overemphasized. Links can also be forged between Wright's sharply outlined figures and those in the works of Jacques Louis David. ''Widow of an Indian Chief,'' for instance, suggests that he was familiar with David's ''Oath of the Horatii.'' Perhaps most distinctively, during a century in which painters were largely defined by their work in a single genre, like portraiture or landscape, Wright seemed to move easily among a variety of genres. The same artist whose ''Arkwright's Cotton Mills at Night'' has been interpreted - perhaps optimistically - as a celebration of modernity and the Industrial Revolution also painted the Gothic adaptation of an Aesop fable, ''The Old Man and Death.''",1990-09-07T05:00:00+0000

As a subplot, two of the cattiest members of the club try to palm off their daughters on a couple of Wall Street dealers. Widows, wealthy or poor, deserve better than this.

In a 1935 memoir, ''In the Shadow of Liberty: The Chronicle of Ellis Island,'' he recalled the trip from ship to the island: ''During this ride across the bay, as I watched the faces of the people milling about me, I realized that Ellis Island could inspire both hope and fear. Some of the passengers were afraid and obviously dreading the events of the next few hours; others were impatient, anxious to get through the inspection and be off to their destinations. I have never forgotten the scene.'' Fiorello H. La Guardia, American-born of Italian parents, was an interpreter at Ellis Island in 1907, at the beginning of an adult life that was to see him become Mayor of New York City. In his autobiography, ''The Making of an Insurgent,'' he describes the process from a different perspective: ''The work on the island was difficult and strenuous. For two years we worked seven days a week, for immigration was very heavy at this time. All of us were glad, however, to have the jobs, despite the long hours and tiring tasks. Immigrants were pouring in at the average rate of 5,000 a day, and it was a constant grind from the moment we got into our uniforms early in the morning until the last minute before we left on the 5:30 boat in the evening . . . The immigration laws were rigidly enforced, and there were many heartbreaking scenes on Ellis Island. I never managed during the three years I worked there to become callous to the mental anguish, the disappointment and the despair I witnessed almost daily. Some of the employees did become callous to the suffering after a while, but on the whole they were a hardworking lot, conscientious and loyal.'' In 1923, Henry H. Curran, a literate New York political figure, became Commissioner of Immigration for the Port of New York.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"The stated goal of these essays - to replace the received wisdom, or lack thereof, about the human mind with new metaphors - is a noble one. Too often, however, the thinking is fuzzy and confined by the myopic vision of the author's particular discipline. Few of the ideas are illuminating or original, although some have the virtue of being bizarre. The neurophysiologist William H. Calvin suggests the brain is a ''Darwin Machine'' that is ''mimicking biological evolution on a greatly accelerated time scale, creating new thoughts rather than new species.'' It is not clear whether he thinks this proposition constitutes a useful scientific theory. The philosopher Daniel C. Dennett recognizes the need for testable hypotheses. He offers a number of them having to do with the genesis, function and mechanism of the mind. What is missing is the hard task of translating hypotheses into experimental agendas. Indeed, what is lacking throughout this volume is a serious effort to lay down ground rules for what a useful new metaphor of the brain must accomplish. Let me suggest a few of the more obvious: a successful metaphor must reconcile all observed brain processes, from the biological to the psychological; it must pose testable hypotheses for currently unexplainable phenomena; and it must frame a research program by which one can probe the metaphor's validity. These are not trivial demands. Any attempt to invent a new scientific metaphor for the brain must satisfy them. Otherwise, it is not iconoclasm but merely mysticism.",1990-09-09T05:00:00+0000

She wanted a sabbatical from her job and family responsibilities - time to look, think, feel, keep a journal, draw, make collages and enjoy time with her mother, a painter, and her father, a composer. She explored the countryside, went to local markets, visited a Cistercian abbey, attended a wine festival, a circus and various fetes. She met interesting people, among them Lizzie Napoli, a book illustrator from Paris who owned and summered in a tiny roulotte, or gypsy cart, decorated in bright colors with a curtain of beads and pale-pink scalloped awnings. She was invited to the art historian John Rewald's house, The Citadel, where sketches by some of his favorite Impressionists hung on the walls. Ms. Niles gives snippets of the area's history and describes local customs and characters. Her book, illustrated with the author's amusing line drawings, is charming and intelligent; she can make you taste an oily olive and a sun-dried tomato, smell the rosemary and picture sunflowers and a rugged, stony terrain.

Still a very popular way to spend an evening, movies on cassette are no longer the rage they were in the 80's. These days the industry must work harder to hold the public's interest. In most video specialty stores, the priority is nourishing the rental trade. At the big studios, the plan is to supply the market with scores of titles, new and old, to sell to consumers at prices that in some cases have gone below $15 and might be headed still lower. (Both ''Pretty Woman'' and ''Total Recall'' should rent well, of course, but at $19.99 and $24.99 respectively, they will enter stores priced to sell.) On another front, the industry, like other arts-related enterprises, warily eyes would-be censors in states and localities where restrictive regulations are contemplated. (One forthcoming release may have nothing to do with censorship per se, but perhaps it's symbolic of new sensibilities. While video commonly restores X-rated material cut from movies for their theater runs, Vidmark has cut a sizable chunk from the previously unrated film ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' due Oct. 17, so that the film could be given an R rating for its video release. Vidmark will also bring out an unrated version.) Whatever the issues, a video season comes down to titles.

Though there was a fair amount of soloing - Mr. Ribot is a decent guitarist who breaks his lines up with big intervallic jumps - the improvisations were always less important than the group interplay, and the overall texture of the music blurred the distinction between the foreground of the soloist and the background of the rhythm section. Occasionally Mr. Ribot sang or talked - he talked through an ironic, jokey version of Jimi Hendrix's ''Wind Cried Mary'' - and like the sampled noises coming from Mr. Coleman's keyboards, or the toy xylophone and whistles Mr. Byron played, his voice was just another sound added to the thick mix of the group.

At the heart of the issue is the huge budget shortfall, which state budget officials say may reach $800 million next spring, in a budget of just over $7 billion.

He was wounded while leading the assault on Quebec, the strongest fortress on the continent. Although his forces withdrew and Canada remained British, the attack so alarmed the British Government that it took the largest force of regulars dispatched across the Atlantic and sent almost half of them to Quebec. By draining off the British soldiery, the ultimate result would be the most decisive American victory of the war, at Saratoga. But before the war was over, Arnold changed sides and sold out to the British. After his treason, his effigy was paraded through the streets of Philadelphia. ''Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor'' is a why-done-it. The hero turns out to be a little worse as a man, and a little better as a soldier, than his reputation. In the course of the story, the reader learns a good deal about the Revolutionary War and how close the ragtag American army came to defeat. For Benedict Arnold was not the only traitor, deserter or summer soldier under General Washington's command.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ORIGINS: The Lives and Worlds of Modern Cosmologists. By Alan Lightman and Roberta Brawer. (Harvard University, $29.95). Of all the sciences, cosmology cuts closest to the emotional bone, daring a scientific answer to the kinds of questions children wonder about: How far does the world go? Does time have a beginning or an end? ''Cosmic questions start inside,'' say Alan Lightman, a professor of science and writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Roberta Brawer, a graduate student there. Armed with a tape recorder, they sought out 27 cosmologists and asked them about their childhoods, philosophical preferences and personal reactions to recent developments in their field. There is a lot to talk about. Emboldened by the discovery of faint radio waves lingering from the putative big bang with which the universe began, astronomers and particle physicists have joined forces in the last few years and succeeded in unraveling a plausible history of the universe back to the first fiery picosecond of recorded time. Yet so much remains unexplained, the voices in this book remind us over and over, that the entire edifice often seems to teeter one datum point from disgrace. The subjects, who include astronomers, physicists, observers, theorists and even one nonbeliever in the big bang - Fred Hoyle - come across as a friendly, if driven, bunch (most had settled on science before adolescence and have never looked back) and disarmingly frank about the uncertainties and pitfalls in the cosmic quest. Margaret Geller, whose maps of the universe have helped subvert several cherished theories, says: ''I think it's hard in this field to really have the courage of your convictions. You have to have a sense of humor about it because the likelihood of ever being right is so low.'' General readers may struggle with a crisp scientific summary that is as unrelenting as it is lucid, and they may be exasperated when the authors, who are physicists, cut off juicy reminiscences to return to the drier parts of their agenda. However, ''Origins'' should prove invaluable to scholars, journalists and perhaps novelists who want to launch their own investigations of how we came to think of the world as we do.",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Sawallisch (pronounced suh-VAHL-ish), who is 67 years old, first appeared with the orchestra as a guest conductor in 1966. He said he plans to continue living in his native Munich, where he is the general director of the Bavarian State Opera, although he will give up that post. In appearances in the United States, he has often conducted works by recent West German composers. He said he also would like to explore American ones, but described his tastes as very conservative, warning, ''I am not a friend of extremely contemporary music, with electronic sounds and so on.''",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss Australia ended Monday, had successfully executed a solo and then jumped in tandem with a member of the Bungee Bats, a group that arranged public jumps. Both jumpers were treated for neck and back injuries. The ban will remain until a report can be completed on the accident. Theoretically, the jumpers were to leap from a cage secured to a crane suspended over water, the cords attached to their ankles stopping them a couple of yards short of the water. Safety checks had included a weigh-in and a match of the cords' tensile strength to the couple's combined weight.

us,  The French Collection,"CONFESSIONS OF A LITERARY ARCHAEOLOGIST. By Carlton Lake. (New Directions, $21.95.) The sight of rich, green leather bindings and gold-lettered type scrolled across the spine of a book makes Carlton Lake ecstatic. He positively gushes if the book also happens to be a first edition of Baudelaire's prose work ''Les Paradis Artificiels,'' which, in one instance, it was. Mr. Lake, a private collector and the executive curator of the Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, dived into his avocation while living in Paris in the 1950's. From then on, he focused his collecting energies on French literature and art. ''Confessions of a Literary Archaeologist'' is well stocked with intriguing anecdotes of his searches high and low for special and rare books, letters and manuscripts. In the course of relating his discoveries, Mr. Lake not only opens up the relatively closed door of the French rare-book trade, but also discloses both gossipy and scholarly information about many French cultural heroes, including Paul Valery, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Jean Cocteau. Writing with a sure and eloquent hand, Mr. Lake provides, often by quoting from actual documents, character-revealing information otherwise unknown to the general public. For example, in letters written by Toulouse-Lautrec's mother, one sees a leaden maternal hand that, Mr. Lake opines, may not have been obvious in biographies of the artist. Cocteau, ever the controversial cult figure, grows more outrageous as Mr. Lake describes the sword - custom-made from Cartier, with a profile of Oedipus's head - Cocteau carried during his induction ceremony into the French Academy. Readers will be lured by such amusing and plentiful details throughout this charming book.",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: A Life of Hardball. By Dick Williams and Bill Plaschke. (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $19.95.) Dick Williams managed six teams for a total of 21 years in the major leagues, winning 1,571 games (13th on the all-time list), taking three different franchises to the World Series and winning the baseball writers' Manager of the Year award three times. Four times he took over teams with losing histories and performed dramatic turnarounds. He fought, screamed, heckled umpires and opponents and probably, if such things could be determined, would be found to have kicked more dirt and made more lasting enemies than any other manager. Compared with Dick Williams, Billy Martin was a mere brat and Earl Weaver was Gandhi. Not the least of the charms of Mr. Williams's memoir, ''No More Mr. Nice Guy,'' is his refreshing refusal to rewrite history. Mr. Williams, now retired, is quite willing to acknowledge that he was, in the words of a former player, ''arrogant, brash and a pain.'' In his reply, Mr. Williams says, ''I always defend the truth.'' Being so candid about himself, he feels free to savage just about every baseball legend he has met. Speaking of his celebrated former teammates on the Brooklyn Dodgers, Mr. Williams writes, ''Many of those Boys of Summer weren't really boys but mean-spirited men filled with conceit.'' Mr. Williams even managed to fight with mascots, once threatening to assault the Philly Phanatic. Curiously, the one man you might expect Mr. Williams to blast - the irascible Charlie Finley, former owner of the Oakland A's - comes off comparatively well: ''While Charlie may have been a demon, he was a champion.'' Perhaps Mr. Williams saw a front-office version of himself. Not surprisingly, ''No More Mr. Nice Guy,'' written with the Los Angeles Times sportswriter Bill Plaschke, is great baseball reading; the 1967 pennant year of the Boston Red Sox and the string of championships in the early 70's with the A's are recalled in vivid detail. But the real kick of the book is the nearly constant fussin' and feudin'. ''When a fight is over,'' Mr. Williams says, ''it's over. I'll forgive. I just don't forget.'' His book demonstrates that he hasn't forgotten much that is worth remembering.",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

A vasectomy seemed the least I could do. In the waiting room, we filled out our reproductive short form. ''How many pregnancies have you had?'' ''How many children do you have?'' Besides our two daughters, there had been the cry of pain from the upstairs bathroom six weeks into my wife's second pregnancy. I had sprinted into the room and joined Shoshana, who was more upset than injured. We stood together at the toilet, staring down at a small, discrete pool of blood. Worse still was a pregnancy a year later that ended when a routine sonogram showed a great plume of matter spilling out of a gap in the fetal skull.

His inexpressiveness is eloquent: the poetry of strong emotion trapped in confused and disintegrating times. Yet he longs for things to be other than they are. He yearns, in fact, for tender connection. Just behind the leanness and coolness of the prose lies the open - but doomed - expectation that romantic love saves.

When digital recording and the compact disk came along, consumers were expected to change buying habits of three decades, throw out their ''obsolete'' LP's and completely rebuild their collections. It's amazing how quickly that happened. But serious collectors find themselves in a quandary: which if any LP should be discarded when a duplicate CD is released?",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE BANANA WARS: A History of United States Military Intervention in Latin America From the Spanish-American War to the Invasion of Panama. By Ivan Musicant. (Macmillan, $24.95.) Ivan Musicant's military history of selected United States interventions in Central and South America is awkwardly written but painstakingly researched. Mr. Musicant, a former Marine whose previous books include ''Battleship at War'' and ''U.S. Armored Cruisers,'' is particularly thorough in describing ships, surf conditions and military tactics. Too thorough, in fact. He buries us in detail; the replacement of a provincial military chief in the occupation of Cuba, for example, receives almost as much weight in his story as Theodore Roosevelt's decision to reinvade the island. A lack of analysis weakens ''The Banana Wars'' even as military history. The chapter on the 1983 Grenada invasion reads like the script of ''H.M.S. Pinafore,'' with invading ships forced to count on the B.B.C. World Service for intelligence and maps too small to be read - no whitewash here - but Mr. Musicant never shows why such mistakes occurred. More important, the book treats invasions as problems in naval engineering or military logistics. Mr. Musicant says in his introduction that he will make no sweeping condemnation or approvals of policy, and then goes on to do exactly that with a checklist of ''good'' invasions (Panama in 1885, Cuba in 1899, Haiti) and ''bad'' (Cuba in 1912 and Nicaragua in 1927). But after spending two paragraphs of the introduction discussing what makes a justified or successful intervention, he does not offer any insights on the topic in the rest of the book. The material is there - the disastrous occupations to ''bring democracy'' to Cuba and Haiti foreshadow current attempts to do the same in Panama and El Salvador - but Mr. Musicant does not try to explain why the invasions failed. He draws no conclusions from his history, no lessons or insights to prevent fiascos in the future.",1990-09-16T05:00:00+0000

Henry award for short fiction, and it's easy to see why. At her best, she gives us what we want from stories; root emotion recognized through someone else's consciousness. The best story of the seven in this, her first collection, is the novella ''To Be Sung On the Water.'' With great delicacy, Ms. Steinbach moves us into a family -- the family as it was and is and is to be, the family in all its ramifications, the family as destiny. The main character is Rose, a gifted young painter who is also a wife, mother, sister, the daughter of a beauty who has missed her great chance for happiness, a granddaughter and the lover of a married man. Rose's life has been interrupted by the death of her grandfather and a trip home for his funeral. Ms. Steinbach moves easily backward and forward in time, from the adult Rose consoling her widowed, unexpectedly diminished grandmother, to the small Rosie who nestles against her for comfort. Ms. Steinbach touchingly details what is left of the child in the adult, and what the adult eventually comes to realize from what the child has seen. The shortest piece in the book, ''On Star Street,'' is a brilliant little portrait of an old woman in a nursing home, the syntax of her life dribbling away. Ms. Steinbach is particularly gifted at using quiet, typically plaing her characters in rural settings against which emotional clangor stands out as clearly as the bright colors of the yellow slicker and red boots in the rainy city of her story ''A Preponderance of the Small,'' a moving tale in which a young widow has to face a second experience with death.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,  Tender Outrage and Tough Sympathy,"STORIES BY CONTEMPORARY IRISH WOMEN. Edited by Daniel J. Casey and Linda M. Casey. (Syracuse University, Cloth, $32.95; Paper, $14.95.) ''Are there Irish women writers the like of Yeats and Joyce? Is there a developing feminist tradition in Ireland worthy of serious critical attention?'' Such interesting questions, posed by Daniel J. Casey and Linda M. Casey in their introduction to ''Stories by Contemporary Irish Women,'' cannot be answered by these 17 works alone. But the Caseys' impressive collection makes a sterling case for the need to include several female writers in the highest echelon of Irish fiction. Edna O'Brien's story ''A Scandalous Woman,'' set in County Clare and deeply rooted in conventional Irish values, is a masterpiece of ironic fiction. In it, the narrator poignantly tells the story of a beautiful childhood friend who loses her spunk and sanity after a forced marriage to a man who impregnated her during an adventuresome girlhood dalliance. Equally eloquent is Mary Lavin's ''Lilacs,'' which explores the conflicts of a traditional Irish family that prospers by - but agonizes over - selling manure for a living. In addition to such established writers, the Caseys include several new voices of distinction. Ita Daly's ''Aimez-Vous Colette?'' is an achingly sad story told by a fusty spinster, a romantic soul at heart, who has sacrificed the love of a good man to save her silly pride. In ''Five Notes After a Visit,'' Anne Devlin, a writer born in Northern Ireland, pitches her lovers - one Roman Catholic, the other Protestant - from their exile in London into their native Belfast, where political tensions and outright threats fray the couple's nerves and finally unravel their reunion. The Troubles are evoked even more explicitly in Maura Treacy's story ''A Minor Incident,'' a horrifying account of senseless violence in the North. Not surprisingly, there's a sorrowful tone to this entire collection, born of these writers' tender outrage and tough sympathy for their haunted homeland and its inhabitants. As Ms. O'Brien expresses it, ''Ours indeed was a land of shame, a land of murder and a land of strange sacrificial women.''",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

(University of California, Cloth, $22.50; Paper, $7.95) Written in 1930 and first published posthumously in 1970, this Chilean novel is a fascinating early example of the effects of Surrealism on Latin American letters. ''Eva the Fugitive'' followed Andre Breton's ''Nadja'' by only two years, and in the delirious, multidirectional prose of Rosamel del Valle's novel there are clear echoes of Breton's artistic revolution-in-progress, a feverishly lyrical determinedly antiliterary expedition into the darkness of unreason and dream. Like Breton's title character, Eva is mad, and she more than fits Breton's definition of beauty (it must be ''convulsive''); she exercises a powerful erotic fascination on the narrator, not least because she shares her own doubts about whether she exists anywhere except in fantasy. As they walk together through a Santiago amusement park, fragments of overheard conversations season the narrative with a hint of everyday realities in which Eva's hallucinatory existence must be contained. Yet she is not truly of this world. ''Eva's freedom,'' we are told,''maintains no connection with any other.'' Constantly associated with oneiric images of blood and water, desperate Eva eventually comes to embody the narrator's own despair, which is said to resemble ''a forest peopled with everything except life.'' It may seem idle, at this remove in time, to complain of life, yet it may be that Eva is too exquisitely fey to be convincing. Anna Balakian, the eloquent translator of this whirling prose, points out in her introduction that in its flight from common sense, Surrealist narrative often defaults to standard Gothic structures of phantasms and demonic possession. Rosamel del Valle's Eva, with her edenic name and fatal madness, is perhaps only a familiar dislocation of the Eternal Feminine, another link between the Surrealists and their excitable Romantic forbears.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Elvis: The Cousin,"THE BOY WHO WOULD BE KING. By Earl Greenwood and Kathleen Tracy. (Dutton, $19.95.) For some Americans, Elvis Presley remains an obsession. For others, he has turned into a joke. The authors of ''The Boy Who Would Be King'' offer a different view, depicting a profoundly insecure child who grew up tormented by poverty and emotional abuse. With its thoughtful, honest commentary, this biography hits readers with the force of truth - at least as Earl Greenwood, Elvis's cousin, close friend and press agent, sees it. With the help of Kathleen Tracy, a freelance writer, he chronicles the singer's childhood in Tupelo, Miss., and his youth in Memphis. Many elements of Elvis's life would suit a Gothic novel: a twin brother born dead, whom Elvis invokes as a protector; a father jailed so often the sheriff ordered the Presleys to leave Tupelo; an alcoholic mother who manipulated her son's sense of guilt so well he felt he had betrayed her simply by asking another female for a date. As an adult, Elvis added more unsavory characters to his circle, selecting a manager who controlled him through intimidation. Twenty-five years of mounting frustration and rage, the authors suggest, created a cynic who mistrusted everyone, especially the ever-changing roster of women he bedded regularly. Plenty of details here match the standard gossip about Elvis's later years. But others - his first entry in a talent contest, his joyful discovery of gospel music outside a black church - reveal the man's spirit and inspire sympathy for a life dominated by feelings of unworthiness. The authors lend fluid writing to the story, even if their foreshadowing is heavy-handed and their arguments occasionally repetitious. Thanks to Mr. Greenwood's closeness to his subject, he and Ms. Tracy help readers care about a fellow human being many other writers have reduced to a cartoon.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Philip Randolph (1889-1979) helped shape this nation. Before him there was no African-American labor leader. He organized this country's first black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and sat as the first black member on the inhospitable American Federation of Labor's executive council. A front-rank civil rights leader, he conceived of two marches on Washington. The political establishment so detested the idea of the first one, set for 1941, that no one needed to take to the streets; President Franklin D. Roosevelt acceded to Randolph's demands that the Government issue orders for fair housing practices. Randolph was also part of of the effort that led to the abolishment of segregation in the armed forces. The sadly neglected Pullman porter who helped create the civil rights movement in the 50's, E.D. Nixon, was a Randolph protege. Randolph abhorred racial separatism; he also explained that pro-black does not mean antiwhite. He was an atheist, a Socialist and an unwavering anti-Communist; he was also an authoritarian leader whose multiple commitments spread him thin. In her detailed and insightful biography, ''A. Philip Randolph, Pioneer of the Civil Rights Movement,'' Paula F. Pfeffer proclaims twio goals: to show how Randolph laid the groundwork for the modern civil rights movement and to describe the difficulties experienced by a black leader who, though lacking in resources, believed that rich white allies can be as harmful (especially to black psyches) as helpful to the cause. Throughout, Msd. Pfeffer, who teaches history at Mundelein College. In Chicago, discusses the impact of Randolph's tenets and achievements.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

The separation of church and state is an idea that is accepted by most American. Controversy arises, however, when the boundaries of the separation are asserted in a particular situation. Wayne Swanson, a professor of government at at connecticut College, has written a case study of one such situation. In 1980, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the city of Pawtucket, R.I., for erecting a Nativity scene with public funds. The Supreme Court, in the 1984 case of Lynch v. Donnelly, overruled the lower courts and, in a 5-4 decisin, held that the creche was not an establishment of religion prohibited by the First Amendment. The court reasoned that the context of the display had the basically secular purposes of promoting the spirit of the holiday season and attracting shoppers to the downtown stores, rather than demonstrating government support of religion. The author does a good job of presenting the issues that the courts faced in the decisions set forth at each judicial level. He also traces the history of Supremem Court cases concerning separation of church and state, and includes some background on the Federal judicial system. All this, will be useful to the reader with no grounding in the issues involved, but the book lacks the depth and perspective to add any insight into this controversy. The relationship between religion and government has stirred sufficient passions on both sides to cause fundamental fissures in Americna life today. The scope of Mr. Swanson's book is too limited to give his readers an understanding of how deeply rooted attitudes and beliefs make this issue, for many, a moral crusade rather than a legal argument.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

That is undeniable. Anyone will confirm it. Their name lives as a virtual guarantee of good quality. Is that why a considerable public is still interested in them? Is it because now, as always, people revel in success stories or, as some put it, the Frankfurt ghetto of the 19th century prefigures the modern ''Dallas''? We must forgive them their misguided humor. Obviously, for the Jewish family we come to know in this very Jewish play, the danger is not corruption of morals and traditions by money, but rather isolation, oppression and death. For them, evil lies not within the family, but outside it. Their story is not of a clan's decline, but of its flowering, in the context of a great adventure in war-torn Europe.",1990-09-23T05:00:00+0000

The Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi found inspiration for his architectural fantasies in the geometrical oddities of the hand-molded mud structures, which are at once extravagant and astonishingly simple in form. More recently, the virtues of earthen construction have attracted the enthusiastic attention of the architecture historian Jean-Louis Bourgeois and the photographer Carollee Pelos. Between 1978 and 1986, the pair traversed 22,000 miles in West Africa and Southwest Asia, documenting the stunning variety of one of the oldest construction methods in the world. SPECTACULAR VERNACULAR: The Adobe Tradition (Aperture, $35) is a compilation of Ms. Pelos's photographs, accompanied by Mr. Bourgeois's incisive text, which explores the culture, history and habits of those who build with mud. The book is their attempt to ''relegitimize'' a tradition ''under attack by the ideology of progress.'' From the undulating curves of Afghani shrines to the lavishly embossed walls of village houses in India, adobe construction is revealed as a diverse architecture. Particularly alluring are the mosques of Mali, so organic in composition that they seem to be naturally occurring phenomena. Indeed, Ms. Pelos's photographs depict structures in such striking harmony with their severe desert environments that we are easily convinced of their ecological merits, described in detail by Mr. Bourgeois. Some 1.5 billion people live in mud structures, according to ''Spectacular Vernacular.'' An important implication of this book is that these are not primitive dwellings, which should be enhanced or replaced by concrete and steel, but ecologically sound constructions, perfected over centuries.",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Everywhere we went, prices were always quoted, stated and requested in dollars. In fact, Israeli merchants preferred the dollar because of the instability of their own currency. Moreover, the tourist who paid in shekels paid more than when he paid in dollars. A tax was added to bills paid in shekels but not when paid in dollars. The only problem was that when the tourist paid in dollars, he received his change in shekels. When asked why this was so, the response was ''It's the law.''",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"ENRICO CARUSO: My Father and My Family. By Enrico Caruso Jr. and Andrew Farkas. (Amadeus Press, $39.95.) Enrico Caruso Jr. was 17 and his brother, Rudolfo, was 23 when their father, the renowned operatic tenor, died in 1921. In 1983, at 79, Enrico Caruso Jr. began an extraordinary project. He recorded his memories of his father, which formed the basis of a highly readable biography, ''Enrico Caruso,'' written with Andrew Farkas, a professor of library science at the University of North Florida and the editor of ''Lawrence Tibbett: Singing Actor.'' The fascinating personal life of the flamboyant, earnest elder Caruso resembled soap more than grand opera, though the authors tell the drama with the polite dispassion of a watcher from the stage wings. Caruso spent money lavishly on homes, hotel suites, clothes, jewelry and women. The opera singer Ada Giachetti, who abandoned her husband and infant to live with Caruso, was the mother of Rudolfo and Enrico Jr. In 1908, she bolted with the family chauffeur. In 1912, Rina Giachetti, sister to Ada and also a famous singer, became Caruso's mistress. Her tenure ended abruptly in 1918 when he unexpectedly married an American, Dorothy Park Benjamin. The Carusos had a daughter, Gloria, who inherited the bulk of her father's estate. Although the sons never really knew a mother and never dared contradict or assert themselves with their father, they seem to have adored him. Enrico Caruso Jr., who died in 1987, has served his father well with musical details of the singer's life throughout the text, accompanied by some 200 family photographs, including wonderful caricatures, some in color, by the Great Caruso. The authors have also provided a discography of all the Caruso recordings, dates and places of the tenor's performances of operas and recitals, and bibliographies of earlier biographies. Enrico Caruso Jr. finally earned, posthumously, his own sustained ''Bravo.''",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Now, a team of researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee has developed a microscope based on what they call Z-contrast imaging. This new technique uses a finely focused electron beam to scan an object. Because the beam is narrow, the image is easier to detect than ones made with a conventional electron microscope.

In these book reviews and short essays, Hugh Kenner is like the albatross in Baudelaire's poem: his giant wings prevent him from walking. His mind hefts too much bulk for these cramped forms, and why shouldn't it? A professor of English at Johns Hopkins University, the author of 24 books, personal friend to Ezra Pound and Samuel Beckett, Mr. Kenner has written many of the greatest works on modernism, and if his ideas on everything from literary preservation technologies to the new Oxford English Dictionary unfold well beyond the edges of a newspaper column or a magazine page, all I can say is, more power to him. What is remarkable is that given the pressure of such expansive knowledge, Mr. Kenner still manages to write apt, amusing prose. Of dull literary biographies he snipes: ''From gossip the book-writer sucks a goo called information, to cement edifices of assertion with.'' Of leisure in literature he boldly declares: ''Fiction was always about people on vacation - people in free-fall. Don Quixote was not punching a time clock.'' Of Wallace Stevens he almost coos: ''Not-quite-Milton, a sort of Origami Milton, the paper phoenix fluttering in the wizard's hand.'' Mr. Kenner is an old-fashioned critic, the kind who sprinkles his brilliant microscopic readings with personal anecdote (''Sam [Beckett] could be exasperatingly denying''), the kind whose stylistic imitations are, indeed, the sincerest form of flattery (Tom Wolfe is ''the nonchalant master of the neon-piped sentence''), the kind who, to the certain dismay of his academic colleagues, blithely ignores the past two decades of critical theory (as well as much of anything having to do with minorities and women). No matter - go somewhere else for theory. Stick with Mr. Kenner's ''Historical Fictions'' when you want to remember that literature is not only the best intellectual exercise around, it is also supposed to be fun.",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SAMS IN A DRY SEASON. By Ivan Gold. (Seymour Lawrence/Houghton Mifflin, $19.95.) Jason Sams, the blocked novelist and creative-writing professor whose story is told in ''Sams in a Dry Season,'' counsels himself to ''beware romans a clef.'' Ivan Gold himself has clearly not followed this advice. A writer who has not published fiction since the 1960's, when he produced a short-story collection, ''Nickel Miseries,'' and a novel, ''Sick Friends,'' also about Sams, Mr. Gold has devoted his new novel to the travails of a hero who seems remarkably like himself. And although Mr. Gold doesn't state so directly, numerous allusions point to the same cause for both men's long silence: alcoholism that nearly destroyed career, health and marriage. Not surprisingly, this painful narrative, which concentrates on a brief period in 1976, reads more like autobiography than fiction -Mr. Gold even switches abruptly from third-person to first-person narration in the final passages - and the book has both the merits and difficulties of a personal account. Mr. Gold's insights lend immediacy to Sams' suffering, and his portrayal of the man's self-delusions allow the reader to share an alcoholic's viewpoint in nearly unparalleled fashion. We see vividly how the humiliations to which Sams subjects himself, ranging from missed student conferences to cleaning out a friend's supply of ale, create a private hell whose misery inevitably leads to more abuse. Yet few human lives have the thematic tautness of a novel, and the one chronicled here sometimes sprawls all over, with forays into past events and relationships that are never fully explained. The excess is also stylistic - seen in pages of unpunctuated, stream-of-consciousness prose, undoubtedly illustrative of drunken ruminations but extremely hard to follow. It is easy to wish, too, for more attention to detail. Mr. Gold never reveals how the down-on-his-luck Sams manages to support his family when, sans job, he finally joins Alcoholics Anonymous. But some beautifully realized portraits, particularly of Sams' parents, Orthodox Jews trying to eke out a living on New York's deteriorating Lower East Side, show Mr. Gold's talent. His return is welcome.",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE EAGLE AND THE RAVEN. By James A. Michener. (State House Press, Box 15247, Austin, Tex. 78761; $19.95.) Waste not, want not. It's generally good advice, especially in this era of social and environmental responsibility. And it can usually be applied to writers, since most are pack rats when it comes to their own prose. Consequently, when one of James A. Michener's former assistants, who had recently established a small Texas publishing house, approached her one-time boss and asked permission to publish a chapter he'd written seven years earlier for his novel ''Texas,'' he leaped at the chance. ''Yes!'' he reports in the lengthy and somewhat self-promotional introduction to ''The Eagle and the Raven.'' ''I spent a lot of time on that chapter, but nobody else felt it should be included in the book, and for good reason. It was written outside the normal story-telling pattern. . . . I hated to cut it, but had to.'' And so Mr. Michener presumably reached into a dark corner of his file cabinet and came up with this rather slight text, a comparison of the American politician and frontiersman Sam Houston and the Mexican general (and oft-time president) Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the man responsible for the massacre at the Alamo - history with a bit of fiction thrown in for good measure. This is an odd sort of book. First, there is that introduction, in which Mr. Michener, now in his 80's, recaps his distinguished career. Then there are the alternating chapters detailing and contrasting the lives of Houston and Santa Anna. It's difficult to imagine who the audience for a book like this might be, other than die-hard aficionados of Mr. Michener or Texas history. But even they might be disappointed, given that the writing is rather flat, its tone not unlike that of a high school textbook.",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

My relations with baseball were similar. Between the ages of 9 and 13, I must have put in a 40-hour week during the snowless months over at the neighborhood playfield - softball, hardball and stickball pick-up games - while simultaneously holding down a full-time job as a pupil at the local grammar school; as I remember it, news of two of the most cataclysmic public events of my childhood - the death of President Roosevelt and the bombing of Hiroshima - reached me while I was out ''playing ball.'' My performance was erratic; O.K. for those easy-going pick-up games, but lacking the calm and the expertise that the naturals displayed in stiff competition. My taste, and my talent, such as it was, was for the flashy whiz-bang catch rather than the towering fly ball; running and leaping I loved, all the do-or-die stuff -somehow I lost confidence waiting and waiting for the ball lofted right at me to come down. I could never make the high school team, yet I remember that in one of the two years I vainly (in both senses of the word) tried out, I did a good-enough imitation of a baseball player's style to be able to fool (or amuse) the coach right down to the day he cut the last of the dreamers from the squad and gave out the uniforms.",1990-09-30T05:00:00+0000

Which does nothing for American music - often designed to appeal to a lot of people, including babbitts out on a Saturday night. That isn't to deny the radical impulse.
