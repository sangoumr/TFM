The second floor has a spacious dining room, a smaller room and a greenhouse garden room that will open later. Mr. Burkes signature use of slabs of Himalayan pink salt is everywhere, in the food and even to cover some walls. His menu can be counted on for inventive touches; there are scallops with corned beef cheeks, lamb carbonara and Peking pork shank. The executive chef is Ed Cotton.

us,Its Rachel Weiszs Turn in Plenty at the Public Theater,"When the drama Plenty was first produced in New York at The Public Theater in 1982, its British playwright David Hare had been active for over a decade but was known, if at all, in America as a plucky newcomer. The year before, Mel Gussow of The New York Times described him as part of a wave of young, politically righteous dramatists, and since then, Mr. Hare has grown into the role of liberal dramas minence grise. Plenty, a time-jumping drama, remains not only one of his finest and most popular plays but also one of the great modern vehicles for ambitious actresses. The four-time Tony nominee Kate Nelligan originated the role (an English secret agent, who worked for the French resistance, adjusting to a tepid postwar life), which has now been played by Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett. Part of the fun of the new revival, once again at the Public, will be to see how Rachel Weisz follows in their footsteps. David Leveaux directs.

But Ginsburg has also become something of a pop culture superstar in recent years, ever since an admiring law student nicknamed her Notorious R.B.G. (a riff on the rapper Notorious B.I.G.). The meme went viral, and now Ginsburgs stern face and big glasses show up on tote bags, baby onesies and coffee mugs bearing slogans like The Ruth Will Set You Free. So when Gwen Ifill talked with her for PBSs NewsHour Bookshelf this month, the first question involved Ginsburgs newfound status as a folk hero. It is utterly amazing, Ginsburg said. Of course I didnt see it coming. ... But I certainly was given a tremendous boost into the public arena by the Notorious R.B.G. When I was asked about it, I said, well, its exactly right, because Notorious B.I.G. and I had something in common. ... We were both born and bred in Brooklyn.",2016-10-14T15:01:03+0000

us,Kerry James Marshall Is Shifting the Color of Art History,"WE COULD BEGIN IN Birmingham, Ala., where the artist Kerry James Marshall was born in 1955, his father a postal worker whose hobby was buying broken watches, fancy ones  Baume & Mercier, Piaget, Patek Philippe  that hed pick up in pawn shops for a song, figure out how to fix with the help of books hed find used, and resell. From that story, we could derive the practical idea that Marshall, a companion on his fathers expeditions from a very early age, saw that something rarefied and complex, in which one had zero training, could be approached, deconstructed and  with education and application  mastered. Or we could begin by talking about Marshalls older brother, Wayne  one year and nine days older, who, straight out of high school, went to work for the post office like his father and worked there until he retired  Wayne who was always first at everything, whom Marshall was always chasing, from whom he was inseparable except at school where their ages kept them in different grades, Marshall trying to catch up but always falling short, one year and nine days short. From that story, we could understand that Marshall is a man who, from the beginning, has been hustling to get to where he wants to go. Or we could begin in Watts, in 1963, when Marshall was 7, when his family moved there in time for the riots, 12 blocks from the Black Panther headquarters, a neighborhood where he learned things youre not supposed to know about when youre a kid. We could talk about how their mailman, a really nice guy, got killed on Marshalls best friends front porch, in a robbery gone wrong, two doors down. How, on another day, coming home from school, cutting through the alley he always cut through, he found three grown women rolling around in the grass of a front yard, stab wounds all over them, stabbed by a young man whod been discharged from the Army with problems, a man whod just stabbed his mother, his aunt and his grandmother 70 times. And how, later, when Marshall was voted homecoming king of Jefferson High and was on his way there in his suit for the first homecoming parade in a decade  Jefferson having gotten kicked out of the conference because thered always been problems  he arrived to find everybody heading the other way: Three people had just been shot on the field, friends of his. That was the kind of world Marshall grew up in, a world where he knew founding members of the Crips, and where a lot of the people he knew are now dead of unnatural causes and have been for a long time. From those stories, wed be amazed to learn  as he told me in August when I visited him on the South Side of Chicago where hes been making one masterpiece after another for three decades  that it didnt stop me from developing the sense that, still, everything is possible. I was never in despair.",2016-10-17T15:11:00+0000

To judge from the genial, disarming tone of his memoir, A Life in Parts (new at No.9 on the hardcover nonfiction list), that journeyman experience has given him the perspective to stay humble in the face of fame  or at least to maintain a sense of humor about it. Ive seen Breaking Bad T-shirts in cities and little outposts all over the world, he writes toward the end of the book. People dress as Walter White for Halloween. They dress their children and dogs in hazmat suits and Heisenberg hats. People have shaved my face into the back of their heads, theyve inked it on their backs, their forearms, their legs, their asses. Im the permanent resident of some guys left butt cheek. Next to Larry and Moe. I suppose Ive taken the place of Curly, the third Stooge. Its a little ... odd to have your face tattooed on someones backside. I did not see that coming when I lied about my ability to mountaineer in order to get a Mars bar commercial. Fame has other pitfalls, too, Cranston adds. As an actor you need to be sensitive, to be open, to be able to observe people and study human behavior, he writes. But as a celebrity I am no longer the observer, I am the observed.

He is the first character introduced, and for a few pages he is called only by his description: the fair boy. I could relate to that.

Put the saddle between your legs and, with the pedal for your dominant foot at the 9 oclock position, step up onto the unicycle as if you were climbing stairs; as the unicycle moves underneath you, put the other foot on its pedal. Hold onto a wall or a fence for support. (Dismounting is easy, Wilton says: Step off backward  do the exact same thing you did to get on the unicycle, but in reverse.)",2016-10-28T09:00:05+0000

The refurbishment of the directors reputation, which began in 1966 when Franois Truffaut published his landmark book of interviews, Hitchcock/Truffaut, reached its conclusion in 2012 when the film critics polled by Sight and Sound voted Vertigo the greatest film of all time, kicking Orson Welless Citizen Kane from a top spot it had enjoyed for decades. Wellesians bit their knuckles, and the rest of us scratched our heads. Vertigo is not Hitchcocks best, but rather, with its lush morbidity, somnolent pace, poor box office and relative scarcity of jokes, the Hitchcock film for those who most wish he were French. Flops make film critics feel useful  they are the film-crit equivalent of the deserving poor. What else can you do with a gleaming hit maker except overpraise his misses?",2016-10-28T10:04:03+0000

That one might bite into ones mallard or grouse and land on stray birdshot is perhaps a badge of honor, proof that whats on your plate has a woodsier back story than the steak. And palombe, or wood pigeon, has a better back story than most. As a chef, you want something that tastes delicious, but also thats coherent and has its own tradition, says Daniel Rose, who serves it rare-roasted at his First Arrondissement restaurant Spring during the birds month-and-a-half season from mid-October to the end of November. Generally grayer than its close cousin, the standard pigeon, with distinctive white marks on its neck and wings, the wild-caught palombe is more delicately gamy and less rich. Rose serves his with braised foie gras and cabbage, and a pure of smoked beet. At LAmi Jean, Stphane Jgo goes a more traditional route, roasting the birds with thyme and garlic, or stewed in salmi, a mixture of giblets, wine and foie gras. Wild palombe brings a rustic, old-fashioned moment to the table, Rose notes. It evokes the deliciousness of nature and cooking on an open fire.",2016-10-31T09:50:57+0000
