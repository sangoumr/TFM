He'd worked on programming at ABC and created the Fox network, and he's wanted to get back into prime time -- as witness his failed effort to buy Paramount. Laurence Tisch, at 71, has really treated CBS as an investment and is ready to cash part of it in. But don't think, as David Letterman suggested, that the ""60 Minutes"" stopwatch will now be ""yours for $49.95."" CBS will, however, get a desired foothold in cable. So why did both CBS and QVC stock jump so sharply? Perhaps because, as one CBS executive put it, Mr. Tisch just ""put the money in the bank,"" and now Mr. Diller will breathe life, and growth, into the company.

Not too long after, in 1904, Mr. Gravereaux donated 6,000 roses from l'Hay to the city of Paris to start the rose garden at Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne, the city's vast park of over 2,000 acres. The Bagatelle, an 18th century house surrounded by extensive gardens, includes the sumptuous two-acre rose garden. Planted with 11,000 rosebushes of over 850 varieties, it is in bloom throughout the summer.",1994-07-03T05:00:00+0000

New Cigarette, but Same Old Problem","WHAT: Natural American Spirit, an additive-free cigarette made by the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company in Sante Fe, N.M., that started out in 1985 as a cult cigarette and grew to sales of $10 million last year.THE PURITY: Spirits are made from premium Virginia tobacco. They contain none of the additives found in conventional brands, like synthetic flavor enhancers, preservatives and other agents referred to as ""burn accelerators."" Spirits do contain about 25 percent more tobacco than most other brands of the same size (85 millimeters, the standard length). Like all tobacco products, Spirits also contain tar and nicotine, substances considered highly addictive and harmful to health.THE PSYCHOLOGY: About a dozen Spirit smokers interviewed said they thought the cigarettes were healthier and less addictive because of the absence of additives. The higher tobacco content makes Spirits more satisfying, the smokers said, so they crave fewer cigarettes and inhale less deeply.THE PRICE OF PURITY: The average retail price is $3 a pack, which the company says reflects the quality of tobacco used. Most conventional brands cost $2.30. By the way, Marlboro, the best-selling brand, rang up sales of $12 billion in the domestic market last year.THE PACKAGING OF PURITY: Like all brands, these carry the Surgeon General's warnings. The Natural American Spirit logo depicts an American Indian smoking a peace pipe. The color of the background (turquoise for filtered, sand for nonfiltered), the thunderbird icon and the distinctive style of type on the packaging suggest a synthesis of Southwestern and Art Deco motifs. A political message? Not according to company literature. ""Our package design was chosen because tobacco is a plant native to America and was introduced to 'Western civilization' by American Indians,"" it says. ""We feel tobacco is a powerful herb worthy of the respect it has been shown in American Indian tradition.""THE DISTRIBUTION OF PURITY: Natural food stores account for 15 percent of Spirits' sales. ""We're in select outlets like upscale wine stores, gourmet food shops, herb stores and new-age boutiques,"" said Robin Sommers, the president of the company. Advertising has appeared in magazines like the Utne Reader, Vegetarian Times, Mother Earth News and Shaman's Drum.THE REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY: Dr. Leo Goldberger, a professor of psychology at New York University, had this to say about the popularity of Spirits: ""There is a very basic psychological mechanism at work here -- denial. We are living in an age of denial: 'The environment is O.K.,' 'AIDS doesn't affect me,' 'Bosnia isn't so bad.' This denial acts as a defense mechanism against negative information from the outside world. So even though we know cigarettes cause cancer, we cling to all kinds of rationalizations -- like a healthy cigarette."" Dr. Richard D. Hurt, the head of the nicotine dependence center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., agreed. ""There is no such thing as a safe cigarette, period,"" he said. ""Even a tobacco without additives has tar and numerous naturally occurring chemicals present in the smoke, many of which are harmful.""RENE CHUN",1994-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Main Street Memories,"In his 19th book, SMALL TOWN AMERICA (Abrams, $49.50), the photographer David Plowden focuses on the last vestiges and artifacts of the rural communities once considered the wellspring of everything American. Mr. Plowden himself grew up in such a town -- Putney, Vt. -- during the 1940's, and has set himself the mission of documenting the few remaining examples of the culture that evoke his youth: barbershops, general stores, gas pumps, clapboard houses, main streets, hardware stores, quiet bars and whimsical meeting halls. The book's straightforward black-and-white photographs are the result of Mr. Plowden's travels on the country's roads, setting to work with his camera and tripod in backwaters where CVS pharmacies, Wal-Marts and Toyota dealers have not yet reached. Like an archeologist, Mr. Plowden seems to be engaged in a treasure hunt, uncovering and recording what he calls ""once commonplace things"" that provide clues to life in another time and place. Pleasure in the genuine article underlies all his images, from handmade doors and homely interiors to the faces of small-town folk who, as he makes clear in his text, represent a rugged individuality that has all but disappeared. The last photograph, taken in Mayetta, Kan., neatly summarizes Mr. Plowden's sense of loss. The glorious steam locomotive of the past has been reduced to a painting on a brick wall, advertising antiques and used furniture. Beyond it an abandoned building sits on the far side of the empty street, and in the foreground weeds push through cracks in the neglected pavement. ROSEMARY RANCK",1994-07-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Tracking Police Corruption Over the Years,"Sept. 23, 1986: More than a decade after the Knapp Commission focused wide attention on corruption among the police and after years of relative quiet, the police department is rocked by the arrests of eleven officers from the 77th Precinct in Bedford-Stuvesant who knocked down doors, stole money and drugs from drug dealers and resold the stolen drugs. The ""Buddy Boys"" case is the department's first major corruption scandal since the Knapp Commission exposed organized ""pads"" that ran extortion operations out of nearly every precinct house. It was out of the Knapp Commission that the Internal Affairs Division was born. Oct. 31, 1986: Twenty-seven supervisors are transferred out of the precinct by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, but no need is seen for an investigation of the department's anti-corruption efforts. March 1991: Apparently no corruption troubles are in sight. The state disbands the office of Special Prosecutor for corruption and agres to give money to the district attorneys to fight corruption. To date, only a fraction of the money promised has been delivered. May 7, 1992: A group of six New York City police officers, led by Officer Michael Dowd, are arrested for cocaine trafficking by the Suffolk County police, raising a host of questions about oversign and the Blue Wall of Silence. Why didn't the department's own investigators uncover the scandal in light of flagrant misconduct over many years by Officer Dowd? Had the department looked the other way? One person, anyway, sees no major cracks. Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown calls the department's system for weeding out corruption ""a system that police agencies across the country look to."" June 25, 1992: Mayor David N. Dinkins announces the creation of a special panel to investigate corruption, and as its head, names Milton Mollen, a former judge and former Deputy Mayor for public safety, as well as a close friend. Commissioner Brown, who opposed the panel, was conspicuously absent from the announcement. June 29, 1992: Commissioner Brown finally acknowledges a problem. He announces tougher anti-corruption measures that on the surface seem rather basic. Investigators will finally be supplied with modern surveillance equipment and even new cars that will help them avoid detection from officers under scrutiny. He also asks his top deputy, Raymond W. Kelly, to prepare a report on why the department failed to stop Officer Dowd. But law enforcement officials say the response is too late, that the Internal Affairs Division had been bungling cases for years. One officials calls it a ""secret waiting to come out."" July 30, 1992: More problems for Michael Dowd. He is arrested on Federal charges that he took huge weekly cash payments from drug gangs. Officials say he offered protection from police raids and in return took in as much as $8,000 a week. Nov. 16, 1992: Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announces a major revamping of the Internal Affairs monitoring system, starting with an upgrading of its status to Internal Affairs Bureau and creating more accountability among investigators. Mollen Commission officials say the changes do not go nearly far enough. Sept. 27, 1993: The Mollen Commission begins the city's first public hearings on police corruption in more than 20 years with a star witness: Michael Dowd. He says that early in his career other officers indoctrinated him with the attitude: ""never rat against another cop."" There is testimony from a hooded informant named ""Mr. X"" and from former police officials and investigators who reveal tales of corruption and brutality in the 9th Precinct in the East Village and in many of the city's minority communities. It is learned that Internal Affairs has long maintained a secret ""tickler"" file for charges made against its own investigators, rather than pass the allegations on to prosecutors. Dec. 28, 1993: An interim report released by the Mollen Commission is a sign of things to come. The commission declares the department ""incompetent"" in policing itself. March 8, 1994: The commission produces its first criminal case when three officers from the 73d Precinct in Brownsville are charged with dealing drugs, usually while on duty. The officers called themselves the Morgue Boys because they often met divide their profits outside a factory that had once manufactured refrigerators for morgues. March 18, 1994: Three officers from the 30th Precinct are caught on videotape beating up Harlem residents and stealing drugs and cash. Eleven more officers from the precinct will eventually be arrested. And another new police commissioner, William J. Bratton, tries to put his own stamp on the corruption battle. He pronounces that no one will ever wear the badges of the arrested officers. To date, he has transferred eight of 22 supervisors from the precinct, as well as 25 of the precinct's 191 officers, many on suspicions that they knew about corruption but did not tell. July 6, 1994: The Commission's final report is issued. Its central proposal is the creation of an independent commission, appointed by the Mayor, to review police department efforts to eliminate corruption and to conduct its own investigations.

us,Business Diary: July 3-8,"THE ECONOMY This Many Statistics Can't Lie: Joblessness Is On the Wane Unless the statistics lie, the job picture keeps on improving. Last week came word of a surprise surge in payrolls in June -- 379,000 jobs added -- as the unemployment rate held steady at 6 percent. On top of that, new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 21,000, to 332,000, the largest drop since April and the lowest level since March. Of course, as always, statistics can fib a little. After a winter laden with snow days, for example, schools had to stay open longer, keeping school workers on the payroll. But, mainly, more jobs are appearing. And, yes, more jobs equals inflation scare equals rising interest rates. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to its highest level since Nov. 9, 1992, the week of the Presidential election. But for President Clinton, the point was this: ""We have still Americans who need jobs, we have still Americans who are working part time who wish to work full time."" News From the Fed: No News One on important front, nothing happened last week -- and that nonevent was big news. Whenever Federal Reserve policy makers sit down to meet, the financial markets hold their collective breath, waiting to see if the central bank will tighten the screws a bit more by raising short-term rates. But after this meeting, the Fed said nothing, which observers took to mean the Fed had not acted. Of course, just because after recent meetings the Fed has gone public with its decisions doesn't mean it's still doing so. Many people still expect the Fed to act sometime this summer, and the latest job numbers could give them the final nudge. Bretton Woods It's Not When, exactly 50 years ago, world leaders met in Bretton Woods, N.H., they faced grand challenges: a world to rebuild, a global monetary system to reinvent. But as this weekend's summit meeting began in Naples, world leaders tiptoed around the currency question. The big industrial economies are doing just fine, but global bond and currency markets are already on edge -- so don't rock the boat. When President Clinton tried his own brand of tiptoeing, though -- saying he opposed propping up the dollar, not wanting to ""choke off growth"" worldwide -- currency traders, sure enough, took the cue and sent the dollar near its all-time low. Tally of Smoking's Health Costs There are numerous ways of measuring the health costs of smoking -- with the tobacco industry, of course, at one extreme, often saying there's no cost at all because smoking isn't dangerous. And last week a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came out with a novel statistic: for each pack of cigarettes smoked, the taxpayer pays an 89-cent medical bill. Here's how that works out, according to its survey: health care for smoking-related illnesses cost at least $50 billion in 1993 (that represents fully 7 percent of the nation's total health costs), and Federal and state Governments pay 43 percent of that. So of a total health cost of $2.06 a pack, the taxpayer pays 89 cents. Trump Tower South? Once again, Donald Trump is out to spiff up the neighborhood. Last week he said he'd become part owner of a certain Midtown office tower and immediately vowed to restore it to ""its rightful position as a world-class real estate asset."" That surely noble sentiment, though, was not greeted warmly by Peter Malkin, who's had partial control of the building and who was quick to voice his feeling that ""it is a world-class real estate asset."" Granted, it's no Trump Tower, but you still may have heard of it: it's called the Empire State Building. And Mr. Trump, it seems, now owns half of it -- without having spent a penny. He managed that by helping the buyers -- European and Asian investors -- arrange financing. Now, Where Were Those Bonds? In the beginning there was cash -- well, O.K., beads or shells or even salt. But then came all this high-tech stuff, with banks zinging money mysteriously through the ether. What keeps them from losing a million here, a million there, through a hole in some electronic pocket? The answer: sometimes they do. Seattle First National Bank just settled with the S.E.C. and the Comptroller's office, paying a $75,000 penalty, after it simply lost track of $3 million in bonds. After the bank switched to a computerized system of handling bonds, the S.E.C. said, inadequately trained workers from a temp agency were handling things, and the bonds fell through the cracks. And who found them? The F.B.I., which bought them after they'd been stolen in transit. ""This was a glitch in the extreme,"" said one official. COMPANIES New York, on the Savings Map When you think savings giants, you think California, a land with two mortgages in every garage. The biggest guns are there -- Ahmanson, Great Western, Golden West. In New York, mega-banking generally means catering to the affluent, who want to move money at the flick of a computer. But suddenly, rising in the East, is a savings giant. Last week Dime and Anchor, two pillars of traditional mortgage lending, said they'd merge, with the combined company vaulting to No. 4 among savings banks. The new name: Dime Bancorp (a survey showed that Dime, born in 1852, is better known). At its head: Richard Parsons, Dime's chairman and a rising industry star. Bond Shopping at Macy's Macy's owes bondholders $1.3 billion it can't pay, and that gives bondholders a big say in Macy's fate as it tries to climb out of bankruptcy. So far bondholders have stymied an attempt by Federated to merge with Macy's, but that could change soon. Fidelity, the mutual fund powerhouse, which backs the merger, decided that if it couldn't fight the bondholders, it would join them -- in a big way. Last week Fidelity bought $80 million worth of the bonds -- not enough to dictate Macy's fate, but enough to make itself heard. Texaco Pulls Up Some Stakes American oil companies have had it with America. Environmental concerns put many areas off limits, and many oil fields are past their glory days, so they're increasingly looking abroad. And of course, like all good corporate citizens these days, they're trying to be stingy with costs. Texaco fit right in with both trends last week when it said it would sell half its 600 producing domestic fields and cut 2,500 jobs. Soon, it says, its balance will tilt, putting more of its spending abroad. And Texaco says it plans to keep cutting overhead. A Crowded Exit at Fox As Fox moves steadily toward television's big leagues, it's endured some highly visible growing pains -- perhaps because Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox, has been taking a special interest in it lately. Two years ago Barry Diller left as head of Fox Inc., beginning his detour in home-shopping land at QVC en route to CBS. More departures followed, with the latest coming last week, when Lucie Salhany, network television's highest-ranking woman, resigned from Fox Broadcasting after a reshuffling wiped out her position as chairwoman. Her tenure was marked by ups and downs, with one memorable down being her bet on Chevy Chase as Fox's great late-night hope. INTERNATIONAL French Business on Trial These haven't been good times for French business, with accusations flying about corruption at the very top and fraud charges against various executives. Last week brought a vivid episode in this drama, as Pierre Suard, head of Alcatel, the telecommunications and engineering giant, was arrested for questioning about possible misuse of company funds -- investigators say he used $740,000 of shareholders' money on a security system for his apartment. Alcatel has just agreed to pay France Telecom $11 million to settle charges of overbilling and two Alcatel managers were convicted of fraud. An Argentine Miracle (for Some) Latin America is a volatile economic laboratory, its nations lunging from system to system. A world-minded capitalism has won many a recent tug-of-war, but the cost is often high. In Argentina, President Menem's Government has wrestled inflation down from a numbing 5,000 percent in 1989 to under 5 percent, becoming a model economy-in-training. But left behind, critics say, are the rural poor. And last week, with unemployment rising and rich and poor drifting further apart, tens of thousands of out-of-town Argentines descended on Buenos Aires to protest economic policies. Said one member of Congress: ""The Government cannot ignore this.""",1994-07-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Heavenly Color,"""It is agreeable, I think, to be rescued from unreality,"" John Shearman, the formidable Harvard University art scholar, writes in THE SISTINE CHAPEL: A Glorious Restoration (Abrams, $75). And there are many downright exhilarating rescues performed in this volume, produced with the Nippon Television Network, which underwrote the project to clean Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel and documented it on film. The color photographs in the book, by Takashi Okamura, are captivating, especially a double foldout spread depicting the entire ceiling. In fact, the title of the book is slightly misleading, since the book covers only the ceiling, having been prepared before work on ""The Last Judgment"" was completed this year. The book contains essays by 10 leading experts on Michelangelo and the restoration. They are not written for casual readers, but several will make the great frescoes, and all of Michelangelo's art, vastly richer for anyone with the determination to understand them -- especially Michael Hirst's treatise on the surviving drawings of bodies the artist made from life for the huge figures on the ceiling; Gianluigi Colalucci's beguiling and illuminating essay on how the frescoes were made; and Mr. Shearman's warm and opinionated chapter on the purposes of the colors. ""The Sistine Chapel"" is a book that can be read, in part or wholly, many times with increasing wonder. Now that the ceiling appears much as it did to its creator, I want to leap up into it, looking and feeling and sniffing, to roll around in it. I am glad to have the assurance of the angular Mr. Shearman that Michelangelo invited such robust reactions. What is obvious now, he says, is that this heaven of color was meant to give pleasure, ""like that of a bouquet,"" and he adds that as the artist worked ""the poet in him was released.""

FIELD HOCKEY U.S. Surprises England Barbara Marois scored from a 59th minute penalty corner shot yesterday to give the United States a surprising 1-0 victory over favored England in the women's field hockey World Cup in Dublin. In a desperate final 20 minutes, England repeatedly pressured the goal, only to be turned back by a stout American defense, with goalkeeper Patty Shea forced to make seven saves. The Americans were not considered a threat, clinching the last of the 12 qualifying places and being beaten by England, 2-0, two months ago. (AP)",1994-07-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Helmut Lang: Fresh Glitter,"NAME: Helmut Lang. IDENTITY: Fashion designer, unwilling progenitor of the ""new glamour"" movement. AGE: 38. HOME: Vienna. CAREER: Began designing his own collection in Vienna in 1980, and showed in Paris for the first time in 1986. Since then, he has been developing what he calls a non-referential view of fashion: one that does not look back. His clothes typically use high-tech fabrics and clean tailoring, but with a rock-and-roll edge. In the last year, the Lang influence has been inescapable in glossy magazines and on other designers' runways: satiny and silky sheens, deft touches of glitter, simple silhouettes. Fashion insiders are calling it ""the new glamour."" He wishes they wouldn't. Q. Why are there so many Helmut Lang rip-offs this season? A. I give that question back to you. That's your role in this industry, to define this kind of movement; it's not mine. I'm just doing it. Q. You don't like people using past references to describe your style. Why? A. Because the past has nothing to do with it. It's all about today. We all know there is a history, and we all have our own history and past. There can be some references, but you can't always compare everything using the same old images and the same feelings. I think the history and the past we have is just an energy we've built up to do what we do now. Q. Your success has come from a steady evolution of your style. Does fashion try to change too much each season? A: If something is good, it doesn't go out of style every six months. The fashion wheel of today doesn't have to go as quickly as it was pushed in the 80's. Q. Culturally, why do you think this ""new glamour"" movement is happening now? A. Simplicity, deconstruction, was what we had the moment before glamour, and it was celebrated like a religion. That caused the change. It's never good to exaggerate a movement. When that happens with glamour, when it's overexaggerated, we'll go quickly to something else. Q. How is this glamour different from yesterday's? A. The difference is it's more mature. It's more mature than the glamour of the 80's, when it was important to be sun-tanned, before we knew what the sun could do to us. Today, it is being able to show you can play with sophistication. Q. So, are designers forcing too much change? A. I don't even think it's only the designers who influence it anymore. It's the media and what they promote to their readers. If there's one lipstick in your bathroom, you're out of fashion, or another, you're in fashion. We should have progressed much more at this point. Q. But obviously, since the new cry is ""glamour,"" you're profiting. How would you prefer to see magazines handle trends? A. The media is looking every season for a designer to tell a story. I have a long story I have to tell, continuing fluently year after year. I don't think I'm the one that invented glamour at all. I just built up my style year by year. I'm just lucky that the times are coming closer to what I do. But that wasn't the purpose of my work, to establish a new glamour. I do what I do. It has to do with my personality and my life, and I'm not thinking of what kind of provocation or sensation I want to make with my next collection. That wouldn't be a very good basis for a collection. I just try to do very honest, good clothes.",1994-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Macy's bondholders do fairly well as the chain emerges from bankruptcy, but retail workers will probably lose out. New York-area department-store jobs have slid to 24,000 from 57,000 just 15 years ago, and more layoffs will certainly follow now.

us,Bill Brandt's Britain,"There are plenty of arresting images in BILL BRANDT: Photographs 1928-1983 (Thames and Hudson, paper, $24.95). But one leaves this book of black-and white landscapes, literary portraits, abstract-looking nudes and studies of English upper-class and lower-class life wondering just what makes Bill Brandt Bill Brandt. What links the man who in 1944 took a striking shot of an unhappy couple sitting at a pub with the man who in 1957 photographed an East Sussex landscape dominated by a large human ear? Why are the linkages in Brandt's work so unclear? A partial explanation is given in the introductory essay by the British art historian Ian Jeffries, who calls Brandt ""Britain's greatest photographer of the modern era."" He says that many of Brandt's works, particularly those that appeared in his socialogical studies ""The English at Home"" and ""A Night in London,"" were intended as a series of photographs whose meaning depended on their juxtaposition -- a photograph of a coal miner at work was meant to go next to a shot of the coal miner's hard-bitten family at home without him. Even when Brandt (1904-83) was on assignment for magazines, Mr. Jeffries says, he often became ""engrossed or seduced by motifs."" Here, one gets an occasional glimpse of Brandt's juxtapositions. There is, for instance, an eerie trio of photographs under the title ""The Magic Lantern of a Car's Headlights."" But many of the photographs here are stripped from their intended context. That does not completely explain the uneasiness of this retrospective, though. The uncanniness of Brandt's art, as Mr. Jeffries points out, is the suggestion ""That what is ostensibly on show is not the whole story, that all those motifs are part of a larger, secret scheme, a private universe to which we are on the point of gaining access.""

us,"[ ENCOUNTER ] ; Whose Vision Is It, Anyway?","THEY SEEMED, IN PRINCIPLE, LIKE WORTHY ADVERSARIES: Linda Nochlin, the distinguished feminist art historian and critic, a professor of modern art at New York University whose thought-provoking essays on women as depicted in 19th-century painting have pioneered a new way of looking at familiar works by Courbet, Degas and other artists; Thierry Mugler, the Paris fashion designer, admired for his intricate cuts and notorious for his theatrical runway shows -- a cavalcade of Amazons, mermaids, angels, dominatrixes, space-age sex goddesses, vampires and other female stock characters, clothed in such elaborate fantasies as a quilted leather bustier and matching hot pants with motorcycle handlebars protruding from the waist. Nochlin turned up for their meeting in a West Side apartment wearing red socks patterned with black Scotties. Mugler reacted with mock horror. The photographer taking their picture told him not to wrinkle his brow. ""I'm supposed to be the aging intellectual,"" Nochlin joked. They went on to talk about images of women, about femininity as an enterprise, about the uses of fashion, which Mugler calls ""a trick and a game."" If fashion is in fact ""a trick and a game,"" what does the game tell us about the women who play it? MUGLER: So many things. A lot, I think. NOCHLIN: Well, that's if you think there's such a thing as women. I'm more inclined to agree with somebody like Joan Riviere, who was a student of Freud and said that femininity is a condition of disguise. I mean, there may be women, but femininity you dress up for. You learn how to be feminine -- it's not something natural, ever. So I would say that the great designer of clothing is always providing additional disguises to create new forms of the feminine. And I would say that clothes tell you something about the choice of the woman who's wearing them, but they don't tell you anything about the quote-unquote real woman, because I don't think there is a real woman. There's a real person, but I don't think it's a woman. MUGLER: Very true. There is only the person who chooses to play the feminine role, to experience different aspects of femininity. And do you feel, Thierry, that you're furnishing women with disguises that they can pick and choose and use? MUGLER: Completely. Completely. It's like directing your own everyday movie. Baudelaire said, ""La femme est naturelle, c'est-a-dire abominable."" ""Woman is natural -- that is, abominable."" Do you agree? MUGLER: No, because -- well, the body is beautiful. It's as simple as that. And for a fashion designer, it's the base. I mean, I think a pair of breasts is so gorgeous and I just can't resist when they're pushed up like this -- you know? It's so seductive. It's very sexual. NOCHLIN: How do you get them so round? MUGLER: Well, the minute you push them up and together, they go round. And then we pad them underneath and on the side, just to make them a little more perfect. NOCHLIN: I see. Linda, do you agree with Baudelaire? NOCHLIN: You know, Baudelaire's an old pal of mine, in a certain sense. And when he said that about women, he was being his usual perverse self. Understandably. He was so sick of everyone talking about Jean-Jacques Rousseau and ""the natural"" and how wonderful ""the natural"" was. So he took absolutely the opposite tack -- that nature was an abomination. Everything, then, is natural that is not manipulated, that is not changed by man. To him, a woman without makeup was disgusting. When she was natural, you could see all her -- her ooziness. MUGLER: Because the makeup was not as good as now! NOCHLIN: Well, he liked kohl around the eyes. Kohl, rouge -- of course it wasn't as good, and he was speaking mainly about prostitutes and courtesans. MUGLER: But at that time he was right, because all the bourgeois women, they were so boring. That's why the courtesans, they were so fabulous. NOCHLIN: They looked fabulous. MUGLER: They were free and beautiful. NOCHLIN: Right. And I think Baudelaire was speaking to a certain point. I mean, he also loved the dandy -- he didn't like natural men any more than natural women. So he was really talking as an urban man who wanted things to be infinitely civilized and yet, in a way, infinitely wild at the same time. He loved savages. He felt that savages who put on war paint and feathers and beads were as marvelous as women with makeup. When he talked about having to manipulate nature and change nature and alter nature and disguise nature, he didn't just mean civilization, he also meant what to him was the opposite of civilization. He meant primitive men and women who made themselves into wonderful fetish objects. And so -- I mean, as far as fashion is concerned -- I agree with him. I don't think there can be, quote unquote natural fashion. MUGLER: Exactly. We have to be frank. You know, nudity is great. The body is beautiful. But the minute that you put on clothes, this is an act of civilization. So I don't believe in natural fashion, either. Let's go for it! The corset. The push-up bra. Everything! If we do it, let's do the whole number. Linda, it sounds to me as if your theory is not so much that the woman is natural but that the person is natural and the woman artificial. MUGLER: Not only the woman but the whole mythology of femininity. NOCHLIN: Exactly. But I would also tie it in to certain postmodernist ideas about the self -- that there is no self, even. That the self is a condition of disguise and that we can move back and forth in terms of sexualities, in terms of social being, in terms of all kinds of senses of who we are. And I think fashion helps us wonderfully in this. That's why, in a sense, I would say that fashion is the postmodern art, because it helps to destabilize the self in such a wonderful way.",1994-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Mitchell, to stand firm for the idea of health insurance for all Americans, largely financed by employer payments, rather than make concessions before debate begins, two prominent Democrats said. They said the Clintons were encouraged to think he would. Democratic leaders say they have a chance to pass such legislation in the House -- as long as their supporters believe the effort is being pressed in the Senate as well. THE WHITE HOUSE Mrs. Clinton went to Portland, Ore., to kick off a cross-country bus trip organized by supporters of national health insurance. ""If we do not guarantee health insurance to all Americans, then we have failed all Americans,"" she told passengers. LOBBYISTS Allan S. Huston, the president of Pizza Hut, told the Senate Labor Committee that requiring employers to pay for workers' health insurance would mean lost jobs, lower wages and closed businesses. He conceded that the company offers health benefits to workers in several foreign countries but said the company was able to expand its business faster without them. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the committee, told Mr. Huston, ""You think you ought to get a free ride in the United States of America.""",1994-07-23T05:00:00+0000

The acquisition, which was announced in late May, bolsters the Pittsburgh-based food company's position in Britain, where Farley's sells 70 percent of its products. Farley's also sells infant formula, baby food and other nutritional products in Ireland, Pakistan, New Zealand and East Asia. In addition to Farley's, Heinz is close to completing its previously announced acquisition of Glaxo Holdings' baby food business in India for about $70 million. A Heinz official said yesterday that an announcement could come in several weeks. Boots bought Farley's from Glaxo in 1986. Heinz is the leading seller of baby food outside the United States. Heinz also makes Starkist tuna, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and pet food. Over all, the company ranks second to the Gerber Products Company.",1994-07-23T05:00:00+0000

Patrons and Projects, 1892-1912 (Yale University, $60). The author, an assistant curator of European painting at the Art Institute of Chicago, examines Vuillard's work during the two decades in which he created decorative panels and screens for some of his affluent patrons. His first efforts, for a Paris industrialist, established many of the themes Vuillard (1868-1940) would explore in his subsequent decorations: domestic scenes on a terrace, vignettes in a dressmaking studio, images of nursemaids with children in public gardens. Ms. Groom stresses that perhaps more than the choice of subject or format, Vuillard's use of distemper -- a technique requiring the fast and arduous application of a mixture of glue and pigment to obtain a tapestrylike surface -- signaled his concern for the decorative qualities of his work and helped to change ideas about interior decoration and modern esthetics. The book is profusely illustrated with color reproductions not only of Vuillard's work but also of paintings by contemporaries like Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Claude Monet. Sure-footed and fluid, Ms. Groom's highly informative study gives Vuillard's sophisticated decorations the recognition they deserve. CHRISTINE SCHWARTZ HARTLEY",1994-07-24T05:00:00+0000

Everything is connected to everything else: air-conditioning in Texas causes skin cancer in Kazakhstan; whatever anybody does makes everything worse. ""The Environment From Your Backyard to the Ocean Floor"" means to help. It is based principally on articles that appeared in The New York Times from 1990 to 1993; its editors say it is intended to provide readers an understanding of environmental issues by focusing ""on the science that provides, or should provide, the framework for political discussion."" Its 112 articles explore such recent newsworthy subjects as pollution in the former Communist nations, the perils of intelligence to parrots, the dangers of stocking game fish and the contribution of lawn mowers to smog. Threats and disasters occupy most of the book, but interesting sections are devoted to the economic consequences of ecological studies, reassessments of previously identified menaces, and the possible restoration of damaged ecosystems.",1994-07-24T05:00:00+0000

Exploring the same problem with a concentration on France is ASSASSINS OF MEMORY: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust, by Pierre Vidal-Naquet, translated by Jeffrey Mehlman (Columbia University, $15.95).

It is ""as good a one-volume overview of anti-Semitism as exists in English,"" Mark Silk said here in 1992.

His excellent essay is one of 14 commentaries by artists, critics and collectors that complement the 82-year-old French-born artist's work in LOUISE BOURGEOIS: The Locus of Memory. Works 1982-1993 (Brooklyn Museum/Abrams, $45). The subtly lighted photographs perfectly render Ms. Bourgeois's luscious yet disquieting forms -- for example, an array of lotion-pink rubber breasts in ""Mamelles"" (1991) or the odd anemone-like colonies sprouting from sparkling marble in ""Untitled (With Growth)"" (1989). The artist's extraordinary new installations, the ""Cell"" series, are beautifully documented: cubicles of industrial metal fence, rusted and peeling, enclose uncanny assemblages of found objects and finished sculpture, as in ""Cell (Choisy)"" (1990-93), in which a small white marble version of Ms. Bourgeois's family house sits beneath a scale model of a guillotine. The intensely personal nature of Ms. Bourgeois's work, fueled by the artist's deep exploration of her emotions, memories and body, has attracted the admiration of a wide spectrum of artists and critics; the Minimalist artist Richard Serra and the Conceptualist artists Jenny Holzer and Adrian Piper contribute short statements to the book. Her work is an attempt, as she puts it, ""to give meaning and shape to frustration and suffering."" It is this quest that goes beyond the immediate sensory appeal of her sculptures and captivates our sometimes unwilling emotional attention. SIRI HUNTOON",1994-07-31T05:00:00+0000
