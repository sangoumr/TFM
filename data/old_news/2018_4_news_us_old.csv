Starting in the mid-1980s, Manser, a Swiss traveler, decided to live with the Penan, an indigenous tribe that eventually accepted him as one of its own. After several years with the Penan, Manser became an outspoken critic of deforestation on the island, and he disappeared in 2000, presumed dead.

But his profile is solemn: a sharp jawline, chin raised and jutted, tinted sunglasses that appear more fogged-over than tinted, hair sheared short, perhaps by an electric razor. He wears a gray Mao jacket with glinting buttons, the old uniform of the Communist Party of China. He is an ambassador or a poseur, a visitor out of time and place, his manner ruthlessly aloof, his impression of his surroundings comically unreadable. He visits Disneyland and requests photos with Goofy and Mickey, who bend and mug as he stands upright with customary self-protecting stiffness.

One novel looks at gun culture; another explores how feminism has changed over the years.

Less topical, but still fascinating, is Yunte Huangs thorough history of the 19th-century conjoined twins Chang and Eng.

But this wasnt any kind of self-hatred thing. Ms. Thompson-Spires was inspired by James McCune Smith, a 19th-century abolitionist and doctor whose brief stories about various characters were published under the title Heads of the Colored People, Done With a Whitewash Brush. In an authors note, Ms. Thompson-Spires writes that, like the work of Smith and some of his contemporaries, including William J. Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in black U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.

In the show, William Hurt, Ron Silver and Harvey Keitel all play showroom model prototypes of a sexual psychosis we now call toxic masculinity, as provoked by Cynthia Nixon, Sigourney Weaver and Judith Ivey. You can see them all now as icons, but back then they were like ions  in kinetic motion, orchestrated by the shaper of all molecules, director Mike Nichols. Consider also that a gamine Nixon, 18 at the time, was in two shows concurrently: She had to race back and forth between this raging behemoth of an American play and a cleareyed British one, Tom Stoppards The Real Thing, just a few blocks away, where she provided wisdom beyond her years to Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close, again agitated into motion by Nichols.",2018-04-16T09:50:04+0000

A product of the fertile downtown Manhattan musical scene, centered around the CBGB club on the Bowery, she had gone pop with a series of hit singles, including Blondies Rapture, which reached No. 1 in 1981. The track, a tribute to an uptown musical culture that most Americans viewed as a curiosity or fad (if they had any awareness of it at all), name-checked a few seminal New York figures, including Grandmaster Flash, the pioneering D.J. whose group the Furious Five formed in 1976 and broke musical ground at house parties in the South Bronx before cracking into the Top 100 in 1982 with the socially conscious rap anthem The Message, and Fab 5 Freddy, a Brooklyn-based graffiti artist who acted as a liaison between street artists, the commercial art world and downtown clubs. At the urging of Blondies Harry and the bands guitarist Chris Stein, S.N.L. booked the Bronxs Funky 4 + 1 (four male rappers and pioneering female M.C. Sha-Rock) to perform their single Thats the Joint for the shows final number of the night. Harrys rapped verse on Rapture was, for most people, a proxy introduction to hip-hop, but it was the Funky 4 + 1 that gave network television viewers the first true taste of what young New Yorkers had been experiencing in parks, subways and schoolyards for several years already.",2018-04-16T16:57:59+0000

It was a career move suggested by Diana Vreeland, the former editor of American Vogue who was by then a curator to the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Costume Institute in Manhattan. I wanted to design textiles, the 79-year-old Herrera recalls. I came to see Diana, and I told her my story and asked whether she liked the idea or not. And she said, My God, thats very boring. Why dont you do something else, connected with fashion? Why dont you do a collection? So she did. It was around 20 outfits, on a group of models corralled with help from her friend, the designer Bill Blass. It was shown at the Metropolitan Club, an august private social club founded in 1891 by J.P.

It made little headway  perhaps due to Cold War-era fears of Communist China  before it was rechristened in honor of the equally fuzzy kiwi bird. But not until the early 80s did it begin appearing with merciless persistence at restaurants across Manhattan, in tart after tart, fruit salads, compotes and even savory dishes, lending an algal tinge to beurre blanc.

Of them he wrote, they plucked and gave me a rod, a shoot of sturdy laurel, a marvelous thing, and breathed into me a divine voice. Homer invoked the muse for his epic poem (Sing to me of the man, Muse) as did Virgil. Over time, the muse became a less incantatory figure and more of a sexual one: The word is commonly used, for example, as a shorthand for the many wives and lovers Pablo Picasso captured in his work. With the rise of the model as celebrity in the latter half of the 20th century, the muse became more objectified. She could be the woman a fashion designer trusted to wear his clothes, both on and off the runway. Or she could be a figure of whom a world-famous photographers lens never tired. These women and their looks  from Misia Serts bohemian opulence at the turn of the last century to Twiggys sprightly boyishness in the 1960s  can be as much an expression of their times as their eras music, literature or even politics.",2018-04-17T12:54:29+0000

Dinner on the Upper East Side with a former president of the United States. These are the moments, large and small, recounted by 36 writers, artists, fashion designers, musicians and more who lived in New York City in the early 80s. Together, this chorus of voices  assembled, edited and condensed  creates a compelling mosaic, revealing a city bustling with creativity but also slowly emerging from its recent near-bankruptcy, with upscale restaurants just blocks away from rubble-filled, graffiti-painted lots.

Both had begun in the 1600s as colonial farmland; by the 19th century, both had transformed into a shopping and entertainment district, with large hotels, upscale department stores, theaters and hundreds of brothels. After the Civil War, the area became an important manufacturing center for textile firms and other industries, and the brothels were gradually replaced by clusters of cast-iron warehouses. By the 1950s, these warehouses were mostly being used for storage or sweatshops, and the neighborhood, increasingly decrepit, earned the nickname Hells Hundred Acres.",2018-04-17T13:04:58+0000

To go alongside, Mr. Salicetti has come up with cocktails like a sesame colada with mangosteen, and the El Paso, combining baijiu with Lillet, lime, Sichuan pepper, cucumber and cilantro. His bar is stocked with more than 30 baijius, including some infused with herbs in-house.

us,11 New Books We Recommend This Week,"With this weeks selection of titles, we put ourselves into the hands of experts: expert storytellers, expert thinkers, expert biographers of expert subjects. For instance? As the founding curator of the New York Public Librarys photography collection, Julia Van Haaften is a leading authority on the citys rich photographic heritage  surely the right person to have produced the first major biography of Berenice Abbott, the larger-than-life artist who captured and defined New York City in some of the 20th centurys most arresting images. Read that, and spend some time lingering over the photos. Also for instance: We recommend fiction by the celebrated masters Thomas McGuane and Richard Powers  whose new novel, The Overstory, is reviewed by Barbara Kingsolver, speaking of experts  and nonfiction by Hannah Arendt (about politics), Barbara Ehrenreich (about mortality) and Ross Douthat (about the Catholic Church under Pope Francis). Other choices include a family memoir, a debut novel about a single gay mother, a ghost story and a Nordic thriller with shades of The Silence of the Lambs. And if the Abbott biography gets you thinking about the character and destiny of cities, you might want to settle in with Ben Austens High-Risers, about the ill-fated Cabrini-Green projects in Chicago. Its not a happy story, but its an important one, and Austen, a journalist who frequently writes about urban planning and housing issues, tells it expertly and well.",2018-04-19T17:32:54+0000

They will serve some beers and wines, and can stir a proper martini, but thats beside the point. Their drinks are listed as nonalcoholic (sophisticated, at times sparkling, and priced at $15, the same as the alcoholic selections), carbonated, shaken, stirred straight up or on a big rock. Those in a hurry can buy bottled cocktails from vending machines with a $15 token. The ingredients they use are often extracted in a centrifuge or chilled with liquid nitrogen. But aside from such techniques, the cocktails are simple and focused, not assembled with a pantryload of components like many concoctions these days. These drinks are all flavor-driven, Mr. Arnold said. Mr. Lee added that they intended to show off ingredients in drinks like the delicious nonalcoholic Doyenne with clarified Comice pear juice, the fresh-tasting OG Celery with gin and a blast of celery, and the satisfying Professor Plum, which is like an old-fashioned with prune-infused bourbon.

Episodes were directed by the underground filmmaker Amos Poe in a small Manhattan studio using cheap rental equipment, but the guests were well known  or soon would be. The musicians Iggy Pop, George Clinton and Debbie Harry, as well as the artists Robert Mapplethorpe, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Chris Burden all made appearances, starring in improvised performances, mumbled interviews and a call-in segment consisting mostly of stray insults, scattered fan support and the recurring question, What is this all about?",2018-04-24T20:57:57+0000

Justin Strauss first brought a bag of records to spin at the Mudd Club, the downtown New York City bar thats now the stuff of underground lore, the term disc jockey didnt mean much yet  and it certainly didnt evoke celebrity status. It wasnt anything that anyone thought about  I didnt think about it, Strauss says now. I didnt wake up and go, I want to be a D.J. It just sort of happened naturally. He had left New York, his hometown, to live in Los Angeles with his power-pop group Milk n Cookies. The band eventually split and his then-girlfriend persuaded him to come back to the city. She said, You gotta come. This club opened up and youd be great to play your records there, he remembers. This was the era of the slick, moneyed glamour of Studio 54, and the Mudd Club was, in many ways, a reaction to it. There were no rules  you could play a rockabilly song next to a rap song or a reggae song or the Buzzcocks or whatever it was  it all made sense and everyone danced, he said. As for the crowd, it was just a mix of downtown kids, artists  Keith Haring, Jean-Michel [Basquiat]. Strauss spent the rest of the decade spinning at big  and now shuttered  clubs like Area, the Ritz, Tunnel and Limelight. He ultimately began remixing and producing original tracks; he still D.J.s around the world and has a show on the Lot Radio, based in Brooklyn.",2018-04-27T18:26:23+0000
