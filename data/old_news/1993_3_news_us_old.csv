us,"Good Writer, Perfect Wife","As ANNE MORROW LINDBERGH: A Gift for Life (Ticknor & Fields, $24.95) attests, the popular writer and wife of the country's most celebrated and controversial aviator was shy from childhood, unsure of her writing talent and convinced she was unsuited to the demands of her tumultuous life with Charles A. Lindbergh, whom she met two years after his historic 1927 flight. The Lindberghs' 45-year marriage forms the centerpiece of this thoroughgoing portrait by Dorothy Herrmann, whose previous biography was of S. J. Perelman. Although Harold Nicolson described Mrs. Lindbergh with blithe condescension as ""an adorable little person,"" she proved equal to the dangerous, even death-defying pioneer flights she later wrote about, on which she accompanied her famous husband, serving as co-pilot, radio operator and all-round good sport. In 1932, she endured the kidnapping and murder of their firstborn son and the relentless press coverage the event produced. Later she weathered the fall from public grace that the couple experienced over Lindbergh's rigidly isolationist and pro-Nazi views, aspects of which she shared. While Ms. Herrmann seems intent on rescuing Mrs. Lindbergh's lyrical if occasionally cloying writings (13 books of nonfiction, poetry, fiction and memoir in addition to her 1955 best seller ""Gift From the Sea""), her subject ultimately trips up the biographer. Because Mrs. Lindbergh placed duty to her husband before devotion to her craft, Ms. Herrmann suggests, her longevity as a writer was compromised. ""In a sense,"" she writes, Lindbergh ""and their extraordinary life together were her only subject."" If that is so, then perhaps it is no coincidence that Mrs. Lindbergh, now 86 years old, has published virtually nothing since 1974, the year her husband died.",1993-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Consenting Adults,"In the thoughtful, laudatory essay at the end of MAPPLETHORPE (Random House, $125), a selection of 280 black-and-white photographs taken by Robert Mapplethorpe from 1972 until his death in 1989 -- studies of faces, flowers, navels, nipples, penises, celebrities and sadomasochists -- Arthur C. Danto raises the issue of consent. Unlike Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand or Diane Arbus, who all caught their subjects off guard, unaware or simply not knowing how they would look, Mapplethorpe got his subjects' full trust because he was part of their world. The thrill of these photographs, writes Mr. Danto, the art critic for The Nation, is that of ""the child who finds it delicious to be thrown in the air, certain his father will not let him fall."" Thus, rather than catching the suspicious glare and passionate flurry of hostile strangers, Mapplethorpe caught the calm, clear look of those who want to be seen, say, urinating into the mouth of a friend, or up to their elbows in someone else's anus. Whether he was photographing the artist Alice Neel's ragged face when she was near death, or his roommate, the singer Patti Smith, nude and clutching some radiator pipes like a mental patient, or Mr. 10 1/2 exhibiting his organ on a table like a slab of meat, the staginess, the stillness, the symmetry all indicate Mapplethorpe's subjects were not just about to walk out of his viewfinder or his world. But what did he get from the luxury of consent? In a word, domestication. Even the most shocking photographs are tamed by the permission implicit in them. The picture of Elliott grabbing the testicles of Dominick, who is chained upside down, is so planned that it looks, as Mr. Danto says, like ""a fisherman being photographed next to some immense tuna he has caught."" And one of the best shots, ""Man in a Polyester Suit,"" featuring a smooth, uncircumcised penis lolling out of a man's fly, is funny because it is so offhand. Mapplethorpe got so much permission for so many things that he made us forget, at least occasionally, what he was getting away with.",1993-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Still, the neighbors are different indeed. Merrill has molded itself into a model of a diversified, profitable securities firm; Shearson aspires to do the same, but has much to overcome. Merrill Lynch's growth has been largely internal, with no major acquisitions in the past 10 years; Shearson was a second-tier firm until it acquired Lehman Brothers, a leading trading and corporate finance firm, in 1984 and the troubled E.

us,Author! Author!,"1. I've seen the Atlantic: pretty but frantic. / I've faced the Pacific: nothing specific. / As for the continent, I'm not yet on to it. 2. Any noun on which my eyes rested, a hill across the harbor, a lane between the fishermen's shacks, silently returned two sounds, one the patois, the other English. 3. It seemed a haunted land. I thought of witches, of the kingdom of Medea. 4. But as I walk the streets of San Francisco, many of them have, for me, a familiar ring: Kearny, O'Farrell, Larkin, Geary, McAllister -- obviously some of my countrymen have left their mark here. 5. Off the packed trail we experience the miracle of corn snow, skiing atop the crust, like skiing on an eggshell that has been sprinkled with sugar. 6. Recently I returned to the old migration route of the Kiowas. I had in me a need to behold again some of the principal landmarks of that long, prehistoric quest, to descend again from the mountain to the plain. 7. There was a time when senescent gentlemen and ladies, down by the seawall, used to walk their dogs at the cocktail hour with leash in one hand and a martini in the other. 8. When the spirit of adventure invades the historical process -- when states or their leaders or representatives go adventuring -- the results are usually catastrophic. 9. One morning in Stockholm, after rain and just before November, a mysteriously translucent shadow began to paint itself across the top of the city. 10. For the Rock and the desert are not nullities. They have astonishing beauty and subtle habits, the desert seeming to overflow with an Old Testament plenty, the Rock shedding its skin evenly, through the process called spalling, like a live serpent. 11. But Salem is a different matter. It takes its name from no English county or cathedral town, and one comes to it without the weight of nostalgic associations. 12. Paris with its long humanistic tradition, as a city known to value and respect those who create, was for the Tournon Crowd both a cultural and racial haven. 13. The sally is the first tree to green and the first to wither; the rowan berries are an incredible orange in the light from the lakes each September. 14. Parisian gloom is not simply climatic, it is a spiritual force that acts not only on building materials, on walls and rooftops, but also on your character, your opinions and judgments. 15. Like the Pharoahs, the landscape itself is dead, enlivened only by the tourists who lend some movement and color to a barren and mortuary area. 16. The next time I look, the sky above the far peaks has been painted with broad streaks of brilliant orange on a ground of cerulean, the last stars are fading overhead, and the bay is silent. Then the voices of the waking birds begin. 17. Speaking of venison, I do remember my first haunch. 18. It isn't necessarily the great and famous beauty spots we fall in love with. As with people, so with places: Love is unforeseen, and we can all find ourselves affectionately attached to the minor and the less obvious. 19. From the coastal bluffs to the north, I now realize, I could easily watch Kurile seals cut the wild, jade-green water of the ocean. Such animals draw a visitor quickly out of himself and into the land -- the sight of them alone is exhilarating. 20. We have watched the Nakhi women coming down from the Snow Range, with their bundles of pine and artemisia; and one old woman with a bamboo winnowing basket on her back, and the sun's rays passing through it.

Beyond it lay a no man's land of which one knew nothing and into which one never penetrated. Islington? Fulham? Where on earth is that, my dear? This heartland is the square contained roughly within Piccadilly Circus to the east, Curzon Street to the west, Green Park and Pall Mall to the south and Savile Row to the north. And the certain kind of person is the well-heeled upper-class nob of yesteryear. Actually, such people are still around, but sparser and less prosperous, and their children -- or grandchildren -- are probably living in Islington or Fulham and considering themselves fortunate. But, once upon a time, from around the middle of the 19th century until around the middle of this century, for a particular bunch of privileged people, London meant simply that small group of streets and buildings, highly esteemed for their central location, which satisfied their every need. You did your shopping there, you wined and dined there. If you were a man, your club was there, to which you resorted daily to escape your family with a bout of male bonding. If you were a lady (and you were in every sense, of course), you stayed at Brown's Hotel when you came up from your country home, met your friends at the Ritz for lunch or tea, bought your groceries at Fortnum & Mason and maybe stopped into the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House for a drop of culture. Old Bond Street provided your clothes and jewelry. Your husband had his suits made on Savile Row and bought his shoes and shirt on Jermyn Street. You might make the occasional foray to Knightsbridge, but you would barely have heard of Oxford Street, let alone Kensington High Street.

Aamodt, who won gold medals in the slalom and giant slalom in the world championships at Shizukuishi, Japan, in February, covered 1.35 miles of the Ruthie's Run course in 1 minute 17.48 seconds, as the second racer down the mountain. The race was free of controversy, a marked change from Saturday, when the men's downhill was canceled after 16 racers, with the American A.J. Kitt in the lead and virtually assured of victory. Race organizers had said the downhill would be rerun yesterday, but it turned out that this was contractually impossible, so an extra downhill will be added at another race site later this month. Kitt couldn't duplicate his great run of Saturday, finishing 1.73 seconds behind Aamodt in a tie for 35th place. (AP) Compagnoni Finds Her Form: Capping a yearlong comeback, Deborah Compagnoni of Italy returned to the top of the medal podium for the first time since the 1992 Winter Olympics. She did so by winning a World Cup super-giant slalom race in Morzine, France. Compagnoni's super-G gold-medal celebration in Albertville, France, ended suddenly two days later when she tore left-knee ligaments in the giant slalom. She has struggled to regain her winning form. With the help and support of her occasional training partner, Alberto Tomba, Compagnoni made consistent progress early this season. Yesterday, Compagnoni charged down the 1,700-meter course in 1:12.66, edging the super-G world champion, Katja Seizinger of Germany. Seizinger, who secured the World Cup downhill title with a victory Saturday, was second in 1:12.80. (AP) GOLF Geiberger Feels Better Despite feeling weak, Al Geiberger closed with a four-under-par 66 yesterday to capture the $500,000 Senior GTE Classic in Ojai, Calif., by two shots. Geiberger's three-day total of 198 left him $75,000 richer. Isao Aoki carded a five-under 65 to tie the second-round leader, George Archer, at 10-under 200. Chi Chi Rodriguez was fourth at 201, and a new senior, Tom Weiskopf, was fifth at 202. Weiskopf won last week's Chrysler Cup in his Senior Tour debut. (AP) SOCCER U.S. Routs Turkey Chris Faklaris scored three goals last night as the United States upset the European champion, Turkey, 6-0, in Melbourne, Australia, in its opening match of the World Youth championship. The Americans scored three goals in each half as they surprised the Turkish team with a succession of whirlwind attacks. Miles Joseph scored two goals and Imad Baba had the other for the Americans. The next match for the Americans is against England. (AP) TENNIS Olhovsky Wins Twice Andrei Olhovsky of Russia won his first two ATP Tour tournament titles yesterday by winning in the singles and the doubles finals at the $175,000 Copenhagen Open. Olhovsky, ranked 87th in the world, upset No. 5-seeded Nicklas Kulti of Sweden, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, to take the singles crown in 1 hour 50 minutes. In doubles, the 26-year-old from Moscow teamed with David Adams of Australia to down the Czech Republic's Martin Damm and Daniel Vacek, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. (AP) AUTO RACING That Roar Is Allison Davey Allison finally got into high gear after a disappointing start to the 1993 Nascar Winston Cup season, overpowering the field yesterday en route to a record-setting victory in the Pontiac Excitement 400 in Richmond. Allison, who previously won at Richmond International Raceway in September 1988, the first race on the current three-quarter mile oval, came from 14th place to dominate the second half of the 400-lap, 300-mile event. His average speed of 107.709 miles an hour broke the track record of 105.397 set in February 1991 by Dale Earnhardt. Allison's Ford Thunderbird led three times for 155 laps, including the final 42 laps, and crossed the finish line 4.38 seconds ahead of the Pontiac Grand Prix of runner-up Rusty Wallace. It was the 19th career victory for the 32-year-old, second-generation stock car star. (AP)",1993-03-08T05:00:00+0000

He had seen a photo of a similar bent-metal device in Europe. Soon, he had patented the modular connection that allows the units to be assembled vertically or horizontally.

On a distant planet a race of people who superficially resemble humans lives at the foot of a mountain so steep and so tall that it is known as the Wall. Their myths tell of a Prometheus-like First Climber who ascended the Wall and brought back useful knowledge from the gods who live at the summit. In honor of this First Climber, the people periodically choose 40 of their best and brightest as Pilgrims, who try to climb the Wall and parley with the gods.

us,Business Diary/March 14-19,"THE ECONOMY A House Cheer for the Budget Plan; Next: The Messy Part So far, so good for the Clinton vision of the economic future. In a ringing show of unity, nearly all the House Democrats came into line behind their President last week, as the House passed his broad deficit-cutting plan with a solid majority. With Senate action expected this week, final passage is possible before lawmakers break for Easter. With a goal of cutting the $300 billion deficit to below $200 billion in four years, the resolution would set firm limits on total spending and taxes. In a sense, though, this is the easy part.

Kemp advocates an inclusive brand of conservatism that threatens the status quo moderates and social-engineering bureaucrats alike. It is no wonder that he failed to institute a far-reaching anti-poverty policy. Nevertheless, Kemp has set a new direction for modern conservatism by moving it into the realm of state-fostered privatization. He proposes to do nothing less than to use the Federal Government as an instrument of its own diminution. This greatly explains his widening appeal.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
How to Get a Head","Contrary to what one might expect of a study of 18th-century English portraiture, HANGING THE HEAD: Portraiture and Social Formation in Eighteenth-Century England (Yale University, $65) contains little by way of extended analysis of the work of such well-known practitioners of the genre as Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough or George Romney. Rather it aspires to demonstrate, in the ambitious, quasi-sociological manner of the newer art history, ""what portraiture meant in terms of 18th-century English culture and society."" As Marcia Pointon shows in her highly discerning discussions of several ""conversation pieces"" (a favorite 18th-century subgenre that depicted placid family groups in domestic settings), portraits served as ""a form of quasi-legal genealogical statement"" for both the aristocracy and the gentry. One chapter of ""Hanging the Head"" is devoted to the physical location of portraits, establishing how and where they were hung (hence the rather awkward title). Elsewhere Ms. Pointon, who teaches art history at the University of Manchester, considers portraiture as a trade, ""a highly developed business in a buyer's market,"" detailing how even successful portrait painters were forced to endure the almost unbelievable arrogance and penuriousness of aristocratic patrons. The oddest but not the least fascinating chapter, entitled ""Dangerous Excrescences: Wigs, Hair and Masculinity,"" sets forth in extraordinary detail the fetishistic significance of the wigs seen in so many portraits of 18th-century gentlemen. When Ms. Pointon does pause to scrutinize individual works -- a series of portraits of prepubescent girls, portraits of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in Turkish dress -- her analyses can be brilliant and arrestingly phrased.",1993-03-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Using ones Head: The Bad Haircut as Star Turn,"They must be really acting if they've got such geeky hair. That's the hidden message behind the conspicuously awful haircuts of some current leading men. An actor with bad hair is the equivalent of an actress doing an unglamorous turn (think of Cher looking plain in ""Moonstruck"") -- a sign he cares so much about his art, he's willing to ugly up. Here is a sampler of top stars who have been acting with their hair. Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"" -- The nerd du jour look says emphatically that this is not Michael Douglas, sex symbol. No nude posteriors, no ice picks. The seriously bad hair also says that this is a movie with a message, though the message may be that Mr. Douglas is paying homage to. . . Al Pacino in ""The Godfather Part III"" -- This is the haircut that was so distracting, some people couldn't pay attention to the movie. Who knows why the aging Michael Corleone got a spiky brush-cut? Maybe the porcupine look was supposed to keep rival families away. Kevin Costner in ""The Bodyguard"" -- This cut perpetuates the myth that secret service agents have to look as conspicuous as possible. Some people have speculated that this bad hair is an homage to Steve McQueen, for whom the movie was originally written. More likely it is an homage to . . . Harrison Ford in ""Presumed Innocent"" -- There are two possible explanations for this cut. As a dedicated lawyer, the Ford character wants to look like Julius Caesar. Or, the hair is a red herring, deflecting attention from the true murderer and any holes in the plot. Robert De Niro in ""Mad Dog and Glory"" -- Sometimes he gains 50 pounds to play a role. Sometimes he gets his hair cut the way it must have looked in third grade. Living with this 'do inspired him in playing the meek, mild-mannered Mad Dog. Robin Williams in ""Toys"" -- No, he isn't entering a Barry Manilow look-alike contest. The dyed-blond hair suggests a man so in touch with his inner child that his hair has never darkened. Or, maybe he's just trying to look like Rod Stewart. Sean Connery in ""Medicine Man"" -- In this classic hair strategy, the ponytail compensates for a receding hairline. The character, a scientist who has spent years in the jungle, could be an aging hippy, or a SoHo art dealer who hasn't heard that the 80's are over. Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" -- The ultimate in Romantic hair. Never mind that the character is engaged in the French and Indian War. In another century, Keats and Shelley would have killed for hair like this. For that matter, so would have Madame Bovary.",1993-03-21T05:00:00+0000

In light of that, DeParle's article was particularly ironic. Jack Kemp defied traditional Republican conservative ideology by fiercely advocating the cause of America's poor and downtrodden. It's a tribute to Kemp that his ideals have been embraced by members of all political persuasions and that he continues to be a favorite among conservatives. To portray Kemp's efforts in any other way is patently unfair. Even staunch supporters of the Bush Administration recognize that housing issues were low on the budgetary priority list. It is a credit to Kemp that he continued to battle for what he believed was right despite constant opposition. Perhaps the new administration will be more responsive to the nation's housing crisis.

Others assert that the real revival came during World War II, when nostalgia for the ""peaceful world"" of his novels brought solace to war-ravaged Britain. Still others believe he has been resurrected only lately, through the television serialization of the Palliser novels in the 1970's and of the Barchester novels in the 1980's. And some date the Trollope revival from the founding of the London-based Trollope Society in 1987, an organization that has successfully lobbied for Trollope's entry into Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey.

us,Q and A,"Post-Bankruptcy Prospects Question: In 1990, we were forced to file for bankruptcy. Now we are finally back on our feet financially and would like to purchase a small home of our own. Can we get a mortgage? . . . Fernando Carrion, the Bronx. Answer: Yes, but it won't be easy. According to Beryl Riley, a mortgage manager with Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, your best bet may be secondary lenders, such as Champion Mortgage, which may also charge you a higher rate. Mortgage brokers may also help you find a lender. Some banks, such as Chase Manhattan, will consider an application from someone with a bankruptcy on his credit report, but only if there is a full discharge of the bankruptcy and the borrower has established good or secured credit. Further, two years should have elapsed since the bankruptcy discharge, three years if there is a down payment of less than 20 percent. Also, it should be documented that extraordinary circumstances caused the bankruptcy, such as an extended illness that was not covered by health insurance, and that the event is not likely to occur again. Escrow Accounts Question: I recently refinanced my mortgage, a fixed rate on a private single-family residence. My bank, however, has refused to give me a current escrow analysis. Who regulates escrow accounts? Can I ask my bank for a complete escrow analysis more than once a year? . . . Randy Hunt, Locust Valley, L.I. Answer: No. According to Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Banking, escrow issues are governed by the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which describes how escrow accounts are done, including how often escrow analyses can be requested. She added that analyses must be given annually, but no more often unless the lender desires. If the loan is refinanced by the same lender, the same rule applies. If a new lender refinances, then a new analysis is made. Security Deposit Question: My security deposit for my apartment is in a savings account under the name of the owner. I have a letter from her bank verifying that this account is separate from the owner's other accounts. But who is entitled to the accumulated interest? Also, the owner lives on the West Coast and travels extensively. How can I make sure that my deposit will be returned? Can I not pay my last month's rent? . . . K.A. Hanson, Manhattan Answer: Maybe. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, when a landlord takes a security deposit it must be placed in a trust account and segregated from other money. Technically, he added, the account also has to be in the tenant's name.",1993-03-28T05:00:00+0000

Greenblatt is a Renaissance scholar, by now easily the most prominent of his generation. But in 1982, when he coined the term ""new historicism,"" he was not looking to found a school of criticism. He merely wanted to argue for a critical method that situates a work of art in its historical context and at the same time breaks down the boundaries ""between artistic production and other kinds of social production"" -- that is, between art and other historical traces, including just about anything from a royal utterance to a tract on hermaphrodites or a pamphlet on exorcism.",1993-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Hot Ticket,"WHAT: New York Knicks tickets. Those big ones to die for, those 3-by-7-inch color postcards posing as ducats. They cost $400 apiece and the two above would place you and a friend at courtside amid the celebrity elite at the season finale against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls: a chance to wave at Woody or have the Adonis-like Knicks forward Anthony Mason land in your lap. Gaze at the tickets now. Cut them out. Frame them. You may never see them again. At least not in your hand. Or your lifetime. WHAT ELSE: Cheaper Knicks tickets ($12 to $75) are scarcer than humility in George Steinbrenner or hair on Burt Reynolds's head. Thirty-three of the Knicks' 35 home games have sold out. Even scalpers need scalpers. WHERE: Madison Square Garden, 33d Street and Seventh Avenue. CULTURAL BENEFITS: Knicks games have become a nexus of New York culture (or stars just in from wherever), making the gaggle of glitterati that once accompanied Jack Nicholson and his sunglasses to courtside of Los Angeles Lakers games seem underpopulated. It is where film meets hip-hop meets politics meets sports. Only Swifty Lazar's Oscar-night party matches this eclectic turnout. WHO: There's Spike Lee in one of the 58 $400 courtside seats. And John McEnroe, Ronald Perelman, LL Cool J and Ahmad Rashad. Right behind the Knicks bench in his $75 club seat is Woody Allen (no longer spotted with Soon-Yi Farrow Previn). And there's Danny Aiello and Ed Bradley, Bill Murray and Peter Falk, Gloria Estefan and Senator Bill Bradley, Hammer and Rodney Dangerfield, Smokey Robinson and Dustin Hoffman, all sitting courtside. BENEFITS OF THE CULTURALLY ADVANTAGED: Star: ""Hello, this is Arnold. I'm holding up traffic in Times Square while I film my current movie. I'd like two at courtside, please."" Garden: ""Why, of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger, we always keep eight courtside seats available for cultural icons and gazillionaires like yourself we'd like to showcase in our arena. Will any of the other Kennedys be accompanying you tonight?"" FASHION TIPS FOR THE SARTORIALLY DEPRIVED: The best seat affords scrutiny of Knicks Coach Pat Riley, poster boy for Giorgio Armani. Mr. Riley is a GQ dream, a man whom suits were made for and whom designers would love to dress and send down a runway. He may perspire in those immaculately tailored suits but he wouldn't let it show. When his Armani pants were split during a free-for-all last week against Phoenix, the rip was repaired at halftime. WATCH THE GAME, GET A DANCE: Except for eccentric Dancing Harry, who used to boogie in the stands and hex rival teams during the Knicks' heyday of the 1970's, the Garden had been dance needy until the Knicks City Girls arrived in 1991. The troupe of 15 Paula Abdul wannabes (Ms. Abdul, by the way, is an ex-Laker Girl) have eight outfits from which to choose during their halftime, timeout and between-quarters rock, rap, hip-hop and techno numbers. FUTURE AS HIP HANGOUT: As long as they win. But watch the Knicks crash in the playoffs, and Spike & Company will cross the Hudson for New Jersey Nets games. Stars have already abandoned the Lakers for the Clippers in Los Angeles, so there's precedent. Stars don't want to be seen with losers. It's boring. It's embarrassing. Would Arnold call if the Knicks had 19 victories and 45 losses? Does he go to Dallas Mavericks games? Get out of here.",1993-03-28T05:00:00+0000

In May 1979, swollen by melting snow, the Ob began eating away at its banks at a Siberian town called Kolpashevo. As the flood waters gnawed deeper into the base of the river bank, the earth and sand that crumbled into the water disclosed a mass of human skeletons. Beneath this strata of bones was another layer: whole corpses. Buried in dry, cold sand that lay just on top of permafrost, they had not decomposed; they had been mummified.

Other shapes are starkly simple, clinging to the figure or floating sinuously away. Colors are somber yet radiate with depth. Fabrics like velvet, knit, leather, tweed, jersey, georgette and sheer wool are sensual to the touch. Hats snuggle down, while boots muffle up. Accessories are dramatic by dint of their scarcity.

'No Legs No Jokes No Chance'","The transformation of Helburn's Folly into ""Oklahoma!"" should be an inspiration to anyone who has the courage to keep saying yes when everyone else says no -- no to the possibility of turning a play that flopped into a musical, no to investing in a musical with no stars, no chorus line and no glitzy opening number. (One potential backer declined to invest in the play, saying, ""I don't like plays about farmhands."") In fact, as Max Wilk relates in OK! The Story of ""Oklahoma!"" (Grove, $24.95), Walter Winchell's secretary, seeing the play at a New Haven tryout in 1943, wired her boss: ""No legs no jokes no chance."" What the show did have proved far more important: a brilliant, lyrical score by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, in their first collaboration; a series of of extraordinary dances choreographed by Agnes de Mille, featuring ballet dancers instead of chorus girls; and a script that took the minds of theatergoers off World War II by celebrating the innocence, vitality and grandeur of the American West. Mr. Wilk, whose many books include ""The Golden Age of Television"" and ""Every Day's a Matinee,"" tells the story with vigor, relying whenever possible on the words of the participants -- including, besides Miss de Mille, Rodgers and Hammerstein, the producer Theresa Helburn, the director Rouben Mamoulian, the conductor Jay Blackton and the costume designer Miles White. When the Broadway production closed on May 29, 1948, after 2,212 performances, it had been seen by more than 4.5 million people. On its 50th birthday, Mr. Wilk concludes, "" 'Oklahoma!' remains our precious promissory note on an America that was.""",1993-03-28T05:00:00+0000
