us,'The Bonfire of the Vanities'," Now comes Tom Wolfe, aging enfant terrible, with his first novel, (his first novel!), six hundred and fifty-nine pages of raw energy about New York City and various of its inhabitants - a big, bitter, funny, craftily plotted book that grabs you by the lapels and won't let go. As in much of his other work, such as ''The Right Stuff,'' Mr. Wolfe's strategy is to somehow batter the reader into submission, using an incantatory repetition of certain emblematic phrases, (HIS FIRST NOVEL!), detailed description of people's clothing, hyperbole, interior monologue whenever he feels like it, and various other New Journalism devices he is apparently too fond of to give up. What is amazing is that he gets away with it. I read ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' straight through, in two sessions on two consecutive days, and enjoyed it enormously. It swept me right up. When he writes about process he knows what he is writing about, whether it's the Wall Street bond market, the Bronx District Attorney's Office, print and television journal-ism, or the working habits of sleazy lawyers -the man knows how to prepare and he knows how to research. As well, he knows how to tell a story, and how to make us laugh, qualities not always present in the work of some of the more polished, more literary or ultimately more ambitious novelists of his generation.

us,Purcell Amid Statuesque Postures,"Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' belongs not only to the early history of opera but also, as Thursday's performance at Florence Gould Hall reminded us, to that of ballet. Within the defective score that has come down to us, dances have their places in a chain of events that also includes songs, dialogues and choruses, but probably in a 17th-century performance the infiltration of dancing went further. Graceful movement and posing would have been expected of the soloists as much as beautiful singing, and members of the chorus, in their bodies and the spacing of their bodies, would have given a visual equivalent to their music. All this would make sense, whether the work was written for a girls' school in London or, as modern scholarship implies, for the court of Charles II.",1997-11-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Crazy, Mixed-Up Kids","In MESSAGE TO THE NURSE OF DREAMS (Cinco Puntos, paper, $11.95) Lisa Sandlin displays a deep, instinctive understanding of the ways in which generally close-knit families compulsively bicker and splinter -- and the ways in which a teen-age girl can, unexpectedly, be as concerned about her moral nature as she is about her complexion. Since the stories are set in the rapidly changing social world of the Texas Gulf Coast, Sandlin's characters' inherent confusions are both aggravated and ennobled by racial intermingling. In ''If You Don't Watch Out,'' for example, an adolescent named Mayda gains increasing respect for a courageous black family she first encounters in a local restaurant; in a lighter vein, the story called ''Vidor'' provides a hilarious account of a racially mixed high-school football team. Throughout the collection, Sandlin's stories focus on young women, using their naivete to build moving portrayals of people coming to understand others even as they remain unsure about themselves. This strategy achieves a peak of gritty lyricism in a story called ''Cold in the Bone,'' whose narrator painstakingly puzzles out the behavior of her embattled family -- and of a stricken girl ''who came back to school with my name and affected my life in a way I wished I didn't have to understand.''

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Making Do on Nothing,"Sunlight jabs through the haze of swirling vapors enveloping a tangle of jerry-built huts. The ground is littered with plastic bags, piles of scrap lumber and a capsized bicycle. Nearly lost in the confusion, a mother and child sit by a cooking fire, casually taking a meal. Sebastiao Salgado has earned a reputation as one of the world's greatest photojournalists by creating quiet monuments to the dignity of the poorest of the poor out of the silver light and velvet shadows of their often miserable lives. TERRA: Struggle of the Landless (Phaidon, $55) is a collection of photographs taken in Salgado's native Brazil between 1980 and 1996. Combining some of his most famous images from books like ''An Uncertain Grace'' and ''Workers'' with recent shots, ''Terra'' tells the story of Brazil's rural poor. Facing drought and starvation, many fled the hinterlands for hellish urban shantytowns. Others rose up against landlords in acts of de facto agrarian reform. Salgado's photographs invoke the rich physical, cultural and symbolic texture of these people's lives. His unsparing yet compassionate vision produces images of moments we could not have imagined otherwise. In one picture two young girls stand eating popsicles in the doorway of a store that sells both bananas and child-size coffins. Jake Miller",1997-11-02T05:00:00+0000

Voters looked at referendum options, progressive or reactionary, and came to the same consistent conclusion.

These are long-legged, predominantly gray birds with tinges of rust color and bald red crowns. When they landed, each crane awkwardly hopped a few yards, then held stock-still. In a moment they all displayed outstretched wings as if drying racks of wet neckties. Folding in their wings, they started up an elegant choreography of head-bobbing, slow-motion, high-strutting steps, prowling the stubble field in five different directions. The background distinctly resembled a Rothko painting, its floating color fields -- gray sky on top, reedy beige of the sloping wetlands below -- silhouetted other incoming groups of sandhills against the horizon.

That common-sense idea first came to Carol Gilligan, a developmental psychologist, in the early 70's, when she noticed that researchers were drawing conclusions about girls from studies of boys. In 1975 she published a paper that grew into a landmark book, ''In a Different Voice.''

The original was concocted as an elixir at an apothecary in Paterson in 1891 and then bottled by the Boylan Sodaworks of Paterson. When Prohibition came in, Boylan switched to a cheaper packaging method: unused beer barrels. When Prohibition went out, Boylan decided to jettison its birch beer for the real thing. One of the company's drivers, Frank Fiorina, offered to buy the birch beer formula, the customers and the routes. For decades he made birch beer by night and delivered kegs around northern New Jersey by day, all by himself. His grandsons Ronald and Mark Fiorina got involved in the early 70's, switching to selling it through institutional soda dispensers. Finally, in August 1993, Boylan's got a bottler. Now bottles are sold all over the region, in specialty food stores, cafes, pizzerias and the like.

He was born December 4, 1916 in Boston, MA, the son of Henry A. and Edith Sherman Morss. He graduated from the Fessenden School in Newton, MA, St. George's School in Newport, RI and from Harvard College in the class of 1938. He worked for his family's Boston based business, Simplex, a cable and wire company, for many years as the controller and treasurer. After he retired he pursued his true love of yachting. He started sailing at the age of five and sailed all his life. He was a member of the Cruising Club of America. He sailed in races all over the world winning race after race in his 52 foot, Sparkman and Stephens yawl, ''Legend.'' Some of the races he won included Bermuda races, Halifax races, and transatlantic races, Fastnet and races to Spain. Some of his world sails included sailing from Buenos Aires to Rio De Janiero, Marblehead to Bermuda, and Bermuda to Spain. When he wasn't racing he was helping other skippers bring their boats back. He sailed his last Bermuda race in 1981. He had sailed in 15 regular Bermuda races, 12 of them in his own boat, since his first in the fabled Grenadier in 1934 (after voyaging to England in her for the Fastnet the previous year). He had sailed in 12 Halifax races since 1939, when Grenadier won the Schooner Class, and in 1969 won Class B in the only custom boat he ever owned, the 44 foot Sparkman and Stephens sloop Carillon. He also completed Southern Circuits in his latest Legend, a Swan 48, and Errant in 1973 and 1975. He sailed in 17 of the Portland Yacht Club's Monhegan races, he took home silver more than half the time, and won the race overall twice. He was a member of many yacht clubs throughout the world including for 60 years at the Eastern Yacht Club and Boothbay Harbor Yacht Club. He was a veteran of WWII serving in the U.S. Army. He is survived by his wife, Nancy Rice Morss of West Boothbay Harbor, ME; son John Addel of Franconia, NH; daughter Leslie Morss Kane of Stratham, NH; sisters Eleanor Morss English of Liberty Corner, NY; Virginia Morss Galpin of North Bramford, CT; sister-in-law Elisabeth Morss of Hardwick, MA.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Lunch With a Thousand Eyes,"Go to your local greengrocer. Select a nice bell pepper and rotate it in your hand. Observe it closely. Do you see a rabbit? Never mind, you will. PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD (Stewart, Tabori & Chang, $19.95), by Joost Elffers, might better be called ''Look at Your Food,'' particularly at a panoply of fruits and vegetables that, with a little help, can become something quite other. Some 150 weirdly hilarious photographs document the metamorphoses: pear bears, lemon pigs, okra grasshoppers and bunches of wild-haired people who are really leeks and scallions (the leeks look fashionable, the scallions panic-stricken) are only the beginning. Minimal means are used to produce these transformations; for garlic-clove geese, for example, the peel of each clove has merely been twiddled to suggest the head and neck of the bird in question, while the bell-pepper rabbit is achieved by the simple additions of big almond teeth and snow-pea lop ears. Elffers, an advocate of finding the natural visual puns inherent in his materials, is almost reluctant to give how-to instructions, since he wants his readers to invent their own menageries. Nonetheless, there are recipes for each of the creatures, as well as a section on what materials to use for eyes (peppercorns, olives, black-eyed peas), ears (mostly folded out from the host fruit or vegetable) and, especially, noses. ''Anything that sticks out of a fruit or vegetable is a potential nose,'' Elffers writes, and illustrates that maxim with a gallery of gnarly-nosed jack-o'-lanterns. As a practical note, he suggests that having fun with veggies might help a fussy-eating child to see the light. Perhaps, but doesn't it seem a bit heartless to boil a brussels sprout that you've learned to love as a pig or a goldfish or a hippo? Sarah Ferrell",1997-11-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Botanizing in the Balkans,"In MONTENEGRO (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23), Starling Lawrence has created a stirring account of turn-of-the-century political intrigue -- and an intriguing romance. Even though a prefatory deathbed scene hints at a terrible final tragedy, we read compulsively on, hoping somehow that the inevitable will be avoided. At the center of the novel is a reluctant spy, Auberon Harwell, the agent of a corrupt English peer who hopes to turn British ignorance of the tensions between the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires to his own advantage. Harwell is traveling through the Balkans posing as a botanist, much to the contemptuous disbelief of the fierce Montenegrins, who cannot fathom why an able-bodied man in full possession of his faculties would spend so much time looking at flowers. Harwell soon comes to agree with them. Impelled in part by his growing attachment to a local family, he begins to loathe his backer and even himself, seeing in his dutiful reports only ''the grinding of empires and his own dishonor.'' He renounces neutrality to become wholeheartedly engaged in the escalating violence, which comes to a climax when an earthquake threatens to turn matters -- even mountains -- upside down. Early in his stay in Montenegro, as he watches a group of monks leaving church, Harwell reflects on the sweetness of issuing forth from services at Oxford, his slate having been wiped clean so he could re-enter ''the bright sin and glory of the world.'' Lawrence's novel captures all that brightness and glory. Julie Gray",1997-11-09T05:00:00+0000

A recognized leader in developing marketing strategies and advertising for nationally-known consumer products, died from Lymphoma on October 14, 1997 at Boca Raton Community Hospital in FL. He was 66. Mr. Albrecht's reputation was such that when he authored a marketing plan for a new product, the plan was virtually certain of support from venture capitalists. In the early '90s, as a consultant to the Himmel Corporation, he originated the advertising that fueled the dramatic comeback of two ''forgotten brands,'' Gold Bond Medicated Powder and Ovaltine. Following his graduation as BA cum laude from FL State University in 1957, Mr. Albrecht began his career in 1958 with the Vick Chemical Company. He started as a salesman, was promoted to promotion manager and later assumed management of the Vick subsidiary in Canada. Mr. Albrecht then moved on to senior marketing/advertising positions at Whitehall Labs, Revlon, J.B. Williams and the William Esty Advertising Company. From 1981 to 1991 he was President of his own advertising agency, Petersen & Albrecht, responsible mainly for the advertising of Bausch & Lomb contact lenses. In recent years, he served as marketing and advertising consultant to Combe Inc., Bausch & Lomb and Himmel, Inc. as well as companies headquartered in Europe and Japan. As Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Pace Univeristy Business School, he shared his knowledge and kindled excitement about the power of marketing among hundreds of Pace students from 1976 to 1985. Mr. Albrecht was the author of numerous articles in trade journals and was also active in many professional groups. He was a member of the Pharmaceutical Advertising Club, The National Writers' Club, FL State University Alumni Association, The International Platform Association, Phi Beta Kappa as well as Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Delta Sigma. For many years, he has been listed in Who's Who in America. He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Sandi and their daughter, Sherylyn.

He built this organization from a small group to a major national Jewish women's organization. He educated us. He moved mountains for us. He inspired us to move mountains. Nathan Gould spearheaded ORT's movement into Latin America, North America and Russia. He mobilized Women's American ORT's support to answer the needs he found abroad, especially in Israel. The School of Engineering in Jerusalem, the Braude International College in Karmiel, and, in particular, the Syngalowski Center in Tel Avivthe first college-like campus for a vocational high school, the likes of which the world had never seenwere his vision. He put Women's American ORT on the map of prominent world Jewry. Nathan reached out and touched every one of us. At national conventions he would walk down an aisle through thousands of people and touch them on the shoulder; he knew their name. He knew everyone's name. We all have personal stories about Nathan. One woman said, ''What Nathan did for me...'' He had empowered her to speak out against censorship in Texas public schools, something this elderly woman didn't know she could do. A longtime Women's American ORT officer tells how Nathan helped her make a meaningful connection between the basic human values she learned from her parents and her own Jewish identity. ''He encouraged me to act on my principles,'' she said. ''And he made it feel like an imperative.'' Nathan Gould was a mentor, a teacher and a friend. His legacy will live on in Women's American ORT.

You'd expect it of the title character, Olive Martin (Pauline Quirke), an obese woman with dead eyes who is in prison for having murdered her mother and her sister and carved them up in the kitchen. But the cool, sophisticated, blond Rosalind Leigh (Caroline Goodall), who is writing a book about Olive, has her own psychological problems, thanks to her alcoholic ex-husband having killed their daughter in a car crash. Hal Hawksley (Christopher Fulford), the detective who found the bodies and arrested Olive, was so unnerved by the experience that he quit the police force and now operates a dimly lighted restaurant that is always empty. The taciturn, unsmiling Hal makes David Caruso's police characters seem lighthearted. Even the priest (Dermot Crowley) who tries to introduce Olive to God has some complex reactions to her behavior. (O. K., it was wrong to steal candles from the chapel, but so what if she carved them into little white wax fertility goddesses? She did hum ''Rock of Ages'' while she worked.)",1997-11-13T05:00:00+0000

Quick, Make an Indie!","'Who is Simon Baker Denny?'' asks Matthew Modine, looking up from a stack of head shots and facing a room full of William Morris agents. The Morris team, in gray-and-brown business attire, has assembled one fall afternoon in the gray-and-brown Morris conference room to help their client cast his writing-directing debut, ''If . . . Dog . . . Rabbit.'' Modine, who came to prominence in the 80's in movies like ''Streamers,'' ''Birdy'' and ''Full Metal Jacket,'' will also act in this independent film, a black comedy about an American trailer-park family of thieves and their misguided attempt to rob a Mexican bullring. For Modine, directing offers autonomy and, after a series of missteps, a chance to reinvent his career. The agents are firing names at him -- all up-and-coming Morris clients who could possibly play Modine's brother: Denny, Christopher Eccleston, Jake Busey. Talented newcomers like these are the lifeblood of independent film making, and while the agents are keen to help Modine, they are also keen to help the rest of their stable find roles. An agent tosses out Christian Bale, the refined English actor who made his debut in ''Empire of the Sun.'' ''I love Christian Bale,'' Modine says, sighing. He continues, ''If we're going to go English, how about Ewan McGregor?'' McGregor, a Scot, is the highly-sought-after star of ''A Life Less Ordinary'' and the upcoming prequels to ''Star Wars.'' An embarrassed agent gently breaks it to Modine that McGregor is ''really unavailable.''",1997-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Children are routinely patronized, and thus so are we who spend our creative lives entertaining them and nourishing their spirit. Given this minefield of confusions and uncertainties, when such a work turns out looking as easy as a James Marshall picture book, it says everything about the man. Marshall is the last of a long line of masters that began in the late 19th century with the pre-eminent English illustrator, Randolph Caldecott; then continued in our century with Jean de Brunhoff in France and Edward Ardizzone in England; and then via Tomi Ungerer arrived full blast in America, where the laurel wreath settled finally, splendidly, on the judicious, humane, witty and astonishingly clever head of James Marshall.",1997-11-16T05:00:00+0000

It's not the face one would think a Hollywood superstar known for playing sunny romantic leads would want staring back at him every time his hair is brushed. At least not while working on Redford's current project, ''The Horse Whisperer,'' a big-budget, big-emotions melodrama based on the shamelessly corny best-selling novel by Nicholas Evans. ''The Horse Whisperer'' -- which Redford is being paid about $20 million by Touchstone Pictures to produce, direct and star in -- isn't Beckett, or even close, and Redford's role as a kind Montana rancher with a gift for soothing traumatized animals is frankly heroic and warmly optimistic.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; California Dreamin',"This scrapbook-cum-autobiography by Kristin Nelson Tinker is a quick trip from the 1960's to the 90's, as seen through the lens of her primitivist paintings, family photographs and snatches of text. Tinker's life is emblematic of postwar prosperity in California: her father was the all-American halfback Tom Harmon, her mother the movie actress Elyse Knox and her brother the actor Mark Harmon. She married the teen idol Ricky Nelson when she was pregnant and not yet 18 years old; her twin sons became the long-tressed rock duo Nelson. OUT OF MY MIND: An Autobiography (Abrams, $35) is wistful rather than tell-all: the biggest disclosures here are that Harriet Nelson, the perfect mother of ''Ozzie and Harriet,'' didn't bake apple pies and drank a vodka martini before dinner. The spotty text is overly padded with quotations from Rilke and Billy Joel. Tinker's brightly colored, perspectiveless paintings range from ''When the Kennedys Were in the White House'' (1964) to ''The Day He Died'' (1990), a commemoration of her father with images of funereal vines, raining clouds and a country church painted on a window frame.

Despite its meticulous hedging of bets -- its fair-minded and many acknowledgments of the gulf between two media -- Mr. Swain's book begins with an unavoidable bias. For it is indeed a book, a collection of sentences, paragraphs and printed musical examples. They make not a sound. What musical sounds they imply are conveyed by proxy. Taken for granted is that written symbols will have the power over music somehow to cope with its mysteries. Why else write the book?",1997-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Based on Eva Braun's actual diary entries and fleshed out by Alison Leslie Gold's imagination, THE DEVIL'S MISTRESS (Faber & Faber, $24.95) shadows Braun, also known as Fraulein Effie, as she schemes to keep herself in lipstick and crocodile shoes, nipping at a bottle of vermouth while waiting for the rumble of a Mercedes staff car outside her door. Many of Effie's evenings with the Chancellor end the same way: the two circle his bedroom, sniffing each other like dogs. (Sometimes Adolf nips her.) Because Gold's writing is so consistent in tone, her invented version of Braun seems almost indistinguishable from the real one. Effie reveals herself in short, enervated blurts, as if her staggering self-centeredness has left her with no means to shuttle her thoughts to the outside world. And yet her boxed-in existence is lavishly furnished. ''In every shop window -- in a gilt frame -- a twig and flower garlanded photo of him. Spilling down house fronts, red bunting dotted with white circles offsetting black hooked crosses.'' What does this imperiled nonentity have to say about what she's getting into?

Nixon and the National Archives to force the release of thousands of hours of secret White House tapes recorded between February 1971 and July 1973.

IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT (University of California, $27.50) is not only a history of Alexander but also an account by the intrepid British documentary maker Michael Wood of his tracing of Alexander's entire route with a film crew to prepare a program for broadcast on the BBC and on public television in this country. Relying on Greek and Roman sources, Wood tells a glorious story with some very dark shadows. On the whole he gets it right, and his writing is clear and crisp. The harrowing tale of his own trek over the same ground makes clear how heroic Alexander's army was. And in a dozen countries, in cities and villages, in desert camps and on mountains of the Hindu Kush, he found that Alexander is fiercely alive in poetry, songs and folk tales, in the imaginations of millions. He has been ever since he set out on his conquest. In the Middle Ages there were more than 200 Alexander epics composed in European languages alone, and every ruler wanted to emulate him. One of them was Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, whose great-grandson, the Emperor Charles V, would rule an empire even greater than Alexander's, one that included the Americas. THE HISTORY OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT (The J. Paul Getty Museum, $140), by Scot McKendrick, reproduces the magnificent paintings of Charles the Bold's copy of a French translation of the history of Alexander by the Roman historian Quintus Curtius and places them in the context of the literature and art of the late 15th century in northern Europe. The paintings and surrounding illuminations in this book blaze with the opulence of the Burgundian court, brilliantly depicted in a frontispiece showing the translator presenting the book to the Duke. The ability of the anonymous painters to render palpable action in brilliant colors is admirable, and so is the reproduction of the pictures by the Stinehour Press on the 17-by-13-inch pages of this formidable volume.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Romans and Christians,"In Rome, Marcus Aurelius is Emperor, and in faraway Lusitania, in a city called Tarcisis, on the western edge of the Iberian peninsula in what will one day be Portugal, Lucius Valerius Quintius is his humble servant -- the duumvir, or magistrate. Dedicated and loyal, Lucius lives in a contentious time, caught between the dominance of what he calls ''Romanity'' -- built on its Latin heritage as well as the Empire's global reach -- and the fast-growing influence of the cult of Christianity. While the Christians spread their unfamiliar Gospel, the old guard sticks to comfortable tradition: animal sacrifice and entrail reading, bloody games and public punishment to please the masses, and stubborn adherence to the laws of Rome. Added to this precarious situation is an unseen but very real menace: Moorish hordes who have come from North Africa intent on looting and burning the Roman settlements. In A GOD STROLLING IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING (Louisiana State University Press, $26.95), the Portuguese writer Mario de Carvalho (aided by his skillful translator, Gregory Rabassa) captures the fear and suspicion that surrounded the early years of what Lucius dismisses as ''the sect that worshiped fish.'' The right-minded Lucius is intent on remaining a just and respected leader by upholding Roman authority, but his colleagues scheme behind his back, and the Moors descend on his vulnerable city with deadly force. At the same time, Lucius' mind becomes clouded by a strangely decorous love for the Christian daughter of one of his most trusted friends. Elegant and erudite, Carvalho's novel is an absorbing study of a single man's moral code, as well as a provocative meditation on the difficulty of leading a virtuous life in an era of tumultuous change.

Can this be because our culture is still more tender to talented drunken male lechers than to talented free-living and free-loving women? Two books -- ''Twenty-four Ways of Looking at Mary McCarthy: The Writer and Her Work,'' edited by Eve Stwertka and Margo Viscusi, and ''Edmund Wilson: Centennial Reflections,'' edited by Lewis M.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  DALY, JAMES E. (''JED'')","DALY-James E. (''Jed''), 56, financial specialist. James E. Daly, known as ''Jed,'' died of heart failure at New York Hospital Nov. 15. Mr. Daly suffered from end-stage renal disease since 1989 and received hemodialysis at home from his wife. An unsuccessful transplant in 1995 left him physically disabled and curtailed his ability to work. Born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, Mr. Daly spoke frequently of his ''rebirths.'' The first occurred when he left Armstrong Cork to enter Harvard Business School. After graduation in 1971, he worked in bond sales for First Boston, where he was instrumental in creating a marketing department. In the 1980's, at Salomon Bros., he worked in Canadian fixed-income securities sales and in new-business, real-estate finance. Mr. Daly was ''reborn'' again when survival of kidney failure spurred him to apply a life-long interest in finance to estate planning and insurance sales. Employed by MetLife, he was appointed manager of his own branch in 1994 due to his pioneering efforts to use The Bloomberg business computer as an insurance channel of distribution. He spoke of establishing an ''interactive, multi-media, office-shopping network.'' Mr. Daly was a board member of Ursinus College in Pennsylvania. He was a member of the American Kidney Association and served as a fund-raiser for The New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Fund. He was a long-time member of the Calyx Club of Dallas, Texas; the Harvard Clubs of New York and Boston; the Harvard Business School Club of Greater New York; and the Larchmont Yacht Club. He is survived by his wife, Margarethe, and their two children, Peter, age 12, and Karen, age 16, all of Larchmont, New York, and his sister, Kathryn Daly Leahy of Hanover, Massachusetts. A memorial service wil be held at 10 A.M., on November 29 at Sts. John and Paul Church in Larchmont. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Rogosin Institute (505 East 70 Street, New York, NY 10021).",1997-11-23T05:00:00+0000

But after meeting here with Russian officials and analysts I can report that such charges certainly reflect the prevailing mood of U.S.-Russian ties.

The cause of death was complications following a series of strokes. He was 83 years old. Mr. Hathaway began his long career in advertising at J. Walter Thompson in 1935 where he quickly made a mark as an innovative account manager. His work there was punctuated by some intermissions including stints at two other agencies and World War II service as a Navy Lieutenant JG in the Pacific Theater. He spent the years from 1947 to 1961 at Control-O-Gram in Illinois. On his return to New York, he rejoined Thompson as a vice president. There he stayed until 1966 when BBDO hired him to manage their Burger King business. When Thompson won the large national account in 1976, Clem was quickly lured back. A creative account manager, he spearheaded the memorable Burger King work of that period. He retired in 1981 and is still remembered with affection by those who had the pleasure of working with him. His wife of 27 years, Mildred, his sons from a previous marriage, John of Darien, CT., and David of Millbrook, NY, four grandsons and one granddaughter survive Mr. Hathaway.

Along with photographs of the exteriors and interiors of each theater, this updated and expanded edition of a 1991 book offers architectural drawings and lists of the major plays and players. Van Hoogstraten, a television producer, tells marvelous anecdotes that set the imagination spinning: opening nights, beginning early in the evening with hors d'oeuvres, and ending after the play in the early morning with the audience invited to drink from an enormous bowl of Champagne with a nude chorus girl floating in it. (And that was during Prohibition.) The Paradise Roof Garden on Oscar Hammerstein's theater, the Victoria, spilled over to Hammerstein's adjacent theater, the Republic, where strollers could enjoy a Dutch-style dairy farm with a cow and other live barnyard animals and even a costumed dairymaid. Eddie Foy Jr. remembered the glass of warm fresh milk the dairymaid gave him after he and his brothers finished performing. During the Depression, what would the producers think of next? The Waldorf Theater had ''book nights'': a small library was connected to the box office, and you got to choose a book with your ticket. (If the show wasn't any good, I guess you could always read, which must have often been the case, as that theater didn't survive long.) Though fewer than half of the nearly 90 original theaters still exist, all is not lost. For starters, the New Amsterdam and the Victory theaters have been rebuilt with all their marvelous ornateness restored, giving us a much-needed view of the munificence of our past.

But Robert Girardi's VAPORETTO 13 (Delacorte, $19.95) shows that there's still a lot of life left in the unliving. Jack Squire is the embodiment of today's ideal man, a fast-track currency trader clad in Armani armor. When he is assigned to Venice to become his company's eyes and ears on the Italian political and economic scene, he feels that his career has taken a wrong turn. Yet while he sees the crumbling, ancient city as, literally, a backwater, Venice brings him to life in a way Wall Street never could. One night, roaming aimlessly because he can't sleep, Jack makes the acquaintance of an elusive and beautiful young woman, Caterina Vendramin, who will meet him only in the evening and whose past is mysteriously entwined with that of the sinking city. The more he becomes involved with her, the more troubling he finds her evasive responses to his questions: What does she do during the day? Why won't she introduce him to her father? Why does she claim to be a member of an ancient class of impoverished aristocrats that has long since died out? And why, when he attempts to follow her home, does he find a necropolis awash under the waters of the lagoon? In telling the story of Jack, his obsession with Caterina, his fall from corporate grace and his redemption into a world where he is no longer blinded by the dancing cursor on a trading screen, Girardi suffuses his narrative with rich descriptions of the food, fashion, traditions and architecture of Venice. With this artful novel, he invites us to put aside our rational skepticism and enter a world where the past is still hauntingly present. Malachy Duffy",1997-11-30T05:00:00+0000
