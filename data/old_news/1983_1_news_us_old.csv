By Moscow standards, it was a restrained day. For most of the Administration's two years, the official line has been that Washington was in the hands of a lunatic fringe. Soviet leaders accused President Reagan of launching the ''madness'' of a fresh arms race, attempting to strong-arm Western Europe into submissiveness, stirring ''counterrevolution'' in Poland and backing repressive regimes in South Africa, South Korea and Chile.

Benjamin Blom's ''New York Photographs, 1850-1950'' (Amaryllis/Dutton, $65 hardcover), gives an optimistic picture of life in New York. Blom sees this city as a microcosm of America, and he believes that America has, on the whole, kept its promises both to itself and to the rest of the world. (A shorter and reorganized version of Mr. Blom's book may be seen as an exhibition at the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue and 51st Street, through Jan. 8).",1983-01-02T05:00:00+0000

This streaming of events defines the literary as well as the political situation in Poland, a situation so unstable that the writers, whose main effort is to grasp what is happening to Poland, find themselves at a loss to keep up with it.

us,Putting Juries on The Couch,"Morton Hunt's article on the possibility of manipulating the minds of jurors fails to stress sufficiently two issues that underlie ''scientific'' jury selection (''Putting Juries on the Couch,'' Nov. 28). The lesser of these issues is that there is no way to know whether jury selection actually works. In those cases where social scientists have been employed to select juries, the outcomes that have ensued might as easily have resulted from the strength of the case as from the bias of the jury. Indeed, the literature is rife with examples of jurors who were selected by social scientists with high confidence that they would take a particular side, and who subsequently led the opposition. Jury selection, by itself, can never be said to augment materially the interests of a particular client since, once a jury is in place, there is no way to compare it with an unselected jury.",1983-01-02T05:00:00+0000

We were treatminded, too. Alas. Though Miss Le Gallienne still flies in from the wings -on wires - looking like a chess piece that's been dropped in the powdered sugar, and though Kate Burton makes an appealingly sturdy, white-stockinged Alice, the entertainment is unexpectedly tepid. The treat of the week, in a genuinely savage irony, turned out to be a viciously conceived and recklessly played account of an attempted rape and the revenge it breeds. It's called ''Extremities,'' it's at the Westside Arts Center on 43d Street, and it's far from perfect. But William Mastrosimone's play bristles with so much energy that it makes you feel glad to be in a theater again, and I guess that's a reasonable facsimile of the holiday spirit (a little something to be surprised by, a little something to be grateful for).",1983-01-02T05:00:00+0000

In other words, they speak and act pretty much the way you and I and people we meet every day speak, not the way heroes and villains of a child's fairy-tale world speak. They do not sing arias when they are happy, nor do they gather at the footlights in groups to vow vengeance when they are angry.

Encompassing both painting and photography, it deals with the work of artists who, as children in the 1950's, were weaned on the ''sensory overload'' of the mass media - television, movies, magazines, newspapers, computers and such - and now ''recycle'' its imagery. This tendency toward mass media ''appropriation'' is one aspect of the new interest in figuration, says Janet Kardon, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art.

In the interest of seeing those of perhaps the greatest architectural and historical significance within three weeks, however, Charles Little of the Metropolitan Museum of Art staff suggested that you base yourself in Paris and start by visiting Saint-Denis on the city's northern outskirts; it is considered the first Gothic church, dating from around 1140. In Paris itself is the Cathedral of Notre Dame; its construction spanned the middle of the 12th century and continued into the 13th. Not far from Notre Dame are Sainte-Chapelle, dedicated in 1248, and Saint-Germain de Pres, with Gothic elements dating from the late 12th century in addition to earlier Romanesque.",1983-01-09T05:00:00+0000

We travel on nonimmigrant visas and usually stay here about five to six months a year. Recently, for the third time since we moved into our apartment in 1976, we received a letter from the managing agent asking if our apartment is a primary residence. Since I don't have any other place in this country, I answered accordingly, signed the lease and sent it back. I was soon asked to include a check for $82.45 to bring the security deposit current with the new rent, which I did. Later I received a letter from the agent advising me that it had come to his attention that the apartment was not my primary residence and asking me to submit proof to substantiate it or I would be refused the renewal. Is it legal for the owner to offer an extension of that lease, claim and receive money for the future security deposit and still withhold the lease? ... Z.G., Manhattan Answer: The courts have ruled that an owner is entitled to refuse a renewal lease to a nonprimary tenant and he may do so at any time up to the point where the owner signs a renewal lease. It is up to the Conciliation and Appeals Board (10 Columbus Circle, New York, N.Y. 10019) to decide whether your apartment is a primary residence and whether the landlord has executed the lease and thus has to wait until the lease has expired.",1983-01-09T05:00:00+0000

Hugh L. Carey. Last week was Governor Cuomo's turn, and while he acknowledged that cash was limited, his ambitions clearly weren't. The Governor spoke of repairing roads, rails and ports, building new water supply systems and housing, and new aid programs for the homeless and the jobless. To help pay for all this, he called for $7 billion in new bonds and additional billions in public and private investment, though he also warned that sacrifices lay ahead. ''God - and Washington - will help those who help themselves,'' he said. With Albany facing its biggest budget deficits ever, Mr. Cuomo's financing proposals may have struck some as mortgaging the state's future. Others perhaps wondered why, while promising to reorganize a bloated bureaucracy to reduce waste, he proposed about a dozen new councils, committees, funds, offices, commissions, authorities and boards - not to mention an expanded Urban Development Corporation, a restructured Public Service Commission and, possibly, a dismembered Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Those four words made this particular visitor want to dance around the block like Gene Kelly in ''Singin' in the Rain,'' so vividly did they summon up the time when Manet was opening a whole slew of new options for painting and Paris was being torn apart and rebuilt in roughly the shape that we know today.","Manet would have liked that title, too. He was a true Parisian. He was born there, he was raised there, he went to a very good school there, he learned to think there and he never really wanted to be anywhere else. When he was in art school there was a famous male model who took a pride in the histrionic poses that showed off his musculature. Manet wouldn't have any of them. ''But, sir,'' said the model, ''my poses have helped more than one student to win first prize and get sent to Rome.'' ''But we are not in Rome,'' said Manet, ''and we don't want to be in Rome. We are in Paris. I for one intend to stay here.''",1983-01-09T05:00:00+0000

us,ART: FRANK STELLA'S PRINTS AT THE WHITNEY,"WE'RE so accustomed to saluting Frank Stella's career as a painter - it's been nearly a quarter of a century since his debut in a Museum of Modern Art show at the age of 23 -that it comes as something of a shock to realize he's had another whole career, as a printmaker. The fact that Stella makes prints is by no means a secret, of course. What's surprising is the scope of this activity, now clearly laid out in ''Frank Stella: Prints 1967-82,'' the first full retrospective of Stella prints, on view at the Whitney Museum through March 13. A dazzling display, it comprises more than 150 works, beginning with the small, austere images of the late 1960's that diffidently mirrored his paintings, and ending with the big, exuberant pyrotechnics of today's output, works so boldly explorative of the medium itself that they give the word print a literal new dimension.",1983-01-14T05:00:00+0000

(Page 1, Column 6.) Moves on detente with Moscow have been undermined by China's support of ancient territorial claims and disputes and its spreading of anti-Soviet sentiments in China, the Soviet weekly political journal, Novoye Vremya, said.

Unfortunately, biographers in the past have not been sensitive to such matters of the heart. There is no evidence, for instance, that Mozart went through life raging at the world for failing to recognize his modest little first opera, ''La Finta Semplice,'' as one of music's monuments.",1983-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Answer: The Administrative Code of the City of New York says the owner of a multiple dwelling must keep it in good repair; this includes shareholder corporations that own cooperative apartment houses. Mary Ann Rothman, administrator of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that some co-ops would repaint after repairing a wall that had been damaged by defects in the building system, but that most limit repairs to plastering and patching the damaged area. To recover more damages, a tenant must make a claim against the coop's insurance or his own homeowner's policy. Marc Luxemburg, chairman of the executive committee of the council, also notes that if a pipe bursts and the co-op board has to break through a tenant's wall to repair it, the board is not responsible for repairs to the wallpaper.",1983-01-16T05:00:00+0000

I said to him I didn't think I would ever go back. For one thing, in Paris I was only five hours by train from Vermeer's ""View of Delft"" in the Hague, or Grunewald's ""Isenheim Altarpiece"" ""View of Delft"" in the Hague or Grunewald's ""Isenheim Altarpiece"" in Colmar; with an overnight train I could step into the cold dawn light of Piero's ""Resurrection"" in sansepolcro, Italy, the next morning. Then, suddenly, I left. For seven months now, as art news reporter for this newspaper, I have been living with something dynamic, complex and very different. What follows is an attempt to present some thoughts and impressions either about or inspired by that multi-headed, many-sided thing known as the New York art world. Just before I left Paris, when I was wondering if something I was about to write was wrong, an American critic familiar with the subject told me: ""Say it. You'll find out.""

The reason for the precipitous periodic homecoming was word processing. I find it hard to conceive of very many families that really need word processing. Nevertheless, in high schools and colleges, this particular new treatment of verbal expression seems to be falling rapidly into the scholastic category once traditionally reserved for the recipients of such comments as ''He always gets better grades because he types his reports.'' There is a large difference between the two, however. Unlike selecting a typewriter, when it comes to choosing a word processor, it's how the device is programmed to be used that counts. Excluding the lowercase percussive perambulations of Archie the Cockroach, typing can really be done in only one of two ways, by hunt and peck, or by touch. Processing words, on the other hand, offers a myriad of variants in operation, depending partly on the computer involved but even more on the software.",1983-01-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1983","International The U.S. will show flexibility in the talks on medium-range missiles in Europe if the Soviet Union demonstrates some new ''give,'' , the chief American negotiator hinted after a meeting with President Reagan. Mr. Reagan and the negotiator, Paul H. Nitze, have defended the so-called zero option proposed by the United States in November 1981 as the best way to deal with the European missile issue. But Mr. Nitze seemed to suggest that Washington might drop the zero option in response to some undefined concessions by Moscow. (Page 1, Column 3.) A helpful American counterproposal to the latest Soviet proposal to reduce medium-range missiles in Europe would not only be welcomed, but demanded, by the opposition Social Democratic candidate for Chancellor of West Germany. Han-Jochen Vogel's address to a party meeting tended to portray the United States as delaying progress in the Geneva arms reduction talks, which are scheduled to resume Thursday.

us,"SATURDAY, JANUARY 22, 1983; The Economy","The Consumer Price Index fell 0.3 percent in December, pulled downward by declining home mortgage rates. The Labor Department said the decline brought the inflation rate for all of 1982 to 3.9 percent, a full point below most forecasts. It was the lowest rate since 1972 when, with price controls in place, the figure was 3.4 percent. The sharp decline was seen as the strongest sign to date that the runaway price increases of recent years have been arrested, at least for a while. But officials concede that one of the main reasons is the 17-month recession, during which the unemployment rate has risen to 10.8 percent, the highest since 1940. (Page 1.)

us,I.M. PEI REDISCOVERS CHINA,"Paul Goldberger is the architecture critic of The New York Times. The architect I.M. Pei, creator of the East Building of the National Gallery in Washington, the New York City Convention and Exhibition Center and some of the most conspicuous skyscrapers of the last decade, does not normally design relatively modest 325-room, low-rise hotels. But few of the small hotels he would be likely to disdain as unworthy of his time are intended for a hillside 25 miles outside of Peking, and so when the Government of China invited him to design such a building in 1978, he did not say no. He returned to China - where he had been born in 1917 - and began to produce what in short order became the most eagerly awaited piece of architecture in recent Chinese history. The building is called Xiangshan (meaning ''Fragrant Hill'') Hotel, and it will not be entirely completed until this spring, when it will serve as a luxury hotel mostly for foreign visitors. Its first wing opened last October, before a gathering of Chinese dignitaries and Americans, including Pei's friend Jacqueline Onassis, at whose behest he had designed the John F. Kennedy Library near Boston. Fragrant Hill resembles neither that building nor the National Gallery, nor any of Pei's other well-known works; it is no exaggeration to say that it is a mix of Chinese and Western architectures the likes of which have never been seen in China or anywhere else. t is too soon for a formal critical evaluation of Fragrant Hill, which is impossible in any event without a visit to the building, which this critic has yet to make.",1983-01-23T05:00:00+0000

While maintenance payments can be limited in amount and duration, they can, where appropriate, be ordered on a permanent basis. This can be done when a spouse has been out of the labor market and lacks sufficient resources or when a spouse has sacrificed her business or professional career to serve as a parent or homemaker.

Certainly Caryl Churchill isn't very nice to them in her ''Top Girls,'' which will be available with its original London cast for one more week at the Public (after which an American company will go into rehearsal and, three weeks later, reopen the hard-hearted piece). Miss Churchill is the author of the antically successful ''Cloud 9,'' and, since the opening sequence of this new one scrambles history and a few other things even more cavalierly than ''Cloud 9'' did, you can't tell right off just how kindly or how cold-blooded she means to be tonight.",1983-01-23T05:00:00+0000

This cluster of cells, called the locus coeruleus because of its blue tint, seems to be a key place where anxiety and fear take shape and where the painful sensations of withdrawal from narcotic drugs may have at least part of their origins. The locus has become a target of much scientific study because its activity offers clues to parts of the immense puzzle of the chemistry of the brain and the derangements of that chemistry caused by drugs. In recent years scientists have made giant strides in identifying a whole host of chemicals through which the brain acts in health and disease, in normality and in such aberrations as drug addiction. The focus of scientific attention is now on efforts to understand just how that multitude of different chemicals and nerve circuits actually do the brain's work - that most complex of biochemical performances in the panoply of life on earth.",1983-01-25T05:00:00+0000

The code will not officially take effect until Nov. 27, but most of the changes have been put into practice by Roman Catholics around the world. (Page A1, Column 3.) A Turk wanted in Italy for complicity in the shooting of Pope John Paul II says he has never met the man who shot the Pope in 1981. But the suspect, Bekir Celenk, said in Sofia, Bulgaria, that he had been in Bulgaria at the same time that Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk convicted of shooting the Pope, was reportedly there. Unconfirmed Italian newspaper reports have said that Mr. Celenk offered Mr. Agca $1.25 million in German marks on behalf of the Bulgarian secret service to shoot the Pope.

Mr. Hare has said that ''Fanshen'' is not only about land reform but also about the relationship in any society between leaders and the led. It deals with the difficulties of effecting change, too. The play won high praise when it opened in London in 1975. ''Fanshen,'' which means ''to enter a new world'' and is based on a book by William Hinton, will play Thursdays through Sundays until Feb. 20. Tickets: $8.

You could get a tax writeoff if you invested in a motion picture, so, rather than doing good films, people would do stuff half-cocked.

us,THE INS AND OUTS OF I.R.A. ACCOUNTS,"Deciding where to stash your contribution to an Individual Retirement Account is only one of many factors to take into consideration when setting up a retirement savings program. Below are answers to some commonly asked questions by first-time I.R.A. investors. Q.I don't have the cash to set up an I.R.A. Can I borrow to do it? A.Yes. Not only is your I.R.A. contribution tax-deductible, but so are your borrowing costs. As long as the return on your I.R.A. investment -which compounds tax-free until you begin making withdrawals at retirement age - exceeds the after-tax cost of your loan, you come out ahead. (To determine the after-tax cost of a loan, multiply your tax rate by the interest rate on the loan.) But be sure you have adequate savings on hand for emergencies and other expenses, such as your children's college education, because you pay a 10 percent penalty for any money prematurely withdrawn from your I.R.A. Q.My company has a payroll deduction plan for making contributions to an I.R.A. Should I take advantage of it? A.It all depends. If you find it difficult to save regularly, and this is the only way you can be assured of making the maximum contribution, by all means go ahead.",1983-01-30T05:00:00+0000

Still, as Governor Kean noted during the State Agricultural Convention in Cherry Hill last week - the second major farm meeting held this month - one out of every four jobs in New Jersey is connected with agriculture and food processing, which has a $2 billion to $3 billion impact on the state's economy. Mr. Kean did more than tell those in the audience how important he thought they were. He signed two significant pieces of legislation, a right-to-farm law protecting farmers from nuisance suits or local regulations regarding such things as fertilization, irrigation and noise, and a farmland preservation program setting aside state funds to purchase development rights and pay for soil and water conservation efforts. It will be up to Arthur R. Brown Jr., who became State Agriculture Secretary in July, to implement these measures.
