Weinberger testified that he repeatedly thought he had stopped the Iran arms sales but that he learned later he had failed because White House officials resorted to deception to keep the deal going. Page 1 Mr. Weinberger helped provide the final pieces of the Iran-contra puzzle, a puzzle that now appears to be warped with contradictions and may never fit together properly 1 The Iran-contra affair prosecutor has granted full immunity to Lieut. Col. Richard B. Gadd, a key participant who helped direct the private network supplying weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, officials said. 7 A chronology of Israeli activities in the affair will be turned over to the Congressional investigating committees. The chronology was put together in the last two months. 7 A request for British minesweepers from the United States to assist in protecting oil tankers in the Persian Gulf was rejected. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said that Britain was wary of an increase in tension there. 1 In Sri Lanka, Tamil guerrillas have refused to surrender their arms to an Indian peacekeeping force as a cease-fire went into effect, the Indian commander said. The agreement calls on the guerrillas to surrender their arms by Monday. 1 Social satire in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev is not as easy as it used to be for one of the country's most beloved comics. Although he can now say anything he wants, ''the newspapers are already saying it,'' Arkady Raikin said. 1 Moscow presented a draft arms plan that would cut the two superpowers' long-range nuclear arsenals by half. The United States said the draft was helpful but contained no concessions on major issues. 3 U.S.-Vietnamese talks will begin in Hanoi on resolving the issue of Americans still missing 14 years after the withdrawal of United States forces. A special envoy of President Reagan will meet with a new Vietnamese leadership. 2 A tornado in Canada killed at least 31 people and injured more than 150 in Edmonton, Alberta, officials said. One and perhaps more twisters hit the western Canadian provincial capital. 36 Leukemia victim in U.S. seeks Hanoi aid on transplant 2 Pretoria to pay damages 3 Helms yields on Manila envoy 3 Cairo journal 4 National 8-10, 12, 32 A Supreme Court Justice endorsed Judge Robert H. Bork's fitness for the Court in a little-noted speech two weeks ago. Justice John Paul Stevens likened Judge Bork's philosophy to that of himself and two other moderate centrists. 1 The Vice President was confronted by the brother of Benjamin Linder, the American slain in Nicaragua. The encounter sparked an exchange in which Mr. Linder accused the Nicaraguan rebels of murder and Mr. Bush defended American aid to them. 1 The President had a skin cancer removed from the tip of his nose by military surgeons but did not require skin grafts to cover the wound for cosmetic purposes, the White House announced. 10 News analysis: An anti-abortion plan of the Administration appears vulnerable to legal challenge. The proposal would restrict federally funded family planning clinics from giving their patients information about abortion. 8 Detroit's monorail began working above the business district. The much maligned system, the People Mover, was nearly two years late and tens of millions of dollars overbudget. 12 Calls to clean up the Miami River have been renewed. But Miami has always treated the ribbon of water that opens into Biscayne Bay at the foot of downtown skyscrapers with little respect, even disdain. 8 A budget balancing law change that provides a new mechanism for automatic spending cuts was approved by the Senate. But the Government could avoid major spending cuts or tax increases until after the 1988 elections. 10 Automobile workers' negotiations with the two largest American automobile companies completed their first week. Both sides focused on general, rather than specific issues in the labor contract discussions. 32 Woman, 65, and cane to rescue 8 Mixed prospects for Democrats 10 Babbitt calls for sales tax 10 Panel warned of mismarked bolts 10 Government ordered to expunge files on reporter 12 Regional 33-35 An inquiry into Andy Warhol's death found insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges over the artist's medical care, partly because of poor medical records and uncertainty about the effects of other treatment, officials said. 1 A homeless shelter in the suburbs of Long Island is the focus of growing tension. In Lake Ronkonkoma, two incidents between residents of the shelter and neighbors resulted in five injuries and four arrests. 33 The sites for two new prisons in Connecticut were chosen, ending a seven-month search. Newtown, in northern Fairfield County, and Suffield, near the Massachusetts border, were selected. Officials of the two towns reacted angrily. 34 Recent remarks by Benjamin Ward, the New York City Police Commissioner, have left some police officials perplexed and angry. Some of his top aides say that even they cannot understand some of the statements. 33 Something is killing dolphins off the Atlantic coast from New Jersey to Virginia, and marine scientists are still looking for clues. Seventy-three of the mammals have washed ashore this month, 30 on New Jersey beaches, one scientist said. 33 In negotiations, sanitation workers are seeking more money from New York City. But unlike most of the other municipal unions, they have presented an unusual array of facts and figures to bolster their case. 35 An operator was found to rebuild the 110th Street Boathouse in Central Park and run it as a restaurant. The Parks Department wants new structures for a restaurant and boathouse to serve the park's north end. 35 A $250,000 bribe was sought by a public-relations consultant, ''acting as a henchman of Donald R.

Some Israelis remember the Six-Day War as their finest moment, others as a victory that contained the seeds of despair. If it rescued the Jewish state from possible annihilation, it also marked the beginning of an occupation that continues to sap the nation's strength. These contradictions are woven into the fabric of Israel, creating patterns that are not readily apparent. Milton Viorst, a political journalist, takes a long look at Israel's four decades, capitalizing on the growing library of memoirs in Washington as well as in Jerusalem, on interviews with some of the principal players and on his own rich experiences. His is a valuable examination of the competing values of religious and secular Jews, of rival Ashkenazi and Sephardic interests and of a mainstream Zionism whose struggle with revisionists remains a factor. ''Sands of Sorrow'' is valuable not only for the linear examination that carries us from the 1948 War of Independence to the debilitating invasion of Lebanon, but for the study of rival domestic forces that continue to bear on Israel's relations with Washington and with its neighbors. Mr. Viorst cites a growing belief in Israel that the Jewish colonization of the West Bank has become irreversible, but he argues that creation of an independent Arab state there remains possible and desirable.",1987-08-02T05:00:00+0000

Beautiful, troubled Alice and her resolute Resistance lover, Jerome, descend on the peaceful country estate of Jerome's boyhood best friend, the happy industrialist Charles Sambrat. Their intention: to persuade Charles to let them use his property in the unoccupied Dauphine as a way station for Jews being smuggled out of France. If this sounds interesting, let's take another look at Francoise Sagan's characters. Alice likes ''nothing so much as a wood fire in the summer, open French windows in the winter, and long swims'' in the rain. Jerome is a ''man of intellect,'' a man ''born lame . . . disappointed, anguished''; whereas Charles is ''a very fine-looking, healthy animal,'' ''a skirt chaser'' who gives ''women the desire to lie down and men the desire to get up'' (and one woman the desire to lay the book down and get up). Jerome is dedicated to saving Jews (no Jewish character appears, though Alice visits a sort of nest of ''them'' . . . ''There were eight of them, no, ten, no, twelve . . .''). Charles is dedicated to pleasure. And Alice - well, Alice is troubled and beautiful: Swim in the rain, anyone? How to persuade apolitical Charles to risk all for the Resistance? But of course: Alice will seduce him. Certain she would never feel ''that'' again, she is suddenly reawakened by the virile industrialist. Et voila! Le triangle. They reel, they gaze, they moan. Don't blame the cliches on the translation. It's Mlle. Sagan who has failed this time to invent a cast of grown-ups and a vocabulary equal to her theme - the conflict between personal desire and moral responsibility.",1987-08-02T05:00:00+0000

Most performances are given by fellows of the Tanglewood Music Center. Sunday morning at 10 A.M., there will be a concert of works by Stravinsky, Copland, Carter, Louise Talma, Arthur Berger and Harold Shapero. Sunday night's performance, which begins at 8:30, is conducted by John Oliver and includes works by Mr. Knussen, Bruce Saylor, Lutoslawski and Mr. Perle. Works by Boulez, Rorem, Miriam Gideon and Alexander Goehr are to be performed Monday evening at 8:30.

Mike Raglan, the hero, is an investigator of occult phenomena, but he is also a tough loner who knows how to use a six-gun. When he travels to a remote Southwest mesa to investigate the mystery of the Anasazi - a race of vanished cliff-dwellers - he manages to cross over to the Other Side, a fourth dimension that turns out to be very much another western frontier, replete with hidden gold, treacherous landscapes and plenty of Indians to shoot down. (The latter, a military clique called the Varanel, may sound exotic, but they attack at dawn.) When ghostly invaders cross from the Other Side to make trouble, Raglan neatly dispatches them with fisticuffs. The expansionist ideology of westerns remains thoroughly intact: ''No barrier will stop my people,'' says Raglan to a dismayed Keeper of the Archives. ''No doubt your land has minerals we could exploit.'' As always, Mr. L'Amour is adept at tight plotting, meticulous research and authoritative sense of place. But the writing here is tired and lacking the crusty energy of his better westerns. Nor does he apply any suggestiveness needed for a supernatural chiller, often resorting to long series of questions and cliches. At one point we are told that Raglan ''did not want there to be another dimension. . . . He was having trouble enough dealing with the three he had.'' This seems a reasonable complaint; perhaps Mr. L'Amour should heed it and stick to writing westerns.",1987-08-02T05:00:00+0000

There is hardly a theatrical notion or whim, no matter how creatively barren, antimusical, muddle-headed or inane, that may not attract a subsidy, pass itself off as an opera production and find place fleetingly on some stage somewhere. Though born dead, each unfortunate creature serves its purpose: awards, academic honors, publicity and commissions are pressed on the director, who is then encouraged to attack other operas. Theoretically, this might be a good thing, since a piece of durable art could result, just as it is mathematically certain that a thousand monkeys jumping on the keys of a thousand typewriters would eventually write all the books in the British Museum. Eventually, however, could mean light years, at least, and most of us do not have that much time.",1987-08-02T05:00:00+0000

Bass and drums, stuttering in tandem, are no longer simply the foundation of the music - they are the music. And the music is the beat. The bass player plucks and pulls at his strings, making them pop like a drumstick ricocheting off the head of a snare. The guitarist chokes his strings against the instrument's neck while strumming percussively, getting a rapidly percolating, double-time rhythmic pattern, something like a jazz drummer might play on his ride cymbal. Electric keyboards sputter staccato responses, and even the horns hit hard and hollow punctuations: every instrument a drum. That's funk. And while it's a long way from James Brown's original mid-sixties funk manifesto, ''Papa's Got A Brand New Bag,'' to the latest rap, go-go and street-funk hits, with their new technology of electronic sequencers, turntable scratching and synthetic rhythm sections, the fundamentals remain the same.

us,Sports People; Gymnasts in Congress,"Peter Vidmar, winner of two gold medals in the 1984 Olympics and captain of the United States men's gymnastics team, performed gracefully and flawlessly in Washington yesterday on the parallel bars. So did Scott Johnson, another 1984 gold medalist in gymnastics. Joyce Wilborn, a 16-year-old who has high hopes of making the 1988 team, slipped on a back flip on the balance beam, but recovered with the aplomb of a seasoned veteran and finished her performance to the rousing applause of the audience. The events weren't performed in a sports arena. The scene was the hearing room of a House office building on Capitol Hill. Vidmar, 26 years old, of Los Angeles; Johnson, 26, of Lincoln, Neb., and Wilborn, 16, of Paterson, N.J., joined officials of the United States Olympic Committee and a half-dozen other Olympians to lobby for legislation to mint gold and silver commemorative coins in honor of the United States athletes who will participate in the 1988 Winter and Summer Olympic Games. Representative Frank Annunzio, Democrat of Illinois, chairman of the House consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee, said the panel had had Olympic athletes testify before and ''the legislative process is often full of twists and turns, but I doubt that this room has ever seen such maneuvers so gracefully executed.'' The Annunzio bill, passed unanimously by the subcommittee after the performances, authorizes the minting of 1 million gold coins and 10 million silver coins, which, he said, could raise up to $105 million to enable the Olympic Committee to train and support Olympic athletes. A similar bill was introduced Monday in the Senate by Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican.",1987-08-05T05:00:00+0000

This aristocratic restaurant offers some beguiling Indian food: the vindaloos are appropriately hot, condiments are cool and curries are complex. The lamb vindaloo, for example, a smoldering dish from southwestern India, excels here because it has much more than mere B.T.U.'s going for it; the pulpy sauce is stratified with sensations of cumin, garlic, ginger and cinnamon. Another good choice is the tandoor chicken, mildly hot outside from a coating of mixed spices and succulent within. Entrees $7.50 to $19.95.

It had already been announced that Hearns would try to become the first man to win four titles by fighting Juan Domingo Roldan for the vacant W.B.C. middleweight championship Oct. 29 in Las Vegas, Nev.

But the liability insurance crisis won't be ended - or even greatly mitigated - by the law's repeal. That requires a basic change in liability awards by the courts.

Page 1 A preliminary Latin peace accord was agreed upon and signed by the Presidents of the five major Central American countries. The proposal requires follow-up negotiations. 1 Jim Wright embraced the accord, raising pressure on the Administration to support a plan that differs from its own peace proposal. Mr. Wright, the Speaker of the House, termed the tentative pact ''a very positive step.'' 4 U.S. consultations on a resolution at the United Nations Security Council have begun, officials said. The resolution would seek to impose an arms embargo on Iran for the continuation of the Iran-Iraq war. 3 Sri Lanka will ask India to withdraw its forces before the end of the month if the situation in the country remains stable, President J. R. Jayewardene said in an interview. 2 A divestment from South Africa was announced by Standard Chartered P.L.C. of Britain. The sale for the equivalent of $254 million is the largest ever by a foreign corporation. 33 U.S. and Soviet arms negotiators will step up their work in an effort to narrow differences on reducing nuclear missiles before the planned meeting between their foreign ministers in Washington, officials said. 28 Moslems returning from Mecca to Cairo said that Iranian demonstrators who rioted there carried knives and Molotov cocktails and that hundreds of people were killed in a stampede as the Iranians attacked the Saudi police. 3 In India, terrorists killed at least 25 people in the Punjab in the last two days, and the authorities ordered a curfew at the Sikh holy city of Amritsar after Hindu relatives of the victims rioted. 2 The scarcest single ticket in England is for an opera seat at the converted Glyndebourne estate house and, more particularly, at the acclaimed production of ''Porgy and Bess'' that reopened for eight performances. 5 Runaway Soviet locomotive crashes into passenger train 2 Syria tries to calm Saudis and Iran on Mecca riot 3 Managua journal 4 Marine in spy case pleas not guilty 5 National 6-9 The nation's jobless rate fell in July below 6 percent for the first time since 1979, Government figures showed. Analysts said the array of monthly statistics were encouraging and pointed to a quickened pace of economic expansion. 1 Labor economists continue to worry that despite the landmark dip in unemployment, most new jobs tend to pay lower wages, carry fewer benefits and create a more unstable labor environment. 9 A definition of insider trading was offered by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which asked Congress to outlaw the use of confidential corporate information to buy and sell stocks and other securities. 1 A dispute over salvage efforts on a wreck 160 miles off Cape Fear, N.C., may become the vehicle for deciding a legal issue: jurisdiction over wrecks in international waters. 6 The House and the Senate delayed the effort to reach a compromise on a proposal to reinvigorate the budget-balancing law and prepared to leave for the four week-summer recess. 8 The television evangelist Jim Bakker and his top associate refused to defend themselves at proceedings that led to their ouster as ministers of the denomination, the chief officer of the Assemblies of God said. 6 College tuition this fall will rise faster than the inflation rate for the seventh straight year, according to a survey that found the total annual cost at one elite school reaching more than $19,000 a year. 6 Pennsylvania Avenue's rebuilding will be completed with a 3-million-square-foot, $370-million trade and cultural center and Federal office building that is to be the crowning jewel of the Federal Triangle. 6 Dole urges AIDS issue to be kept out of 1988 race 8 Soviet scientist said to ask asylum 8 Nuclear plant evacuation plan called inadequate 8 Congressman resist cutting census queries 9 Ceremonies mark dam's 50th year 9 Regional 29-31 Mayor Koch suffered a 'tiny' stroke on Thursday, his doctors concluded after administering new tests requested because he had re-experienced the symptoms that led to his hospitalization Thursday morning. 1 The type of stroke the Mayor had is generally regarded by doctors as having a prognosis of complete recovery, but it could be followed by another stroke. The type of stroke is often called a lacunar. 31 In the Queens cable-television case, a public relations consultant was found guilty of collaborating with Donald R. Manes, the late Queens Borough President, in soliciting a bribe for the awarding of the cable franchise. 1 The collapse of a bridge on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway in April could have been avoided had the New York State Thruway Authority properly inspected and maintained the structure. a new report shows. 1 The X-rays of Howard Johnson's bat were negative. Baseball entered the era of the random bat test as X-rays of the bat used by Johnson to hit his 27th home run of the season did not reveal any foreign substance. 1 An appraisal: Broadway's boom in construction has added sleek glass to the brick and limestone of old Broad way.

To begin with, Rembrandt looks different because of a young American scholar, Gary Schwartz, who published in 1985 a revisionist study called ''Rembrandt: His Life, His Paintings.'' Working with day-to-day contemporary documents, rather than with traditional iconographical methods, he came up with new ideas on virtually every aspect of Rembrandt's career.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE GODDESS LETTERS. By Carol Orlock. (St. Martin's, $15.95.) This first novel is just what the book jacket says it is: ''The Myth of Demeter & Persephone Retold.'' Here expanded, touched up, re-created, it is retold in fact by mother and daughter themselves through letters spanning roughly the years 1500 B.C. to A.D. 425. Their initial occasion is Persephone's rape and abduction by Hades (here depicted as part sullen, ghoulish trickster and part hapless clodhopper). As we follow the two goddesses through Eleusis, Olympus and the nether world we become reacquainted with an array of Classical figures. (Even Homer makes a cameo appearance.) Demeter recounts her end of the story with a blend of carp and immortal hauteur, while Persephone settles into a vexing adolescent vernacular: ''Once long ago the immortals threw stones to decide who got what, and Poseidon won the sea. Mother got the fertility on earth - definitely best. And Zeus got sky. Zeus is my father - but he's married to Hera. I never actually met her, but I don't like her.'' Ms. Orlock uses her sensuous pictorial imagination to advantage in rendering the chilling underworld landscapes, where we embark as if on an eerie pleasure cruise down the Cocytus. The author has apparently devoted considerable research to her subject but her attempt to convey the power of ancient myth through modern sensibility and language is undermined by a self-conscious, academic approach; deeper concerns such as the complexities of mother-daughter relationships or the decline of matriarchal power are sounded, but only hollowly. One finishes ''The Goddess Letters'' feeling a little like Erysichthon, condemned to perpetual famine - the more he ate, the more he hungered.",1987-08-09T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 The Sandinistas called the accord a historic step toward peace, but are warning that important obstacles remain. Opposition activists said they had seen no concrete steps toward restoring political freedom since it was signed. 13 Revelations during the hearings on the Iran-contra affair have prompted the intelligence services of some friendly nations to reduce the information they share with the United States, officials said. 1 When the President gives his speech to the nation on the Iran-contra affair on Wednesday, he is expected to dispute Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter's assertion that the ''buck stops here with me'' in the decision to divert arm sales profits to the contras. 11 The surrender of arms by Tamils in Sri Lanka and the agreement to end the guerrilla war marked the culmination of an extraordinary diplomatic breakthrough by Colombo and New Delhi, which had tried to arrange an end to the war since 1983. 1 Canada admitted Nazi collaborators to the country after World War II because of misleading information supplied by United States intelligence officers, a study for a Canadian Government commission says. 1 Moscow is beginning to deploy a new land-based missile, and that has started a new battle over Soviet compliance with the strategic arms treaty of 1979. Some officials said the Russians appeared to remain in compliance. 3 Pretoria may talk on Namibia 8 2,500 at South Africa funeral 9 Pope sets U.S. tour schedule 11 U.S. escorts 3 ships into gulf 12 National 18-27 Mail-in test kits for the AIDS virus that several companies plan to offer have stirred concern among public health officials and drawn harsh criticism from many doctors and groups working with AIDS patients. 1 Louisiana's execution process is part of what seems likely to be an inexorable national increase in executions as legal barriers fall and death sentences increase, experts said. 1 The American Antiquarian Society of Worcester, Mass., will celebrate its 175th anniversary with an open house. In a reading room usually closed to the public, people will find early American books, newspapers, maps and broadsides. 18 Vying to have a radioactive dump, three remote Mojave Desert towns hungry for jobs hope that being host to the dump will bring an economic lift. ''It'll bring people into the area,'' a resident of one town said. 18 Only a handful of Rajneeshees, followers of the Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, remain at his ranch nearly two years after allegations against the guru became public. 18 The American Bar Association began its annual meeting in San Francisco. The legal impliations of AIDS and the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the United States Supreme Court are among the topics occupying the people in attendance. 23 Democratic Presidential hopefuls Michael S. Dukakis and Richard A. Gephardt, who have been stalking each other in Iowa for weeks, jousted there over trade and energy policy in a one-on-one debate. 22 Ex-Armco chief is said to be choice for Commerce job 19 Delta pilot loses license 20 Hard times at anti-abortion PAC 25 Mormon official castigates press 27 Regional 28-36 New York City's heroin industry is in a sudden restructuring as Chinese criminals have taken over the dominant role in the multibillion-dollar enterprise that for decades was the preserve of the Mafia, officials said. 1 Doctors described Mayor Koch as sufficiently recovered from a minor stroke to be able to return to Gracie Mansion sometime Sunday, but they said he still faced a period of greatly reduced physical activity. 28 At the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, Calvin O. Butts, the executive minister, has taken on the city's white and black leadership and allied himself with more radical elements of the black community. 28 A plan to help compulsive gamblers stop gambling gained unusual support from two Atlantic City casinos last week. The casinos posted signs notifying patrons that help was available by calling 1-800-GAMBLER. 36 New York City's new lobbying law is encountering some problems. Some law firms that engage in lobbying have failed to file the required reports, or filed them late or incomplete, a city councilwoman said. 33 A junior high school in the Bronx has been ordered closed because of failure to improve its educational performance in reading and math and low attendance rates. 29 Longtime fugitive captured 30 Helping a detective's widow 31 Dolphin deaths examined 32 Poor lack adequate legal advice in evictions, report says 32 New York bolsters recreation programs 34 Employers warned on hiring illegal aliens 44",1987-08-09T05:00:00+0000

Unable or unwilling to speak, she said only one word during her 82 years in Aytolles Parish, Louisiana - and then nobody was around to hear it. When the violin next landed in the chubby fingers of the boy destined to become the Fiddling Prophet of Jesus, who would have guessed he'd meet the Devil in the arms of little Icy Fee Moulder or that she would cast a charm on the violin with the rattle from a snake she killed? Thus Ms. Kennedy (whose previous books have been for young adults) traces the history of a prized Stradivarius through its unlikely possessors. Although not all its owners are aware of the monetary value of the instrument it becomes clear to most of them that a violin by any other name does not play as sweet. This violin evokes passion as well as odd behavior even when the player does not possess natural musical ability. Besides the Stradivarius, one constant throughout the book is the Strait family, the violin's current owners, who include an aged beauty queen, Baby Sheba Todd, a half-wit musician, Boo, and a preacher, Brother Heck, among other assorted eccentrics. The one thing the Strait women have in common is the susceptible Moseley men, who introduced the instrument to the family. About the only thing the diverse Strait men have in common is their name. The author of this very funny book appreciates both the ridiculous and the predictable goings-on of daily life. Generally a superb storyteller, Ms. Kennedy occasionally overwrites - her too-cute descriptions and Southernisms in the opening sections get in our way. But it doesn't take long to get past that as we're taken home to meet the family.",1987-08-09T05:00:00+0000

World War I conjures up images of weary troops shooting it out in the trenches and daring aces dogfighting in the skies. All the action, of course, takes place in Europe. In ''The Great War in Africa, 1914-1918,'' Byron Farwell gives long overdue attention to theaters of war where wild animals were more feared than enemy soldiers, insects often bit harder than bayonets and bacteria actually accounted for more fatalities than bullets. Mr. Farwell, the author most recently of ''Eminent Victorian Soldiers,'' focuses on the eccentric characters and unlikely events of the period. For example, there was the expedition - possibly the inspiration for the book and film versions of ''The African Queen'' - in which two British launches were brought crashing overland through the muck and mire of the Belgian Congo to Lake Tanganyika, where they attacked and forced the surrender of a larger German gunboat. This quixotic mission was mounted by one Lieut. Comdr. Geoffrey B. Spicer-Simson, R.N., an aging braggart whose arms and torso were covered with tattoos and who wore a skirt he had designed himself. ''It was not a sarong or a kilt, but a skirt,'' Mr. Farwell writes in the droll and authoritative tone he maintains throughout the narrative. There is, unfortunately, little in this volume about the lives and lot of African soldiers; few African participants left accounts of their adventures. The tidbits Mr. Farwell has dug up are surprising. How many people know, for instance, that ''the first British bullet fired in anger'' in World War I came from a rifle aimed by a black soldier in what is now Togo?",1987-08-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"UP THE COUNTRY: A Saga of Pioneering Days. By Miles Franklin. (Beaufort, $15.95.) Readers may know Miles Franklin, the early feminist and prolific Australian writer (1879-1954), as the author of a classic novel, ''My Brilliant Career.'' But ''Up the Country'' was considered her finest work; first published in 1928, it is now appearing in this country for the first time. Based on tales told by her grandmother, the novel was written to extol the values and the individualism that Franklin felt were threatened by industrialism. By telling the story of three Australian families of the mid-19th century - the Mazeres, the Pooles and the Brennans - she re-creates the feisty spirit, feuding, ceremonial rituals and hardships of life on the frontier. Symbolically it begins with the baptismal showers of a great, overdue rain; it concludes with a tragic funeral that unites the community as evening falls. What's most compelling are Franklin's feminist loyalties: with the exception of Bert Poole, a headstrong frontier man, the women in the novel, notably Rachel Mazere, a tough-minded matriarch, outshine the men as they defy the elements - and often their husbands - to tame the wilderness. ''Men have not yet learned,'' she writes, ''. . . that male courage is often nothing but a recklessness, induced when the temperature is high. But women's courage is conceived in cold blood . . . and that is why it is the more deadly.'' Franklin has a keen ear for dialogue, a sharp eye and wit; though her narrative is densely poetic and her language at times florid, she can be ironic, especially when writing about men. And she never falters in rendering the rich texture of life on the frontier.",1987-08-09T05:00:00+0000

While the 10th anniversary of Elvis Presley's death (on Aug. 16, 1977) has stirred up nostalgia and hype, here's a concert that might bring something new to the Presley legacy. Otis Blackwell wrote some of the best-remembered Presley songs - among them ''Don't Be Cruel'' and ''All Shook Up'' - as well as ''Great Balls of Fire'' and ''Breathless,'' for Jerry Lee Lewis. His demo recordings helped shape Presley's phrasing. Tomorrow, Mr. Blackwell will sing with the Black Rock Coalition Orchestra, led by Vernon Reid, a fireball of a guitarist who'll probably have some unorthodox ideas about updating the impact of rockabilly. Tomorrow at 8 P.M., Celebrate Brooklyn will also present two other rock concerts this weekend. Tonight's double bill, starting at 8, features the gruff, terse, muscular, angry songs of Persian Gulf. And on Sunday at 8 P.M., the Persuasions will harmonize - all voices, no instruments - on a repertory that encompasses doo-wop, gospel and their own songs.

But what must have looked like a kind of Primitivism then, and still seems somehow innocent, was in fact as laboriously calculated as the Cubism that was its main inspiration.

Lietzke chipped in from 40 feet for an eagle 3 on the 17th hole at the Castle Rock Golf Club and holed another chip, this from about 25 feet, for par on the 18th to complete a round of six-under-par 66. Scoring in the tournament is based on a system in which points are awarded or subtracted depending on a player's performance on each hole. Five points are awarded for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, none for par, minus-1 for bogey and minus-3 for double bogey or worse. Lietzke's effort converted to a score of 14 points, the best of the day.

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. COASTAL, #300 Amsterdam Avenue, at 74th Street (769-3988) - **(June 12, 1987) A contemporary glass-fronted dining room and coastal mural provide the backdrop for a serious new fish house on the Upper West Side. Among the recommended appetizers is a trio of vibrant little ceviches, each in a large mussel shell and four-pepper gravlax. The New England clam chowder is a tasty starter as well. Good options for main dishes are broiled halibut with a choice of sauces; red snapper under a concasse of tomatoes, scallions and basil, and broiled grouper with a Provencal sauce with olives, capers and onions, and any of the grilled fresh fish of the day. Entrees $10 to $17.25. Fridays and Saturdays, 6 P.M. to 2 A.M.; Sundays, 6 to 10:30 P.M. HATSUHANA, #17 East 48th Street (355-3345) - ***(Feb. 21, 1986) Cheerful dining rooms on two levels, each with elongated sushi bars flanked by rows of simple wooden tables, provide a suitable stage for the colorful production put on by the personable sushi chefs. The highlights of the menu are sushi and sashimi in many varieties; and you might order the Hatsuhana special, which includes both of the raw fish specialties as well as tempura and grilled skewered fish. With fish as fresh as this, some of the least elaborate presentations may be the most appealing: negihamachi, which is chopped mild-flavored yellowtail flecked with scallions; negitoro, chopped belly of tuna with scallions, and slices of mackerel blended with pickled ginger and wrapped in Japanese white radish. Dinner entrees $15 to $29. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and 5 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 10 P.M.; closed Sundays. JANE STREET SEAFOOD CAFE, #31 Eighth Avenue, corner of Jane Street (243-9237) - *(May 8, 1987) This Greenwich Village restaurant has a rustic tavern-like setting with brick and natural wood walls, low lighting and blackboard menus; and the kitchen prepares a staggering variety of fish and shellfish. Starters include steamed clams; fried bluepoint oysters with tartar sauce, and mussels steamed in wine and sherry with shallots and garlic. You can usually rely on the cripsy golden-brown fried fillet of sole, or when available, fried soft-shell crabs. Other winners are poached fillet of salmon with a mild dill sauce, and red snapper under a profusion of sauteed onions, tomato and basil. Entrees $11.50 to $19.95. Fridays and Saturdays, 5:30 P.M. to midnight; Sundays, 4 to 10 P.M. JOHN CLANCY'S RESTAURANT, #181 West 10th Street (242-7350) -",1987-08-14T05:00:00+0000

He was reported to be displeased with the White House's failure to assign him a major role in diplomatic efforts to work out a regional peace settlement. Page 1 News analysis: The Latin peace plan proposed by President Reagan, put forth in part to demonstrate that the Administration was moving forward after the Iran-contra hearings, is instead causing the White House nothing but difficulty. 5 The Salvadoran rebels accepted President Jose Napoleon Duarte's offer to meet for peace talks next month as part of a regional peace effort.

Redskins Beat Steelers: Ricky Sanders and Art Monk each caught touchdown passes last night in Washington to lead the Redskins to a 23-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the exhibition opener for both teams. With the Redskins leading by 16-14 early in the second half, Sanders slipped behind Harvey Clayton and grabbed a 14-yard pass from Doug Williams to cap a 77-yard 9-play drive. Pittsburgh, hampered by three third-quarter fumbles, could manage only a field goal by Gary Anderson in the second half. The Steelers drove to the Washington 48-yard line in the final minutes, but an illegal-motion penalty wiped out a first-down pass from Steve Bono to Danzell Lee and Pittsburgh did not threaten again. Jay Schroeder completed 11 of 17 passes for 160 yards while playing only the first half for Washington.

Eric Chaisson opens ''The Life Era'' with nearly 50 pages of the cosmic, hyperbolic kind of prose that Carl Sagan has made famous. This is followed by an equally long section that almost seems an attempt to recapitulate the history of Western thought. Finally, on page 109, the book begins. Here Mr. Chaisson, the author of the much-acclaimed ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life,'' gives us an exceptionally clear exposition of the subtle interplay between entropy and information and the ways in which structure arises from chaos. All this is in preparation for his history of cosmic evolution, in which the Energy Era gave birth to the Matter Era, which spawned the Life Era, a time when intelligence and consciousness become as active as the laws of physics in choreographing the great pageant of universal change. This isn't as mystical as it sounds. While Mr. Chaisson, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, shows an appreciation for such metaphysicians as Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, at the core of his being he is a materialist who rejects vitalism and teleological explanations of all kinds. While some readers will dismiss Mr. Chaisson's call for a holistic, global ethic as naive, others will be struck by how much he seems to care - not only about the fate of the earth but of the universe. Unfortunately, his self-conscious style interferes with his message. Even when discussing ancient and medieval philosophy, he manages to refer to himself on almost every page.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

No one demonstrates this better than the toughest turnaround manager of them all, Lycurgus. It was during a Helot uprising (read: ''labor unrest'') that he was asked to rescue his organization, Sparta. He succeeded so well that Sparta not only recovered, but later whipped the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War. Lycurgus's steeliness more than 3,500 years ago can be a model for 20th-century managers. His strategy boils down to nine very modern steps: 1. Preparation",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

Rolph writes on the first page of this second volume of his memoirs, ''I had arrived at something between the essayist, the historian, the polemicist, and the crusader'' as the definition of his life's work. For a 17-year-old's vision (recalled 68 years later), it was remarkably prescient. After stabs at accountancy in an effort to find ''the 'bread-and-butter job' which would earn me the leisure time for writing,'' Mr. Rolph turned to his father's profession. In a quarter-century on the City of London police, he acquired the grounding in the ''huge national industry'' devoted to ''the preservation of what we nowadays call Laura Norder'' that along with his social compassion informed his writing. He wrote part time while on the force and full time after that - scripts for the BBC, pieces for The New Statesman (he was a member of the staff) and reports for the countless commissions on which he sat, on penology, on mental health, on the aging. Charming when not resigned at how little injustices change, and at times highly personal, ''Further Particulars'' is a cross between autobiography and social history that lets the reader share everything from the slow fading of the 19th century in the City to Dame Rebecca West's style of character assassination - all transmitted with the polish and tony modesty that educated Britons of not inconsiderable achievement use to such advantage.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE LEAGUE OF NIGHT AND FOG. By David Morrell. (Dutton, $17.95.) In 1941 Hitler ordered his henchmen to grab people ''endangering German security'' and drag them off without a trace into the ''night and fog.'' David Morrell's latest thriller, whose title comes from the infamous ''night and fog decree,'' is about how a group of Israelis scarred by the Holocaust turns the tables on a menagerie of former Nazis. It's not a bad idea for a novel. Probably everyone who suffered at the hands of the Nazis has imagined giving his tormentors a dose of their own medicine. But Mr. Morrell doesn't let well enough alone. Instead, he gives us a class reunion of cutthroats from his previous thrillers, bringing back Saul (a k a Romulus), the C.I.A. gunslinger from ''The Brotherhood of the Rose,'' and Drew, the church hit man from ''The Fraternity of the Stone.'' One wonders why he didn't also call in Rambo, the one-man army from his aptly named debut novel, ''First Blood.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Morrell's facility with words doesn't help him in creating credible characters. He has a Swiss peasant woman who spouts some stilted mumbo jumbo about how to identify a priest in mufti. And he has a couple of cardboard killers who try to save their fathers from the avenging Israelis (actually, a cabal of spry old coots who used to be Mossad agents). The Nazis, for their part, have a sort of gray power Elks Lodge and, like good old boys, toast one another on such occasions as the Fuhrer's birthday. But don't despair. If you haven't had your fill of Drew and Saul, you're in luck. Mr. Morrell hints that the pair will be back for an encore.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"EVIL ANGELS. By Pascal Bruckner. Translated by William R. Beer. (Grove, $16.95.) ''I was going to Asia in search of a holy turmoil,'' declares the narrator of Pascal Bruckner's novel, published to some acclaim in France in 1981. He gets a double dose without ever leaving the Mediterranean. Scarcely has his ship left Marseilles when Didier, an earnest young Parisian, falls under the spell of a morally twisted doctor, Franz, who, Ancient Mariner-style, grips him by the arm and over the course of five nights relates a bizarre tale of sexual obsession. Initially repelled, Didier listens with growing fascination as Franz tells how he emotionally enslaved his beautiful, exotic wife, Rebecca, tormented her mercilessly and eventually became her pathetic plaything. As it happens, Rebecca has already succeeded in mesmerizing Didier, with Franz's approval. Together these evil angels set about corrupting Didier and alienating him from his longtime girlfriend. All this should make for wicked entertainment, but it doesn't. The prolix doctor's analyses of the human passions grow appallingly tedious. The miserable Didier has to endure such weighty observations as: ''Feelings are something that can be lost, like your watch; they can be slowly drained, like a bank account, but they can also be found again, like a hat you have misplaced.'' In addition, a wretched translation turns Franz's monologues into a weird mishmash of slang and pompous pronouncement. The main problem, though, is that Mr. Bruckner aims for evil but never gets beyond kinky. For the real thing, readers might turn to ''Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BEST INTENTIONS. By Kate Lehrer. (Little, Brown, $15.95.) The 17-year-old daughter of an influential Washington political commentator is murdered, and subsequently a mother-daughter relationship based on guilt trips comes to light. The journalist, Sarah Corbin Adams, has made it big by charming intimate truths out of powerful interview subjects; in her own life, she is an insecure, dictatorial phony whose obsessive love is like a bear trap. Demanding perfection of her only child, Sarah is the sort of woman who buys her daughter's clothes, lays out her outfits at bedtime and meddles with unacceptable friends. In her first novel, Mrs. Lehrer (who lives in Washington) presents a milieu of genteel materialism populated by stressed-out functionaries and bitchy party guests. We find it difficult, however, to sustain interest in her self-centered characters, all thinly drawn. It doesn't help that the narrator, Sarah's researcher, is unperceptive and demonstrates little gift for description: ''She was 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood' come alive for grown-ups,'' she gushes about her employer's social ease at a soiree. At 28, the researcher is unable to detach herself from the domineering mother-mentor figure who attempts to impose order on everyone within reach. A subplot about a former national security adviser involved in shady dealings with a tiny African nation only intrudes on the frequently compelling domestic drama and its violent conclusion. Distasteful as they are, the shouting matches between the publicly serene Sarah and her tormented daughter come through as raw and real.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

It is hard to differentiate between the good and the bad guys. Plots become so complicated, the action often so tenuous, that the exasperated reader is tempted to hurl the book through the window. And yet we captive wretches persevere. Where will all this take us? When will the fog lift? It is worth the effort to work your way through FOR THE GOOD OF THE STATE by Anthony Price (Mysterious Press, $16.95). Mr. Price is one of the better practitioners of the post-le Carre genre. He gives us two elderly secret agents. One is a Russian archeologist who also is high up in the K.G.B. The other is his opposite number in England - a former professor, a medievalist, an espionage agent who was in the field and now is an invaluable analyst of Russian affairs for an arcane agency.

The St. Louis Symphony is a fine group and, as the most important American orchestra led by a native-born American, is accustomed to working with new American scores. Slatkin, in turn, has known Bolcom since they were together at the Aspen Music Festival in 1964 and is a brisk and efficient master of rehearsal time. Still, the first run-through was full of opportunities for improvement.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

New York's Mayor was greeted by cheering subordinates on his first day back at work since he was hospitalized 10 days ago after suffering a minor stroke. Mr. Koch, who spent three days in the hospital, said he would heed his doctors' orders to cut back his hectic schedule. Holding forth at his second news conference in five hours, he said, ''I'm a person who takes advice from physicians. I came within a hair's breadth of being paralyzed.'' The stroke, which was characterized by his doctors as ''tiny'' and ''trivial,'' caused a temporary slurring of his speech and a slight drooping of the left side of his face. The Mayor said he was not concerned about the political ramifications of his illness. He said he was just ''happy that I came through this without what the doctors refer to as a deficit.''",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

us,ANSWERING THE MAIL,"Q. Over the years I have put many coats of clear sealer on my flagstone patio. This finish has yellowed over the years, so I would like to take it all off and get back to the natural flagstone. Any suggestions? A. Although I am not familiar with the particular brand of sealer you have been using, most stone sealers can be removed with a chemical paint and varnish remover. I would recommend a semipaste type that can be washed off with water. Spread it onto a few square feet at a time, wait about 15 minutes, then scrub off the softened finish with a stiff brush dipped into a detergent solution. Flush off with lots of water. Q. The uninsulated air-conditioning ducts in my basement drip condensation onto the carpet. The ducts in my garage are insulated, but they also drip when the unit is running. My air-conditioner man told me to cover the ducts with a special blanket that can prevent this, but then where would the condensation go? A. The ''blanket'' he is referring to is insulation with a vapor barrier on the outside. Insulation without a vapor barrier lets air through to the cold metal ducts so condensation can form. But a vapor barrier around the outside will keep warm, moist air from coming in contact with the cold metal - so condensation will not form at all.

In the amendment to the conversion plan the sponsor agreed to a roof repair job in which it would be stripped, insulated and covered with a four-ply cap sheet. But what the sponsor did, which can be verified in photographs and an engineer's report, amounted to a patch job that saved $25,000 in repair costs. As the repairs were negotiated in lieu of money for the reserve fund, can the rental tenants force the sponsor to make good on the repair job agreed to in the amendment if the co-op board refuses to press the issue? . . . R. M., Manhattan Answer: Yes. Russell McGurk, a spokesman for the New York Attorney General's office, says the interests of rental tenants, just like those of co-op or condominium buyers, are protected by the laws pertaining to conversions. If you believe terms of the conversion plan for your building have been ignored or violated, file a complaint with the Attorney General's Real Estate Financing Bureau at 120 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10271.

Joseph Olshan's second novel, a coming-of-age tale spiced with a good measure of ethnic conflict, is set in a Westchester town where middle-class Jews and blue-collar Italians make uneasy neighbors. Daniel Fell is sensitive, intelligent and Jewish. He is also fluent in Italian. When he begins dating the tough-talking Julietta, his friends suggest caution. Her cousins, the Polanno brothers, are gangster apprentices who are rumored to have slaughtered the animals at the local children's zoo. But Daniel finds a friend and protector in the football hero Gianni Scaravento. The two share a kind of outlaw status because Gianni has also crossed the tribal boundaries and is seeing a Jewish girl. Their bond grows stronger with Daniel's late-night visits to Gianni's dying mother; she's thrilled to reminisce about the old country in her native tongue. The Polannos, however, manipulate events in such a way that Daniel loses the trust of both mother and son. Bewildered by their rejection, he discovers just how rigid social barriers can be. Although well designed and engagingly told, the novel too obviously echoes ''West Side Story'' and even ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Daniel, of course, emerges from this somewhat stagy cross-cultural experience wounded but more mature. Still, by placing the economic and ethnic tensions in high relief, ''A Warmer Season'' becomes a novel about teen-agers of compelling interest to adults.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

But most people seemed to be having too much fun watching the numbers go higher.

But denim's most important duty is to be sturdy, practical and comfortable, requirements for both parent and child.

And again, there is a mixture of textures: wools, acrylic blends and cottons. Dots are everywhere, for both boys and girls. Autumn offers many romantic, feminine looks, with enough ruffles, lace and glitter to entice any young lady out of her blue jeans, at least for a while. Full twirling skirts with fitted bodices, flounces, petticoats peeking from under swishy taffetas, soft velvets with lace collars and cuffs, organdies and shiny satins - there is much to choose from.

Daphne Hurford is a genuine lover of dance, and she wants her readers to share her admiration for ballet dancers, especially male dancers. In telling the brief story of Max Fuqua, a troublesome but promising young student at the School of American Ballet, Ms. Hurford, a former editor of Life, has produced a breezy little book for young adults about the demanding life at one of the most prestigious ballet schools. Dance students from around the world vie for admission, and the Fuqua family moved to New York City from Dallas when 13-year-old Max was accepted. The author shows great empathy for adolescents and captures the intense competition and the physical and emotional agonies of a young student's daily life. About one-third of the book is devoted to brief profiles of past and present male stars of the New York City Ballet. In a simple narrative form, Ms. Hurford gives us a picture of the loneliness and anguish dancers must endure. She is a good listener and storyteller. Unfortunately, the book has its problems. Perhaps to fill the pages of a slim book about a teen-ager's life, the writer has interspersed a lengthy history of ballet -from its establishment as an art under Louis XIV to the present. During these interruptions, the story bogs down and reads like a term paper. Still, ''The Right Moves'' offers young readers and dance fans a heartwarming peek into a very special fraternity.",1987-08-16T05:00:00+0000

Although I am not familiar with the particular brand of sealer you have been using, most stone sealers can be removed with a chemical paint and varnish remover. I would recommend a semipaste type that can be washed off with water. Spread it onto a few square feet at a time, wait about 15 minutes, then scrub off the softened finish with a stiff brush dipped into a detergent solution. Flush off with lots of water. Q. The uninsulated air-conditioning ducts in my basement drip condensation onto the carpet. The ducts in my garage are insulated, but they also drip when the unit is running. My air-conditioner man told me to cover the ducts with a special blanket that can prevent this, but then where would the condensation go? A. The ''blanket'' he is referring to is insulation with a vapor barrier on the outside. Insulation without a vapor barrier lets air through to the cold metal ducts so condensation can form. But a vapor barrier around the outside will keep warm, moist air from coming in contact with the cold metal - so condensation will not form at all.

Intervention by Congress is the wrong way to set local rail policy. But the substance is right; the M.T.A. could act on its own to ban smoking on its commuter trains. The provision was initiated by Congressman Robert Mrazek to solve a problem in his district on Long Island. Conductors object to working in smoking cars and have filed thousands of grievances against the railroad. They threatened a walkout if disciplinary action were taken against those who refused smoking-car duty. Smoking cars also offend passengers. New Jersey Transit banned smoking on its commuter trains last year after determining that most nonsmokers prefer to stand rather than sit in smoking cars. The same is true of L.I.R.R. riders. As long as there is a shortage of seats during rush hours, smoking cars contribute to the crowding. The grimy ''smokers'' are also more expensive to maintain and repair.",1987-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Ron Kiefel of the powerful 7-Eleven team finished second and moved up to fourth place over all, giving 7-Eleven the first four spots in the general standings. In the women's race, Leslee Schenk broke into the lead 18 miles from the finish and won the 58-mile Copper Mountain Road Race. Jeannie Longo of France is the overall leader. Rosola, 30 years old, of the Bianchi-Italy team, won his second race of the Classic. Running in a lead pack of six riders, Rosola went in front with about 25 miles to go when Jaanus Kuum of Norway and Roberto Pagnin of Italy exchanged blows. Kuum contended he was pushed by Pagnin and responded with a shove of his own. Pagnin said the incident started on Sunday when the two had words. He and Kuum were fined $25 each for the incident and will be assessed 20-second penalties in the overall standings. Jeff Pierce of 7-Eleven finished 14th yesterday but retained his overall lead.

The timing apparently represents an energy-saving arrangement the animals have developed in the course of evolution. While it moves at high speed, the wallaby does not have to exert extra energy in breathing. Its internal organs surge forward and back, giving the effect of a mechanical air pump impelled by the changing momentum of the animal's stride. Air is squeezed out of the lungs as the internal organs push forward against the diaphragm; air is drawn back in as the lungs are forced to expand when the viscera move back.",1987-08-18T05:00:00+0000

The victory capped a two-year recovery from a car accident in which she suffered ankle and eye injuries. Complications from the accident, which included bouts with pneumonia and asthma, kept her from regaining racing form last year. Brunet, a Canadian now living in Monument, Colo., extended her margin with each lap during the 29-lap, 44-mile circuit that wound around the base of a ski area about 70 miles west of Denver. The victory moved her from 16th to fifth place in the standings.(AP)",1987-08-19T05:00:00+0000

They can be quite surprising, too. From a distance, the Dipway Arch, near Seventh Avenue, appears handsome but no-nonsense. As you get closer, however, you see that there is a fanciful arcade within. Seven tall but shallow brick niches, each framed by an arch with keystone, line both sides of the tunnel. Quite different is the next arch to the northeast, Driprock, which has a deeply coffered ceiling and recessed panels along the walls, looking something like a brick rib cage. To the northeast again is Willowdell Arch, which combines an arcade and coffered ceiling.

I have tried pure Clorox, a polishing compound and lots of rubbing, but nothing has worked. Do you have any suggestions? A. Most ''plastic'' sinks are made of fiberglass. It is possible the brown stain is actually rust and if so, a rust remover may be your best bet. If this doesn't work, try a cleanser called Zud (sold in many plumbing outlets, as well as in supermarkets). If even this fails, go to a marine supply store and buy a hull cleaner that is sold for removing rust and engine exhaust stains from Fiberglass hulls. These chemical cleaners should also work on your sink. Q. Our house is five years old. A professional termite inspection was done last year when we bought the house and indicated that we have no termite problem at present. I would like to treat my house against termites in the future and have read several articles about this. Can homeowners do a satisfactory job doing this themselves? A. In my opinion, no. Protecting against termites, or treating termites when they are found, is definitely a job for an experienced exterminator who is licensed to do this kind of work.

But so far Alan Greenspan, the new man at the helm of the Fed, has been quiet about the state of the dollar - unlike his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker. The dollar firmed in midweek, but then fell further as bearish statements from Japan and a lack of intervention from West Germany and the United States to halt the slide traders made uneasy.

us,NONFICTION,"In the half-dozen essays that make up the bulk of this hefty work, the history of the Vienna Opera is laid out in an engaging, clear and thoughtful fashion. The authors assembled in THE VIENNA OPERA (Rizzoli, $65) by Andrea Seebohm, a music critic and the editor of the volume, have written a history that not only details the progress of opera in Vienna during the last 350 years but also instructs about the characteristics of operatic production everywhere. In discussing the development of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra, Otto Strasser, a violinist in the ensemble for many years, comments on the fostering of a distinctively national sound and the benefits of a diversified schedule for the musicians who play both for the opera and the Vienna Philharmonic. Wolfgang Greisenegger's essay on set design puts the perpetual battles over realistic or abstract productions in historical context. There are intelligent treatments of architecture and ballet by Wilhelm Holzbauer and Riki Raab. Andrea Seebohm's introduction makes for a concise history of opera in Vienna before 1869, when the Vienna Opera was founded. The largest portion of the book is by Egon Seefehlner, a former director of the company, who outlines the accomplishments of each directorship. While he does not shy away from critical comment, one might have wished from Mr. Seefehlner more elaboration on the troubled 1940's and on the controversial tenure of Lorin Maazel. Still, there is fascinating material about Richard Strauss, Mahler, Bohm, Weingartner and other famous musicians who served as directors. The book's several hundred illustrations -drawings and photographs, many in color, of everything from architectural plans to set designs, program books to artist's portraits - articulate their own history of a great operatic institution.",1987-08-23T05:00:00+0000

It was the first death since a wave of labor unrest began sweeping the country. 3 In the Philippines, a national debate over the presence of two American bases has begun with the filing of two bills that would bar nuclear weapons. Such a ban could render the bases useless. 6 In the first formal loan default by any country since the international debt crisis began in August, 1982, Western banks have reportedly notified North Korea that it is in default. 3 Canada's Conservative Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will mark the third anniversary next week.

us,ANSWERING THE MAIL,"Q. We have a white plastic sink that has a yellow stain behind the faucet where water tends to collect. I have tried pure Clorox, a polishing compound and lots of rubbing, but nothing has worked. Do you have any suggestions? A. Most ''plastic'' sinks are made of fiberglass. It is possible the brown stain is actually rust and if so, a rust remover may be your best bet. If this doesn't work, try a cleanser called Zud (sold in many plumbing outlets, as well as in supermarkets). If even this fails, go to a marine supply store and buy a hull cleaner that is sold for removing rust and engine exhaust stains from Fiberglass hulls. These chemical cleaners should also work on your sink. Q. Our house is five years old. A professional termite inspection was done last year when we bought the house and indicated that we have no termite problem at present. I would like to treat my house against termites in the future and have read several articles about this. Can homeowners do a satisfactory job doing this themselves? A. In my opinion, no. Protecting against termites, or treating termites when they are found, is definitely a job for an experienced exterminator who is licensed to do this kind of work. Questions about home repair should be addressed to Bernard Gladstone, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.

us,FICTION,"BLOODSONG: And Other Stories of South Africa. By Ernst Havemann. (Houghton Mifflin, $13.95.) The best of these South African tales occupy a tenuous territory of truce in which a white man is invited to observe an ancient tribal ceremony; a white soldier frees a guerrilla from a crevasse; and ''every small white boy has an umfaan,'' a black companion and caretaker. Blacks address whites deferentially in Afrikaans, and even conservative whites learn a grudging respect for black co-workers. Ernst Havemann's orderly fictional world resembles that of Athol Fugard in '' 'Master Harold' . . . and the Boys.'' But that play was set in 1950, and Mr. Havemann's stories appear to take place in the present; a reader may wonder whether this society still exists in South Africa, even in rural areas. To some extent the question is precluded by the author's simple, fabulist style. He makes good use of Zulu legends, animal metaphors and exotic tribal praise-names. But there is little structural complexity in these stories. The author is more occupied by his subject - South Africa's rural, white-dominated society - than in developing a short-story technique of his own. When explicit racial tension doesn't inform the stories, as in ''The Animal Lover'' and ''Tom and Beauty,'' they seem flat and familiar. For readers of South African fiction little new ground is broken in this first collection. However, especially in the four stories previously published in The Atlantic (among them the title story), Mr. Havemann nicely captures the ironies of whites trapped in the collusion of sustaining black culture. Mr. Havemann, who was born in Zululand, learned Zulu as a first language and spent much of his adult life as a mining engineer. The majority of the stories in ''Bloodsong'' clearly reflect the authenticity and texture of experience.",1987-08-23T05:00:00+0000

If this doesn't work, try a cleanser called Zud (sold in many plumbing outlets, as well as in supermarkets). If even this fails, go to a marine supply store and buy a hull cleaner that is sold for removing rust and engine exhaust stains from Fiberglass hulls.

This situation did not exist in any significant degree even as recently as the 1950's, when opera still could seem to be primarily about the vocal feats and interpretative insights of people such as Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi and Jussi Bjoerling, artists who were theatrically persuasive in various degrees but who all could create dramatic tension and convey emotional meanings simply by opening their mouths.",1987-08-23T05:00:00+0000

And of course, there are the acoustics, which many critics say are among the best in the country. It's really a beautiful hall, with a rich history. ''But you have to remember,'' he added, ''that there was a 20-year hiatus - from the early 1960's, when Lincoln Center opened, through 1984, when we finished refurbishing the hall - during which we were eclipsed. We're recovering from that, slowly. We've had to focus on the past and the future, because we didn't have much of a present. But we've built a nice little family of people interested in the hall.

Memory keeps records for us, chooses this story and drops that one, builds odd manticores out of authors who happen to have met at our bedside. As readers, we change what writers write, cut it to fit our daily quotas, give it the tone of that particular moment in which something was read, mirror it in other texts of similar plot or style - in a word, make the writing ours. And because reading is a lonely vice, we frequently bring others into our reading; we nudge them to listen, to share our delight or disgust, to judge our selection. Every reader is an anthologist who breeds readers. When I was 10 or 11, and living in Buenos Aires, my eldest aunt, who late in life had adopted strict Edwardian manners, gave me her commonplace book. It was a scrapbook with fake white marble covers, and on the gray pages my aunt had copied out favorite passages from a long life of reading -mainly Spanish romantic poets and French novelists now mercifully forgotten, such as Jose de Espronceda and Anatole France. She had inscribed the names of the authors in her voluted handwriting, but to me the only author of this collection was my aunt. I could recognize, here and there, lines that she was Continued on page 22 fond of repeating, and certain words and phrases that had her intonation. ''He had never known desire except in the uttermost depths of love,'' my aunt's voice sang from the page. The line, used to describe one of my more colorful uncles, had thrilled me.

In his previous two starts, both in daylight, he lost to the Cubs at Shea Stadium and then squandered a five-run lead for a no-decision against the Cubs in Chicago. Knock, knock. Who's there? It's me Doc, Davey. Davey? Davey who? Oh c'mon, Doc, You know. Davey, your manager. What is it? What do you want - at this hour? Do you know what time it is? Certainly. It's 10 in the morning.

I don't think I'd trade it for my king-size mattress, Doc. Besides, scientists have discovered that a little sun is good for you. Vitamin C and all that. That's easy for you to say.

us,Q&A,"Q.How do city pigeons take care of their young? Although pigeons live on the ledge under my air-conditioner, there is no sign of nest-building or chicks. A. Urban pigeons don't necessarily build elaborate nests, or any nests at all, according to Michele Ball of the Audubon Society. ''Sometimes they just find a sheltered corner on someone's terrace,'' she said, adding that they are particularly partial to outdoor carpeting made to resemble grass. People seldom see signs of nesting, Ms. Ball said, because baby pigeons reach adult size very quickly, in about 10 days. A female pigeon can have two or three broods a year, usually of two chicks each. Q. Why are there so few thunderstorms early in the morning? A. Collisions of warm and cold air masses can produce thunderstorms at any time of day. Most common, however, are storms that occur when air warmed by the earth's heat rises to cooler altitudes, where moisture within it condenses to form clouds. The process creates ''a natural generator'' of lightning, according to Robert J. Banner, a climatologist at the National Weather Service. The tops of the clouds become positively charged with electricity, he said; their bases have a negative charge,and the earth under them has a positive charge.",1987-08-25T05:00:00+0000

THE Australian film ''Backlash'' begins with a brief, crude sequence in which a young aboriginal woman is attacked by her employer, an older white man whom she proceeds to murder and emasculate (we are later told) with a garden shears. How will the film, which is the second dramatic feature by Bill Bennett, make use of this episode? As it turns out, the focus shifts quickly from the murder to the man-and-woman police team assigned to escort the accused woman to her trial. Once these three begin their journey together, the film shifts gears entirely and becomes an odd hybrid, a whimsical, eccentric road movie with an element of mystery.",1987-08-27T05:00:00+0000

The coup attempt was the most serious assault yet on Mrs. Aquino's Government. Page 1 News analysis: The rebellion by disaffected soldiers reflects a deep discontent within the military that has erupted in a series of threats and coup attempts throughout President Aquino's tenure. 1 U.S. officials expressed confidence that President Aquino would withstand the immediate problems presented by the coup attempt against her Government, but some expressed concerned about the longer-term implications. 5 The Philippine rebellion's leader, Colonel Gregorio Honasan, is seen by Filipinos as an example of the best and the worst in their military. Colonel Honasan's whereabouts was unknown after the insurrection. 5 The Saudi Government is preparing an unusual offensive against the Iranian ruler, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, planning to challenge him as a braggart and idolator in the theological councils of Islam, some ranking Saudis say. 1 Iran's foreign policy is hardening, diplomats stationed there say. They are detecting the change amid the clues sprinkled through the public pronouncements and actions of the Teheran leadership. 2 In Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau returned to Parliament for the first time in three years since the end of his 15-year tenure as Prime Minister and his virtual disappearance from public view. 1 In South Africa, talks resumed between black mine union leaders and officials of the giant Anglo American Corporation as employers dismissed another 13,000 miners in the 19-day-old wage dispute. 3 A South Korean shipyard worker was buried almost a week after he died in a clash with the police, but opposition groups failed to turn his funeral into a day of protest. Nonetheless, the Government started a crackdown. 3 A seminary in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, was permitted by the Vietnamese Government to reopen and enroll 49 students. The numbers are small compared with the need of the country. 4 Mexicans feast on their first candidate breakfast 3 Tenancingo journal 4 National 6-9, 28, 32 An agreement with six airlines aimed at reducing delays at four of the nation's busiest airports was reached by the Government. The agreements come after a series of secret meetings over a two-week period. 1 The fundamentalist Christians' drive to shape public education more to their liking remains very much alive despite three major legal setbacks this summer, authorities on both sides of the issue agree. 6 Aliens who test positive for AIDS will be barred from immigrating to the United States. The new policy also requires illegal aliens who are applying for amnesty under the new immigration law to undergo AIDS testing. 32 A lobbying effort by the President on behalf of the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court began. The President said that Judge Bork would ''take a tough, clear-eyed look'' at crime issues. 6 Releasing some radiation might be safer than risking a ''catastrophic'' release in a reactor accident, Vermont and Federal officials suggested as they debated whether a Vermont plant's steel and concrete shell should be vented. 6 A hydrogen explosion may not be preventable by the Government if a major accident occurs at a nuclear plant here that resembles the Soviet Union's Chernobyl reactor, according to a new study. 6 The first test of a new booster rocket for the space shuttle was delayed again after engineers found a series of software problems in the computer that runs the firing. The test will be held no earlier than Sunday. 9 The number of dead dolphins washing ashore along parts of the eastern coast appears to be dwindling, but scientists were unable to say whether the disease that has been ravaging the mammals had run its course. 8 The American Medical Association led an effort to destroy the chiropractic profession by depriving its practitioners of association with medical doctors and calling them ''unscientific cultists,'' a judge ruled. 8 Endangered owl is focus of Audubon Society meeting 8 Union rebuffs G.M. on 2d proposal 9 3 die for crimes in 3 states 9 Monsanto ruling in dioxin case is upheld 9 Constitution cited as bar to Reagan pension 28 Regional 29-31 Mentally ill homeless people deemed ''incapable of taking care of themselves'' will be involuntarily hospitalized by New York City, Mayor Koch said. The new policy vastly expands the city's treatment standards. 1 Eastman Kodak prevailed upon the University of Rochester to rescind acceptance to its business school of an employee of a rival. Kodak said it feared its employees would be inhibited in the classroom. 1 Police officers wounded in a shootout charged in a suit that they were injured because the Police Department severely bungled its first attempt to arrest the suspect. Three of six officers that had been wounded made the charges. 30 Rudolph Giuliani has not ruled out running for senator, governor or mayor, he said. But Mr. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said a decision would have to wait until pending government corruption cases are resolved. 31 Two men posing as police officers investigating a murder have held up nine bars and their patrons in Manhattan and Queens since July, the police said. The cash taken has ranged from about $1,000 to $3,800. 31 Mayor Koch expressed shock at ''the lack of outrage'' being voiced by the city's religious and civic leaders about the burning of a couple in Prospect Park, and wondered whether that stemmed from the fact that the victims were white. 29 A study of the Meadowlands and the surroundings of the sports complex will be performed in an effort to allay fears that there are cancer-causing elements in the area, New Jersey officials said. 29 Renewal in Atlantic City slum 29 Black-Hasidic patrols seek harmony in Crown Heights 29 Therapy aids Chinatown youths 29 Plan for Coliseum site is criticized in court 31 Koch picks deputy as successor 31",1987-08-29T05:00:00+0000

Great art, which even in our time is not always preceded by the beating of the publicity tom-toms, has a way of turning up just at that moment when no one expects it.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MONKEYS. By Les Roberts. (St. Martin's, $12.95.) What does a private eye novel need? A crime; a victim. Women - a few sexy, full blown; one fragile, resistant and adorable. Men -many, big and bad, some good but not heroic, an unfriendly police lieutenant. A couple of bodies no one will miss. Rich people. And a sophisticated, velvet-gloved, iron-fisted peg of a private eye who fits into any situational hole. In Les Roberts's pleasant if predictable first novel, set in contemporary Hollywood, they're all there. Also a professor who eats health foods, a black drug dealer-student and a wealthy publisher. Mr. Roberts's would-be victim is a Los Angeles author, Buck Weldon, who turns out best sellers about a stereotypical private eye. His trashy stories are, he says, a living. Someone wants him dead. He has two daughters. The sweet one is his secretary and lives at home; the other is a promiscuous addict supported by dad. Each has, or had, a worthless man who detests her father. Characters in Weldon's new novel resemble people in a high-level financial scam at a Hollywood studio. Stylistically, Mr. Roberts, a screenwriter, gets off slowly and unsteadily. He describes someone's Pepsodent teeth (in this Crest generation) and allows Saxon, the private investigator and part-time actor (he has one name), to fall for the novel's first good-looking woman. Mr. Roberts's strength lies in descriptions of places like Venture City in West Los Angeles and Palm Springs or in deft characterizations of people - a literary agent or a movie magnate dining out.",1987-08-30T05:00:00+0000

This will soften the adhesive backing so that scraping with a razor blade will be easier. When scraping, hold the blade almost flat against the bottom of the tub to avoid scratching and move it back and forth as you push it forward under the decal. Q. Can I use Clorox and detergent on a blacktop driveway to get rid of a green mold that is spreading over the surface at a rapid rate? A. The green mold (moss) can be washed off with a solution of Clorox and water (one part Clorox to four parts water), but adding detergent does not really help much. You can also use one of the fungicide solutions sold in swimming-pool supply stores. Any of these should be kept off the lawn, or washed off with lots of water.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"FLIGHT FROM FIESTA. By Frank Waters. (Swallow/Ohio University, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $9.95.) Frank Waters's new novel, his first in nearly 20 years, tells of an unlikely friendship between a snotty little 10-year-old Anglo turista and an old, alcoholic Pueblo Indian. Set in Santa Fe in the 1950's during an annual fiesta, the plot has the economy and stateliness of a fable. Elsie, in rebellion from her materialistic parents, has a tantrum in the plaza and destroys the old Indian's pottery. Suddenly and mysteriously, she is moved by his ''massive dignity,'' his ''strange and compelling immobility.'' Inocencio, the Indian, is in turn drawn to Elsie by enigmatic tribal and paternal impulses and, with no words exchanged, no sense of logic or consequences, they take off on an odd and remarkable two-week odyssey through increasingly remote frontier towns, mountain areas, deserts and ancient Pueblo dwellings. During their adventures, the ''old, atavistic hate'' between Indian and white is purged, and a touching reconciliation takes place before the story's predictable, tragic conclusion. Inocencio is more a force of nature than a conventional character; muted and aloof, his unexpected outbursts of affection and joy make him thoroughly charming and lifelike. The real pleasure of ''Flight From Fiesta,'' however, is the evocation of the landscape, with its ''empty, illimitable sea of sage'' and the ''alien remoteness'' of dying frontier towns. Born in 1902, Mr. Waters, author of ''The Woman at Otowi Crossing'' and ''Book of the Hopi,'' is noted for the painterly eye he brings to the Southwest. Here, it remains as keen as ever. For all its allegorical bluntness and old-fashioned impulse to tell even after something has been vividly shown, ''Flight From Fiesta'' has an admirable authenticity and humaneness.",1987-08-30T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW FACES FOR THE NEW SEASON,"THEODORA SKIPITARES Puppeteer, age 40. Temperamental actors? This New York director has found a way around that problem. Most of her players are life-size puppets, like Marie Curie (behind screen). Those who missed her humorous look at science, ''Defenders of the Code,'' can see it next month at the Performing Garage. Beyond science? ''The History of Food,'' due next year. GERI ALLEN Jazz pianist, age 30. After creating a stir among the New York avant-garde with her virtuosity and versatility, Allen garnered fans from Paris to Tokyo. Her style encompasses African-derived rhythms and Thelonious Monk's lush harmonies. Her album ''In the Middle'' came out this summer; after a fall European tour, she'll return to the New York clubs. MILCHA SANCHEZ-SCOTT Playwright, age 32. This Bali-born writer (standing) arrived in Los Angeles by way of Colombia and Mexico. Her plays about domestic dynamics are infused with humor and the bizarre. ''Roosters,'' in which cockfighting is the family business, is being filmed for PBS's American Playhouse, and a new work, ''Evening Star,'' is to be staged in New York in the spring. SARAH JESSICA PARKER Actress, age 22. Natalie Wood and Elizabeth Taylor did it, but few others have made the transition from child star to successful adult actress. Parker, who starred on Broadway as Annie, seems poised to make that leap. Last year she played an independent young woman in NBC's acclaimed ''A Year in the Life.'' Now the mini-series is to be a series, featuring Parker. WES CHAPMAN Dancer, age 22. To stand out from a corps, a dancer must be able not only to execute the movements, but also to communicate through them. Last year, dancing with American Ballet Theater, Chapman made it look easy, particularly in the romantic ''Les Rendezvous.'' He'll return to Lincoln Center with ABT in the spring. MARILYN MIMS Opera singer, age 31. This soprano from Collins, Miss., walked away a winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditions last year, a triumph that helped bring about her debut as Violetta in New York City Opera's ''Traviata.'' In January she'll have her debut with the Metropolitan Opera as Rosalinde in ''Die Fledermaus.'' JOHN HIATT Singer/songwriter, 35. With a new album out (''Bring the Family'') and a national tour this fall (he's at the Bottom Line tomorrow), this Nashville-based musician may get the recognition he deserves. Hiatt's quirky, heartfelt songs, sung in a soulful drawl, combine gospel emotionality with ironic literary edges: Elvis Presley meets Elvis Costello meets Randy Newman. KENT NAGANO Conductor, age 35. Two New York orchestras will follow the baton of this Californian in November: the Brooklyn Philharmonic at BAM's Next Wave Festival and the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center. The double debut reflects Nagano's successes in classical and contemporary repertory, including Robert Wilson's ''Salome'' at La Scala last season. ELLEN DRISCOLL Sculptor, age 34. The organic and the totemic, the flow of life and the rigid form. This New York-based sculptor (seated), winner of a 1987 Guggenheim Fellowship, melds the two in her work (''Sorrento,'' above, is an example), which can next be seen in the spring at the Damon Brandt Gallery. LAURIE METCALF Actress, age 32. She has lately been exploring venues beyond Chicago's Steppenwolf, the troupe in which she honed her considerable skills. Recently she played the earthy Liverpudlian of ''Educating Rita'' in New York. She's made some excursions to Hollywood, too, for this year's ''Making Mr. Right'' and for ''Stars and Bars,'' due out this winter. COURTNEY B. VANCE Actor, age 27. Sharing a stage with James Earl Jones is a formidable prospect. But Vance, in his Broadway debut as the son of Jones's character in August Wilson's ''Fences,'' collected a Tony nomination for the role. This fall, the Detroit-born graduate of Harvard and the Yale School of Drama can be seen in the film ''Hamburger Hill,'' as well as in ''Fences.'' ROB BESSERER Dancer, age 37. Media are frequently mixed in the arts, and Besserer, a dancer who can act (or an actor who can dance), finds plenty of projects that use both of his talents. Martha Clarke in particular has kept him busy, most recently in ''The Garden of Earthly Delights.'' Next March he'll do a turn with Lar Lubovitch's modern dance company.",1987-08-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"HEARTSTONES. By Ruth Rendell. Illustrated by George Underwood. (Harper & Row, $10.95.) Someone's been tapping that cask of amontillado again, and it isn't the Raven. Ruth Rendell, the British author of psychological suspense novels, has tried in ''Heartstones'' to combine the horror story and whodunit. The result, unfortunately, stays all too dead. Blond, anorexic, self-absorbed Elvira, the teen-age narrator, and her plump, dark sister, Spinny (for Despina), a compulsive eater, live near London with their fastidious father, Luke, a widower, in a 15th-century stone house facing the cathedral where he sometimes preaches. Not only the house but the characters are haunted. Spinny sees a cat that walks through doors; Elvira, when she isn't reading Poe by herself, or ''Medea'' in Greek with Luke, lavishes most of her thoughts on her father, whom she idolizes, perhaps for good reason: ''I have been told too often that [ mine ] is a beautiful face. If it is (as I have also often been told) a facsimile of Luke's it must be beautiful''; and Luke seems to reciprocate in an arctic way until he thaws over Mary Leonard, ''a distinguished medievalist'' - emphasis on the evil, it doesn't matter whose. As Elvira chills to her monotonous narrative, there is a death under mysterious circumstances and a suicide. The tantalizing aspect of this book in the Harper Short Novel Series is not the trick ending but the development of Elvira. By the end, the character is no longer a precious, unsympathetic twit but a young woman of some depth and insight. It's too bad she's walled in alive by ''Heartstones.''",1987-08-30T05:00:00+0000

Aquino. The leaders of the attempted coup were at large. Page 1 Iraq broke an informal cease-fire with Iran on attacks on Persian Gulf shipping with bombing runs on Iranian offshore oil installations that left an Iranian supertanker ablaze and another ship possibly damaged. 1 The attacks on the two ships have increased concern among Administration officials who said they feared an increased risk of a clash between Iran and the United States. 14 Mozambique is in desperate shape, in need of outside aid after being torn by the civil war. Officials stress that the war, combined with unusually dry conditions in the last several months, threatens millions of people. 1 A lawyer for Clayton Lonetree, the former Marine sergeant sentenced to prison for spying, said that the defense would seek to have the sentence set aside because prosecutors had falsely portrayed him as the first Marine convicted of spying. 7 Israeli riot police broke up protests at dusk by hundreds of black-garbed Orthodox Jews demonstrating against the showing of movies on Friday nights, and bursts of tear gas wafted through Jerusalem. 13 Japan could send minesweepers to the Persian Gulf under its Constitution, which renounces war, the Prime Minister declared. But he will not order such a mission because of a risk that they could become embroiled in combat. 16 A dead town is a monument to a disaster 3 2 more strikers killed in South Africa 3 Argentina has first televised debate 6 Weapon issue stirs doubts in Sri Lanka 11 Revolutionary Guards dominate Iran's military 15 Case stalled in Mexican beating of U.S. agent 17 National 20-27, 38-40, 43 Abortion-related activities by family planning clinics that receive Federal funds would be more tightly restricted under proposed rules announced by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 1 A people-less county's high taxes were established by Nevada's Legislature to make the cost too exorbitant for the Federal Government to use it as a radioactive dump site. But some say the plan has backfired. 1 The home of boys infected with AIDS was destroyed by a suspicious fire, officials said. The boys' mother said that they would be withdrawn from school and that the family would leave DeSoto County, Fla. 1 Fraudulent treatments for AIDS are the subject of a campaign by Federal and state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration has already acted in a number of such cases and California has created a task force to handle the issue. 20 Lawyers for Lyn Nofziger, the former White House aide charged with violating ethics laws, suggested that the special prosecutor, James C. McKay, may have to disqualify himself because of a conflict of interest involving his law firm. 26 The Pope will meet Jewish leaders and thrash out such issues as the Holocaust, diplomatic recognition of Israel, and probably the event that sparked the meeting - the Pope's audience with President Kurt Waldheim of Austria. 20 Dole says budget cuts threaten travel safety 21 New method of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease is announced 24 Government called lax on identifying hazardous dumps 25 Lawyer sees hope for a retrial in Atlanta Murders 26 Regional 28-36, 41-44 The use of illegal drugs appears to be generally decreasing among Americans, but, at the same time, the poor face mounting deaths and an ever bleaker future because of drug abuse, according to government statistics and interviews. 1 The placement of homeless people from New York City in New Jersey hotels is facing rising opposition in North Bergen, N.J. Officials have drafted a letter threatening legal action if the practice is not stopped. 30 In a tenant harassment case, four tenants of an Upper West Side building have been awarded $683,275 from their landlords. Housing authorities found that the landlords had tried to drive tenants out of the building. 35 New York will watch milk prices in light of an agreement between milk dealers and a cooperative of milk farmers to raise wholesale prices.

us,Plucking Nostalgia From Defeat,"Any people needs icons, legends, heroes, but never more than when defeated. As a present garish example, we need look no further than Rambo. The prostrate, despairing South after Appomattox exalted leaders like Lee, Davis and Jackson and rewrote parts so that cameo players would appear as stars, skirmishes as battles and defeats as victories. Southern artists churned out drawings from which printers (many of them in the North) made cards, posters - and money. In THE CONFEDERATE IMAGE: Prints of the Lost Cause (University of North Carolina, Cloth, $32.50; Paper, $14.95), Mark E. Neely Jr., Harold Holzer and Gabor S. Boritt collect and annotate much of this artistic output. The authors, who previously collaborated on ''The Lincoln Image: Abraham Lincoln and the Popular Print,'' often point out inaccuracies, such as a mythic meeting between Grant and Lee before the surrender and the ultimate ''Lost Cause'' depiction (in 1880) of the day in 1864 when Virginia Military Institute cadets, called from their books and drills, charged Union lines at New Market, Va. There are other battles - almost bloodless, of course - and contemporary inspirations, such as ''The Burial of Latane,'' a gentle and genteel, enormously popular 1862 depiction of the real-life interment of a Confederate cavalry captain whose mourners are mainly home-front women and sorrowing slaves. It is hard to remember that most Civil War antagonists thought of themselves more as citizens of Georgia or Massachusetts than as Americans. The best epitaph on that vision was perhaps that of a Virginian who rode with Jeb Stuart and Joe Johnston and remarked to his granddaughter many years later, ''I could not take up arms against my people, but I am very glad we still have a nation.''

Today, the classics have it when Elmar Oliveira, the first American violinist to win a gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in Moscow, plays works by those masters and Ysaye and Saint-Saens. Accompanied by Robert McDonald at the piano, Mr. Oliveira performs at 6:30 P.M. On Saturday, in a concert that's become a traditional Labor Day weekend event, Lee Andrews and the Hearts, the Dubs and the Regents take the stage twice, at 7:30 and 10 P.M., to rock-and-roll across the venerable theater's stage. Guild Hall is on Main Street in East Hampton. For tickets call 324-4050. CYCLING CRAZE When it reached its first peak at the turn of the century, cycling was still considered a fad that would pass with time and the developing wisdom of its practitioners. The sport, or actually pastime, fooled everyone and has stayed around long eough to warrant a nostalgic, but scholarly, look back. That's what the Suffolk County Historical Society has done in ''The Cycling Craze 1890-1910,'' its current exhibition. With antique bicycles, bicycling memorabilia and photographs from the museum's extensive collections, the curators take a close look at the impact that the introduction of cycling had on social habits and transportation methods. For example, the show explores how the bicycle brought freedom and independence to more than just travel; it also affected how people dressed (it helped kill corsets and petticoats), and even how the sexes related to each other.",1987-08-30T05:00:00+0000
