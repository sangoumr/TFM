Instead, we see a melange of images so full of geography - Notre Dame Cathedral, the Sydney Opera House, Fifth Avenue - that the work mocks the idea of any specific setting.

The American men's 400-meter relay team, the favorite for the gold medal, was disqualified from competition Friday after officials ruled it had passed the baton out of the zone in a heat. The incident was the latest bit of trouble for a team already amply beset by controversy. Internal disputes had left the team without cohesion or comaraderie. ''I think it was doomed from the start,'' said Russ Rogers, the team's coach. It certainly was after 300 meters Friday when Calvin Smith and Lee McNeill failed to complete their pass. The Kenyans continued to run with such grace and without the slightest trace of a grimace that it all appeared effortless. Simply walking from these Games, though, may be another matter. They have got a lot of gold to haul back home. Peter Rono of Kenya won the men's 1,500 meters and his countryman, John Ngugi, minutes later captured the 5,000 meters to finish a day when Kenyans took three gold medals in distance events. Julius Kariuki earlier won the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Paul Ereng of Kenya got everything started for Kenya when he won the 800 meter at the beginning of the week. Paula Ivan of Rumania set an Olympic record when she won the women's 1,500 meters in 3 minutes 53.96 seconds. Boxing Ray Mercer stood on the top level of the medal platform and took a bite of his gold medal, testing its authenticity. In a traditional ceremony, it was a symbolic moment, one that captured in many ways the identity of the entire American team. As unorthodox as they were unheralded, they are a brash and loose collection of fighters who are not above having a little fun during the biggest moments of their lives. And they are - like the medal Mercer put between his teeth - for real. Mercer stopped Baik Hun Han of South Korea in the the final of the heavyweight division. Kennedy McKinney of the United States took a gold in the 119-pound class, gaining a 5-0 decision over Alexandar Hristov of Bulgaria. Michael Carbajal lost a tough decision at 106 pounds and had to settle for the silver. Three more American boxers were scheduled to fight for gold today. Tennis When Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini both qualified for the final in women's singles, people joked that Seoul had merely turned out to be like any other stop on the women's tour. And the match turned out to be like most others between the two. Graf, who earlier this month completed the Grand Slam, completed he bid for the gold medal in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3.",1988-10-01T05:00:00+0000

Without multinational good will on the grand scale, and without the close cooperation that is now standard form between museums in France and the United States, the show would never have made it out of dreamland. It is an indispensable show. Contrary to what is often supposed, Edgar Degas is one of the least known and least well understood of the great European painters. Many of his finest achievements are in museums in remote places or in private collections to which access is not always easy. Often they are too fragile to be on regular exhibition. In his work, as in his life, Degas was the most complex, as well as the most private of men, and there are great paintings in the present show that have resisted elucidation for more than 100 years and continue to do so. The easy Degas, who spawned his undemanding dancing girls by the dozens, is familiar to everyone who tours the dealers' galleries and the auction rooms. But the Degas who really matters is the difficult Degas who went his own way for more than half a century and still defies us to keep up with him.",1988-10-02T05:00:00+0000

(The Hebrew letters have numerical equivalents that form the basis for a mystical understanding of the meanings of the various words.) In fact, chai means ''life.'' The translation of ''good luck'' would be ''mazal tov,'' with a value of 94. I'll bet that most congregations would prefer that kind of contribution by far. DANIEL S.

THE FACTS: A Novelist's Autobiography, by Philip Roth. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.95.) Mr. Roth's simple subtitle fronts for a combined short novel, apologia, confession, nostalgia exercise, self-explication and several other modes and entities. NELLY'S VERSION, by Eva Figes.

A woman who has lost her identity to masculine conventions finds clarity through amnesia and dual personality in this shrewdly executed feminist satire (first published in Britain in 1977).

us,New & Noteworthy,"AND THE BAND PLAYED ON: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic, by Randy Shilts. (Penguin, $12.95.) ''AIDS did not just happen to America,'' Randy Shilts writes in his chronicle of the pandemic. ''It was allowed to happen.'' And, he concludes, the Reagan Administration, public health officials, the communications media and the leadership of the gay community all share the blame. Last year, The Times's Christopher Lehmann- Haupt called the book ''a heroic work of journalism.'' ROCK SPRINGS, by Richard Ford. (Vintage, $6.95.) Sick of pretending that it is really possible to change his aimless life, a character in the story ''Rock Springs'' is momentarily astonished to find himself stranded in a motel parking lot, looking for another car to steal. The other pieces in Richard Ford's collection are also about marginal men and women (even some marginal children), drifters whose lives have a way of jumping the track. ''The finest of [ these stories ] achieve luminous moments, moments with potential to change how the reader sees and thinks,'' our reviewer, John Wideman, said last year. ARMED AND DANGEROUS: The Rise of the Survivalist Right, by James Coates. (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) The paranoid fanatics who belong to The Order, Posse Comitatus and the other anti-Semitic groups in James Coates's book call the Federal Government ''ZOG,'' for Zionist Occupational Government, and they stockpile weapons in preparation for a revolution that they are certain is ordained by God. This is ''an excellent piece of work,'' Wayne King said here last year, ''both a good read and a chilling warning.'' WEAVEWORLD, by Clive Barker. (Pocket, $4.95.) The Fugue is a universe woven entirely in a carpet, where a people called the Seerkind hide from their enemies in the outside world. Last year, our reviewer, John Calvin Batchelor, said Clive Barker has created ''a fantastic romance of magic and promise that is at once popular fiction and utopian conjuring.'' FREEDOM SONG: A Personal Story of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, by Mary King. (Quill/Morrow, $12.95.) In the early 1960's, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or ''Snick,'' attracted many of the youngest and most militant of the civil rights workers who interrupted college and career to fight racism in the South. Mary King's chronicle of the movement ''will stand as a monument to that wondrous time,'' Susan Brownmiller said in The Times last year. TEMPTING FATE, by Laurie Alberts. (Washington Square/Pocket, $6.95.) When this first novel about a band of misfits in an Alaskan fishing village was published last year, our reviewer, Deborah Kirk, said it ''ably evokes a climate and style of life that few will ever know, much less imagine. [ It ] is a perceptive work of adventure fiction.'' SECRECY AND POWER: The Life of J. Edgar Hoover, by Richard Gid Powers. (Free Press/Macmillan, $12.95.) In 1924, J. Edgar Hoover replaced the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who had fallen because of the Teapot Dome affair. Almost half a century later, during the Watergate scandal, he died in office. Last year our reviewer, Norval Morris, called this ''the best biography of Hoover so far.'' THE OXFORD GAMBIT, by Joseph Hone. (Collier/ Macmillan, $4.95.) A Soviet mole has burrowed deep within the labyrinth of British intelligence. In 1980, Peter Andrews said here that Joseph Hone's novel ''gives us a view of the world of espionage as a self-contained universe, intricate and deadly, following its own baroque rules.'' IDOLS OF PERVERSITY: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Siecle Culture, by Bram Dijkstra. (Oxford, $14.95.) In the 19th century, when women began to rebel against their roles as baby-makers, men waged psychological warfare with misogynist art and literature. Last year, our reviewer, Alessandra Comini, called Bram Dijkstra's book ''an ensemble of acrid evidence that will titillate the sadomasochistic set and sadden champions of human rights. . . . Readers may be able to put Mr. Dijkstra's persuasive book down, but they will not be able to forget its message, so applicable to the end of our century - that ideological dualisms, whether about sex or race, are also deadly.'' THE POWER OF SILENCE: Further Lessons of Don Juan, by Carlos Castaneda. (Pocket, $4.95.) In the eighth installment of Carlos Castaneda's tales of the Yaqui sorcerer, the narrator ascends to ever higher planes of consciousness. ''His relationship with his teacher seems more egalitarian than in previous books, and the character of Don Juan appears more modern and less macho,'' Margot Adler said here this year. FIRST LINES: Poems Written in Youth, From Herbert to Heaney. Edited by Jon Stallworthy. (Oxford, $7.95.) To better understand the development of poetic sensibility, Jon Stallworthy collected verse written by great poets when they were young. ''Many of the poems . . . are moving, over and above their literary value, as reminders of the exaltations and uncertainties of growing up,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1987. A CASE OF LONE STAR, by Kinky Friedman. (Berkley, $3.50.) Country western singers are being murdered in a Manhattan nightspot, and our hero, a musician turned detective named Kinky (named after the musician turned author Kinky Friedman) manages to catch the killer. ''It's all very refreshing, this un-self-conscious meld of author and not so fictional character,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review last year.",1988-10-02T05:00:00+0000

The unseeded Chang, who turned pro in February, is ranked 36th in the world. The left-handed Visser used his serve effectively and attacked Chang's at every opportunity. Visser also used drop shots and lobs well to gain a set point against Chang at 5-4. But Chang cut down on his errors and unleashed a flurry of passing shots and winning volleys to take the first set. The only service break of the second set came in the ninth game when Visser failed to handle Chang's powerful service returns.(AP) Soccer Newcastle Upsets Liverpool: A late goal on a penalty kick by the Brazilian star Mirandinha gave Newcastle United a 2-1 victory at champion Liverpool yesterday on a day of upsets in the English First Division.

For someone so young, 23 years old, Brian Bosworth - The Boz - has picked up an awful lot of wisdom. He's an expert, for instance, on the generation gap: ''Adults are so screwed up. There's no pleasing them. They don't know what they want. Except two things: (1) they don't want you being any different than anybody else on the block; and (2) they want to yell at you.'' Mr. Bosworth, the linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, is as differnt as they come - witness his Boz earring and Boz hair style. And why bother raising your voice when you can wreak sanctioned havoc, which brings us to the Boz's two goals on the football field: getting into fights and hitting people on the head. Thoughtfully, Mr. Bosworth provides detailed instructions. ''There are some surefire tricks. Like, if the guy is down, take his helmet and bang it a bunch of times against the ground. Or maybe stick your finger in his earhole and jam it around.'' For pearls of wisdom like these, Mr. Bosworth has reaped the scorn of ''adults,'' the adulation of ''kids'' and an $11-million contract. Written with the aid of Rick Reilly, a Sports Illustrated writer, the book takes the form of a long, sometimes rambling monologue. Nevertheless, amid the sophomoric rantings of someone so privileged due to his athletic prowess that he practically owned Norman, Okla., where he attended Oklahoma University, there is the occasional insight into college and pro sports, including drug use, recruitment and the coaching ability of Barry Switzer. In the end, Mr. Bosworth admits that what he does - play football for a living - ''isn't a real job,'' but then, ''The Boz'' isn't a real book.",1988-10-02T05:00:00+0000

The simile refers to a character's voice, but it's an equally apt description of the stories in Mary La Chapelle's first collection. In ''House of Heroes: And Other Stories,'' she chooses rough-hewn subjects - a mime and a giant who struggle with nonconformity, a boy who finds a dead body. But Ms. La Chapelle's writing and insights are smooth and elegant, a respite for readers bored with minimalist fiction and self-indulgent heroes. The recipient of the 1986 PEN/Nelson Algren Fiction Award, Ms. La Chapelle produces work that is traditional yet unexpected, analyzing small-town life in the Great Lakes region with compassion and a sharp eye for the odd detail. Her special turf is the inner territory that lies between sanity and insanity - and the ways people who find themselves on either side view those on the other. The title story, for example, is about a woman who works in a halfway house for disturbed boys. In ''Faith,'' a mentally ill teen-ager attaches herself to a psychologist. And in ''The Meadow Bell,'' one of the most beautifully realized stories, a man floats between past and present, reason and madness, as he seeks to impress an outsider who, it turns out, is trying equally hard to impress him. The control and restraint that Ms. La Chapelle shows in this story is enviable as she deftly avoids the ''sentimentality close at hand . . . like an embarrassing pet waiting at the door.'' Here and elsewhere, her heroes are of the everyday sort - misunderstood, struggling, maybe even crazy. But she makes us care about them, and believe that they would care about us.",1988-10-02T05:00:00+0000

Jones, a promising 19-year-old fighter from Pensacola, Fla., was so disillusioned by the decision that he said he might never fight again. Later, Riddick Bowe, the superheavyweight from Brooklyn, saw his fight stopped early in the second round after taking his second mandatory eight count. He merely shook his head at the referee's surprising decision and walked away in dismay. The day was not a complete loss to controversy, though. Andrew Maynard scored a 5-0 decision over Nourmagomed Chanavazov of the Soviet Union at 178-pounds to win a gold medal. Water Polo Terry Schroeder, the captain of the American team, remained in the water after the final game was over. He didn't want to leave the pool because he didn't want to acknowledge what had just happened in it. No matter how long he stayed, though, Schroeder, a chiropractor, couldn't make the dull ache go away. The United States, which had finished second to Yugoslavia in Los Angeles in 1984, watched a 5-2 halftime lead wash away as Yugoslavia rallied for a 9-7 victory. Soccer After 32 years, 104 minutes didn't seem an unreasonable amount of time to wait for the gold medal. The Soviet Union, which hadn't won the gold in this sport since 1956, defeated Brazil, 2-1, in overtime. The game, which was supposed to feature a clash of styles between the flamboyant Brazilians and the disciplined Russians, wound up a demonstration of mutual inertia for the first half. But the teams traded goals in the second half and then the Soviet Union won it on Yuri Savichev's goal in the 104th minute of play.",1988-10-02T05:00:00+0000

Many economists and Government officials have been hoping for signs of slower overall growth, out of fear that the economy may overheat. [ Page D1. ] More stocks fell than rose in the third quarter, and volume declined even further. Shares in companies that were takeover targets continued to be active, however, as 9 of the Big Board's top 10 gainers were involved in takeover actions. [ D1. ] COMPANIES California's challenge to the merger of two big grocery chains comes partly in reaction to an increasingly concentrated supermarket industry. Analysts note that mergers like the one between American Stores and Lucky are encouraged by the highly competitive nature of the industry, in which the most efficient operators thrive. [ D1. ] The doll wars are heating up. A volley of advertising will begin today to promote Maxie, a new fashion doll by Hasbro. The nation's leading toy company has fallen far behind No. 2 Mattel, creator of the Barbie doll, in the $400 million fashion-doll market. [ D1. ] Maxwell said its rival knew the terms of its bid for Macmillan. The British company said that the auction was unfair because the rival bidder, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, had been told by a Macmillan official that its offer was 50 cents higher than Maxwell's. Both bids have since been raised. [ D3. ] Du Pont denied that it covered up information about accidents at a plant that produces fuel for nuclear weapons. [ A1. ] INTERNATIONAL REPORT Many foreign stock markets declined again in the third quarter, but several that had previously dropped gained in the most recent period. The West German, Italian and Austrian markets had a burst of growth, while those in Canada, Singapore/Malaysia and Hong Kong slipped. Japan's market was essentially flat.

us,How Mets and Dodgers Stack Up,"Mets Catchers (Average, home runs, runs batted in) 8 Gary Carter (.242, 11, 46) The Kid, at 34, endured some dry spells in his 14th season, even after punishing himself into hard shape last winter. He even went three months and 225 times at bat before he hit the 300th home run of his career. 2 Mackey Sasser (.285, 1, 17) Left-handed hitter who arrived in spring training in trade from Pittsburgh, and made impression with hard-nosed style. Good contact hitter, line-drive type, but scatters his throws. 33 Barry Lyons (.231, 0, 11) Reserve catcher for last two seasons, and dependable. Right-handed hitter with some power. Infielders (Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 17 Keith Hernandez (1b, .276, 11, 55) Now 34 and still playing it safe with right hamstring muscle, which was torn four months ago, so he has lost a step. But he is still leader of the team. Hit .341 against Dodgers. 6 Wally Backman(2b, .303, 0, 17) Lost job as left-handed half of platoon at second base because he lost 70 points in batting average last year. Started hitting in May and won his job back in August. 9 Gregg Jefferies (3b, .321, 6, 17) Arrived from minor leagues late in August, and blazed through one month with .323 average and six home runs. Will play second or third, and others will be shifted to make room. 20 Howard Johnson (3b/ss, .230, 24, 68) Hit .371 against Dodgers and will move to shortstop when Mets want big bats in lineup. 21 Kevin Elster (ss, .214, 9, 37) Rookie shortstop with fine glove and style on defense, and good double-play man, but he may be replaced for offense. Outfielders (Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 22 Kevin McReynolds (lf, .288, 27, 99) Steadiest Met. Hit around .290 all season, second to Strawberry in home runs, led league with 18 assists from outfield, stole 21 bases in 21 attempts. 1 Mookie Wilson (cf, .296, 8, 41) Sulked as No. 2 to Lenny Dykstra and asked to be traded. Then got shot at playing in August when Dykstra slumped, and got hot. 4 Lenny Dykstra (cf, .270, 8, 33) Seemed solid in center, but yielded job six weeks ago. Against Dodgers, batted only .143 this season. 18 Darryl Strawberry (rf, .269, 39, 101) The big man who carried the offense for first couple of months, then lost consistency in midsummer, but turned on power and speed in September. Starting Pitchers (Record, e.r.a.) 16 Dwight Gooden (18-9, 3.19) Complained of shoulder pain in August, and lost three of final four, but heads into playoff with strength and numbers. Likes to pitch in Dodger Stadium, and thrives against the Dodgers. 44 David Cone (20-3, 2.22) Came out of bullpen when Rick Aguilera hurt elbow in early May, and blazed way to sixth best winning percentage in baseball history for 20-game winners. Won last eight; hasn't lost since Aug. 17. 12 Ron Darling (17-9, 3.25) Completed seven games, pitched four shutouts, seemed less cerebral and more physical in approach. 50 Sid Fernandez (12-10, 3.03) Often brilliant with low hits and high strikeouts, right knee buckled twice in second half under the stress of 230 pounds. Relievers (Record, e.r.a., saves) 48 Randy Myers (7-3, 1.72, 26) New left-handed tiger of bullpen who replaced Jesse Orosco. Had a hand in 32 victories, striking out one per inning. 42 Roger McDowell (5-5, 2.63, 16) His sinkerball stopped sinking for spells this season. He was recently smacked for 23 hits in 11 innings. For groundouts, he's still the man. 15 Rick Aguilera (0-4, 6.93, 0) One of the front five in rotation until he suffered inflamed elbow and later underwent arthroscopic surgery. Pitched only 23 innings. 26 Terry Leach (7-2, 2.54, 3) When Mets needed a sound arm last year, he won 10 games in a row. When they needed long or short relief this year, he won seven more. Unflappable right-hander with underhand delivery. 27 Bob McClure (2-3, 5.40, 3) Left-hander with World Series experience with Milwaukee. Reserves (Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 11 Tim Teufel (2b, .234, 4, 31) Stopped hitting and opened door for Backman's return in August. Right-handed hitter, likely to start against most left-handers. 29 Dave Magadan (1b, .277, 1, 35) Hit .300 in every minor league and in National League until he wilted under strain of not playing this year. Left-handed line-drive hitter who has problems on defense. 13 Lee Mazzilli (1b/of, .147, 0, 12) Veteran switch-hitter subsided as role player this year, with only 114 times at bat and 17 hits. Manager 5 Davey Johnson At 45, he's had five consecutive winning seasons and a winning percentage of .600, finishing in second place three times and in first place twice. Still commanding figure among players, favors offensive lineup with hit-and-run attack and speed on bases, and loves the long ball. Looks for tactical edge with right-left switches and bold decisions. Dodgers Catchers (Average, home runs, runs batted in) 14 Mike Scioscia (.257, 3, 35) Solid No. 1 catcher who may be the best in guarding home plate against runners great and small. Left-handed hitter who may give way to Rick Dempsey against left-handers. 56 Rick Dempsey (.251, 7, 30) Tough 39-year-old veteran of Yankees and Baltimore Orioles. For last six weeks, Tommy Lasorda has been platooning them. Hit .273 against Mets. Infielders (Position, avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 22 Franklin Stubbs (1b,.223,8,34) Left-handed hitter platoons with Tracy Woodson. Hit seven home runs, all against right-handed pitchers. 3 Steve Sax (2b, .277, 5, 57) Doesn't turn the double play, but he can hit and run. Stole 42 bases, by far the most on the team, and he's the main threat to Mets' poor defense against base-stealers. 33 Jeff Hamilton (3b, .236, 6, 33) Spent six weeks on disabled list after he ran into tarpaulin in San Francisco and pulled rib ligaments in upper chest. Returned Sept. 5 and hit .300 down homestretch. 7 Alfredo Griffin (ss, .199, 1, 27) Hit only .167 against Mets, who put him out of action May 21 when Gooden fastball broke finger. 21 Tracy Woodson (1b, .249, 3, 15) Can play third, but Hamilton has pre-empted move there. May start against left-handers. Outfielders (Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 23 Kirk Gibson (lf, .290, 25, 76) Signed as free agent from Detroit last winter, and he's the key to Dodgers' offensive success. Mets struck him out 19 times in 36 times at bat. Has sore hamstring. 31 John Shelby (cf, .263, 10, 64) Switch-hitter who batted .300 against Mets. Hits in No. 5 spot behind Gibson and Mike Marshall, but has struck out 124 times, the most on the team. 5 Mike Marshall (rf, .277, 20, 82) The cleanup man, right-handed hitter with power and leads club in knocking in runs. Hit .192 against Mets. Starting Pitchers (Record, e.r.a.) 55 Orel Hershiser (23-8, 2.26) The main man, right-hander with snapping stuff, 23-game winner who ended season in record blaze of 59 straight shutout innings over his last six games. 30 John Tudor (10-8, 2.32) Traded to the Dodgers this summer for Pedro Guerrero, and replaced Fernando Valenzuela as chief left-hander. 54 Tim Leary (17-11, 2.91) Onetime star prospect of the Mets who injured his right shoulder in first start in 1981. Seems flat lately. 49 Tim Belcher (12-6, 2.91) Has found steady work with Dodgers and will probably start fourth game. Spent time in bullpen and thrived. Relievers (Record, e.r.a., saves) 50 Jay Howell (5-3, 2.08, 21) Has surpassed Orosco as stopper of bullpen. Right-hander hasn't allowed a run in last 18 games. 26 Alejandro Pe na (6-7, 1.91, 12) Missed all of 1985 and part of 1986 after shoulder surgery, but has made effective comeback as middle relief man. Used 58 times this year. 47 Jesse Orosco (3-2, 2.72, 9) Former stopper for Mets and winning pitcher in three of their four victories in 1986 playoff. Switched to set-up duty for Jay Howell this year. 51 Brian Holton (7-3, 1.70) Effective right-hander who pitched 58 times for Dodgers last year and 44 times this year and gave up less than two runs every nine innings. 29 Ricky Horton (1-1, 5.00) Left-handed relief pitcher who used to trouble the Mets when he was with the St. Louis Cardinals. But he hasn't troubled anybody since the Dodgers acquired him in a trade late in August. Reserves (Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 9 Mickey Hatcher (1b, .293, 1, 25) He and Danny Heep are the main pinch-hitters, and Hatcher is by far the more accomplished: 11 for 36 this year with eight runs batted in as pinch-hitter. 12 Danny Heep (of, .242, 0, 11) Another former Met, left-handed batter who got only four hits in 43 times up this year. 37 Mike Davis (of, .196, 2, 17) Signed as free agent from Oakland, where he hit 22 home runs. 27 Mike Sharperson (inf, .271, 0, 4) Plays anywhere in the infield. Turns faster double play than Sax at second. 36 Jose Gonzalez (.083, 0, 0) Added to playoff team yesterday when Fernando Valenzuela was droppped. He is a good defensive outfielder and an exceptionally speedy runner, but he got into only 37 games and the Mets will see him mainly as a pinch-runner. Manager 2 Tommy Lasorda The family extrovert and gourmet, completing his 39th year in Dodger system and 12th as manager. Led Dodgers to dramatic turnaround after finishing fourth last year, 16 games below .500. Still the evangelist, headed for sixth playoff and possibly fourth World Series.",1988-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,How Boston and Oakland Compare,"RED SOX Catchers(Average, home runs, runs batted in) 10Rich Gedman(.231, 9, 39) Once a solid offensive player with good power but has slipped noticeably in last two seasons. Still, has strong arm behind plate and will keep Canseco honest on bases. 6Rick Cerone(.269, 3, 27) Picked up after his release by Yankees in April and made significant contributions with bat. Infielders(Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i) 38Todd Benzinger(1b, .254, 13, 70) A switch-hitter who will probably face only right-handers. Defense is so-so. 25Larry Parrish(1b, .217, 14, 52) Late acquisition after he was released by Texas Rangers. Will share duties with Benzinger at first. 17Marty Barrett(2b, .283, 1, 65) Teams don't notice he's there until he beats them, and he has that ability. Will bat second in order behind Boggs and can move runners over exceptionally well. 26Wade Boggs(3b, .366, 5, 58) Best hitter in game. Won his fourth straight batting title and collected at least 200 hits for sixth consecutive season. 3Jody Reed(ss, .293, 1, 28) Benefited most when Joe Morgan took over as manager. Moved into starting spot and produced enough to become legitimate rookie-of-year candidate. Superb offensive player, but his defense sometimes can hurt. Outfielders(Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 39Mike Greenwell(lf, .325, 22, 119) Had Canseco not had his big year, Greenwell would surely be league's most valuable player. Defense can be spotty, even scary. 12Ellis Burks(cf, .294, 18, 92) Considered superb athlete with average arm, although he covers ground well in Fenway. Led Boston with 25 stolen bases and hit almost .500 with bases loaded. 24Dwight Evans(rf, .293, 21, 111) Although he turns 37 next month, is still among most productive players in league with 55 homers and 234 r.b.i. in last two seasons. Knows nuances of Fenway. Designated Hitter(Avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 14Jim Rice(.264, 15, 72) His bat has slowed and his power has diminished, but he remains dangerous. Starting Pitchers(Record, e.r.a.) 47Bruce Hurst(18-6, 3.66) Why is he starting Game 1? He was 13-2 at Fenway this season and had 11-2 record after Red Sox losses. Lost his only start against A's this season. 21Roger Clemens(18-12, 2.93) Struggled at times because of injuries. Worked 264 innings and led league with 291 strikeouts. When he's on, his fastball is unhittable. 52Mike Boddicker(13-15, 3.39) Came to Boston in late July trade and finished with 7-3 record, solidfying Red Sox staff. 44Wes Gardner(8-6, 3.50) Former Met who blossomed into starter. Could start if Red Sox are ahead after first three games. Relievers(Record, e.r.a., saves) 48Lee Smith(4-5, 2.80, 29) His acquisition by Red Sox last winter was organization's key move. Although he struggled at times, was still formidable in late innings. 46Bob Stanley(6-4, 3.19, 5) Has come back a long way from last season, when he lost 15 games and had no saves. 15Dennis Lamp(7-6, 3.48, 0) Spent part of August on disabled list with muscle strain in right elbow. 41Mike Smithson(9-6, 5.97, 0) Started 18 games at end of season, but usually gives up the big one: allowed 25 home runs, tops among Boston pitchers. Reserves(Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 7Spike Owen(ss, .249, 5, 18) Lost his job to Reed at the All-Star break. Played in just 89 games but hit .429 in 1986 playoffs. 11Ed Romero(.240, 0, 5) Veteran who can help when he's called on, although it probably won't happen in post-season. 16Kevin Romine(.192, 1, 6) Isn't likely to play, unless it's as pinch-runner. Manager 35Joe Morgan Took over during break for All-Star Game when John McNamara was dismissed. Made number of changes that took effect and turned Red Sox around. Club was 46-31 in his tenure after 12-0 start. ATHLETICS Catchers(Average, home runs, runs batted in) 6Terry Steinbach(.265, 9, 51) He was the unlikely m.v.p. of this year's All-Star Game, but his home run production dropped from 16 to 9. 4Ron Hassey(.257, 7, 45) He returned from knee surgery and was surprisingly able to platoon with Steinbach. 11Matt Sinatro(.333, 0, 5) He played in only 10 games and batted 9 times for the A's. Infielders(Pos., avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 25Mark McGwire(1b, .260, 32, 99) He was a home-run hitting sensation as 1987 rookie of the year, but he couldn't match his 1987 output of 49 home runs and 118 r.b.i. Nevertheless, he's a charter member of the team's Big Bashers. 9Mike Gallego(2b, .209, 2, 20) He played second, short and third and batted more times than he had collectively in playing parts of three seasons. His success, though, did not surpass his previous efforts. 7Walter Weiss(ss, .250, 3, 39) A's traded Alfredo Griffin to make room for the rookie, and he responded by handling the job capably all season. 4Carney Lansford(3b, .279, 7, 57) Early in June, he was hitting .402, but his average dropped more precipitously than the stock market a year ago. Outfielders(Pos, avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 33Jose Canseco(rf, .307, 42, 124) First player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases. Led the league in r.b.i. and home runs. 42Dave Henderson(cf, .304, 24, 94) With fourth team in the past three years, he responded with the best season of his career. 2Tony Phillips(lf, .203, 2, 17) He has played three infield positions as well as platooning in left field, but has hit poorly all season. Designated Hitters(Avg., h.r., r.b.i.) 39Dave Parker(.257, 12, 55) A torn thumb ligament undermined his contribution, forcing him to miss seven weeks in July and August. 12Don Baylor(.220, 7, 34) He is four victories away from playing in the World Series for the third successive season with three different teams. Starting Pitchers(Record, e.r.a.) 34Dave Stewart(21-12, 3.23) He is the only pitcher in the majors to have 20-victory seasons in 1987 and 1988. 35Bob Welch(17-9, 3.64) He established a career high for victories, but won only twice in last five weeks. 14Storm Davis(16-7, 3.70) A flop with San Diego last year, he regained the effectiveness that once earned him comparisons with Jim Palmer. 29Curt Young(11-8, 4.14) Only left-hander in starting rotation. He had arm trouble in July and August, but after his return, he gained six victories in seven decisions. Relief Pitchers(Record, e.r.a., saves) 43Dennis Eckersley(4-2, 2.35, 45) Becoming a reliever last season after 12 years as a starter, he has developed into the league's premier closer. 40Rick Honeycutt(3-2, 3.50, 7) Whatever else he does, he will be remembered for being caught in 1980 with a thumbtack taped to his finger. 54Todd Burns(8-2, 3.16, 1) A rookie, he became the fifth starter early in July, but is expected to be used in relief. 51Eric Plunk(7-2, 3.00, 5) He, too, has gone from starter to reliever. 19Gene Nelson(9-6, 3.06, 3) Has finally become a good long reliever and had his most effective performance this season. 32Greg Cadaret(5-2, 2.89, 3) A left-hander, he was the team's second-busiest reliever, appearing in only two fewer games than Eckersley. Reserves(Pos., avg, h.r., r.b.i.) 28Stan Javier(of/1b, .257, 2, 35) Son of the former major leaguer Julian Javier. He was successful on 20 of 21 stolen-base attempts. 22Luis Polonia(lf, .292, 2, 27) A switch-hitter. He is not talented defensively, although he has improved. Manager 10Tony LaRussa In his ninth season as a major league manager, his third with Oakland, he led his team to his best record ever (104-57).

Also, what kind of paint should I use, and is a special undercoat required? A.As long as you get most of the dust and dirt off, it does not matter what method is used to clean the siding. Scrubbing by hand with a detergent is usually adequate. Most good-quality exterior latex house paints are suitable for use on aluminum siding; just be sure you check the label before you buy. Most do not require a separate undercoat, but again you should read the directions on the label to make certain. Q. The previous owner of my house put plastic sheets on the inside of the windows during winter. They were held up with a double-stick tape, and now there is sticky glue as well as pieces of the tape left on the wood frames. We have tried bleach, alcohol and scraping, but nothing has worked. Other than stripping everything off with remover, what can we do? A. A solvent that usually works on sticky residue is rubber-cement thinner, sold in art-supply and stationery stores.

I felt when I took the heat off everybody by saying it was my mistake, I sure didn't want to be treated like a little kid and be suspended.'' The play occurred when Darryl Clack of Dallas lost Raul Allegre's opening kickoff in the sun and the ball bounced off his shoulder at the 2-yard line and into the end zone. When Clack was tackled by Mark Collins of the Giants while attempting to run the ball out of the end zone, the referee incorrectly ruled it a safety for the Giants, who won by that 2-point margin, 12-10. Since it was a muff and not a fumble, the officials should have called a touchback which would have given Dallas possession at its 20. At halftime, Terzian admitted that he as replay judge he had erred in not ordering a review of the play.(AP)",1988-10-07T05:00:00+0000

His pen, a gold-capped Parker 51, was one of the midcentury's most popular models before it was discontinued in the 1960's. General Eisenhower used an early Parker 51 to sign documents marking the end of World War II. And these days, restored Parker 51's, priced from $145, are the fastest selling item at Penfriend, Mr. Woolf's well-stocked shop in the Bush House Arcade on the Strand in London. ''Handwriting is one of the few crafts we can all use to express ourselves all of our lives,'' he said, signing his name with a flourish. ''And the Parker 51 was a wonderful pen.'' Fountain pens are enjoying new popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, burnished by nostalgia, renewed appreciation of their appearance and what one fan terms a reaction against the computerized world. Most of the surviving fountain pen makers, including Parker, Sheaffer and Waterman, have brought out stylish remakes of their earlier models; Mont Blanc never stopped producing its thick black Masterpiece of the 1920's.

Higgins's ''Wonderful Years, Wonderful Years'' is the latest in his chronicles of low, middle and upscale criminal life in and around Boston. Let it be said straight away that he has one of the best ears for the spoken word of any writer of fiction since Ring Lardner. This permits him to bring off a very difficult task: he advances his plot action and character development almost entirely through dialogue. In the hands of anyone less skilled, this verbal volleyball of direct and indirect quotations would likely be a disaster. A former Federal prosecutor, Mr. Higgins knows the intricacies of law enforcement and the gray world inhabited by business people who operate on the thinnest of ethical and legal ice. This very readable, often hilarious book concerns a public-works contractor, his loopy wife, his chauffeur and the chauffeur's present and former girlfriends, a whole fog bank of lawyers, both pleasant and nasty, and assorted minor characters. The plot is complex, and at its core are a couple of politically ambitious Federal prosecutors who are eager to further their careers by hanging the contractor out to dry, preferably in some dark lockup. Mr. Higgins's expertise does not stop with law enforcement. He also has a convincing knowledge of mental illness and, wonder of wonders, manages in an essentially comic novel to introduce with empathy and understanding the terror of the threat of AIDS as it suddenly descends on some unsuspecting individuals.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE TELLING OF LIES. By Timothy Findley. (Delta, Paper, $7.95.) As he demonstrated some 20 years ago in ''The Last of the Crazy People,'' the Canadian novelist Timothy Findley is an expert at using a crime story as the nucleus of a serious book. In ''The Telling of Lies,'' the initial crime involves the murder of an odious pharmaceutical magnate. The novel's atmospheric setting is an old hotel on the coast of Maine, an establishment that is soon to be turned into a hideous condo development. Mr. Findley's vividly drawn narrator, an elderly hotel resident named Vanessa Van Horne, finds herself becoming a reluctant detective as she confronts an ominous conspiracy. Her only weapons are her aristocratic manners and her expertise, learned in a World War II Japanese prison camp, in ''the subversive uses of charm.'' This is very much a novel of charm and manners, if of a rather chilly sort. It is also a full-fledged thriller, replete with mad doctors, sinister C.I.A. operatives and spectacular brainwashing techniques. Mr. Findley's delicate balancing act is reinforced by the perceptions of his heroine, who, as a landscape architect, sees all manner of intricate symmetries in her story; for example, her experiences in prison, presented in harrowing flashbacks, anticipate her confrontation with her own Government and its collective ''layers of lying.'' For both conventional mystery fans and seekers after unconventional storytelling, this novel offers tart and original pleasures.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Nicholas Pileggi, the author of ''Wiseguy,'' says in an introduction that Mr. Dietl ''tells us more about our impotence in fighting crime than all the doctoral theses being studied by desk-bound cops.'' Mr. Dietl's shield has some tarnished edges, however. He admits to drinking on duty, brawling off duty, accepting graft, feuding with civil rights activists and maintaining ties with Mafia bosses. He made arrests without probable cause. To flush out a murder suspect, he threatened to burn down a house and kill all its occupants. Mr. Dietl's 62 medals and commendations were matched by repeated charges of insubordination and brutality. The department stalled on promoting him to detective, exiled him to Brooklyn and, finally, processed his resignation in record time.

In Russell Mokhiber's compelling chronicle of corporate negligence, the criminals are white-collar executives and the victims are the rest of us. Mr. Mokhiber, the editor of the Washington-based newsletter Corporate Crime Reporter, points out that the largest robbery in United States history totaled $5.4 million, whereas the far larger cost to the American public resulting from the manufacture of faulty goods, monopolistic practices and a host of other corporate law violations has been estimated by a Senate subcommittee to be between $174 billion and $231 billion annually. Yet few corporate executives have had to face tough penalties for such abuses as the marketing of the fatally flawed Ford Pinto or the shirking of responsibility for the environmental disaster at the Love Canal, the onetime waste dump for Hooker Chemical. These and other case histories make ''Corporate Crime and Violence'' grimly urgent reading, as one company after another is shown to have valued short-term economic profits far above human lives, community safety or the long-term health of the environment. A passionate if sometimes strident advocate of legal reform, Mr. Mokhiber outlines a 50-point ''law-and-order program to curb corporate crime'' and calls for a grass-roots alliance of victims of corporate crime to challenge ''an inequitable justice system that consistently treats street thuggery as a criminal activity and corporate thuggery as business as usual.''",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

She called an ambulance, and 30 minutes later he was in the emergency room of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. His blood pressure was dropping and his electrocardiogram warned that a major heart attack was almost certainly developing. Normally, if he was lucky enough to survive it, a special coronary care team would have to watch over his life for days to keep him from slipping over the edge. Even if they succeeded, his heart might well be severely and permanently damaged. That was the expectation, but for this patient there was a crucial difference. Within five minutes of his arrival at the hospital, doctors had inserted a tube in a vein in his arm and begun infusion of a drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or t-PA. Thirty minutes after the infusion began, the man's pain disappeared completely. And tests later indicated that the attack had been halted -with little heart damage.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"ALICE IN LA-LA LAND, by Robert Campbell. (Pocket Books, $3.95.) Since Raymond Chandler wrote about the underside of Los Angeles, parts of the city have become even sleazier, and Robert Campbell has seized upon the worst of them for this sequel to ''In La-La Land We Trust.'' Last year, The Times's John Gross said this story about a loathsome talk show host with a psychopathic streak seemed excessively brutal. But ''Mr. Campbell confirms that he is a master of the hard-boiled Chandleresque manner.'' A SOUTHERN FAMILY, by Gail Godwin. (Avon, $4.95.) The night before he dies violently, Theo Quick tells his sister Clare that he wishes he were a character in one of her novels - unlike in life, tragedy in literature remains under some rational authorial control. ''After reading a Godwin novel,'' Beverly Lowry said in these pages last year, ''you find yourself going to the library to check out the book one of her characters has been reading, you ask the record store for her music, you cook her food. And so the experience continues, like good music, well beyond the last page. . . . Her books all give evidence of a supple intelligence working on the page. In this one she's in full bloom and at her mindful best.'' MOTHERS IN THE FATHERLAND: Women, the Family, and Nazi Politics, by Claudia Koonz. (St. Martin's, $14.95.) Convinced of the need to nurture German souls for the seeds of Nazism, women played a disturbingly important role in the rise of the Third Reich, Claudia Koonz argues. ''She has written a book of great historical and moral importance,'' Robert Jay Lifton said here earlier this year. ''It invites further probing of an extremely difficult issue - that of gender responses to situations of potential and actual evil.'' Basic Books has republished THE ITALIANS AND THE HOLOCAUST: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival by Susan Zuccotti ($9.95). Unlike in Germany and other countries, 85 percent of Italy's Jews survived World War II. ''A book on this subject had been long overdue, and Susan Zuccotti has risen to it with erudition and compassion,'' Raleigh Trevelyan wrote here last year. WITH OR WITHOUT: And Other Stories, by Charles Dickinson. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) The men in these stories live detached, circumscribed lives in small towns. ''They arouse our empathy,'' Richard Perry said here last year. ''We move among them as among a room of accident victims, wondering if any will recover, and who or what is responsible.'' INWARD BOUND: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World, by Abraham Pais. (Oxford University, $17.95.) Written by the author of ''Subtle Is the Lord,'' a biography of Einstein, this history of particle physics is ''illuminated by [ Abraham ] Pais's felicitous style,'' one reviewer said in 1986. He ''writes with lucidity and avoids frills but also shows an acute aesthetic sense and a fine sense of humor.'' TIME WITH CHILDREN, by Elizabeth Tallent. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) Matrimony sounds like a fine idea to the characters in Elizabeth Tallent's short stories. Once bound, however, they find they are, at heart, emotional kleptomaniacs, stealing affection wherever they can. Last year, The Times's Michiko Kakutani called this ''a finely crafted volume that reattests to her poise and eloquence as a writer.'' THE MAKING OF ''THE AFRICAN QUEEN'': Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind, by Katharine Hepburn. (Plume/ New American Library, $8.95.) Katharine Hepburn's memoir of life in the jungle ''is as spirited, appealing and shrewdly elusive as its author,'' Caryn James said here in 1987. ''This is the Hepburn we know: the woman who leaves 'Betty Bogart' behind to fix the crew's lunch while she tracks elephants.'' The same publisher has also reprinted the memoirs of Lee Strasberg, who was artistic director of the Actors Studio. Last year, our reviewer, Stephen Aaron, said A DREAM OF PASSION: The Development of the Method ($8.95), edited by Evangeline Morphos and published posthumously, describes ''in clear language devoid of jargon'' an acting technique that has been criticized as solipsistic and emotional, yet has produced performers of the caliber and appeal of Al Pacino and Joanne Woodward. THE MIND AND BODY SHOP, by Frank Parkin. (Laurel/Dell, $4.95.) A philosophy professor at a troubled British university, where a corporate flag flies above the library and coin-operated turnstiles have been installed in the lecture halls, seizes upon a plan to use sex to sell students on the pleasures of the mind. In 1987, our reviewer, Elizabeth Hawes, complained that the novel was too chipper. But she said Frank Parkin's ''eye and tongue are sharp, and his every sentence supplies a striking distortion, or projection, of reality.'' ACCIDENTAL MILLIONAIRE: The Rise and Fall of Steve Jobs at Apple Computer, by Lee Butcher. (Paragon, $9.95.) Steven Jobs, the countercultural folk hero who is a co-founder of Apple Computer, is little more than an image crafted by Regis McKenna, a Bay Area publicist who helped create the Silicon Valley legend, according to Lee Butcher. He has written ''a crisp, provocative book,'' John Taylor said here last year. ''It reduces Mr. Jobs to human proportions and makes him infinitely more interesting, if much less likable.'' AGENTS OF INNOCENCE, by David Ignatius. (Avon, $4.50.) In this novel of espionage in the Middle East, a C.I.A. agent is cast as a sensitive, principled, intellectual man. ''What emerges is a richly drawn psychological portrait,'' Jules Koslow said here last year. ''It is the skillfully drawn characters as much as the plot and subplot machinations that the reader will remember.''",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"MASQUERADE: A True Story of Seduction, Compulsion, and Murder. By Lowell Cauffiel. (Doubleday, $18.95.) W. Alan Canty, a psychologist, was a pillar of his community in suburban Detroit, quiet and circumspect in his dealings with patients, a loving husband and a devoted son. Then Dr. Canty turned up dead, his head crushed by blows from a Louisville Slugger, his body dismembered by a kitchen knife and the pieces scattered. His story is told in ''Masquerade,'' Lowell Cauffiel's excellent account of one man's flirtation with a twilight zone of his own making and the subsequent police investigation of his death. Dr. Canty led a double life, one that led him to liaisons with a young prostitute, Dawn Spens, in Detroit's grim Cass Corridor section. Dr. Canty quickly became Spens' regular customer, a genuine sugar daddy who gave her clothes, cars and other gifts until the money ran out. It ended on July 13, 1985, when he was murdered by her pimp, John (Lucky) Fry. Mr. Cauffiel, a former Detroit journalist, conveys a sense of a man's loss of control and helpless spiraling into disaster throughout his highly readable narrative. The book's characterizations and style are lucid and polished, he has obviously done the requisite research, and the bite-size chapters are almost cinematic in their movement. ''Masquerade'' names names, convincingly relating a factual tale of murder - and another, more speculative tale, one whose fabric is woven of the less distinct, unpredictable threads of the mind.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Moist oxygen puffed into the tracheostomy tube in his neck, and, whenever his lungs began to fill with fluid and choke him or a nurse turned him to prevent bedsores, his spastic legs and arms shot out straight.

us,FICTION,"A VOID IN HEARTS. By William G. Tapply. (Scribners, $16.95.) If you're a fan of Spenser's Boston beat and first-person narration, but your tolerance for catalogues of laps, reps, exquisite manly repasts and wardrobe details has flagged, give William G. Tapply's Brady Coyne a try. A Copley Square lawyer who, with refreshing misgivings, occasionally deserts trusts for freelance detection, Coyne is neither knight-errant nor cool professional. When a seedy private investigator is crushed by a hit-and-run driver, the ''accident'' adds up to murder. Coyne turns investigator, and throughout ''A Void in Hearts'' his wry account of his own fears, false confidence, confusion and bad guesses lends considerable charm to action that proceeds rapidly from modest initial incidents to dramatic and deadly confrontations. If the plot's surprises depend in part on their outlandishness, well, that's entertainment. Coyne sees himself as ''an anachronism, a country boy''; gazing through the window of his office, he reflects that ''many people find elevated views of cities at night beautiful. I'm a moon and stars man, myself.'' Romantic notions don't inform the state of Coyne's affections, however, or his ethical judgments. ''I loved it,'' he exults, when two icily amoral characters glide away unprosecuted from, at the very least, appropriating a suitcaseful of mob money. This seventh Brady Coyne mystery details the hero's equivocal relations with his ex-wife, Gloria, and throws in a casual affair. Skepticism is Coyne's strength, but uncommited ambivalence hollows him out. ''A Void in Hearts'' takes its title from a bridge term, but there's something important missing in Brady too.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

(In the New York metropolitan area it will be seen Thuraday night at 10 on Channel 31 and Saturday night at 9 on Channel 13.) The drama, which was adapted by Ken Taylor from a Terence Rattigan stage play, parts the parlor curtains on the 1935 murder of Francis Rattenbury, a respectable architect from the strait-laced seaside town of Bournemouth who was bludgeoned to death in his home by his chauffeur. This impressionable 18-year-old ''country lad'' had been having an affair with his 60-year-old employer's much younger wife, Alma, an affectionate and romantic creature who was made to stand trial with her lover, although no one, not even the prosecution for the Crown, seriously suspected her of having committed the crime for which she offered a clumsy confession.",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Identical twin brothers, Doug and Mike Starn were just 24 years old and completely unknown in New York. They lived, worked and exhibited in Boston, never a city from which to launch a modern or post-modern art career. Then, in the third week of the show, the art critic Gary Indiana published a brief notice about their work in the weekly events section of The Village Voice. It read: ''I hate to regress into review chat, but run, don't walk, don't miss it: it's brilliant.'' Indiana followed up a week later with a lengthy review that called the show ''a meticulously ordered, thorough-going assault on photographic conventions, thematically unified and visually thrilling.''",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

All the neighbors were Mexican, and they knew a million ways to get the richest flavors from the poorest foods. I learned early on that my mother's cookies could be swapped for pumpkin empanadas, and that her Spam sandwiches were better traded for spicy beef tamales. Happiness back then was a warm buttered tortilla from the back of the wood stove next door. Bliss was a spoonful of refried beans to roll up inside. Mobility, eastward, deprived me of some of the best food of my life. The farther I got from Arizona, the harder it was to get a good Mexican meal. Back before nachos went national, in fact, it was tough finding any edibles with a Mexican accent.

Four hundred friends and relatives gathered at a ''This Is Your Life, Anna'' party at Elim Evangelical Lutheran Church in Scandia, Minn., to celebrate her indomitable spirit and dedication to the community. Barely a week after this glorious event Anna learned she had ovarian cancer and would need major surgery. She was told that the surgery would be risky because of various medical problems, including high blood pressure, 80 or so extra pounds and a heart condition. Anny spent the week before the operation getting her affairs in order - lining up caretakers for her pets, checking on her will and bank accounts. She also had prescient conversations with close friends and relatives, telling them in different ways how much they meant to her and how much she had enjoyed her life. The day before she went into the hospital, she left a long note on the kitchen table about bills coming due, repairs needed on the house and where all of her important papers could be found. Anna was prepared to die. Her surgeon wavered between concern over her seemingly fatalistic attitude - he feared she might give up too easily - and admiration for her calmness. As she was being wheeled into surgery, she gave voice to her thoughts: ''I'm in God's hands.''",1988-10-09T05:00:00+0000

United States District Court Judge Alice M. Batchelder, citing a lack of jurisdiction, let stand a ruling that wrongly being branded a ''gopher ball'' pitcher generally is not a serious enough matter to sustain a libel lawsuit. Ditmar, who retired as a major leaguer in 1962 and became a recreation director in Brook Park, Ohio, sued the beer company and the advertising agency for misidentifying him for throwing a pitch delivered by a teammate, Ralph Terry. In the original broadcast, Chuck Thompson, the announcer, incorrectly said Mazeroski hit Ditmar's pitch, and the original broadcast was aired in the commercial. Ditmar said the commercial held him up to ''undeserved ridicule, humiliation and contempt.'' He said it might have cost him appearance money for playing in baseball old-timers' games and charity golf tournaments. But Judge Batchelder ruled that Ditmar failed to provide more than speculation that the commercial had caused him any financial harm. (AP)",1988-10-12T05:00:00+0000

McCallum, 25 years old, a graduate of the Naval Academy, was picked in the fourth round of the 1986 draft after setting the Division I-A collegiate all-purpose yardage record of 7,122.

The tentative settlement would dismiss the National Football League team's appeal of a judge's ruling ordering the 49ers to pay Krueger $2.36 million. ''We're disappointed, but if both sides are unhappy with the settlement then it's probably fair,'' said Krueger's lawyer, Clark Leslie. He confirmed general terms of the settlement reported yesterday by The Recorder, a legal newspaper. Krueger, now 48 years old, a mainstay of the 49ers' line from 1958 to 1973, ruptured a ligament in his left knee in 1963 and underwent surgery. A state appeals court ruled in February 1987 that the team never told him that a ligament was missing from his knee and failed to advise him of the risk he was running by playing in severe pain for the rest of his career.

Agents then pick up the money in cash and deposit it in a non-BCCI bank account in the desired city. Step 2: The agents, who are the depositors, ask the bank to wire the money to an account at BCCI in Tampa that had been set up for the operation. Step 3: The money is transferred by wire through a non-BCCI New York bank to BCCI headquarters in Luxembourg. Step 4: From there, the money is wired to BCCI in London, where it is placed in a certificate of deposit. Step 5: The certificate of deposit is used as the basis to generate a loan in the Bahamas to a phony corporation set up by the drug dealers. The money is wired from the phony corporation back into the undercover account in Tampa. Step 6: Money from Tampa is transferred by wire to the BCCI branch in Uruguay.

Slobodan Zivojinovic of Yugoslavia, who was seeded fifth, beat Broderick Dyke, 6-3, 7-6, and Shuzo Matsuoka of Japan stopped Mark Kratzmann, 6-1, 7-6.(AP) Hockey Blues 4, Maple Leafs 2: Consecutive third-period goals by Brett Hull and Gino Cavallini gave St. Louis the victory at Toronto last night. Greg Paslawski and Todd Ewen also scored for St. Louis. Derek Laxdal and Gary Leeman scored for Toronto. Toronto had a 36-22 shots advantage but the work of the Blues' goaltender Greg Millen kept the score close. Leeman tied the score 2-2 at 13 minutes 26 seconds of the third period. Leeman passed to Ed Olczyk 20 feet from Millen, then dashed to the net to take a return pass and tip the puck under the cross bar. Hull gave the Blues the lead again when he slapped a low drive past Wregget at 4:40. Some digging by Bullard set up Cavallini's goal at 9:05 of the third. Bullard lugged the puck around the Leaf net, finally dumping it out front where Cavallini, parked at the crease despite being manhandled by Curran and Darren Veitch, shoved it past Wregget.(AP) Nordiques 6, Canadiens 5: Walt Poddubny scored twice, including the game-winning goal midway through the second period, as Quebec won at Montreal. The Nordiques, who had lost six straight regular-season games to Montreal dating back to last season, also had goals by Gaetan Duchesne, Paul Gillis, Joe Sakic, the 19-year-old rookie, and Peter Stastny. The Canadiens were held to only two shots at the Quebec goaltender, Bob Mason, in the third period. Mason, making his first start against Montreal in a Nordiques uniform, made 27 saves. The Canadiens, who trailed, 4-1, at one point in the opening period, finally made it 4-4 on Smith's second goal, at 2:13 of the middle period. But Peter Stastny whipped in a cross-ice pass by his brother Anton on the power play about four minutes later to restore Quebec's lead. Then, in an embarrassing turn for the Montreal defensemen, Chris Chelios and Craig Ludwig, the Nordiques moved ahead, 6-4, at 11:44. The Nordiques were about to be called for icing but neither defenseman made a move to touch the puck. It was left for Duchesne, whose shot was stopped by the goaltender Brian Hayward, but Poddubny scored on the rebound. (AP) Blackhawks 10, Jets 1: Denis Savard tied a club mark with a pair of short-handed goals and added three assists and Rick Vaive scored his fifth career hat trick as the Blackhawks won in Chicago for their first victory of the season. After having allowed the most goals this season (17), the Blackhawks scored four first-period goals, including three in just 1 minute 42 seconds to gain their first victory after two losses and a tie. The Chicago goalie, Darren Pang, who was replaced last Saturday after allowing five goals, was named to start in goal when Jimmy Waite came down with the flu. Pang stopped 35 shots as Winnipeg misfired on 11 of 12 power play opportunities.(AP) Sabres 8, Penguins 5: Dave Andreychuk, playing in his first game of the season, scored three goals and assisted on two others for Buffalo. The Sabres, trailing, 2-0, after the first period, came back with five goals in the second period to take a commanding lead. Andreychuk had been sidelined with a knee injury from the preseason.

Let the solution dry on the surface, then rinse off with lots of water. When you repaint, use a paint that has extra mildewcide added, or add it yourself (many paint stores sell mildewcide or can order it for you).",1988-10-13T05:00:00+0000

The company said the adjusted results for the year-ago quarter assume the following fiscal 1988 events or transactions were completed as of June 30, 1987: the IMC Fertilizer initial public offering (IPO), payment of dividends from IMC Fertilizer prior to the IPO, redemption of the company's holdings of IMC Fertilizer preferred stock, and reduction of the company's common equity interest in IMC Fertilizer to approximately 38 percent; and further assume elimination of nonrecurring items and earnings from Mallinckrodt's operations divested in 1988, utilization of the cash proceeds from these transactions for debt repayment and short-term investments; and elimination of the net credit to earnings from an extraordinary item. The company also said IMC Fertilizer Group Inc. (IFL) results were consolidated through Jan. 31, 1988.

The sale of these additional shares reduced IMC's common stock ownership in IFL to approximately 38 percent.

Page 1 Mikhail Gorbachev may not succeed in his efforts to transform the Soviet economy because ''the downward spiral of the Soviet economy'' has not slowed, said Robert M. Gates, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. 1 The President of South Korea, Roh Tae Woo, said he would ask the United Nations and its member countries to help bring about a reconciliation with North Korea. 1 The United States can join a treaty outlawing genocide now that the Senate approved a change in American laws. The proposal had been blocked by a battle over whether to mandate capital punishment for genocide. 2 A former pro-Nazi officer fled secretly to West Germany, apparently with false documents, Government investigators said. He is Boleslav Maikovskis, an 84-year-old retired carpenter from Mineola, L.I. 4 Name-calling by Yugoslav leaders included an incident in which the President of the Republic of Slovenia, called the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, a Stalinist. 4 The Chilean opposition is to unite behind a single presidential candidate, avoiding a split between the Christian Democrats and the Socialists, a 16-party coalition announced. 3 Tories may continue to rule Britain well into the next decade, and some have begun seeking a successor to Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile, the Labor Party remains in disarray. 3 Cuba, Angola deny there is yet a firm troop pullout schedule 32 National 6-9 Officials knew of radioactive leaks at an Ohio nuclear weapon plant for decades but decided not to spend the money to correct the problems, a Congressional committee said. 1 Producer prices rose moderately in September, by four-tenths of 1 percent, representing a 5 percent annual inflation rate, the Labor Department said. A big drop in energy costs offset higher food prices. 1 Purchase of 11 savings institutions with an estimated $1.3 billion in aid over 10 years from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation was agreed to by a Texas cable entrepreneur, Don A. Adam. 1 The Senate passed a drug bill that emphasizes education and rehabilitation, It includes civil penalties for possession of small amounts of drugs and the death penalty for drug traffickers who commit murder. 6 Lyndon LaRouche was charged, along with six of his associates, in a Federal conspiracy and mail fraud indictment that accused them of borrowing more than $30 million that Mr. LaRouche apparently did not intend to repay. 6 Violence on Chicago's subways has created a public outcry, and the interventions of bystanders have raised questions about how much citizens should do to prevent a crime. 6 Attracting small investors back to Wall Street a year after the stock market plunged more than 500 points is the aim of a marketing blitz by the brokerage industry. 41 California house become aliens' prison 9 Politics 8-9 Democrats conceded that the debate Thursday between the Presidential candidates did not go well for Michael Dukakis. They said that his performance fell short of what was needed to overtake George Bush. 1 George Bush battled over-confidence as he pledged to run hard over the remaining three weeks and as aides publicly predicted a close race. But hiding glee over Thursday's debate was tough. 8 Michael Dukakis began new assaults on George Bush, saying Thursday's debate was ''strike three'' against the Republicans. His aides denied that he had lost a critical opportunity in the debate. 9 The networks said George Bush won Thursday's debate, though they had avoided picking a winner in the two previous debates. The cause, they say, was instant polls and a sense that Mr. Bush was an obvious victor. 8 Richard Nixon predicted that George Bush would win in a landslide unless he became overconfident or there was a change in Michael Dukakis's ''pathetically amateurish campaign.'' 8 Ex-Jackson group to pay civil claims 9 Debate fails to stir union workers in Texas 9 Regional 33-36 An elderly woman must be kept alive through artificial feeding, New York's highest court ruled, even though she has suffered debilitating strokes and her daughters insist that she would prefer to die. 1 Courts have long recognized right to self-determination 36 Thousands on welfare found jobs through a new program in New Jersey that requires able-bodied recipients to seek work, training or education in return for medical benefits, child care and transportation. 33 Testimony in the Myerson trial was provided by Sukhreet Gabel, who described confronting her parents after learning that her mother was the judge handling the divorce case of Bess Myerson's companion. 33 An inquiry into Metro-North's police by the state has merged with a separate investigation by the railroad's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transporation Authority, law-enforcement officials said. 35 The Taxi and Limousine Commission of New York City will likely get Jack Lusk, Mayor Koch's transportation adviser, as its new chairman.

us,WHAT THEY'RE WEARING - BLACK,"No matter how vociferously designers, stores and the press promote color for evening, good old black remains a big favorite. Certainly one gala evening last month provided ample evidence. Manhattan's National Academy of Design was awash with women in beautiful black dresses at the preview dinner for the Geoffrey Beene ''First 25 Years'' exhibition. Not unexpectedly, most of these gowns were Geoffrey Beene designs, many from his latest collection. But a surprising number of women turned up in Beenes of seasons past. It is a tribute to the designer's extraordinary ingenuity that none of the older ones looked in any way dated. But perhaps a smidgeon of credit could also go to the fact that most of them were shaped of black fabrics. For one thing, black is always in style. Also, black is a superb medium for spelling out a designer's original techniques of draping, shaping or tucking. And Geoffrey Beene is no slouch at all that. Black is also a shameless flatterer of almost every skin tone. It is a becoming frame for all gradations, from palest cream to deepest ebony. And black is an artful foil for accessories, especially pearls, diamonds or blazing gold. WHAT THEY'RE SAYING",1988-10-16T05:00:00+0000

As he did in his 1985 volume, ''The Unpublished Opinions of the Warren Court,'' Bernard Schwartz, Webb Professor of Law at New York University, examines the process that led to 10 of the most important decisions of the Warren E. Burger era on the Supreme Court. He embroiders drafts of the decisions with finely detailed commentary on the conferences, the assignment of opinions and the zigzags of consensus. Like most of what is written about the Court's inner workings, ''The Unpublished Opinions of the Burger Court'' has a fascinated tone and scrutinizes incidents of judicial deal-making that may or may not be significant. At the same time, it explains, uncondescendingly, why the politicking matters. For example, Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision striking down most state restrictions on abortion, would have evaded the core constitutional issue - the right to privacy - had the Court adopted Justice Harry A. Blackmun's initial, narrowly drawn opinion; instead, the Court identified a right to abortion that has changed both social attitudes and constitutional jurisprudence. The assertion of personal rights preoccupied the Court in its 17 years under Mr. Burger from 1969 to 1986, and is a principal theme for Mr. Schwartz.

His writing is popular in Arabic-speaking countries, although he was blacklisted for a time by many Arab countries because of his support for the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.

Words like ''solids'' and ''voids,'' ''volumes'' and ''planes'' invariably crop up in her descriptions. Not surprising, then, that geometric shapes can be found in most of her rooms. Take the master bedroom of her Long Island country house. The 18th-century Spanish bed features a round headboard with a painting of a madonna and child in a pastoral setting. A table in one corner displays some painted paper geometric solids, as well as a watercolor with a circular motif. Playing against the circles is a prominent triangle - an off-center pediment of a house-within-a-house, built to enclose a bathroom and closet. For Gomez, ''inspiring designs are those which create tension through contrasting forms and shapes, colors and materials.''",1988-10-16T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THIS FAR AND NO MORE: A True Story, by Andrew H. Malcolm. (Signet/New American Library, $4.50.) With Lou Gehrig's disease crippling her muscle by muscle, Emily Bauer decided to exercise her right to die. ''The reader, unabashedly voyeuristic, absorbs detail after detail about the torture of an intelligent mind entrapped in a useless body,'' Gloria Hochman said here in 1987. ''Anger, love, rage, resentment, guilt, fear stalk every page.'' BELOVED, by Toni Morrison. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) In her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Toni Morrison tells the story of Sethe, a young black woman who finds that after emancipation she is still enslaved by memories of an earlier time - and of a daughter, called Beloved, and her haunting death. ''Ms. Morrison's versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds,'' Margaret Atwood said in The Book Review last year. ''We experience American slavery as it was lived by those who were its objects of exchange.'' AN ADULTERY, by Alexander Theroux. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) When Christian Ford embarks on an affair with a lost soul named Farol Colorado, he sets off a chain of betrayals that, in the end, leaves him among its victims. Last year, our reviewer, Ron Hansen, called the novel ''a bitter, brooding, Jacobean tragedy of being used and getting even. . . . An odd and hypnotic pleasure to read, [ it is ] a book you dislike and can't do without.'' REBECCA WEST: A Life, by Victoria Glendinning. (Fawcett Columbine/Ballantine, $10.95.) This biography of the novelist and journalist Rebecca West shies away from evaluating her as a writer, John Gross said in The Times last year. But the account of her long liason with H. G. Wells and the feud with their son, Anthony West, ''is consistently readable. Her wit is unforced, her narrative glides along easily and compellingly.'' THE PLAYMAKER, by Thomas Keneally. (Perennial/ Harper & Row, $8.95.) A naval officer determined to bring a bit of Covent Garden to the British penal colony in Australia puts on a play, struggling to draw art and drama from his all-convict cast. Last year, our reviewer, James Atlas, complained that the novel is chaotic and formulaic, but he said its ''depiction of the bleak Australian landscape . . . has a hallucinatory vividness. . . . One of [ Thomas ] Keneally's great gifts is an ability to imagine the lives of the marginal, the forgotten.'' THE MAYOR OF CASTRO STREET: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, by Randy Shilts. (St. Martin's, $10.95.) Half a decade before the publication of ''And the Band Played On,'' Randy Shilts's detailed account of the AIDS plague, he chronicled the history of San Francisco's gay Castro community and its most visible political leader, Harvey B. Milk, the city supervisor who was murdered in 1978. In 1982, one reviewer said the book not only succeeds as history and biography but also as ''an investigative piece on the mechanics of big-city government in all of its expedient, back-biting splendor. Shilts pulls off this threefold stunt admirably.'' SENT FOR YOU YESTERDAY, by John Edgar Wideman. (Vintage, $6.95.) The novelist John Edgar Wideman has made the Homewood district of Pittsburgh as memorable a spot in the literary atlas as Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, or William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Alan Cheuse said here in 1983. '' [ He ] returns to the ghetto where he was raised and transforms it into a magical location infused with poetry and pathos.'' Vintage is also republishing the other two books in the Homewood trilogy: DAMBALLAH and, in November, HIDING PLACE (each $6.95). THE CREATION OF MATTER: The Universe From Beginning to End, by Harald Fritzsch. (Basic, $9.95.) In 1984 our reviewer, Timothy Ferris, said the high point of this account of the big bang, translated from the German by Jean Steinberg, contains ''one of the clearest explanations of the equivalence of matter and energy I've encountered.'' UTAH, by Toby Olson. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) In search of his lost wife, Lorca, a New York masseur known for his erotic touch is drawn to the nether world of Utah. Writing here in 1987, Charles Johnson praised Toby Olson's ''ability to conjure gorgeous prose passages that celebrate the healing powers of friendship, the pleasures of love and lovemaking, and the inborn mystery and beauty of things in this world.'' BAILOUT: An Insider's Account of Bank Failures and Rescues, by Irvine H. Sprague. (Basic, $9.95.) Written by a former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, this account of the troubled banking system, Michael M. Thomas said here in 1986, is ''an unglossed, authentic inside account.'' Though dry at times, ''the facts he adduces are staggering.'' CIGARETTES, by Harry Mathews. (Collier/Macmillan, $8.95.) Harry Mathews's literary jigsaw about promiscuous art lovers in Greenwich Village ''provides enough plot for a season of mini-series,'' Lisa Zeidner said in The Book Review last year. But in the ''subtly experimental novel, the plot is used as bait to lure us into confronting love's darker side.'' DOMESTIC AFFAIRS: Enduring the Pleasures of Motherhood and Family Life, by Joyce Maynard. (McGraw-Hill, $7.95.) A former New York Times journalist, Joyce Maynard has chosen to cover her own experience raising children. Last year Frances Wells Burck said here that in the collection's best pieces, the author's musings build ''into a complex and subtle metaphor for how we learn to mother.''",1988-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Amnon Jackont's compelling first novel is a hybrid, a thriller inhabited by people and ideas that are supposed to be taken seriously. This is a perilous task for a writer: the plot must move with the narrative overdrive of high adventure, but the people threaten to slow the action as the author develops their ideas, strengths and flaws. If the balance isn't right, the book can be a bore. Mr. Jackont, an Israeli businessman who lives and writes in Tel Aviv, deals with an essential question: is Israel worth the pain, for Jews, that is necessary to keep it alive as a nation? The story, as smoothly translated from the Hebrew by Dorothea Shefer-Vanson, is told alternately by several of the main characters. Chief among these is Shemesh, a failure of a schoolteacher, sent to Iran by Israeli intelligence to find his old friend Arik, who has disappeared in Teheran in 1980 during the early days of the revolution, after the Shah has been ousted. Another narrator is Katherine, a Palestinian Arab woman who loves Arik and wants to bear his child, against the wishes of her sister, Nadia, a vengeful guerrilla organizer. Despite some troubling contrivances, the action moves along with suspense. And the debate on Israel is provocative. Arik, for example, is likened to Flavius, a Jewish general who refused to fight the Romans. (''He believed that life was more important than any kind of faith. Better a live dog than a dead lion.'') On the other hand, although it raises interesting issues, Katherine's anti-Zionist talk can often be shrill. Arik fights his impulse to remain faithful to Israel, but the struggle leaves him bitter: ''No oil, no friends,'' he remarks of his country, ''hated on the outside, breaking up from inside. All that's left of the things that kept us going in the past is cheek and luck!'' There is tension as the novel approaches a philosophically tenable, if not satisfying, ending. But no villain is crushed, no hero is victorious, and that seems to make it a truer story.",1988-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Neil Postman is that rare social critic whose commentary on the current state of American culture and education is as funny as it is thoughtful and well argued. In these 18 incisive essays (some of them previously published), as in his earlier book ''Teaching as a Subversive Activity,'' Mr. Postman is concerned with the decline of the written word, the failure of our educators to teach critical thinking and the threat that the proliferation of visual media - in particular television - poses to our cognitive habits, political discourse and even to our concepts of childhood. None of these ideas are particularly groundbreaking. Yet to Mr. Postman's credit, he is able to bring new urgency and insight into what would otherwise be familiar turf. Much of this is due to the entertaining and inventive forms his arguments take. To illustrate his observations about the persuasive power of television commercials, he compares an advertisement warning against ''ring around the collar'' to a religious parable. Both, he wryly suggests, put forward a vision of sin, redemption and heaven. Even when discussing those issues about which he feels most deeply, Mr. Postman maintains his genial style and sense of humor. In the mock graduation speech that closes ''Conscientious Objections,'' he divides the people of our time into two camps: those who seek only wealth and power and those who aspire to reason, literacy, civic responsibility and creativity - all qualities he himself achieves in this provocative collection.",1988-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Woolf said the new deal would make the 6-foot-9-inch forward one of the five highest-paid players in the league. Bird reportedly will receive $8.4 million for the 1990 and 1991 seasons. Woolf said the extension is ''well in excess of $4 million'' for each of the final two years of the contract. Bird had set a deadline for Nov. 4, when the Celtics open their regular season, for conclusion of negotiations.

us,Q&A,"Q. Our house has a septic tank for sewage disposal, and every time there is heavy rain we get a sewage odor in one of the bathrooms. There is no such problem with the bathroom at the other end of the house, and all appliances flush and drain properly. The problem disappears within an hour or two after the rain stops; there is no sign of a leak under the house or in the ground near the septic tank. What could be causing this? A. The problem may be in the vent stack or pipe that services the toilet. This vent goes up through the roof and is supposed to let sewer gases escape. The vent may be partly blocked, so that in a heavy rain, water accumulates inside and traps odors. (The other toilet would have a separate vent, so it is not affected.) After a few hours the water probably drains away and the odors dissipate. Cleaning the vent pipe might solve the problem. Q. The paint on the outside of my house is peeling and flaking. I have taken samples to dealers, who say the original primer has broken down and is no longer bonding. They say the only remedy is to remove all the old paint down to the bare wood. The house was repainted about two years ago, and where the paint was applied to bare wood it seems to be adhering. The painter at that time said he had used a self-priming paint. Should this paint also be stripped? A. When you remove the old paint, whether by sanding or with a chemical remover, remove all of it. After the wood is stripped, apply a good-grade primer as a first coat. No house paint should be used on bare wood without priming first. Q. Last winter we moved into an eight-year-old house that was heated by a wood stove in the cellar. This past summer some of the floors and several of the stairs leading from the cellar started creaking when walked upon. We invested in a dehumidifier, but this has not helped. What do you think causes this? A. It is possible that the heat from the wood stove dried out and shrunk or warped some of the floorboards or the supporting beams and joists. If so, a dehumidifier would not help. If the creaking persists, you will have to find the loose floorboards and fasten them securely with nails or screws.",1988-10-20T05:00:00+0000

In just three relatively small galleries and one barn of a space, and with only 30 works, it sets out to argue both for the continuity and consistency of the work and for its ultimate resistance to systematic analysis. It suggests Mr. Judd's gift and ambition as a designer and argues for his ability to move between sculpture, architecture and furniture and influence all three. Its weight is less on the Judd who will probably always be considered the high priest of Minimalism than on work in which generalizations about him are challenged.",1988-10-21T05:00:00+0000

As far as Bradley (Keene Curtis) and his wife, Ann (Nancy Marchand), are concerned, modern plays contain too much screaming and disrobing to lure them to Manhattan from their home in upstate New York. But this couple can still remember a distant time when ''wonderful plays'' regularly visited their local Erlanger Theater. A wonderful play was one featuring an attractive, ''very sophisticated'' couple - invariably the Lunts - a ''minor indiscretion'' and a happy ending. A wonderful play gave the audience something ''to celebrate at the end of the day.''",1988-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Page 1 The Marcoses will surrender in New York by Oct. 31 and plead not guilty to the indictments against them, a lawyer for the couple said. 4 Officials defended the indictment of Mr. Marcos by arguing that the former friend of Washington had continued to violate American laws after he arrived in the United States. 4 Israel bombed southern Lebanon and the Bekaa region, the site of Palestinian and pro-Iranian guerrilla positions. The action came two days after a car-bomb attack killed Israeli soldiers on the Lebanese border. 1 The Afghan King's help was requsted by a United Nations official in forming a government of national reconciliation before the Soviets complete their military withdrawal. The King is in exile. 5 Soviet constitutional amendments to reorganize the nation's top governmental bodies were proposed by the Government. They would carry out most of the political changes sought by Mikhail Gorbachev. 3 The Mexican alliance forged from four political parties and dozens of political organizations by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the Presidenital election is having trouble saying together. 2 Japan agreed to end restrictions that limit foreign companies from establishing private, multimillion-dollar computer networks between Japan and other nations.

Economists said the increase posed little inflationary threat. 1 A regional surge in apparel costs helped push up consumer prices in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area in September by a sharp 1.4 percent, the Labor Department reported. Food prices and college tuition also rose. 35 Lawmakers have left Washington, eager to campaign and frustrated by a delay in adjournment. Two lone Senators and the House approved restrictions on lobbying by former executive branch members. 1 Social Security benefits will increase by 4 percent starting next January, raising the average retired worker's pension by $21 a month, the Government announced. 35 Two men were acquitted of arson after admitting in court to setting fire to a Detroit crack house. The case dramatized the frustrations of inner cities and tested the line between self-protection and vigilantism. 1 Sandra Day O'Connor had surgery for breast cancer. The cancer was in a ''very early form'' and the prognosis is for ''total recovery,'' a statement by Justice O'Connor said. 6 An attack on ''smokeless'' cigarettes was made by the U.S. Surgeon General, who called RJR Nabisco Inc.'s new product a ''drug-delivery system'' that should be regulated by the federal government. 28 A man who confessed to bombing a black church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963 fabricated the story, investigators said. 6 Maine potatoes may go fast food now that a major producer in the state, McCain Foods Ltd. of Canada, has been designated a french-fry supplier by the Burger King Corporation. A shift to Maine would bring major economic benefits. 33 Yellowstone fire damage less than thought 6 Politics 8-9 An election turnout at a 40-year low was predicted by several political analysts, despite simplified registration procedures and aggressive drives. 1 Michael Dukakis traveled to Harlem with polls showing his support among blacks weakening and as George Bush aims at New York for possible victory.

''And that's why I'm here.'' 8 George Bush backed a weapons ban for deadly chemicals, saying barriers against them ''must be repaired and raised even higher,'' and vowed to make nations that use such weapons ''pay a price.'' 9 State by State: In West Texas, Bush's message comes across 8 Reagan urges wide support for G.O.P. candidates 9 Regional 29-32 New York has two school systems, one in affluent areas and the other in poor areas, a state task force said. Racism ''clearly underlies much of the problem,'' it said. 1 Police Headquarters is in disrepair in New York City 15 years after it was opened as the nation's largest and most advanced.

Lucy Lerner, the American narrator of Linda Ashour's promising first novel, has moved to Provence, where she shares a renovated country house with her husband, a French photographer, and their young son. In ''Speaking in Tongues,'' Ms. Ashour comically exploits the clash of cultures in Lucy's life as she shuttles back and forth between France and the Bible Belt of Oklahoma, where her family still lives. Along the way, we meet a poet who is arrested for publicly posting an ode to body hair; a young Frenchwoman with a voracious, and possibly dangerous, appetite for American jeans; Lucy's son, Sam, who alarms his nursery school teacher with fantasies of himself as a fish; Lucy's mother, Agnes, whose evangelical leanings lead her on a pilgrimage to a born-again faith healer; Lucy's cousin, Ella, who sends her letters from the state mental hospital doused in vanilla extract; and Lucy's brother, Cody, who marries and then deserts Tulsa's former Tractor Queen. Ms. Ashour, who was born in Oklahoma and has lived in France, reveals the turmoil in Lucy's life in a comic novel that is often rich and lyrical. However, it begins to lose focus toward the end; while there's a final family reconciliation, we're never sure just why it is that Lucy has gone to such extremes to keep her two lives separate. Still, Ms. Ashour portrays her characters with depth and wry humor. This is an auspicious debut by a talented writer.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

If you worry that politicians are mucking about more and reporters are happily raking up more of that muck, ''Fall From Grace'' offers reassurance. Sex, hypocrisy and corruption have been common and chronicled since New York was a backwash of a British colony. Indeed, before there was Gary Hart, there was Lord Cornbury, the British governor-general of Manhattan who opened the New York assembly of 1702 dressed in drag in the style of Queen Anne. Before there was Imelda Marcos, there was Mary Todd Lincoln, who bought 300 pairs of kid gloves while Yankee soldiers were shivering without blankets. Before there was Paula Parkinson, the blond lobbyist who was less than popular with Washington wives, there was Peggy Eaton, the daughter of a Washington tavern owner and the wife of Andrew Jackson's secretary of war, whose low-cut dresses and vivacious ways caused such a furor among the wives of Administration officials that President Jackson had to dissolve his entire Cabinet to end the ''petticoat war.'' Would you ever have guessed that the feeble President who brought you the Teapot Dome Scandal, Warren G. Harding, was capable of this sort of prose to his mistress: ''There is one engulfing, enthralling rule of love, the song of your whole being which is a bit sweeter - Oh, Warren! Oh, Warren! - when your body quivers with divine paroxysms and your soul hovers for flight with mine.'' And, in a more prosaic style, there was the wonderful seduction line uttered by Lyndon Johnson in the middle of the night to a female aide staying in a guest room at the Texas ranch: ''Move over, this is your President.''",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

The title of Christopher Noel's first novel refers to his high-spirited heroine, 20-year-old Hazard MacIntyre, and her pronouncement of ''the five things that make life worth living.'' Hazard and Baker Samuels, formerly childhood playmates, now close friends and tentative lovers, inhabit a summery Vermont landscape where they're perpetually in flight from the pedestrian and prosaic. Baker, a starry-eyed innocent, witnesses and experiences miracles. Hazard expresses her exuberance mainly through ''quickmotion'' - the first of the Five Delights. Baker's muse and mentor, she inspires their adventures, including a playful jaunt that transports them into a tall pine tree. There, atop a branch 15 feet off the ground, they engage in tender lovemaking. But despite the coming-of-age theme and Baker's sexual initiation with Hazard, this novel often reads like a children's storybook. Baker, for example, assigns fanciful names to his escapades (''the Miracle of the Chestnut Pine Tree'') as well as to his haunts (''the Scoop-Out''). Two dogs, Everet and Nutmeg, and an assortment of other animals crowd the story and often guide the characters in their search for secret knowledge. In a childlike voice almost choked with hope and wonder, Mr. Noel's narration advances his fable and mirrors Baker's poetic sensibility: ''The sun was close to rising. There was a solid goldness filling Baker up. . . . His arms felt like they could lift anything, no, everything.'' There's a distinctive imagination at work in ''Hazard and the Five Delights,'' albeit one that is occasionally prodigal in its expression. Readers tolerant of Mr. Noel's penchant for whimsy will find a sweet wisdom and quirky charm in his storytelling.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,NUCLEAR ARMS PLANTS: Where the Chain Has Broken,"SAFETY problems permeate the far-flung plants that make atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and the fuel for warship reactors. All the sites are old; Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Hanford Reservation in Washington date to the early 1940's, the dawn of the nuclear age. For many years, their managers say, the Government provided little money for maintenance, let alone improvements. Now, even as it considers spending more than $170 billion to modernize the system and clean up tons of toxic wastes, the Department of Energy has decided that two plants pose so severe a threat to workers and people who live nearby that they must be closed. A third has been closed by the workers themselves, who are striking over pay and safety concerns. ROCKY FLATS: Energy Department halted processing Oct. 8 after three people were exposed to plutonium for lack of a warning sign . . . Built in 1952 . . . Has had dozens of fires, which sometimes spread plutonium-laden smoke over Denver area, yet inspectors found fire suppression measures ''antiquated'' . . . Leads Environmental Protection Agency list of Federally owned hazardous waste sites. FERNALD: Workers have been on strike two weeks . . . Built in 1951, 20 miles from Cincinnati . . . Report in April found ''pervasive'' management problems and worker exposure to radiation . . . For decades, tons of uranium and other radioactive wastes were stored in leaky pits and cracked tanks, contaminating area water supplies . . . Filters on ventilation stacks broke about once a month for years, allowing ''relatively large amounts'' of uranium dust to escape . . . Ohio residents sued contractor that used to run plant; Energy Department filed a motion saying that it was Federal officials, not the contractor, who repeatedly decided to let pollution continue. SAVANNAH RIVER: Energy Department forbade restarting reactors at South Carolina plant in August pending retraining of operators who pushed ahead with procedures even though the reactor was not responding according to plan, as long as the unexplained response was not considered dangerous . . . Metal reactor vessels show markings that might indicate cracks . . . Built in 1954, it has five reactors, two of them permanently disabled . . . Improperly buried wastes have contaminated groundwater . . . Scores of tanks hold highly radioactive liquids.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

Why can't guys bunt? Why can't pitchers hold runners at first? Obviously, some teaching still needs to be done. I doubt Tommy Lasorda or Whitey Herzog would sit cross legged while p.n.m.'s pile up.

As with the large display of paintings by Robert Ryman currently on view at the Dia Art Foundation on West 22 Street in Manhattan, the Pistoletto exhibition reflects an alternative space assuming the function of a conventional museum. A 30-year retrospective accompanied by a hefty catalogue, this show defines a new potential for P.S. 1 and also suggests how such a redefinition, however intermittent, could lighten the pressures on this city's overextended museums as far as contemporary art is concerned.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"ECONOMICS IN PERSPECTIVE: A Critical History, by John Kenneth Galbraith. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) Condemning those who treat economics as a Platonic system of mathematical abstraction, John Kenneth Galbraith demonstrates how power politics and ideology shape what is perhaps the most subjective of sciences. ''Like virtually all of his work, [ this book ] will amuse and instruct the general reader and give a pain in the neck to the professional economics establishment,'' Leonard Silk said in The Book Review last year. KRAZY KAT: A Novel in Five Panels, by Jay Cantor. (Collier/Macmillan, $7.95.) With her competitors Felix, Fritz and Garfield enjoying continued celebrity, Krazy Kat, created in 1910 by the cartoonist George Herriman, has lapsed into obscurity and a deep depression. But Ignatz, an intellectual mouse who is a disciple of Freud, is determined to cure Krazy, helping her come to terms with sex and death. Earlier this year, our reviewer, Thomas M. Disch, called Jay Cantor's novel ''sprightly, delightful and insightful. . . . As [ his ] comedy becomes bawdier and bolder . . . his cartoon characters become rounder, richer, more densely packed.'' THE MASK OF COMMAND, by John Keegan. (Penguin, $7.95.) To examine the changing style of military leadership, John Keegan profiles Alexander the Great, the Duke of Wellington, Ulysses S. Grant and Adolf Hitler. The result is a ''fascinating and enlightening'' book, John Gross said in The Times last year. It is ''marked by great intellectual liveliness.'' GET HOME FREE, by John Clellon Holmes. (Thunder's Mouth, $8.95.) When Dan and May, two New York bohemians, decide to break up, one heads north, the other south in their separate attempts to go home again. In 1964, our reviewer, Haskel Frankel, called the novel ''a neatly wrapped package of futility that [ is ] both depressing and impressive. . . . What is impressive is the author's ability to create so much life in so barren an atmosphere.'' The same publisher has reissued two more of the author's novels of the beat generation, each priced at $9.95. THE HORN, which is about Edgar Pool, a black saxophonist who finally meets his match, is ''the most successful novel of jazz that has ever been published,'' one reviewer said in 1958. When it was published in 1952, five years before Jack Kerouac's ''On the Road,'' Mr. Holmes's first novel, GO, was not especially well received, but it has come to be recognized as a classic of a genre, beat literature, that he did much to help create. CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE: The Secret Life of Anthony Blunt, by Barrie Penrose and Simon Freeman. (Vintage, $10.95.) When Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby defected to the Soviet Union from Britain, the spy they left behind was Anthony Blunt, who lived quietly for years as an art historian. Prime Minister Thatcher exposed him to a shocked nation in 1979. Last year, our reviewer, Stephen Koch, said this biography is ''a valuable book, to be read by anyone under the scandal's spell.'' FIRST LIGHT, by Charles Baxter. (Penguin, $6.95.) In a novel whose plot moves backward in time, Charles Baxter traces the lives of Hugh Welch, a car salesman, and his sister, Dorsey, an astrophysicist, showing how they became estranged. Writing in The Times, Michiko Kakutani called the book ''a remarkably supple novel that gleams with the smoky chiaroscuro of familial love recalled through time.'' ''GROWN-UPS'': A Generation in Search of Adulthood, by Cheryl Merser. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) Why is it, the author wonders, that so many of her fellow baby boomers feel like oversized children, forever awaiting the moment when they will magically become adults? ''There is something touching and sad in this depiction of a generation reared as one of the most pampered and prosperous in history still trying to grow up,'' Francine Klagsbrun said here last year.'' YEARS FROM NOW, by Gary Glickman. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) A Jewish family in New Jersey is confronted with the fact that a son, David, is homosexual and living in New York with his friend Beth, a lesbian. Gary Glickman's ''sense of the rhythms, the beauty, the absurdity, the poignancy of the family as it participates in its rituals is delightful and true,'' Robert Houston said in The Book Review in 1987. THE FUTURE 500: Creating Tomorrow's Organizations Today, by Craig R. Hickman and Michael A. Silva. (Plume/New American Library, $8.95.) In the coming decades, executives will have to search for more than excellence if they want their corporations to survive, the authors argue; they will need to learn new ways to manage overwhelming complexity. Last year, our reviewer, Elizabeth Bailey, said the book provides ''a valuable history of American business and management theory.'' PSYCHOTIC REACTIONS AND CARBURETOR DUNG, by Lester Bangs. Edited by Greil Marcus. (Vintage, $9.95.) This collection of essays by the rock critic Lester Bangs, who died six years ago, ''rescues from oblivion one of the most distinctive voices in modern popular criticism,'' Ken Tucker said here in 1987. ''He created a rude yet earnest persona in his writing, one that believed passionately in rock music as the most vital and innovative of the popular arts even as he decried its crassest excesses. Rather than simply babble on about this or that favorite rock group, Bangs attempted to place rock within a cultural framework, pointing out its similarities to everything from Dada to Jack Kerouac.''",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,REPORT FROM NEW YORK,"Forget about provocative new silhouettes, dramatic hemline shifts or startling colorations. This is not the moment. The spring 1989 American collections, beginning this week, make it clear that this country's fashion creators are concentrating on the cautious route. After a lackluster year of sales, no one is about to go out on any chancy limbs. As always, certain general trends are emerging. These include classic clothes with slightly softer lines for day and the use of fluid fabrics, such as chiffon, for evening. But in the main, designers are presenting clothing that enhances their already-established looks. As Bill Blass says: ''I'm paying no attention to 'outside' [ read European ] influences. I'm convinced you must stay with your own viewpoint.'' The trend toward staying on course does not imply that there will be a dearth of desirable clothes. By now, America has developed a healthy number of ''signatures'' that are instantly recognizable by fashion-knowledgeable shoppers. They are the women who can spot a Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Anne Klein, Geoffrey Beene, to name a few, before even getting off the escalator. Even in the area of late-day and evening clothes, where many designers' offerings blur, there is still that undefinable something that sends out a Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta or Scaasi signal.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

For a novel set in an isolated hunting lodge in the Appalachian Mountains, ''Private Woods'' is filled with homely, almost suburban details of meals served and dishes scrubbed. A strict division of labor applies, with the women preparing food and waiting on their menfolk, who exchange macho challenges when not tracking deer with bows and arrows. It is in this atmosphere, charged with both blood and cooking smells, that Sarah Lannom encounters a surprise guest - her first love, Sonny Woods. Seventeen years have passed since their last, tense meeting, following Sonny's return from Vietnam. Sarah has since become a successful artist and the devoted wife of a computer executive, while Sonny, still tortured by memories of the war, has married a woman raised in the country and earns his living by hiring out as a guide to city slickers. In her debut novel, Sandra Crockett Moore uses direct, unadorned prose to describe the rekindling of old emotions and the consequences of Sarah and Sonny's reunion. And Ms. Moore's spare style suits many of the traditional ideas that are expressed in the course of her narrative - that Sonny is the 1980's version of a natural man; that shooting animals with a bow is more sporting than using a gun. One of the wives even argues, in defense of the male urge to hunt, that ''killing is part of a man's nature, any man's.'' Not all readers will agree with these opinions, but many will be drawn in by Ms. Moore's narrative skills and by the conviction with which she tells her story.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

I can still remember the wetness of the gravel under my gym shoes in the school quad and how the blown leaves made the cloisters by the chapel slippery as I ran recklessly to escape from my enemies between one class and the next. I slithered and came to an abrupt halt while my pursuers went whistling away, because there in the middle of the quad stood our formidable headmaster talking to a tall man in a bowler hat, a rare sight already at that date, so that he looked a little like an actor in costume - an impression not so far wrong, for I never saw him in a bowler hat again. He carried a walking-stick over his shoulder at the slope like a soldier with a rifle. I had no idea who he might be, nor, of course, did I know how he had won me the previous night, or so he was to claim, in a backgammon game with my father.''",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

The city, in English hands and renamed New York, builds a City Hall at Wall and Nassau Streets. 1735. The first city almshouse opens in what is now City Hall Park. 1759. A three-story jail is built next to the almshouse. 1788. City Hall is refurbished and renamed Federal Hall for the use of the first Congress. (Two years later, it moved to Philadelphia.) 1811. Present City Hall is completed. 1828. Gas street lights illuminate Broadway. 1830's. First real sewers, made of brick, are installed in Manhattan. Some are still in use. 1832. The horse-drawn cars of the New York and Harlem Railroad, the city's first, begin carrying passengers. Steam engines are introduced two years later, but not below 14th Street; the city thought them too dangerous for heavily populated areas. The ban was later extended to 42d Street, thus dictating the site of Grand Central Terminal. 1842. Croton Aqueduct System, supplying water from Westchester County, is finished at a cost of $12.5 million. The work was prompted by a fire that destroyed more than 600 buildings because firefighters, some of whom had ferried their pumpers from Jersey City and Brooklyn, lacked water. 1843. First school built by the new Board of Education opens. 1856-63. Central Park is acquired and laid out. 1878. Elevated railways are built on Third and Sixth Avenues. 1880. Electric street lights are installed on Broadway between 14th and 26th Streets. 1883. Brooklyn Bridge is opened; the City of Brooklyn, then independent and a commercial rival of Manhattan, paid much of the $16 million bill. 1898. The first public high schools open. 1903. Williamsburg Bridge opens. 1904. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, with city help, builds an electric subway on the West Side, from City Hall to 145th Street. 1909.

Goethals Bridge and Outerbridge Crossing open; they link Staten Island and New Jersey. 1930. The West Side Highway opens. 1931. George Washington Bridge and Bayonne Bridge open. 1932. City-built subway, now the IND line, is completed. 1936. Triborough Bridge opens; construction starts on Queens-Midtown Tunnel, Sixth Avenue Subway and a project to draw water from the Delaware River, completed in 1955. 1937. Henry Hudson Parkway, part of East River Drive and Lincoln Tunnel's first two tubes open. 1939. Bronx-Whitestone Bridge opens. 1940's. City and private developers work more and more closely on housing projects like Stuyvesant Town. 1940. City buys the subway lines operated by the IRT and the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Company. 1941. Work starts on mammoth air terminal in Idlewild, Queens, later to be called Kennedy Airport. 1949. Brooklyn Battery Tunnel opens. 1954. Columbus Circle redevelopment, including construction of Coliseum, starts; it is one of a series of ''slum clearance'' projects. 1961. Throgs Neck Bridge opens; with the Clearview Expressway, it cost $125.5 million. 1963. Lincoln Center complex is begun. 1964. Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opens; it is the city's last. 1968. Construction of World Trade Center begins. 1970. Third Water Tunnel, from Bronx reservoir to Manhattan, is begun. It is still not in service. 1972-73. $774 million worth of contracts are assigned for sewage treatment plants. 1973. West Side Highway collapses. 1975-76. Fiscal crisis means drastic cuts in capital budget, except in transit. Already-committed Federal aid means that $460 million in contracts are let for expansion of the subway system, including the still-incomplete Second Avenue Subway. 1982. City begins $6.3 billion program to rehabilitate the subways; most of the financing comes from a state bond issue. 1985. After more than a decade of debate, city gives up on Westway, which was to have been a combination of redevelopment along the Hudson and a new road to replace the West Side Highway. 1986. Facing severe shortage of low- and middle-income housing, city announces $2.4 billion, 10-year plan to rehabilitate apartment buildings it owns.",1988-10-23T05:00:00+0000

The Palm is one of three courses used in the 72-hole tournament. Fuzzy Zoeller shot a 64, his best score this year, for second place. Zoeller, seeking his first victory since 1986, was eight-under-par at the Lake Buena Vista course, the shortest and easiest of the three layouts.

I recently learned that the roofing shingles on my 58-year-old house are made of asbestos and that roofers are reluctant to work on this type of roof because they are afraid of the toxic effects of asbestos. Is this true, and if so, what recourse do I have when roof repairs are needed? A. Your shingles are most likely made of asphalt, not asbestos. While some older asphalt shingles do have a small amount of asbestos in them, I doubt if this would be a cause for concern for any experienced roofer, particularly since roofing work is all done outdoors. Roofs like yours are constantly being repaired or replaced without posing any asbestos hazard. Q. During cold weather we have a lot of condensation on the inside of our windows, even though we have storm windows outside. This moisture is not between the window and the storm window. In very cold weather we even have ice on the inside. We turned off our furnace humidifier, as this only made it worse. Any idea what we can do to cure this problem? A. There is obviously too much humidity inside. Install exhaust fans in the bathrooms and in the kitchen and make sure that they are turned on when those rooms are in use. If you have lots of house plants, get rid of most of them, as they produce moisture. Also, check the fit of the outside storm windows.

G.M.'s gain is far more striking than it appears, because last year's figure was inflated by an accounting change. [ Page D1. ] Mcorp has a ''high probability'' of entering bankruptcy next month, its chief executive said. The remark is seen as a daring challenge to bank regulators. [ D1. ] Fears about bank lending for leveraged buyouts are overblown, banking experts said. Lenders have not only built recession assumptions into their loan decisions but also have avoided overconcentration by distributing their loans widely, they maintained. [ D1. ] Stocks of companies subject to takeover bids fell sharply on the day after the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, advised Congress to consider limits on the borrowing needed to complete corporate takeovers. [ D1. ] UAL and Delta Air Lines reported sharply higher earnings for the third quarter, mainly because of higher traffic and the higher fares that have been put into effect in the past year. [ D4. ] Dean Witter Reynolds is expected to announce large layoffs soon in its fixed-income department. [ D12. ] Salomon will join Shearson in making a bid for RJR Nabisco, RJR's chief executive said. [ D20. ] A $1.15 billion financing for Federated is being restructured, the Campeau Corporation and First Boston acknowledged. [ D20. ] Coniston Partners said it would begin an offer for TW Services, valuing the food-services operator at $1.4 billion. [ D4. ] Grand Metropolitan extended its offer for Pillsbury by a week, to Nov. 8. Pillsbury has rejected the $5.23 billion bid. [ D4. ] THE ECONOMY Personal incomes rose a moderate five-tenths of 1 percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest performance in almost a year, the Commerce Department said. The reports offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing. [ D2. ] INTERNATIONAL The Soviet Union has been running large budget deficits for years, the Soviet Finance Minister said, and he predicted that this year the deficit would amount to the official equivalent of $58 billion. He also said that the Government, eager to lure more Western investment, has agreed for the first time to let foreign companies own controlling interests in Soviet joint ventures. [ A1. ] MARKETS The Dow dropped 24.35 points, to close at 2,140.83, pulled down in part by takeover stocks that were sold off amid concerns about buyout financing. The selloff was broad. [ D6. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds posted strong gains in fairly light trading, as investors were hit with a barrage of developments that made Treasury issues appear more attractive.

us,Comics and a 50's Hop in the Wee Hours,"One of the last sounds to disappear in the wee hours of the morning on a New York weekend is the sound of laughter. Here is a list of some of the late-night comedy shows, and one post-show participatory event, that are scheduled this weekend. Political Jokes Randy Credico, Brett Butler and Noo Yawk Talk, Top of the Village Gate (160 Bleecker Street). ''Quayle will help the Republican ticket out in the South - Paraguay, Chile, South Africa, and Pakistan,'' remarks Randy Credico, one of New York's most outspoken political comics. With spiky, angry humor, Mr. Credico follows in the progressive-liberal-left footsteps of Lenny Bruce. A Dukakis supporter, he has journeyed to Nicaragua several times and raised money to aid Nicaraguan children. He will be master of ceremonies of a show featuring Brett Butler, who discusses current affairs, and the nine-member improvisational troupe Noo Yawk Talk. Shows will be at midnight tonight and tomorrow. Tickets are $8. Reservations: 982-9292. Computer Antics Bill Coronel and Patty Rosborough, Stand-Up New York (236 West 78th Street). A dedicated disciple of late 80's high-tech culture, Bill Coronel bills himself as ''the computer comic.'' A computer expert who publishes his own magazine, he knows as much as any young humorist about the funny ways in which machines are taking over the world. Patty Rosborough, a comedian who uses props, employs paraphernalia that sometimes turns against her. One of her most popular routines involves adhesive tape that comes strangely and dangerously to life as she winds it around her body. The weekend's one late show is tomorrow at 12:30 A.M. There is a $12 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Reservations: 595-0850. Urban Humor Rick Aviles, Caroline's at the Seaport, 89 South Street, at Pier 17 (233-9400). A former street performer, the raspy-voiced New York comedian Rick Aviles mines a rich vein of urban humor out of his experience of growing up Hispanic in New York. For the weekend's one late show, which starts promptly at midnight tomorrow, there is a $15 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Modern Angst Ray Romano, Linda Hill and Liz White, the Comedy Elite, 2 Bond Street (260-1213). A warm observational humorist, Ray Romano was voted best comedy newcomer in Atlantic City last year, and much of his humor deals with the intricacies of modern relationships. Linda Hill, who made her name in San Francisco before moving to New York recently, has a rag-doll face and the manner of an ingenuous Martha Raye or Carol Burnett as she dissects contemporary life and love. Liz White is a waittress and comedian. Show time is 12:30 A.M. this evening, and there is a $10 cover charge. Halloween Sock Hop ''The Taffetas - A Musical Journey Through the Fabulous 50's,'' Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street (989-2020). Patrons who attend tomorrow's 10 P.M. performance of this charming Off Broadway production wearing 50's period attire will be given a 25 percent discount off the regular ticket price and invited to a post-performance Halloween sock hop in the lobby. The party will be attended by the Taffetas, a fictional female quartet from Muncie, Ind., modeled after the Lennon Sisters, the McGuire Sisters and the Chordettes. Along with 50's music, there will be candied apples, cider and the dancing of the bunny hop. Pre-discount tickets are $32.50.",1988-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Dining Before Dawn: Bistro Fare and Pasta,"The city that never sleeps is also the city that never stops munching. Yet finding a good place to dine - not just to snack - after midnight takes some research. Most restaurant kitchens close between 11 and midnight. To my mind, nothing ruins a meal more than seeing waiters flip chairs onto tables and cleaning crews mopping up. Here are some suggestions for those times when midnight and hunger strike simultaneously. Brasserie This sprawling, utilitarian-looking spot in the Seagram Building is one of the few restaurants in the city open 24 hours. The food is not exceptional, but much of it is satisfying: the best options are the steak with french fries, the chicken paillard with herb butter (insist that they don't overcook it), soups and salads. A three-course meal runs anywhere from $20 and up. If you are in a rush, sit at the counter. (At 100 East 53d Street, 751-4840. Serves 24 hours daily.) Cafe Luxembourg A stylish and reliable spot, Cafe Luxembourg is the place to go in the Lincoln Center area. The scene around midnight is much more colorful than the early-evening crowd of straitlaced opera and symphonygoers. American bistro food is the specialty here, and you can rely on the roasted leg of lamb, grilled seafood and roast duck: daily specials are usually good, too. Pastas are risky. A three-course dinner runs between $35 and $45. (At 200 West 70th Street, 873-7411. Dinner served 5:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. weekdays, until 1:30 A.M. Friday and Saturday.) Carnegie Deli If you are the type who can sleep soundly after consuming a sandwich the size of a softball, head over to the Carnegie Deli for a pastrami or corned beef on rye, with sour pickles, of course. After midnight seems to be about the only time there are not lines outside this renowned New York institution. Sandwiches run about $8 to $9. Many of the waiters are gruff old-timers who may crack a smile if you manage to clean your plate, then ask, ''What's for dessert?'' (At 854 Seventh Avenue, at 55th Street, 757-2245. Serves from 6 A.M. to 4 A.M. daily.) Corner Bistro This is a good little spot to recuperate with a bowl of chili or a fat hamburger on the way home: and it's possible to eat for as little as $10, including a few beers. It is a cozy spot with high-backed wooden booths and a long mahogany bar where a neighborhood crowd hangs out. The brick-walled back room has a bohemian charm. I usually go for the fist-thick bistro burger, which is wrapped in bacon and topped with tomato and lettuce. It comes with a stack of terrific steak fries ($4.75). (At 331 West Fourth Street, 242-9502. Serves 11:30 A.M. to 4 A.M. daily except Sunday when service begins at noon.) Mezzogiorno This playful Italian trattoria is related to Mezzaluna, and the pastas and brick-oven pizzas are just as good. The setting, though, is considerably larger here, with a long marble-topped bar and cafe tables running along white-paned windows. The pizza oven cranks up at 10 P.M. Before that, you can get such well-made specialties as orecchiette with sausage and fennel; tagliolini with shrimp, arugula and tomato; gnocchi with shredded basil; homemade ravioli with changing fillings, and whole-wheat pasta with tomato (entrees are about $12 to $14).",1988-10-28T05:00:00+0000

He unabashedly informs us that the national economy has prospered almost miraculously under the Reagan-Bush Administration while Massachusetts has stagnated under Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. The truth is quite the opposite. Our economic future has been mortgaged over the last eight years to create a present that is much grimmer than George Bush allows.

With the discovery of superconductors - electrical conductors that could operate free of resistance at temperatures warm enough to make practical applications conceivable - the world of physics snapped to attention. Robert M. Hazen, a physicist who collaborated with another physicist, Paul Chu, explains both the methods and ramifications of obtaining superconductors in ''The Breakthrough.'' However, the most fascinating aspect of the book relates to the cloak-and-dagger aspects of the research. The discoveries were scientifically important - Nobel prizes were virtually guaranteed, but to whom? - and scientists and institutions that patented practical superconductors would certainly become wealthy. The race to be first engendered jealousies, Mr. Hazen says, discussing widespread suspicions of industrial and academic spying. Most fascinating of all are his accounts of Mr. Chu's obsessiveness. He modestly insisted that his name appear as the last author on some work, yet Mr. Hazen shows that at a critical time Mr. Chu almost certainly doctored up his own formula in drafts of an article, so that his results could not be duplicated and exploited. Mr. Hazen's account comes strictly from personal experience; he was not even sure at the time which other laboratories were doing comparable research. A more annoying weakness is the author's holier-than-other-scientists attitude. Pledged to silence by Mr. Chu, Mr. Hazen wrings his hands over the unaccustomed secrecy and is naively appalled by scientists who demonstrate human failings.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Chicago,"Not so long ago, a fledgling airport named after a local war hero stood amid the corn and beanfields northwest of Chicago, a quiet stretch of prairie where night life could mean a tractor plowing in the moonlight. But the field named for Butch O'Hare would become the busiest airport in the world, and corporate towers began to sprout prodigously from the soil, giving rise to a gleaming, sprawling suburbanopolis that today competes for visitors with its big-shouldered progenitor along Lake Michigan. (A recent survey shows that more people work in the suburbs than commute, now that so many major corporations are based outside the city.) Just as train travel early in this century made Chicago the locus of business meetings and trade conventions, the growth of O'Hare (nearly 60 million passengers passed through in 1987) has combined with suburban expansion to spawn the kinds of hotels, restaurants and bistros that once required a trip to the city.) The city itself, of course, remains a vibrant, cosmopolitan feast for the senses - from the restaurants in Greek Town to the glittering shopping district on Michigan Avenue. But the Land Beyond O'Hare, as it is called, is also worth exploration, especially since the trek downtown may demand more energy than a weary traveler can summon. The area, in a 30-minute radius of the airport, is dotted with glass and steel corporate towers and crisscrossed with expressways that bend through the old towns and newer settlements.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

An insane asylum as refuge from the madness of Nazi-occupied Poland in World War II - at first glance, the metaphor seems hopelessly trite. Yet this skillful, semiautobiographical first novel just skirts the edge of allegory, and its author's artistry steers it gracefully away from the dangers of cliche. But then it's no ordinary first novel. The Polish author Stanislaw Lem wrote it in 1948, long before he achieved fame as one of the world's leading contemporary science fiction writers. Now published in English for the first time in a solid translation by William Brand,, ''Hospital of the Transfiguration'' is the pensive story of Stefan Trzyniecki, a directionless, despairing young doctor who takes a job at a provincial Polish mental hospital at the outset of the war. There he confronts the absurdity of life through events that occur both inside and outside the asylum walls. Many of the hallmarks of Mr. Lem's mature science fiction style are present in this melancholy work of realism - the penchant for metaphysical discourse, the command of technical details, the flashes of humor. If it suffers from some of the common weaknesses of a first novel - occasionally excessive bursts of passion, a certain disjointedness - it is nevertheless strong testimony to the profound understanding of people and life that underlies even the lasers and spaceships of Mr. Lem's better-known oeuvre.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

G. Seaga, in 1981 and promises economic aid. In 1983, the region's English-speaking islands support the American invasion of Grenada. Nicaragua: The Central Intelligence Agency begins clandestinely supporting anti-Sandinista guerrillas in 1981. The contras will become the focus of debate over whether, to what extent and how openly the United States Government should support their efforts to topple the Government in Nicaragua. One element in the debate is whether more emphasis should be placed on supporting the Latin Americans' own peace initiatives. Argentina: The Falkland War in 1982 pits Argentina against Britain, increasing American disillusionment with Argentina's military Government. After efforts to mediate the dispute, the Administration sides with Britain, alienating many Latin Americans who sympathize with Argentina's claim to the islands they call the Malvinas. El Salvador: United States-backed elections are held in El Salvador in 1982 amid civil war, to choose an assembly that will oversee a transition to democracy after rule by a civilian-military junta. In 1984, another election is held, for the office of President; the winner is Jose Napoleon Duarte, a centrist whom the United States supports. Mexico: President Reagan holds several meetings with Mexico's leaders, first Jose Lopez Portillo and then Miguel de la Madrid. In 1982 and 1988, the United States is instrumental in extending loans to Mexico to bolster its economy. Chile: Earlier this month, voters in Chile reject Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bid to be confirmed in power through a plebiscite, setting the stage for a possible transition to democracy that the Administration hails as another foreign policy victory.

The unspoken and perhaps unintended message of this collection of ''death stories'' is that you should avoid being ''famous, infamous [ or ] great,'' since you will surely die young, unhappy or both. Among the 178 notables whose final days are recounted in ''They Went That-a-Way . . .,'' there are 44 homicides, 29 accidental deaths, 25 deaths in which liquor or drugs were factors, 16 suicides, 6 mysterious disappearances, 5 natural deaths rife with irony (the runner Jim Fixx's heart attack and the dietitian Adele Davis's cancer) and one death from syphilis. On the plus side, there are no deaths resulting from the victim being crushed by a horse being lowered on her for purposes of romance: Catherine the Great, for once and for all, is absolved of this vicious canard by the authors, Malcolm Forbes, editor and chairman of Forbes magazine, and Jeff Bloch, a New York City writer. Some deaths are weirdly funny: shortly after extolling the virtues of bone meal during a taping of ''The Dick Cavett Show,'' the health-food buff J. I. Rodale collapsed from a heart attack. Some deaths are fitting - the Tammany boss William Marcy Tweed died in jail - and some aren't - Ivan the Terrible died in bed.

How to fill in the dead time was always a problem for broadcasters. On Sept. 21, 1970, Roone Arledge, president of ABC Sports, solved the problem with ''Monday Night Football.'' His broadcast team would fill in the dead spots: a former star quarterback, Don Meredith, and an abrasive lawyer turned radio sports reporter, Howard Cosell. The show hit pay dirt, and for most of the next 15 years watchers of ''Monday Night Football'' cheered Mr. Meredith and his put-downs of Mr. Cosell. One of the few notable dissenters was Henry Ford II, whose company sponsored the first season. ''I listened to that gab between Don Meredith and Howard Cosell,'' the book quotes him. ''I couldn't concentrate on the football. Take that guy Cosell off.'' ''Monday Night Mayhem,'' by Marc Gunther and Bill Carter, two journalists who cover television, is a fast-moving, evenhanded account of how the show began, hit the top and eventually sank low, in ratings and revenue, amid disputes among Mr. Cosell and his colleagues. The book is straight; there is no fan adulation. It describes what it was like inside the ABC broadcasting booth, control truck, executive office. By 1987, the original stars had left, and the authors say the production ''was not 'Monday Night Football' anymore. It was football on Monday nights.'' The thrill of victory, Henry Ford might have thought.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE PROSECUTORS: Inside the Offices of the Government's Most Powerful Lawyers, by James B. Stewart. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) Charges of insider trading at Morgan Stanley and bribery at McDonnell Douglas are among the cases portrayed in James B. Stewart's book about government prosecutors. ''Each of the stories unfolds with the suspense of a terrific detective novel, but the book is even better than that because the stories are true,'' Seymour Wishman said in The Book Review last year. THE WORLD AS I FOUND IT, by Bruce Duffy. (Ticknor & Fields, $8.95.) During his early days at Cambridge, arguing logic with Bertrand Russell, it seemed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was the ultimate system builder, attempting in his book ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' to delineate the geometries of language and life. But somewhere along the way, the philosopher had a change of heart. The ''sweeping arrangement of fact and fancy'' in Bruce Duffy's novel about this enigmatic man ''is vivid, passionate and funny,'' Perry Meisel said here last year. ''Mr. Duffy's is an achievement in both fiction and historiography which deepens Wittgenstein's mythology and should attract a wider audience to it.'' THE TOXIC CLOUD, by Michael H. Brown. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $9.95.) With dioxins, heavy metals, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals filling the air, environmentalists fear that the atmosphere itself is becoming a toxic cloud. Last year, our reviewer, Philip Shabecoff, said this book is ''so compelling it may prod the public to demand that serious attention be paid to this national scandal.'' MURDER IN THE CIA, by Margaret Truman. (Fawcett, $4.95.) President Truman may have been responsible for the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, Newgate Callendar said here last year, but his daughter, Margaret, takes a dim view of how the organization has changed. Miss Truman, who has also written novels about murder in the White House, the Supreme Court, Georgetown and other Washington locales, ''has become a real pro who can juggle false leads with the best of them.'' THE PHILOSOPHICAL DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF ART, by Arthur C. Danto. (Columbia University, $13.) ''Without theories of art,'' writes the philosopher and art critic Arthur C. Danto, ''black paint is just black paint.'' ''The magnitude of the issues Mr. Danto's books raise is a mark of the books' importance,'' Paul Guyer said in The Book Review in 1987. FELICITY, by Coral Lansbury. (Ivy, $3.95.) Felicity, a beautiful if slovenly art historian, becomes involved with a gang of adulterous academics in a search for a campus murderer. Last year, our reviewer, Fay Weldon, complimented Coral Lansbury for ''the sheer pleasure she takes in her own intelligence, her own ingenuity, her own wonderfully informed mind.'' THE LOBBY: Jewish Political Power and American Foreign Policy, by Edward Tivnan. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) Edward Tivnan's argument that the American pro-Israel lobby has encouraged the suppression of dissent among American Jews may be overstated, Walter Goodman said in The Times last year. But ''in treating that delicate subject in a not-so-delicate way, 'The Lobby' is in keeping with the scrappy spirit of open controversy found in both America and Israel.'' GREAT SKY RIVER, by Gregory Benford. (Bantam, $4.50.) When artificial intelligence takes over a planet, the dominated human inhabitants are nearly reduced to a breed of biological machines. ''The mutual incomprehension between adversaries gives rise to crisply rendered scenes of suspense and horror as well as some surprising moments of gallows humor,'' Gerald Jonas said here this year. MANY MASKS: A Life of Frank Lloyd Wright, by Brendan Gill. (Ballantine, $12.95.) Frank Lloyd Wright was as inventive a self-promoter as he was an architect, Brendan Gill writes, ''a virtuoso at bearing false witness.'' ''In giving us a vivid picture of Wright the man, Mr. Gill also succeeds in giving us a practical appreciation of his work,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year. ''As with the play 'Amadeus,' we end by contemplating the frequent disjunction between temperament and talent, character and genius.'' TENDING TO VIRGINIA, by Jill McCorkle. (Fawcett, $4.95.) A shocking revelation from her husband sends a pregnant young Southern woman fleeing home to Saxapaw, N.C., for a therapeutic conversational marathon with three generations of family. Last year, Alice McDermott said in The Book Review that she admired ''the tremendous exuberance'' of Jill McCorkle's characters. TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN: An Autobiography, by Alan Paton. (Scribners, $9.95.) Born in South Africa just after the Boer War, Alan Paton, the author of the novel ''Cry, the Beloved Country,'' spent his life fighting apartheid. ''No one . . . has done more to interpret black and white South Africa to the world outside,'' Thomas Pakenham said here in 1980, ''its terrible wealth and beauty, its frustration and anguish and hope.'' EARLY GRAVES, by Joseph Hansen. (Mysterious Press, $3.95.) When Dave Brandstetter, a homosexual insurance investigator, returns home to Los Angeles and finds a dead man on his patio, he is drawn into a mystery involving a serial killer whose victims are young men suffering from AIDS. Last year, our reviewer, Newgate Callendar, said this ''well plotted and well written'' novel is ''about AIDS and the fear, even hysteria, it creates among otherwise rational people. . . .

When Jane Bernstein and her husband, Paul Glynn, discovered that their 2-month-old daughter, Rachel, was blind, the result of an incompletely developed optic nerve, they were stunned. Blind? Their pretty, cherished baby? It was inconceivable. Over the months, as additional symptoms cropped up and they were presented with the frightening possibility that Rachel might be brain damaged as well, the bleakness the couple felt was almost overwhelming. Their marriage was bruised by the emotional upheaval, and their 4-year-old, Charlotte, stood in doorways ''wide-eyed and silent,'' watching her mother cry. Their anguish and fear seemed insurmountable. Fortunately, the family found a source of strength - their love for Rachel. They loved her not in spite of or because of her disability, but simply for who she was. Ultimately, this is a story of courageous love that rises above misfortune; of parental love, immeasurably patient, hopeful, buoyant; of marital love that is tested, stretched and strengthened through adversity. Ms. Bernstein is a writer of considerable skill (she wrote the novel ''Departures''), and in ''Loving Rachel,'' which reads almost like a diary, her prose is incisive and vivid; it rings with truth and flashes of humor. Parents of disabled children, or any parents for that matter, will find this an inspiring tale.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

History has relegated him to what can best be thought of as a supporting role in the great drama of 20th-century modernism. Mendelsohn, who was born in East Prussia in 1887 and died in San Francisco in 1953, never led a school; he never founded a style, and with one notable exception he never designed a building that the average lover of architecture would be likely to recognize today, half a century after he and his contemporaries did their most important work.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

Ida Morgan-Weiss, the heroine of Linda Bayer's first novel, faces a dilemma that is rapidly becoming a 1980's stereotype: approaching 40, successful and recently separated from her husband, she wonders whether she should beat the biological clock by having a child on her own. Ms. Bayer, however, has added a few twists to this familiar situation. Because Ida is Jewish, she feels all the more compelled to perpetuate her people's heritage; because she was adopted and is troubled by feelings of rootlessness, she worries about whether she should bring into the world a child whose biological father may have no more identity than a test tube. Months of soul-searching ensue as Ida takes on a new university teaching position and begins a love affair with a congenial - but married - colleague. Finally, she decides that she will know whether it is important for any child to have a sense of ancestry only if she seeks her own biological mother in Israel. At this point, logic disappears from the plot of ''The Blessing & the Curse,'' since Ida's very need to make the trip has already answered her question. Her ultimate choice regarding childbearing seems just as anticlimactic, possibly because Ms. Bayer has foreshadowed it all along. Also predictable is the cast of supporting characters. Because their personalities are not developed throughout the novel, sudden switches in points of view - a chapter told from Ida's lover's perspective and one from that of her birth mother - seem like tantalizing distractions. Ms. Bayer's heroine, however, is a strong and sympathetic creation, testifying to a talent that deserves as much nurturing as Ida's hopes.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

James, until his retirement earlier this year the Keeper of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum, clearly loves Egypt. Starting with the proposition that ''in almost every respect the nineteenth-century traveler to Egypt was at an advantage compared with today's two-week visitor,'' Mr. James starts the armchair archeologist on his journey not in Cairo, where the air traveler commonly disembarks, but in the delta, on a meander up the Nile and through time and history that ends in Nubia. Traveling companions in ANCIENT EGYPT: The Land and Its Legacy (University of Texas, $29.95) include wonderful color plates, liberal quotations from the letters and memoirs of earlier visitors, selected anecdotes of excavation, discovery and thievery and that soothing British diction that, when ornamented with a sense of dry humor and a quick turn of phrase, settles you happily in the lap of an expert. What emerges from the expert's view is a landscape and a culture that was constantly in process. Living places and lesser civil and religious edifices, made of mud brick, when decaying were used by farmers for fertilizer; grander stone monuments and tombs celebrating one Pharaoh or another were used by successor monarchs as fill for still more ambitious structures. But what remains on site, combined with what the Europeans took to their museums, constitutes enough of a record to capture the country - and, in Mr. James's hands, ''the essential humanity of the ancient Egyptians,'' whose comfortable conviction about the afterlife left us that record to read.",1988-10-30T05:00:00+0000

We have built a country, east and west and north, on an infrastructure that resisted the continental pressure of the United States.

us,New Jersey Candidates on the Issues,"The United States Senate race in New Jersey has been among the most hard-fought and bitter in the country. Yet when addressing specific issues, the Democratic incumbent, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, and his Republican challenger, Pete Dawkins, do not differ dramatically. For example, both want the Federal Government to spend more on the environment, on anti-drug programs and on day care. Both are concerned about the size of the deficit. Neither favors increased taxes to pay for new government programs or to offset the deficit, although Mr. Dawkins alone pledges not to vote for tax hikes. On some issues, abortion for example, Mr. Dawkins takes a moderate rather than a conservative position. Similarly, on such issues as gun control, Mr. Lautenberg takes a moderate rather than a liberal position. The two men were interviewed by Clifford D. May of The New York Times. What follows is a distillation of their positions on issues facing New Jersey and the nation. Frank R. Lautenberg: Federal deficit - Sees the deficit as a problem of ''major magnitude.'' Opposes the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law because ''we don't need to go on automatic pilot.''",1988-10-31T05:00:00+0000
