Although he has won just two Wimbledon titles, the third-seeded Nadal looks in fine form at majors this year, having also reached the final at the Australian Open. None of that will intimidate Kyrgios, the enigmatic player who can throw tantrums one minute and make subliminally difficult shots the next. Kyrgios has beaten Nadal three times, including in the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2014, when Nadal was the No. 1 seed. After Kyrgios defeated Nadal at the Acapulco Open in February, Nadal said he lacks respect for the crowd, his opponent and towards himself. Kyrgios lived up to this description in his first-round match, a five-set spectacle against Jordan Thompson, in which he alternated between joking with the crowd, admonishing himself for poor decision making, and trying to be conciliatory. Late Wednesday night, Kyrgios was even spotted by reporters at a Wimbledon Village bar. Its hard to know which version of Kyrgios will show up Thursday, but, at the least, you can expect a match full of scorching forehands and high emotions under the watchful eye of the Centre Court crowd.",2019-07-04T05:00:06+0000

(In an interview with The New York Times, the actor Cary Elwes, who plays the town mayor this season, mentioned Fast Times at Ridgemont High as a primary influence for Season 3.)

This film is about their friendship, and their increasingly inability to reign in their darker sides.

Some said the series lacked novelty and that the Ghostface killer doesnt send chills down your spine over 10 drawn-out episodes. Season 3 brings the show from MTV to VH1 and packs terror in three two-hour episodes airing over three nights. The unlucky protagonist is Deion (RJ Cyler), a high school jock in Atlanta who is haunted by the death of his brother and by a mysterious killer who is sending him eerie messages. After Deion lands in detention, he and a few classmates form the Deadfast Club and set out to find the man behind the mask. As in previous seasons, Resurrection offers plenty of meta references: One character plainly states, Were in a horror movie. Another says, This here is a reboot, and reboots dont play by your rules.

But as the title suggests, the star may be the studio itself. Theres an extra, added feeling of coming to a place where a lot of good music has been made, Rubin says in the first episode.

So I Asked.,"In the early days of the run-up to the 2016 election, I was just beginning to prepare a class on whiteness to teach at Yale University, where I had been newly hired. Over the years, I had come to realize that I often did not share historical knowledge with the persons to whom I was speaking. Whats redlining? someone would ask. George Washington freed his slaves? someone else would inquire. But as I listened to Donald Trumps inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign that spring, the class took on a new dimension. Would my students understand the long history that informed a comment like one Trump made when he announced his presidential candidacy? When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best, he said. Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. When I heard those words, I wanted my students to track immigration laws in the United States.

A finalist for the National Book Award numerous times, Morris won it twice, in 1957 for Field of Vision, and in 1980 for his final novel, Plains Song. A celebrated photographer as well, Morriss work was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art as early as 1941. All told, between 1942 and 1986, Morris published 33 books, including novels, prose fiction and photographs (what he referred to as photo-texts), essay and story collections, and memoirs. A Nebraska native, Wright Morris spent much of his life in California remembering, and more important, reimagining, the Midwest. He died in 1998 at the age of 88.",2019-07-18T18:14:14+0000

While this Oscar-winning drama about Neil Armstrong touches on the space race and the political issues the moon landing raised at home, it focuses on the personal and professional setbacks Armstrong overcame before taking that small step in 1969. Feelings are the films fuel, A.O. Scott wrote in his New York Times review. Like some of the ancient epics First Man is primarily a character study, a space odyssey with a diffident and enigmatic Ulysses at its center."" Ryan Gosling, collaborating with La La Land director Damien Chazelle for the second time, portrays the astronaut in the years leading up to the Apollo 11 launch. The screenplay draws from James R. Hansens biography and contrasts Armstrongs reserved, hard-to-read temperament with the larger-than-life job he has shouldered. We watch as he and his wife (Claire Foy) grieve over the loss of their daughter, prepare for the launch and wrestle with the fact that Armstrong could go down in history as the first man to walk on the moon  or perish in outer space.

Sandigo, who fled Nicaragua as a teenager, moved to Florida in the late 1980s, where she started working for an organization that helped immigrants with documentation. After President Trump took office, many parents in the immigrant community started to give Sandigo power of attorney, so that she could make decisions for their United States-born children, should they be deported. This designation protects the children in Sandigos care from entering the foster care system, keeping them from being legally separated from their parents. When Sandigo is not making grocery runs, contacting lawyers or trying to find beds for the hundreds of people she looks after, she makes trips to Washington to meet with lawmakers to discuss immigration policy. The filmmakers Dave LaMattina and Chad Walker followed Sandigo over two years during and following the 2016 election for this documentary.",2019-07-22T05:00:11+0000

Set in Nazi-occupied France, the story follows two separate plots to bring an end to the Third Reich that ultimately converge: Theres a band of Jewish-American soldiers  the so-called basterds  who land in France to scalp and kill Nazis, and then theres a vengeful Jewish-French woman (Melanie Laurent) who runs a movie theater under a pseudonym.

Twist the blade and it pops open, Work says. Squeeze the soft meat in your hand, feeling for something hard. On a typical day, Work will collect as many as 1,500 mussels and check only a few for pearls; his more dependable pay comes from selling the shells to a company that ships them to China and Japan, where they are cut into tiny pieces and forced into oysters, becoming the nuclei of cultured pearls.

us,Contemporary Fare at Red Paper Clip in the West Village,"Theres no sign, but you might spot the red neon paper clip hanging high in the window of this very particular new restaurant. The chefs and partners, Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, decided to incorporate the word red, often used in China, in the name, which also refers to the story, already an internet chronicle, of Kyle MacDonald, who parlayed a red paper clip into a two-story house after a series of trades. Its our philosophy, always moving forward, moving up, Mr. Chen said. So far, the two men, who have no formal culinary training and met while working several years ago at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, have gone from the bottom of the professional kitchen ladder to working in New York establishments like Soho House; One if by Land, Two if by Sea; and the Dutch, as well as Alinea, in Chicago, and Apis, near Austin, Tex. Before opening Red Paper Clip, a bootstrap affair with no backers, they held pop-up dinners in various places, including an Upper West Side apartment. Mr. Chen, 29, a New Yorker whose parents are from Taiwan, and Mr. Gyamtso, also 29, a Tibetan who came to New York in 2008, are doing all the cooking in an open kitchen at the back of the unadorned 24-seat dining room. (There are eight seats at the bar.) John Parson, the manager, takes care of the beverages. Their food is contemporary, with elements like miso, black garlic, beef tendon and chiles. The part of Tibet where Im from is in the east, near Sichuan, so I favor strong flavors, Mr. Gyamtso said. Mr. Chen said characteristic dishes include oysters with yuzu kosho mignonette, and beef carpaccio with Sichuan seasonings, puffed tendon and coriander. Theyll continue to serve those dishes when they switch from  la carte to a tasting menu format in about six weeks. Theyre just waiting for a new sous-chef to arrive from Texas.

In her 2013 documentary, The Square, the director Jehane Noujaim captured Egypt from the winter of 2011 to the summer of 2013, during a time of political unrest and revolution lubricated by social media. The results of Noujaims work, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, were stunning. This new documentary, made by Noujaim and the filmmaker Karim Amer, is more directly concerned with social networks: It turns its attention to the commodification of personal data, with a focus on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the way American Facebook users data was harvested in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The principal figure through which that story gets dissected is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive who became an outspoken defector. Also interviewed are the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie and the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who was an author of a collaborative report between The Times and The Observer that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users. In that article, Wylie described the company as an arsenal of weapons in a culture war. This documentary picks apart those weapons, and their effects.",2019-07-24T05:00:05+0000

On the other hand theres Campbell McGrath, a poet who is every bit an American writer, and whose substantial volume of new and selected work, Nouns & Verbs, closes out this weeks recommendations. In between we have a novel set in a small English village; an intellectual biography of the French mathematician Andr Weil and his sister, the philosopher Simone Weil; a close look at Greenland and its journey to the center of climate science; and a history of Theodore Roosevelts rise thats also about the rise of American dominance in the 20th century.",2019-07-25T20:26:54+0000

The film opens with a 16-year-old, Mandy (Rhianne Barreto), waking up on her front lawn after a night of partying, not sure how she got there. In the morning, she receives a barrage of text massages from friends alerting her to a grainy video thats been circulating. It shows Mandy lying on the floor unconscious, while her crush (Nicholas Galitzine) removes her clothes. But its what the video doesnt show that propels the film, as Mandy works to uncover the truth, growing more isolated in the process. Bianco uses a depressingly familiar story of high-school partying gone wrong to explore sometimes uncomfortable questions about gender, agency and collective guilt, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.
