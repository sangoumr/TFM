It's as if we wished that Presidents could be brought by storks.Mr. Douglas and Mr. Dern have a high old time of it, shooting it out on horseback, foot and, once, on a hijacked train.

us,"In 'Abandoned Children,' a Study of Homeless","Some of the world's poor and disenfranchised may live in the shadows of anonymity and official apathy, but ""The Abandoned Children,"" a new documentary on Colombia's homeless young, and ""In the Street,"" a vintage short on Harlem's barrio, which arrived at the Film Forum yesterday, project them into a glaringly sharp spotlight. The films' points of view may be vague on occasion, but they constitute pictorial records that tug at the heart and stir the mind.Danny Lyon, the 32-year-old film maker and still photographer responsible for ""Children,"" who was represented here in 1973 by documentaries on New Mexican Indians and others, again seems to be less concerned with polished technique than with an obvious empathy for his pitiable principals. Filmed last year in eye-catching color, reportedly in Santa Marta, his subjects are, mostly, a group of boys who personalize the will to survive.The off-screen narration and subtitles call for fuller explanations, but it is clear that the children have been abandoned or simply left their families to join one of many groups of hardy derelicts who beg for the scraps they eat, wheel and deal, sleep, play and wander through the raucous streets or beach or stream they call home.If the film tends to digress on variations on similar themes or for vignettes of teen-age prostitutes, it does expose its largely laconic children in sequences that often speak louder than words. Ranging in age from preteen, pixieish Joselin to dour, teen-aged Ivan, crudely chanting songs about their tribulations, they are seen sleeping on the steps of the city's cathedral or under the compassionate gaze of the Christ figure in its vaulted interior; snagging leftovers from a restaurant or nibbling chicken claws roasted on a city lot; playing games and building sand castles.In illustration of their seeming aimlessness, one blond boy says flatly that he didn't know his father and that he came to the city on a train. The authorities, the narrator explains, ignore these ""thousands"" of youngsters because of their numbers and the expense involved to arrest and/or support them. The documentation of their errant life-style may be diffuse, but it strikingly illustrates, as Mr. Lyon states in a program note, ""the absolute lower end of survival on the yardstick of human existence.""""In the Street,"" oddly enough, is having its first theatrical showing since it was produced in 1952 by Helen Levitt, Janice Loeb and the late James Agee, who, in 1948, collaborated on the memorable drama of a troubled Harlem boy in ""The Quiet One."" The East Harlem they picture in ""In the Street"" is benign ""theater and battleground,"" especially in the vitality of the carefree Latin and black children pelting one another with flour sacks or gazing pensively from tenement windows. They too, like the adults strolling about or chatting on dilapidated stoops, are rambling but historic and eloquent reminders of survival and poverty.",1975-06-06T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'Death Race 2000' Is Short on Satire,"""Death Race 2000,"" now playing at three theaters, is an Orwellian vision of the American future, if you believe that Orwell was afflicted with blurred perception and an inclination toward the adolescent in satire.Set in the year 2000, in a generally docile and economically humbled United Provinces of America ruled by a paternal and Francophobic Mr. President and a Bipartisan party, the film centers on the great annual American sporting eventa coast-to-coast road race in which the chief ingredients of victory are speed and a willingness to score points by running people down.Women are worth 10 points; the elderly, who are sometimes placed out in the road by hospital personnel in observance of Euthanasia Day (which seems to coincide with race day) are worth 100.Five teams, each composed of a man and a woman, and each appropriately costumed and with an appropriately arrayed car, compete.

The Cambridge (England) connection is clear. For many years Steiner, now at the University of Geneva, taught at Cambridge, where science has always played an important role. It was there that I. A. Richards and others modernized English Studies by emphasizing the vital and intrinsic link between language, psychology and thought, and C. P. Snow later urged the education of all in the two culturesin science as well as the humanities. The study of language, as Steiner knows, is a test case for the interaction of the two cultures: it is the only brandi of humanistic learning in which the scientific method seems to have made real headway in the form of structural linguistics, transformational grammar and semiotics. Yet one of the questions raised by Steiner is whether contemporary linguistic science is genuinely humane or potentially dehumanizing.",1975-06-08T05:00:00+0000

The city's graceful, treelined canals will be festooned with lights, and Amsterdam is looking forward to a busy year despite predictions that American tourism in Europe will drop sharply in 1975 due to the recession and the declining value of the dollar, which brings slightly under two and onehalf Dutch guilders these days. But the 700th birthday aside, the talk of the town in Amsterdam this year has been about the battle between the city government and a group of longhaired protesters in the Nieuwmarkt district over the subway under construction. The protesters have been unable to stop the demolition of many old houses in connection with the project, but they seem to have won a major victory, since the city has called off plans that would have extended the subway. The drug problem has worsened since a Chineseled heroin ring settled in Amsterdam, bringing gang wars and a rash of bad publicity. Because of the prevalence of drugs, officials have closed the popular Vondel Park for overnight camping this summer. However, there is nothing that could be called a crime wave gripping the city. All in all, while some observers of the Amsterdam scene maintain the town has lost some of its charisma in the last few years, it still remains the center of the vital, youthoriented Dutch cultural life and an extraordinary city where skyscrapers are few and where bicyclists and pedestrians still hold automobile.",1975-06-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Love and Death' Is Grand Woody Allen,"Boris Grushenko (Woody Allen), the most reluctant Russian patriot ever to take up an arm against Napoleon, sits in his prison cell awaiting execution. At the instigation of his wife, Sonja (Diane Keaton), the sort of young woman who likes to debate moral imperatives, Boris had plotted the assassination of the French general and gotten caught.Boris, like Sonja, is of philosophical bent. As death approaches, as it has been doing throughout his life, Boris muses: ""Every man has to go sometime . . . but I'm different. I have to go at 6 A.M. It was 5 A.M., but I have a good lawyer.""""Love and Death,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton and Paramount Theaters, is Woody Allen's grandest work. It's the film (as he said somewhere) that God tried to stop, a sweeping, side-splitting spectacle of Europe at war, of clashing armies and of Boris's puny attempts to remain neutral, if not to evade the draft. At the height of one battle, Boris hid in the muzzle of a cannon.""Love and Death"" is Woody's ""War and Peace,"" written in English by Woody Allen, which may or may not be a nom de plume for the late Constance Garnett, and filmed on locations where it all did not happen, in Hungary and France. It's Woody's homage to Tolstoy, Kierkegaard, Eisenstein, Groucho Marx, Bob Hope and maybe even Robert Z. Leonard. It looks terrific. You might say that it looks like a million, except that is probably a million or so less than it cost.Besides being one of Woody's most consistently witty films, ""Love and Death"" marks a couple of other advances for Mr. Allen as a film maker and for Miss Keaton as a wickedly funny comedienne. Miss Keaton here plays a warped kind of Natasha. At first she is married to a rich, elderly, odiferous herring merchant while happily carrying on with most of St. Petersburg's available males, and then, after a brief widowhood, she becomes Boris's wife, who loves him as if he were a brother.""Sex without love is an empty experience,"" she solemnly tells Boris when he first makes advances. Boris ponders that a moment and suggests, ""But as empty experiences go, it's one of the best.""The professional Woody Allen character, compounded of equal parts of optimism and pessimism, leavened by cowardice and a ready access to fractured philosophical jargon and literary allusions, has never before been as completely utilized as he is in ""Love and Death."" If Woody's early films had the flavor of his nightclub monologues, this new one suggests the parodies he writes for The New Yorker magazine, fully expanded to film form and annotated with movie references.""Love and Death"" evokes not only ""War and Peace"" but also ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" especially in the mystical experiences that Boris has been prone to all his life. The first time was when he was a boy of 12 (played by Alfred Lutter 3d of ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"") and met Death, whom he prodded to answer one key question: Are there any girls? Woody's vision of the Grand Inquisitor is a guy who wears a white sheet and goes about the daily routine in a methodical, conscientious way, sort of like mankind's gardener.Most prominent in the large supporting cast are Olga Georges-Picot, as a sultry countess who, briefly, fals head over heels in love with Boris; James Tolkan, who plays Napoleon as if Napoleon were Roman Polanski, and Jessica Harper, as a mopy society girl who doesn't want to get married, just divorced.",1975-06-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Antihero Fare,"The theory that crime isn't always the stuff of trenchant movies is scenically illustrated in ""Murph the Surf"" and ""The Destructors,"" the adventures that crashed into local theaters yesterday. If there is a gloss of sincerity in these depictions of antiheros in action here and abroad, it is overshadowed by successions of explosive capers in Miami and New York and Paris and Marseilles that loom a good deal larger than the tough but doomed characters they attempt to dissect.Proof that truth can be more fabulous than fiction is fairly evident in ""Murph the Surf,"" which dramatizes some of the actual exploits of Jack Murphy and Allan Kuhn, the Miami beach boys  jewel thieves, that were capped by their highly publicized, ill-fated heist in October, 1964, of the Star of India sapphire and 23 other fabled gems from the American Museum of Natural History here.Although the script stems from Mr. Kuhn's own story, the drives and mental make-up of the decidedly oddball principals still call for fuller explanations. As Kuhn, who served his time in prison and is now free, Robert Conrad appears to be too meticulous a mastermind to have allied himself with an apparently carefree, if fearless Murph the Surf (now incarcerated for life for other crimes) flamboyantly portrayed by Don Stroud.If there is some service given to their relationship with Robyn Millan and Donna Mills, as their respective, attractive girls, and their motivations and life style, it is largely surface psychology that is not nearly as edifying as the action. Under Marvin Chomsky's merely workman-like direction from the script centered on flashbacks from the major, daring heist to the preceding robberies and chases in Miami and the Bahamas, the escapades and the beauties of those resorts stick in memory more than the ill-defined principals.""The Destructors,"" once reportedly titled ""The Marseilles Connection,"" involves Anthony Quinn, as the harried American narcotics chief in Paris, in a variety of murderous machinations to eliminate James Mason, as the Marseilles kingpin of the international dope traffic. Mr. Mason, it turns out in a highly convoluted plot, has knocked off our hero's best agents, thus driving him to Maurice Ronet, as a seemingly helpful Parisian police inspector, and Michael Caine, as a professional hit man, womanizer and old friend, and others, to do the job.If Paris's streets, bridges and Metro and the Marseilles waterfront never were lovelier, the script by Judd Bernard, who also produced, rarely delves deeply into the characters of his cast. Speed is the essence of director Robert Parrish's approach, which includes shootings, stabbings, car chases, pay-offs and wisps of amour and sex between our hero and Alexandra Stewart and Mr. Caine and Maureen Kerwin, as our villain's pretty daughter, and even a brief appearance by former Presidential aide Pierre Salinger as a top embassy official.It's ungallant to reveal who finally does the deed, but Mr. Mason is more casual than sinister. And Mr. Quinn is simply as muscular and disheveled as the film's complicated plot.",1975-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Reflections',"Eleven years after it won the grand prize at the Berlin Film Festival against such competition as ""The Pawn-broker,"" Ulvi Dogan's ""Reflections,"" also known as ""Dry Summer,"" began evening showings yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.A somewhat choppy looking black-and-white film in Turkish with English subtitles, ""Reflections"" is one of those earthy, lusty, rustic melodramas played out on parched earth under hot sun to the accompaniment of the ""Never on Sunday"" ensemble and Ravi Shankar.What troubles ""Reflections"" is the incomprehensively submissive behavior of one of the principal characters and the fact that Mr. Dogan  having assembled the ingredients of tragedycontents himself with a lesser conclusion.As actor, Mr. Dogan plays the role of Hassan, the younger, more intelligent and more decent brother of a crude, powerful farmer named Ossman, who incurs the wrath of his neighbors by limiting and then cutting off the supply of water from his land to theirs.Ossman's behavior is at least consistent with his manifestation of the sort of provocatively destructive paranoia exhibited by Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs in ""Treasure of Sierra Madre."" But the film lacks any explanation of why Hassan, the younger brother, lets Ossman make the central decisions in his lifelike going to jail for a killing he did not commit.So, while generating a considerable amount of tension and conflictbetween Ossman and the farmers, between Ossman and Hassan, and between Ossman and Hassan's wife, Bahar""Reflections"" leaves one feeling that much of what happens could have been avoided.As director, Mr. Dogan is given to neatly framed shots, to acting styles that should have seemed dated even in 1964, to the kind of symbolism that shows a sexually deprived woman fondling candles and embracing poles and a predictability that signals our final view of Ossman long before it appears.",1975-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Fogswept moors and golden sand dunes, bayberrybordered ponds and roseheaped cottages, 18thand 19thcentury shipowners mansions, winding lanes and cobblestone streets. Nantucket is a quiet place, steeped in the history of the whalemen and Quakers who brought it riches, a place still relatively free of the encroachments of modern man. With its even terrain and smooth bicycle paths, Nantucket is almost unequaled in New England for twowheel touring. Accomplished swimmers can surf off miles of ocean beaches open to the public. Youngsters can enjoy the calmer waters of Nantucket Sound. Fishermen land bluefish, plaice, striped bass and flounder in island waters. Lobsters lurk in offshore rocky nooks. Scallops rest on salt pond bottoms. On the moors in midAugust, orange wood lilies gleam. In town, hollyhocks brighten dooryards. There are woodcocks and ospreys and piping plovers, Canada geese and mallards and black ducks. In winter, fewer than 5,000 residents enjoy Nantucket's quiet. In summer, there are about 24,000",1975-06-15T05:00:00+0000

There are artists Watteau, for one, and Fragonard, for another  who seem to have worked for delectation's sake, and for no other reason; but they too relate to a specific climate of ideas and to a shift in sensibility that has nothing to do with fashion.

Now I wanted to make up some of the time we had lost in the pass. Our packs, weighing about 40 pounds apiece, were firnily secured to the luggage carrier behind the seat; and as the hairpin turns gradually stretched into sweeping downhill curves I began to open the throttle. On the seat behind me, her back resting against the packs, Marcia leaned expertly left and then right with each successive turn in the road. On either side of us pineforested mountains, terraced pastures, and lonely stone farmhouses, shrouded in semitransparent fog, slid by with dreamlike detachment.

us,Fashion,"The ethnic angle this time is Chinese. The big wrap is a blanketsized shawl or poncho. The sweater is still the epitome of chic, whether it is a sweet, sexy, seductive affair awash with little ties that are meant to be left untied or a rugged, burly style that looks as if it were knitted on broomsticks. The newest skirt anchors negligently at the hips and opens at the side, the better to show tights or panty hose. Despite all this, the fashion message for fall from the French readytowear collections is not revolutionary. After all, there's no big brouhaha over hemlines, which have neither risen nor descended by a yard or so. They have, in fact, settled on a reasonable level, somewhere between just below the knee and midcalf. No yardstick is required to decide precisely where: Designers vary among themselves and presumably will extend the same privilege to their clients. The approaching theankle length so prevalent in the spring collections has receded, along with the mountainous bulk that led scores of plumperthanthenorm and shorterthanthenorm women to cry not for me. While clothes are slimmer, they are rarely skintight, resulting in a comfortable ease that is also modern. Designers who sought vainly to pry women out of their pants uniforms have given up the fight. In the current collections, pants have been accorded separatebutequal status with skirts, which means you pay your money and you take your choice. This laissezfaire attitude doesn't mean that there's nothing to startle. After all, the French readytowear practitioners are, collectively, the gadflies of the fashion world. Clothes that seem impossible at first glance (such as winter shorts, skirts that hang from the hips, giant serapes, short sweaters over longer ones) have a habit of passing into the public domain. If the styles seem a bit subdued this season, it may be because of the economy, no cheerier in France than it is elsewhere in the world, or because designers themselves feel a need for a breather. Perhaps the most significant development is the new way of constructing clothes, with no linings, no turnedunder hemlines and a minimum of seams. Karl Lagerfeld of Chloe is the big pioneer in this area, supported by such prestigious designers as Sonia Rykiel and Kenzo. The weightless, and bulkless, construction technique makes possible the layering of clothes. Lagerfeld's tunic over a dress is the simplest manifestation. Multiple sweaters, vests and even coats are other possibilities. Each layer is in itself light and supple. Altogether, they make it possible to face an Arctic winter. The only problem is, when you check your wrap, how many layers do you part with?",1975-06-15T05:00:00+0000

The remark was made about literary artists generally but it applies handsomely to Wilson in particular. Wilson's character was unitary, of a piece, stamped in brass. It explains why he never turned out firstclass fiction. He had not the artist's ventriloqual gift; his own voice too easily drowned out all others. Fiction for Wilson was criticism by other means. A character too bold in outline, too firm in impress is a defect for a novelist, but for any other prose writing a marvelous asset. Yet to criticism, to history, to social reportage Edmund Wilson nonetheless brought the sensibility of the artist. What Vassarion Belinsky said of Alexander Herzen can be said as well of Edmund Wilson where for most artists intelligence was at the service of talent and imagination, for him talent and imagination were always at the service of intelligence.",1975-06-15T05:00:00+0000

The words stay on the page while the reader goes on to other things. There's been no emotional connection.With this in mind, I've devised what may well be the world's first audience-participation film review, which, I trust, will approximate the impact of the movie itself. The review is a multiple-choice test, the answers for which will be found at Loews Astor Plaza and Cine Theaters, where the film opened yesterday:""Jacqueline Susann's Once is Not Enough"" is based on the celebrated novel by (Charles Dickens, Olive Higgins Prouty, Cotton Mather, Anas Nin, none of these).It was adapted for the screen by Julius J. Epstein, whose late brother and collaborator was (Philip Epstein, Jacob Epstein, Joseph Epstein, Jason Epstein, Barbara Epstein, all five).It was directed by a celebrated Englishman whose last name is a color (Redd Foxx, Guy Green, Kid Blue, Shirley Temple Black), the man who earlier gave us the celebrated (""Potemkin,"" ""House of Wax,"" ""House of Secrets,"" ""The Little Colonel"").""Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough"" is about Mike Wayne, played by Kirk Douglas, a down-on-his-luck Hollywood producer of (films, Kentucky Fried Chicken, tie clasps) whose daughter is named January because she was born in (pride, April, a trunk, none of these).January, who is 19 years old, has an unnatural attachment for her father, a complex sometimes called (wholly natural, boring, kleptomania). When she returns to the States to visit him, she finds New York immersed in (a garbage strike, pollution, immorality, all three). January is shocked by Mike's lavish (life-style, new wife, hair-piece).Mike has married Deirdre Milford Granger, played by Alexis Smith, for her money because Deirdre is (the fifth richest woman in the world, crazy about chicken, the best he can do), but Deirdre is secretly in love with Karla, played by Melina Mercouri, an elderly actress-recluse who wears a lot of (ouzo, kohl, lashes) around her eyes.This kind of love is sometimes called (wholly natural, boring, kleptomania) and was once known as the love that (dare not speak its name, launched a thousand ships, was won on the playing fields of Eton).January, in her turn, makes do with Tom Colt, played by David Janssen, who is (impotent, living at the Plaza, a Pulitizer Prize-winning novelist, all three) and has affection for David Milford, played by George Hamilton, a New York playboy who (has a perpetual tan, uses hairspray, walks funny).Like Mr. Hamilton, the movie seems to have been composed of (whole cloth, snips and snails and puppy-dogs' tails, press releases). It is (ludicrous, bad, terrible, horrendous). It's a film that seems to have been made (to warn motorcyclists not to drive fast, under a hair dryer, to make money look boring, to make money, all four).",1975-06-19T05:00:00+0000

First, it hasn't been written about very much, and yet, as Miss Wolfe points out in her section of historical survey, From Adultery to Extramarital Sex, what scanty evidence there is seems to show that women have been seeking sexual gratification outside of marriage ever since recorded history began. Second, the phenomenon seems to be growing more prevalent these days. For whatever fundamental reasons improved contraceptive methods, the lessening risks of childbirth, the increased availability of abortion, not to speak of that complex of forces that have diminished the sanctity of marriage (or at least the lip service we pay to it)the statistics that Miss Wolfe reads show that more American women are looking around them than ever before.

It's about a supposedly intellectual writer, played by Mr. Vadim, who decides to drop his current project, a book called ""Freud, Criminal of Peace,"" to write a study of a beautiful, well-born young woman named Charlotte, with whom he once had a brief affair and who was later brutally murdered. Among other indignities suffered by the victim, her eyes were gouged out.There's no mystery about the killer, who is virtually a parody of decadence, a pretty, young, wealthy German fellow whose family connections are so high the police don't want to arrest him. When he first meets the writer at a Paris fashion show, he introduces himself by saying, ""I kill time and girls.""Charlotte is played by a Finnish actress named Sirpa Lane, who has the sort of near-perfect figure we have all come to expect to see a lot of in a Vadim film.Poor Charlotte, of course, is cursed, both by her near-perfect figure and by a brain that is the size of a squirrel's. Through flashbacks we see Charlotte going from bad to worse, with lots of fancy photographic effects, as she is torn between her love for her homosexual husband and the fascination of the sadistic German, who sometimes uses lipstick and keeps searching for the ultimate experience. If you are at all familiar with fiction of this kind, you know what that means.Mr. Vadim has never been a great film maker, though none of his earlier films, including ""And God Created Woman"" and ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses,"" has ever been quite so absurd and facetious as this one.

us,Film: Futuristic World of 'Rollerball',"The world of the future that Norman Jewison envisions in ""Rollerball"" doesn't look much different from the one we know today. At first, anyway. Then we begin to read the images more carefully. Interior decorators favor a lot of white on white, an indication that soot, grime and your ordinary heel marks are things of the past. All women grow up to look like fashion models and then, miraculously, they don't grow another inch.People spend their leisure time in front of television sets that have four screensone big screen with three smaller ones at the topinstead of today's functional single screen.What have Mr. Jewison, his screenwriter and his production designers wrought?Quite simply, a perfect world, a world of the not-too-distant future in which, after some vaguely remembered ""corporate wars,"" society is governed by a conglomerate of city-state industries. Illness, poverty, hunger, racial animosities, even (you must suppose) nail-biting have been eliminated.More important, war is no longer known. In its place the corporations sponsor a continuous world series of a sport called Rollerball, which looks like a combination of the kind of roller skating you see in a roller derby, professional wrestling and pinball, and it's supposedly so brutal, vicious and exciting that it works off all aggressions and keeps between two and three billion people glued each week to their multivision TV screens.All science-fiction can be roughly divided into two types of nightmares. In the first the world has gone through a nuclear holocaust and civilization has reverted to a neo-Stone Age. In the second, of which ""Rollerball"" is an elaborate and very silly example, all of mankind's problems have been solved but at the terrible price of individual freedom.""Rollerball,"" which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater, is the story of one man's attempt to regain that freedom. He is Jonathan E. (James Caan), a sort of dim-witted, futuristic Private Prewitt, the captain and star of the Houston Rollerball team whose popularityso think the conglomerate executives  undermines the complacency of the world's citizens. After all, as one executive points out, Rollerball was designed to demonstrate ""the futility of individual effort.""Because of his huge personal popularity, Jonathan E. is asked to retire. When he refuses, for reasons that are more clear in the program notes than in the film itself, the executives keep changing the rules of the game until, theoretically, it will be possible to murder Jonathan in the course of one of the games.The only way science-fiction of this sort makes sense is as a comment on the society for which it's intended, and the only way ""Rollerball"" would have made sense is a satire of our national preoccupation with televised professional sports, particularly weekend football.Yet ""Rollerball"" isn't a satire. It's not funny at all and, not being funny, it becomes, instead, frivolous.It's as if Mr. Jewison, and William Harrison, who wrote the screenplay, really believed that things like war, poverty and disease could be so easily wiped away and that something like Rollerball could be inflated into such an effective soporific. The Romans threw Christians to the lions, but that didn't keep the lower orders quiet for long.Rollerball, as demonstrated in the movie, looks nowhere near as brutal as lion-feeding, or even the Indianapolis 500. Rather, it seems to be as carefully planned as a third - rate pro wrestling match. That, of course, could be one of the points of the film, though I doubt it. Mr. Jewison spends far too much time on the graphic details of the various Rollerball contests to mean for us to find them nothing more than a melodramatic swindle.The film has two interesting sequences. In the first, which suggests Fellini's imagination, the guests cap a fancy dinner party by going onto the lawn and playing with a hand-sized atomic gun that incinerates whole trees in an instant. In the second, Jonathan E. journeys to Geneva to question Zero, the world's most important computer tended by a sweet, fussy, forgetful old man, who is played by Ralph Richardson in a way that brightens the entire film for a few brief moments.Everyone else, including Mr. Caan and John Houseman, who plays a leading Houston executive, is more solemn and serious than the movie ever merits.",1975-06-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Newman as Harper:Detective Resurfaces in 'Drowning Pool',"Perhaps Paul Newman, the battered but unflappable private eye of that engrossing 1966 thriller, ""Harper,"" who was created (as Lew Archer) by the acclaimed crime movelist Ross Macdonald, has become tired of red herrings and ill-usage in ""The Drowning Pool,"" which was exposed yesterday at Loews State 2 and Tower East.Even if he isn't weary, this second time around for Harper is a lackluster workout despite its colorful settings, occasional tension and a cast that includes Joanne Woodward (Mrs. Newman). As a convoluted caper it generates action rather than character and surface mystery rather than meaning.Under Stuart Rosenberg's muscular but pedestrian direction, the script, adapted from the author's 1950 novel, transports our hero from his native California to present-day New Orleans and its bayou environs. He answers the plea of a former flame (Miss Woodward) to protect her from an anonymous blackmailer and realistic charges of infidelity.However, before you can say jambalaya, our confused sleuth is being manhandled by rough cops headed by Tony Franciosa and up to his revolver in oddball entanglements. These include Miss Woodward's man-hungry, nymphet daughter (Melanie Griffith); her wealthy mother-in-law (Coral Browne), who's promptly murdered; a blackmailing chauffeur (Andy Robinson), who also is soon dispatched; her homosexual husband (Richard Derr) and a weird, grasping oil baron (Murray Hamilton) surrounded by snarling pit bulldogs and tough flunkies, who will stop at nothing, including the use of that titular drowning pool, to grab the late old lady's potentially oil-rich estate.Of Course, Mr. Newman's Harper survives beatings, traps and a variety of enticing offers with quips, charm and inherent decency projected in underplayed, workmanlike style. If his performance is not outstanding, it is a shade more convincing than the characterizations of the other principals, who emerge as odd types and not as fully fleshed, persuasive individuals.Miss Woodward is simply an ill-fated, well-dressed, languid, if anguished, deep Southern society woman. Tony Franciosa, complete with corn-pone accent and Manchu mustache, is largely awkward as the top cop who's more than casually attached to her and her sexily errant daughter. Murray Hamilton is roughly flamboyant as the oily but villainous oilman. And bits by Miss Griffith (featured in the current ""Night Moves"") and Linda Haynes as a naive but helpful hooker, are momentarily captivating.Unfortunately, the performances and such authentic facets as Cajun talk, bayous, New Orleans and an imposing, white-pillared, antebellum mansion set amid wide lawns and ancient live oaks, serve only to make ""The Drowning Pool"" a mildly interesting diversion.",1975-06-26T05:00:00+0000

It should be noted that a packed preview audience of youngsters and their parents were not too restless watching these juvenile adventures written, produced and directed by Joe Camp.Cynophobes are warned, however, that Benji, a diminutive, bright-eyed, brown, shaggy bundle of energy and a veteran of movies and television, notably this ""Petticoat Junction,"" series, dominates his human supporting players.

us,The Screen:'Bite the Bullet' Is a Richard Brooks Error,"Richard Brooks's ""Bite the Bullet,"" which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, is a big, expensive Western that doesn't contain one moment that might be called genuine. In spite of all the care, the money and the hardships that apparently went into its production, the movie looks prefabricated, like something assembled from other people's earlier, better inspirations. It's a collage of characters, events, emotions and bits of business that might have been collected over the years in an alphabeticized file cabinet.This is a fairly astonishing thing to have to say, considering Mr. Brooks's credits, which include a good, straightforward ""In Cold Blood,"" a Western as slickly entertaining as ""The Professionals,"" and a number of sincerely appreciative if plodding adaptations of works like ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" ""Lord Jim"" and ""Elmer Gantry."" ""Bite the Bullet"" is an original, and it's as hollow as a drain pipe.It's the story of what is meant to look like a grueling, 700-mile cross-country horserace some time after the turn of the century, though exactly from where to where, and during what time of year, are never specified. One assumes that the film is intended to be a salute to the courage and endurance of the men who participated in such contests, as well as to the kind of gutsy outdoor fiction it's supposed to represent.It fails on both levels. Its gutsiness is about as convincing as the ho-ho-ho laughter of the chorus in ""The Student Prince,"" while its dramatization of courage is little more than perfunctory. Even worse is the film's total lack of excitement and suspense, although about three-fourths of the running time is devoted to the race itself.The scenery is often spectacularly beautiful. Among the actors who get in front of it are Gene Hackman, James Coburn, Candice Bergen, Ben Johnson, Ian Bannen and Jan-Michael Vincent, who are some of the contestants in the race. Mr. Vincent plays a brash, gun-toting kid about whom someone says, quite seriously, ""A boy looking for a reputation is the most dangerous thing alive.""Mr. Brooks also includes in his screenplayas his own inventiona fine old Down East tourist joke that has been in the public domain for decades if not a century or two.It's a small impropriety but it's a temptation that any writer with more talent and less chutzpah would have resisted.",1975-06-27T05:00:00+0000

Even farms are sometimes surrounded by high stone walls, making them look like fortified villages. It rains a lot in Normandy, which is why a stay at a beach resort inevitably allows time for a visit to the colorful fishing ports, as well as to the many towns and villages with monuments spanning centuries of Norman history from William the Conqueror to the French Revolution. Just a listing of notable churches, abbeys, and castles would fill this page. The Normandy Channel Coast includes the ports of Cherbourg, Le Havre and Dieppe.

And the central incident in this new book is labeled by witness a secular miracle. I am not suggesting that Mr. Moore has become a religious crank (anyone who wants a convincing example of his levelheadedness needs only to read his Belfast novel, The Emperor of IceCream), merely that with The Great Victorian Collection he is having an extensive romp in the shadowy field sometimes called parapsychology.
