In the survey of 10,000 residents by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 6.4 percent of residents over all reported such distress, with symptoms like depression and anxiety. Among those with significant distress, 54 percent said they were also in poor or only fair physical health; among other New Yorkers, 17 percent said their health was poor or fair. Hispanics had a higher rate of emotional distress than other ethnic groups, at 11.9 percent, or nearly double the overall rate. Emotional problems were also more common among the unemployed and people with household incomes under $25,000. Richard Perez-Pena (NYT) ",2003-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Albany: Lawyers For Poor May Get Raise,"State lawmakers agreed yesterday on legislation that would nearly double the top hourly rate paid to lawyers appointed to represent low-income defendants in Family Court and in criminal proceedings. Legislators also agreed to create a new financing system to help localities pay for the higher fees. Fewer and fewer lawyers have been willing to represent the poor, in large part because of low pay. Helene E. Weinstein, chairwoman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, said that if the bill passed, the new rates would go into effect in January. The hourly rate since 1986 has been $25 for out-of-court work and $40 for time in court. The new rate would be $60 an hour for misdemeanor cases and $75 an hour for other cases. Separately, New York City is appealing a court ruling that ordered appointed lawyers' fees doubled and struck down the system for compensating them as unconstitutional. It was unclear yesterday what impact the bill would have on the lawsuit. Susan Saulny (NYT)",2003-05-01T05:00:00+0000

Nantero said it created the device by depositing a single layer of nanotubes across the entire wafer, then etching away tubes that were too far from a junction to be switched. Nantero said that it had not yet tested the yield of working chips from the process, but it had begun talks with several chip makers it would not identify to develop a pilot production line. Electronics designers say carbon nanotubes are among several technologies that might offer a way to replace the current mix of memory chips in products like cellphones with a single chip.",2003-05-01T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Andujar is accused of depositing company checks in his personal bank account and diverting $106,000 to himself through a third party, his father.

General Abacha, who died in office in 1998, and his associates have been accused of siphoning $2.2 billion out of Nigeria during five years of military rule. Switzerland has frozen accounts in its banks, about $618 million, that it suspects belonged in part to Abacha family members.

In the years before the post-World War II rush to the suburbs, the neighborhood around the six-corner intersection of North, Milwaukee and Damen Avenues on the city's Near Northwest Side was a classic urban retail hub. Cities and retailing both changed, though, and hubs like this began to sag. Its old buildings filled with whatever tenants would take them. Wicker Park and Bucktown, the neighborhoods south and north of North Avenue respectively, went through the familiar pattern of decay and prosperity, having been staked out by artists and other urban pioneers in the 1980's and then blossoming in the last decade into trendy and sometimes very expensive hipness.

Until now, chip researchers have focused on nanotubes as potential replacements for silicon transistors in semiconductors as microchips shrink and, in other forms, as molecular-sized wiring. Dr. Phaedon Avouris, manager of nanoscale science for I.B.M. Research, said that one barrier to further progress was the lack of uniformity among commercially available nanotubes because the wavelength of the light emitted is tied to the precise width of the nanotube.

We were in the library of his home, which was modeled after a Frank Lloyd Wright design and which he had turned into a sandbagged bunker. Until the Americans arrived, Faisal's street was the safest in the city. Hussein's son Uday had a house eight doors down, and Tariq Aziz lived less than a kilometer upriver. When Faisal invited me for the barbecue, the looting had tapered off slightly but the city was still very unstable. The streets around his house resembled a Medelln comuna, with local militias manning barricades of palm trunks and rubble. Just before midnight, there were a few shots from very close by and we stopped talking to listen. Faisal ran into the library and grabbed his machine gun, and when I followed he told me to stay inside. The gunfire grew heavier. Faisal told the guards to open the gates and yelled ''saula'' -- charge -- and they ran down the street firing. After a while, I went out to the front of the house and peered down the street. I saw Faisal sticking out of the sunroof of his Grand Cherokee, holding the rifle from his waist, looking for looters.",2003-05-04T05:00:00+0000

The work was Osvaldo Golijov's ''Yiddishbbuk,'' a string quartet partly inspired by a photograph of children who died at Theresienstadt.

The effort was aimed at evaluating whether the law's restrictions on raising and spending large donations violated the First Amendment's prohibition against government limitations to free speech. In essence, two of the three judges said Congress was within its rights to find that the unlimited donations could not be used by national parties for advertisements that dealt directly with issues or that attacked or supported candidates.

Hillerman orchestrates the chaos brilliantly in THE SINISTER PIG (HarperCollins, $25.95), devising a plot that draws all these interested parties to a lonely dirt road in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico (''the very heart of America's version of the Persian Gulf''), where an undercover agent has been murdered while investigating possible criminal sabotage of the oil pipelines. Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo police and his retired mentor, Joe Leaphorn, are quick to pick up on the implications for a federal inquiry into some $40 billion in oil revenues that never made it into the Tribal Trust Fund. But the F.B.I. elbows them off the case, and it is left to a rookie, Bernadette Manuelito, working Border Patrol near Mexico, to follow the cynical scheme to its bedrock, allowing Hillerman to tie all three investigative strands together in an extraordinary display of sheer plotting craftsmanship.",2003-05-04T05:00:00+0000

Whether one approach is ''more enlightened'' deserves debate. Singapore's stricter quarantine laws may have prevented the SARS outbreak there from being as devastating as the one in Hong Kong.

An antiwar sitcom that blossomed during wartime, ""M*A*S*H"" ran for 11 years, and it was explicitly intended as a commentary on Vietnam. But the show's setting was the Korean War of the 1950's, a chronological remove that gave the show's creators a perverse freedom, as well as a stamp of universality. To watch it now is to gaze back at an era of angry skepticism, personified by the prankster antihero Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda). In the bleak universe of ""M*A*S*H,"" spokespeople are liars, generals are bullies and anyone who mouths patriotic slogans is a dupe or a hypocrite.

us,He Can Stand the Heat,"It would be easy to say that as a writer, Anthony Bourdain makes a great chef. Easy but not fair. Bourdain, executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan, is a fine writer. His swaggering memoir, ''Kitchen Confidential,'' was a stomach-churning page turner. In THE BOBBY GOLD STORIES (Bloomsbury, $19.95), his third novel but first since that nonfiction best seller, Bourdain whips up a Manhattan tale with Elmore Leonard flavor: the bad guys are a little good, the good guys are a little bad, and everybody's a little funny. The story of a mob enforcer and ex-convict named Bobby, the head of security at trendy NiteKlub, rollicks along for about 40 bone-breaking, punk-slapping pages before Bourdain makes the mistake of retreating to ''Kitchen Confidential.'' A chapter is devoted to a meal with Bobby's boss, who seems to exist only to illustrate humorously every trait of the toxic restaurant customer. The story loses steam here, then stops completely as Bobby gets involved with a NiteKlub cook. She improvises a fancy dinner for him at work, which evidently passes for foreplay in chef land. Though we see this through the eyes of food-ignorant Bobby, Bourdain treats us to a play-by-play straight from his memoir. What was fascinating there is beside the point here, and ''The Bobby Gold Stories'' never quite recovers, even in the telling of a big-score robbery and getaway. Too bad. Bourdain cooks as a writer. He shouldn't be afraid to get out of the kitchen. King Kaufman",2003-05-04T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Singular Pilgrim'," Afew years ago a friend of mine, whom I know to be an intelligent and compassionate woman, listened carefully as I told her about a Greek Orthodox pilgrimage I had witnessed on the tiny Cycladic island of Tinos in the Aegean Sea. Each year on August 15, the Feast of the Assumption, which marks the spiritual and bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary into heaven, the Greek Orthodox faithful travel great distances to Tinos to venerate an icon of the Virgin housed in a church atop a small hill at the end of an avenue of marble paving stones. The icon, which was discovered in the early nineteenth century amid the rubble left by an earthquake, is said to have worked miraculous cures and to have granted many pilgrims their individual wishes. The pilgrims arrive by ferry. The moment the gangplank touches the dock, they rush forward, fall to the ground, and begin making their way to the church on hands and knees. Some slither the half-mile on their bellies, poling themselves forward with their elbows in the manner of besieged soldiers creeping through underbrush. Some lie across the street and, like horizontal dervishes, roll themselves slowly up the gradual incline across stones baked torrid by the August sun. As they proceed they pray for miracles and for mercy. Some weep, others call out the name of the Virgin. Many carry on their backs offerings of wax candles the length of their bodies. In the terrible heat the candles droop and sweat. Elderly white-haired widows in black dresses inch their way silently up the hill, humbling themselves in hope of the Virgins attention, their frail backs forming saddles for the punishing sun. (Many women in need of divine intervention in some grave family matter-an illness, a wayward or disobedient child, a financial bind, an unfaithful husband-vow to return to Tinos every year if the Virgin will grant the desired outcome.) By the time they reach the church after several hours of crawling, their hands and knees are galled into raw and bloody emblems of their belief. Once before the icon they prostrate themselves in a rapture of spiritual desire. ",2003-05-04T05:00:00+0000

A few days later, you get an e-mail message with your recommended diet for the next four weeks. It doesn't look too bad: lots of salmon, spinach, selenium supplements, bread with olive oil. Unsure of just how lucky you ought to feel, you call up a few friends to see what their diets look like. There are plenty of quirks. A Greek co-worker is getting clams, crab, liver and tofu -- a bounty of B vitamins to raise her coenzyme levels. A friend in Chicago, a second-generation Zambian, has been prescribed popcorn, kale, peaches in their own juice and club soda.

Sales this quarter will be $6.4 billion to $7 billion, compared with $6.75 billion in the first quarter, Intel said in a Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly filing. Gross margin, the percentage of sales left after production costs, will be 50 percent, plus or minus about 2 points, compared with 52 percent in the first quarter. First-quarter net income of $915 million would have been reduced by $298 million, to $617 million, if Intel had treated stock options as a compensation expense. Accounting rules allow companies to estimate the cost of options in footnotes to income statements rather than recognizing them as a cost. Accounting-rule makers, under pressure from investors and regulators, are moving closer to forcing companies to book options as costs.

Regional phone companies like Qwest must prove that their local phone networks are open to rivals before they can sell long-distance.

us,Technology Briefing | Nanotechnology: House Authorizes $2.36 Billion For Research,"The House of Representatives yesterday approved a bill authorizing an investment of $2.36 billion over three years in nanotechnology research and development. Most of the money would be funneled to academia and industry through the National Science Foundation, the Defense Department and other government agencies. Nanotechnology, which involves creating and processing materials as small as a single molecule in size, is expected to affect virtually every segment of the economy within a generation. The bill is the first major step by Congress toward asserting a role in managing national support for nanotechnology development and in specifying areas of research it wants covered, like potential social impact. The Senate is working on similar legislation that is expected to pass early this summer. At the moment, the federal government's role in nanotechnology is largely centered in the National Nanotechnology Initiative, an executive program started by President Bill Clinton and enlarged by President Bush. The investments authorized in the House bill are roughly similar to current levels of federal support under the executive initiative. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2003-05-08T05:00:00+0000

Previously, the mayor, his appointees and other elected officials were forbidden to directly solicit private-sector funds for city agencies and nonprofit entities closely affiliated with the city. Now, under recent guidelines, these officials may solicit funds from private companies, except those that have matters pending before the city. Further, the city will now have to publicly name the individuals or firms that have made large donations.

He was caught immediately. In 1999, the man, Dantae Johnson, then 16, was shot while running from Officer Mark Conway. Mr. Johnson was unarmed at the time, and his shooting, coming just months after the fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo, led to renewed criticism of the police. Officer Conway was later convicted of a misdemeanor assault charge and fined. Yesterday, the police said, officers caught Mr. Johnson, now 20, and two others in a 2002 Lexus that had been stolen at gunpoint on West 42nd Street on Monday. Mr. Johnson was taken into custody but leaped from the interrogation room into a tree and was then charged with escape in addition to robbery and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.

But the real appeal may be the lively and walkable downtown, gone neither to seed nor to preciousness. The lack of urban attitude takes some adjustment. When a store owner offers to lend you a vintage book overnight, or bikers slam on their brakes to let you cross, just smile and nod. You could get used to this. SUSAN BRENNA",2003-05-09T05:00:00+0000

Some difficult decisions will have to be made in coming months as to whether the aging shuttle fleet can be resuscitated quickly at a bearable cost or whether some newer means of vaulting into space should be pursued more aggressively.",2003-05-11T05:00:00+0000

M.D. The faculty, staff, and students of Columbia University Health Sciences mourn the passing of a highly esteemed and accomplished mentor, colleague, and friend, Dr. Vincent J. Freda. Dr. Freda has been a member of the Columbia community for over five decades, first as a student in the 1940s and then as a respected member of the teaching faculty from the 1960s to the 1990s. Dr. Freda's contributions to the fields of obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine are both numerous and far-reaching, and have helped to save thousands of lives throughout the world. Dr. Freda led the research team that developed Rhogam, the antibody that enables women with Rh-negative blood to deliver healthy Rhpositive babies. In 1959, he became the first doctor in the United States to perform amniocentesis; five years later, he was the first in the world to perform surgery on a fetus. The 1980 Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award winner for his discovery of Rhogam, Dr. Freda was named clinical professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia and honored with a fellowship in his name for perinatalogy research in 2000.

At first, it was feared that all its archaeological riches were looted when the museum was ransacked. Now, a month later, it appears that the looting, while extensive in scope, did not affect all parts of the museum's collection. Most of the looting, authorities now say, took place in storage areas where more than 100,000 more commonplace objects, of importance principally to scholars, were kept. But many of the museum's jewels may have been spared because Iraqi officials apparently stored them safely in repositories before the war, a top British Museum official said. American authorities in Iraq say that the hunt for those repositories is on, but what officials will find when they open these modern-day tombs is anybody's guess.

Leanne grew up on the Borel Family estate in San Mateo. It was there that she began her lifelong love of animals. She was known in the neighborhood for her unusual pets. As a 4H project she raised a lamb that bonded with the family's dog. The two would roam the neighborhoods to the surprise of the residents there. As a result she got to know the local SPCA well. She subsequently served on the Board of the San Francisco SPCA. Mr. Ed Sayres, President of the SPCA, had this to say: ''We have lost a great friend and supporter. During her long tenure on our Board of Directors, Leanne brought passion, vision and unwavering support to our mission. She was engaged, forward-thinking and dedicated to the cause of saving homeless animals. Thanks to a lead gift from Leanne and George Roberts, The Roberts Medical Center at the San Francisco SPCA will provide a new level of health care for animals throughout the Bay Area. The Roberts Center will be a lasting tribute to Leanne's remarkable compassion and generosity.'' Leanne was a long time member of the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Zoo. President of the Zoo, David Anderson said, ''Leanne Roberts was a cherished friend of the San Francisco Zoo. She was devoted to the animals and helped us ensure the very best care possible for animals at the Zoo. We will always remember her quiet, graceful strength.'' Additionally, Leanne served as a Board Member of the SFMOMA. She had an uncanny ability to appreciate the best in art. Leanne was educated at Orme school in Arizona, and Pitzer College in Claremont, where she met her future husband George. They were married over 35 years. She is survived by her husband, and their three children, Eric, Mark and Courtney, and her two daughters-in-law, Poppy and Kelley. Leanne is also survived by her mother, Mrs. Henry Howard, her two sisters Mrs. Howard Egger-Bovet and Mrs. Robert I. MacDonnell, and her beloved companions Sherman, Chauncey and Lykon. Her eldest son and daughter will carry on her legacy by taking over the management of Stone Canyon Ranch, where she raised world-class American Horses. Leanne will be remembered for her grace, poise, her style, her quiet strength, her serenity, her love and devotion to her family, friends, and all of God's creatures.

us,"Sing to Us, Muse, of the Rage of the Hulk","RAGE. It's the first word of Homer's ''Iliad,'' whose hero, Achilles, has always stood in the Western tradition as a troubling precursor for many of our great epic protagonists. What to make of this overgrown mama's boy, so often petty, jealous, sulking and, when called finally to action, murderous? That he also, at the end of Homer's poem, sits and cries, in mutual mourning, with his enemy, King Priam, whose sons he has slaughtered, only adds to our confusions about the nature of his heroism, and of the heroic legacy he has left us. For as every reader of Homer knows, Achilles would soon go on to kill more of Priam's people, all the while knowing he himself was doomed to die in Troy.",2003-05-11T05:00:00+0000

us,On Top of the World,"The allure of the Himalayas, the appeal of the region to mountaineers, religious pilgrims and armchair trekkers alike, is on full and resplendent display in EVEREST: Summit of Achievement (Simon & Schuster, $50), a collection of photographs, documents and maps, with accompanying essays from the Royal Geographic Society of London. Its publication coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of the world's highest peak by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on May 29, 1953. The society's Everest Archive, begun in the 1850's, includes the expected images of eerily beautiful mountain expanses, dogged climbers and variegated Tibetan monasteries (some since destroyed by the Chinese), all of which resonate with historical and cultural interest. The archive is described almost wistfully as ''part of the Victorian legacy of empire'' because the intrepid exploration of the Himalayas, which featured prodigious feats of surveying and mapping from the late 1700's on, followed expanding imperial rule in India. The spiritual significance of the area to Sherpas and Buddhists also elicits postcolonial concern: the famous reply of the English climber George Mallory to the question of why he wanted to climb Everest -- ''because it's there'' -- is interpreted as a myth ''expressing a basic human desire to explore -- but he missed the myths of the people already living there.''

So, on the one hand, it's heady having Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep all at the same hushed level of intimacy, very definitely three voices from one anima, whispering into your ear about ''The Hours'' and how lovely it was and how privileged they were to do the film. And at first you think you're bound to get a lot of insight from this commentary. But no, the voices don't actually talk to one another; it's not as if the three ladies are all in one booth together, giggly and dishy and naughtily alive. No, they've been recorded in hallowed privacy, like voices from Art's grave. And quite quickly you get the impression that they're going to tell you how marvelous Ed Harris was, and how looking into his bright blue eyes made Ms. Streep feel that all the necessary rehearsal and preparation had been done.

Giddings Professor of Sociology at Columbia University, and former President of the American Sociological Association, died unexpectedly on May 4, 2003. The author of 20 books and over 80 articles on a wide range of topics, ranging from ''Religion Among the Primitives'' (1951) to ''World Changes in Divorce Patterns'' (1993), he was an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Stanford University at the time of his death. William J. Goode was best known for his pioneering cross-cultural analysis of marriage and divorce. Drawing on his knowledge of nine languages, his pathbreaking monograph World Revolution and Family Patterns (The Free Press, 1963) analyzed data from over 50 countries to reveal the critical impact of family systems on what was previously assumed to be purely economic forces. Born in Houston TX in 1917, and encouraged by his high school debating coach Lyndon B. Johnson, he attended Rice Institute and the University of Texas, Austin. He served in World War II as a radarman on an attack transport ship in the Pacific. He joined the Columbia University faculty in 1950 where he taught for 27 years (1950-1977). In 1977 he became a Professor of Sociology at Stanford University, and in 1986 he joined the Sociology Department at Harvard University. He was a distinguished quest lecturer in China for the Chinese Academy of Science in 1986, and a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1992. Known as Si to his friends, he was often referred to as a ''Renaissance man'' excelling in a wide range of activities including painting, sculpting, sailing, mycology, tennis, and birding. In the past 5 years he won several tennis trophies and published an article on ''bird watching with your ears.'' He is survived by his wife, Lenore J. Weitzman, Robinson Professor of Sociology and Law at George Mason University; three children, Erich Goode, Visiting Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland and an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the State University of New York at Stonybrook, Barbara Baldwin, Women's Health coordinator for the Washington DC Department of Heath; and Andrew Josiah Goode, an architect in Shingle Springs, CA; and a sister Rosalie Grizzle of Magnolia, TX.

us,The Way We Live Now: Encounter; The Odd Lady and the Sea,"It's not easy to find good scallops in St. Petersburg. But, then, Ingrid Bengis, one of America's most famous fishmongers, wasn't preparing seafood for her guests. On a recent Saturday, she had gone to the farmer's market with an eye to Chinese stir-fry for her dinner party but returned with a squash, bok choy and pieces of bacon. Now, Bengis bustled around the apartment she shares with her husband, Edouard Palei -- and where she has spent half of every year since 1996 -- fussing over napkins and serving spoons. Her curly salt-and-pepper hair frothed over her ears. She moved with a decisiveness that made her gait look like marching. At last her guests were assembled. Andrei, a dean at the aviation institute and a friend of Edouard's from his days as a ballet dancer, and Rebecca, a soft-spoken American art student on a Fulbright, tasted the arrestingly sweet onion soup. After the next course, a salad of shredded beets, raisins, bok choy and cheese, Andrei's face clouded with confusion. ''American salad?'' he said to Rebecca, smiling bravely. Bengis chattered on, unaware of the cold reception her food was getting. Her husband helped carry in the main course, grainy buckwheat and squash flavored with bacon. It was the final straw for Andrei's palate. He took a few polite bites, then put his fork down. Edouard chewed dutifully.",2003-05-11T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Krollage began his career with the New York Times as a security guard. For 32 years he served as the executive in charge of security and reception for the executive floor. He served under publishers Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Orvil Dryfoos and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger. Mr. Krollage hired and trained many office boys who went on to achieve prominent positions within the company. He also served as the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee for the New York Times Credit Union. He retired in 1985. Gay Talese, in his book about the New York Times ''The Kingdom and the Power'' once described Mr. Krollage as, ''polite, soft spoken; an individual with...reddish hair who seems large and tall enough to redirect angry visitors from the street who occasionally intrude to complain about the state of the world or about one of John Oakes's editorial indiscretions against some distant sultan.'' Known for his friendly manner and dedication to his job, Mr. Krollage, seated at his desk outside the publisher's office on the 14th floor, greeted presidents, heads of state and some of the most famous personalities of our time. During WWII, Mr. Krollage served as a corporal in the Army Air Force and was a decorated veteran of campaigns in Bismark, Archipelago, Luzon, New Guinea, the Northern Solomons, the Southern Philippines, and the Western Pacific. He was honored with seven medals of valor. All who knew Mr. Krollage will mourn his passing.

We still believe that the more health workers vaccinated the better, but the vaccination campaign has encountered such difficulties and is so far from meeting its goals that a reassessment is now in order.",2003-05-12T05:00:00+0000
us,Metro Briefing | New York: Queens: Airport Terminal Evacuated,"A terminal at La Guardia Airport was evacuated for about an hour last night in what proved to be a false alarm after security screeners thought they spotted a weapon in someone's bag, the authorities said. The evacuation of the Delta Airlines terminal was ordered about 7:15 p.m., resulting in long delays for passengers. The Associated Press said 1,500 passengers were required to clear the area and have their luggage screened a second time. The authorities said the problem occurred when security screeners, whose suspicions had been raised by an X-ray image of carry-on luggage, grabbed the wrong bag for further examination. A passenger took the bag that had been considered suspicious and walked into the terminal before security personnel realized their mistake. The terminal reopened about 8:15 p.m.. Thomas J.

Nearly $3 million has been spent on scaffolds since September 1999 on schools that still need repairs. The report cited a Manhattan school where scaffolding cost more than $12,000 per month, for a total of $152,000 this year. Mr. Weiner called on the School Construction Authority to move quickly and spend the money on repairs. Department of Education officials said the authority was already making plans to complete construction at some sites by the end of next year. Jennifer Medina (NYT)",2003-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing: Hardware," INTEL DISCLOSES FLAW IN ITANIUM 2 PROCESSORS Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said yesterday that a flaw in some of its Itanium 2 processors can cause corporate servers to act unpredictably or shut down altogether. The problem was discovered by an equipment manufacturer during routine laboratory stress-testing, said a spokesman, Robert Manetta. As a result, I.B.M. , whose servers contain Intel's chips, said it would immediately halt shipments of its high-end eServer x450 server, which uses the Itanium 2 processor and has been available only since the end of April. Lisa Lanspery, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, said that no customers had contacted it with the problem, and added that I.B.M. remained committed to the Intel chip regardless. The problem affects servers based on the 1-gigahertz chip only in certain highly specific situations. Customers can contact Intel for a replacement or they can opt to run their systems at 800 megahertz, rather than 900 megahertz or 1 gigahertz, which would eliminate the risk of a problem. Customers will also able to replace the chip with a higher-speed version, running at 1.5 megahertz, within a few months, Mr. Manetta said. Intel is distributing software that can detect if a system is affected. ""All processors have errata to some extent,"" Mr. Manetta said. ""We've learned that you don't judge what is a major erratum and what is a minor one. You leave that to your customers."" ",2003-05-13T05:00:00+0000

Jr. It is with tremendous sadness and a profound sense of loss that the officers, directors, managers and staff of The Metropolitan Opera mourn the death of Frank Taplin, a key figure in The Met's history, whose involvement with this house over many years was integral to the success of our company today. President of The Metropolitan Opera's board of directors from 1977 to 1984, Frank Taplin was first elected to the board in 1961. He led The Met's National Council from 1961 to 1964, and was an honorary director at the time of his death. Frank was elected president of The Met at a time of dire financial difficulty for the company. His energy, optimism and belief in the glory of music, as well as his eloquent ability to persuade others to share his excitement and give their support, transformed our company. During his presidency, Frank launched the Golden Horseshoe, a key group of major donors. He also initiated the Centennial Campaign, The Met's first endowment drive, which raised one hundred million dollars. His practical focus on the bottom line made him indispensable to The Metropolitan Opera at a critical period, and his generous heart, humor, musical talent and personal grace endeared him to all who were fortunate to know him. Among his many gifts to The Met is our company cafeteria, which serves every day as the central, informal meeting place for artists, technical and administrative staff, stage crew, ushers and guards, indeed the entire Met family. His pride in the excellence of this house, his wisdom to plan not just for the present but for the future, and his joy in this company's artistic achievements will continue to inspire us all.

Mr. Murthy, who was based in Fremont, Calif., was also an Infosys board member and the company's highest-paid employee.

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: Intel Discloses Flaw In Itanium 2 Processors,"Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, said yesterday that a flaw in some of its Itanium 2 processors can cause corporate servers to act unpredictably or shut down altogether. The problem was discovered by an equipment manufacturer during routine laboratory stress-testing, said a spokesman, Robert Manetta. As a result, I.B.M., whose servers contain Intel's chips, said it would immediately halt shipments of its high-end eServer x450 server, which uses the Itanium 2 processor and has been available only since the end of April. Lisa Lanspery, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, said that no customers had contacted it with the problem, and added that I.B.M. remained committed to the Intel chip regardless. The problem affects servers based on the 1-gigahertz chip only in certain highly specific situations. Customers can contact Intel for a replacement or they can opt to run their systems at 800 megahertz, rather than 900 megahertz or 1 gigahertz, which would eliminate the risk of a problem. Customers will also able to replace the chip with a higher-speed version, running at 1.5 megahertz, within a few months, Mr. Manetta said. Intel is distributing software that can detect if a system is affected. ''All processors have errata to some extent,'' Mr. Manetta said. ''We've learned that you don't judge what is a major erratum and what is a minor one. You leave that to your customers.'' Laurie J. Flynn (NYT)",2003-05-13T05:00:00+0000

A Microsoft spokeswoman said the 10 percent price reduction from $199 would take place immediately. Some retailers were already showing the new price on their Web sites. Sony said on Tuesday that it cut the PlayStation price from $199 to clear out inventory ahead of the introduction in June of a redesigned version, which includes an adapter for networking. That package is expected to sell for $199. Both price cuts took industry watchers by surprise, coming as they did at the start of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video game industry's annual trade show. Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo , which makes GameCube, played down the possibility of a price cut for its $149 console, which currently comes with a free game. ""I really don't think there is an urgent necessity to cut the price,"" Mr. Iwata said. Retailers have been clamoring for cuts in the prices of consoles, according to game industry executives, as the move usually brings a sharp rise in sales. Most, however, were expecting that Microsoft and Sony would take $50 off the price, rather than $20. &#0160;&#0160; ( Reuters ) ",2003-05-15T05:00:00+0000

The suit was filed under Belgium's universal competency law, which gives the courts jurisdiction to bring charges of international crimes even if the case has nothing to do with Belgium or Belgians. Earlier this year, the Parliament, concerned about an earlier lawsuit against the first President Bush, revised the law to prevent such charges, and it seemed very likely that the new case would be dismissed in court. The suit, brought on behalf of 19 mostly Iraqi plaintiffs, charges General Franks with responsibility for civilian casualties.

The suit, filed in federal district court, also said that the department had a ''policy and practice'' of rewarding employees who supported Republican political candidates, and of punishing those who did not. Mr. Lorquet, of Queens, said he had not been promoted since 1998, while others less qualified had been. Claiming his First Amendment rights were violated, he seeks damages and a promotion to the position of warden. A department official said the lawsuit would be addressed ''through the legal process.''

us,'God's Secretaries'," Few moments in English history have been more hungry for the future, its mercurial possibilities and its hope of richness, than the spring of 1603. At last the old, hesitant, querulous and increasingly unapproachable Queen Elizabeth was dying. Nowadays, her courtiers and advisers spent their lives tiptoeing around her moods and her unpredictability. Lurching from one unaddressed financial crisis to the next, selling monopolies to favourites, she had begun to lose the affection of the country she had nurtured for so long. Elizabeth, should have died years before. Most of her great men - Burleigh, Leicester, Walsingham, even the beautiful Earl of Essex, executed after a futile and chaotic rebellion in 1601 - had gone already. She had become a relict of a previous age and her wrinkled, pasteboard virginity now looked more like fruitlessness than purity. Her niggardliness had starved the fountain of patronage on which the workings of the country relied and those mechanisms, unoiled by the necessary largesse, were creaking. Her exhausted impatience made the process of government itself a labyrinth of tact and indirection. ",2003-05-18T05:00:00+0000

The Iraqi information minister's spirited delivery of blatant lies at daily press conferences during the Iraq War earned him a devoted fan base among Internet users seeking surreal comic relief. Now, Minister of Misinformation t-shirts are hot items on E-bay and dozens of Web sites memorialize his most famous quotations. (''There are no American infidels in Baghdad. Never!''). Chagrined that Mr. Sahaf is not included in the Pentagon's deck of cards of the most wanted members of the Iraqi regime, some sites are showcasing a special-edition card named for ''Baghdad Bob,'' as he is known to his acolytes. At www.welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com, about 100,000 visitors a day continue to check in for news and purchase large quantities of Mr. Sahaf-related paraphernalia, including a flying disk emblazoned with his image. Conn Nugent, 57, of Manhattan, one of the site's creators, said the site will continue to decry the ''massive conspiracy coverup'' on the former minister's whereabouts until he surfaces.

Box's outdoor mysteries, figures he knows as many words for snow conditions as an Eskimo. In WINTERKILL (Putnam, $23.95), he begins his list with ''powder, packed powder, slush, wind-groomed, wind-loaded, fluff, glazed, crud, rain crust, cold smoke and corduroy.'' But there are no words weighty enough to convey this decent lawman's feelings when he witnesses the slaughter of a herd of elk during the first winter storm in the Bighorn Mountains -- and then finds the demented hunter impaled on a tree by two broadhead arrows. Pickett's thoughts fly to a notorious recluse who shoots game with a bow and arrow and hunts with a peregrine falcon and a red-tailed hawk. But a fire-breathing agent with the United States Forest Service, who is ''determined to prove there's a war on'' between the government and dissenting political rebels, is itching to pin the crime on a band of survivalists camped out in the woods. Although Pickett can be trusted to give a fair hearing to every man, woman and animal on the mountain, no matter how crazy, antisocial or smelly, this exercise in fairness is wasted on Box's unmitigated villains.

us,How Architecture Rediscovered The Future,"In 1988, the Museum of Modern Art in New York showcased seven architects who had accomplished far more as thinkers than as builders. Of the group, Bernard Tschumi had obtained the grandest commission, for a large-scale Paris park, La Villette; but even though he had been working on it for five years, completion was still far off. Among the others, Tschumi regarded Frank Gehry of California, in practice for a quarter-century, as a senior colleague; yet, at that point, Gehry's best-known work was his own Santa Monica residence, notable for its use of plywood planks, corrugated steel and chain-link fencing. Rem Koolhaas was the author of a dazzling, much-read architectural manifesto, as well as the designer of a tiny house in Rotterdam and a dance theater in The Hague. Peter Eisenman was a longtime professor whose pugnaciously impractical Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, was just finished. Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid and the Viennese team of Coop Himmelb(l)au were theorists and teachers, with a knack for winning competitions with exciting schemes that usually failed to find financing.",2003-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Retirement and even death couldn't diminish the founders' impact. Some commentators talked delicately about the ""tremendous pressures"" that Fiorina faced.

The work is marked by an unabashed embrace of the future, something that had been missing in architecture for almost a generation.

The monthly cost, $850, seemed too steep, they said, and they thought they could get a better rate on their own. But Mrs. Donnelly, 40, said no one would sell a policy covering the couple and their 8-year-old son. The reason, she said she was told, was her diabetes.",2003-05-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'PUBLIC PLACES,' A THEATER LIFE","IT was 1957 and a revolution was overtaking the London theater. The previous year, the play ''Look Back in Anger'' had shown what its author, John Osborne, and a new generation of writers, dubbed the Angry Young Men, were angry about: postwar England's middle-class values. Many actors, young and irreverent themselves -- among them Alan Bates, Albert Finney, Richard Harris and Peter O'Toole -- were eager participants. In her memoir, ''Public Places: My Life in the Theater, With Peter O'Toole and Beyond,'' the Welsh actress Sian Phillips describes the hard-drinking Irish-born actor who would become her second husband in 1959, and his own personal rebellion against conventionality. Best known perhaps for her portrayal of the evil Livia in the BBC mini-series ''I, Claudius,'' Ms. Phillips was seen on Broadway in 1999 as Marlene Dietrich in Pam Gems's play ''Marlene'' and, earlier this season, in Israel Horovitz's dark comedy ''My Old Lady'' at the Promenade Theater.

That storybook premise comes to life at the New York State Theater today and Thursday in his new work, ''Carnival of the Animals.'' The ballet, set in the American Museum of Natural History (which Mr. Wheeldon frequents for its ''amazing mix of the grotesque and the wonderful''), uses nearly 50 dancers and includes narration by John Lithgow, who also wrote the text. The main character, Oliver Pendleton Percy the Third, is portrayed by the School of American Ballet student P. J. Verhoest. In ''Carnival,'' Oliver falls asleep; the dancers -- all characters from his life -- transform into animals. But the 50's-flavored costumes, designed by Jon Morrell (who also created the set), never camouflage the characters; rather, each is adorned with a subtle animal accent. ''I wanted to move away from the clichd bunny ears and fluffy tails,'' Mr. Wheeldon said. ''From the beginning, it was very important that they be people first, then animals.''

Esker, a math teacher at a Brooklyn school, volunteers to tutor one of her students, who has broken both heels in a fall, and ends up falling herself -- for the girl's father. Told from the successive points of view of teacher, student and father, ''Heart, You Bully, You Punk'' (the title comes from a poem by Marie Ponsot) exposes three very different attitudes toward love: those of a 16-year-old ''filled with a volatile, dangerous faith in her own heart, in her ability to sprout wings, defy gravity, exist in midair''; a 31-year-old who has spent years trying to cauterize an old desire that had been ''too much to bear . . . too large or misguided'' and who's not sure she's ready for a new one; and a middle-aged father who deals with the darts thrown at his own heart through a strenuous effort ''to will love.'' Propriety, in the form of the school headmistress, ends up putting a damper on the ''rising elation'' of these characters, and Esker must make a difficult decision. Packed with details of contemporary life in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, ''Heart, You Bully, You Punk'' is a lively, thoughtful pleasure. Benjamin Swett",2003-05-18T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno plan to divide this big pork pie and dole the money out for parks or senior centers or medical programs or just about anything else they want for the districts of their most-favored legislators.

Cisco said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that a new regulation required it to consolidate Andiamo on its financial statement on July 27, the first day of its 2004 fiscal year. Cisco previously said it expected to consolidate Andiamo entirely upon the acquisition's close. In January, United States accounting rule-makers approved final rules that clamp down on the abuse of financing entities that allowed companies like Enron to keep large amounts of debt off their books. Cisco said its investment in Andiamo was never an off-balance-sheet vehicle. The new regulation cited by Cisco applies to variable interest entities  investments in which a company has the highest risk of expected losses or more than half its shares. Cisco said the S.E.C. rule would require it to account for Andiamo as if it had consolidated the company since Cisco's initial investment in April 2001.

Since the middle of 2000, our economy has withstood serious blows: a significant decline in equity prices, a substantial fall in capital spending, the terrorist attacks of September 11, confidence-debilitating revelations of corporate malfeasance, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Any combination of these shocks would arguably have induced a severe economic contraction two or three decades ago. Yet remarkably, over the past three years, activity has expanded, on balance--an outcome offering clear evidence of a flexible, more resilient, economic system. ",2003-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,South Korean Official Optimistic on Bid," Atop official of the Olympic bid committee seeking the 2010 Winter Games for the demilitarized zone in South Korea said yesterday that he did not think the resumption of North Koreas nuclear weapons program would derail its efforts. Because we have tension due to the nuclear issue, the International Olympic Committee could think in a different way, said Jin Sun Kim, the governor of Gangwon province and the executive president of the bid committee that wants to secure the Games for Pyeongchang. By awarding the Games to Pyeongchang, the I.O.C. can help us and North Korea ease the existing tension and be a turning point in promoting peace. In a telephone interview during a trip to New York, Jin added, I think the Games can be awarded to us, and the I.O.C. can greatly contribute to solving the North Korean nuclear issue. A recent I.O.C. evaluation commission report analyzing the three candidate cities  Pyeongchang; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Salzburg, Austria  did not rank the competing bids, but appeared to give a slight edge to Vancouver. It did not mention the North Korean nuclear threat. The Olympic committee will select the winning city on July 2 during a meeting in Prague. Jin said he believed that Pyeongchangs transportation network and the compact layout of its athletic facilities gave it a technical edge over Vancouver and Salzburg. Jin said that he hoped for some type of resolution to the nuclear tensions. We dont believe it will go to extremes, like a war, he said. He added that during recent ministerial talks held between the two Koreas, the North Korean delegate announced support for a successful Pyeongchang bid. Gangwon province is divided between North and South Korea; Jin said there were no plans to stage any events in North Korea. ",2003-05-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing: New York," MANHATTAN: MOBSTER'S IN-LAW CHARGED IN PLOT The United States attorney's office has charged in a new indictment that one of the men who conspired in a plot several years ago to kill the Mafia turncoat Salvatore Gravano was his brother-in law, Edward Garafola. The unrealized plot to kill Mr. Gravano, a former underboss of the Gambino crime family who became an important government witness and was later arrested on drug charges, was revealed last week in an indictment in Brooklyn. Mr. Garafola already faces federal racketeering charges in Manhattan, to which he has pleaded not guilty. He is married to Mr. Gravano's sister, according to the F.B.I. The new indictment says he joined in the plot to maintain his position in the Gambino family. Mr. Garafola's lawyer, Michael Rosen, said his client would also plead not guilty to the new charges.

The man, Michael A.

His failure to collect the signatures of at least 10 percent of the town's registered voters cleared the way for the town to set the so-called mill rate for the fiscal year that starts in July. As of last evening, town officials expected the mill rate to increase 9.3 percent, meaning that taxpayers who now pay $18.30 on every $1,000 in property that they own would pay an additional $1.70 in taxes.

District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said the teenager, Shiva Brent Sharma, continued to run a fraud scheme out of his parents' Richmond Hill home even while awaiting trial on similar charges filed in December. In the latest case, Mr. Brown said Mr. Sharma, 18, would log onto the Internet and trick AOL customers into providing him with their credit card information. He then charged more than $30,000 worth of items, including laptop computers, digital cameras, cellphones and plasma television sets that he then auctioned off, also through the Internet, Mr. Brown said. Mr. Sharma was charged this time with first-degree identity theft, grand larceny and scheming to defraud. His lawyer, Thaddeus J. McGuire, said Mr. Sharma was innocent of the December charges but had not spoken to him about the latest charges. Corey Kilgannon (NYT)",2003-05-22T05:00:00+0000

About 48 percent of investors voted in favor of the proposal, Intel said at its annual stockholders' meeting. The company opposed the nonbinding plan, and some shareholders criticized Intel's resistance to expensing options, saying that they inflated profit. Intel, the world's biggest computer chip maker, has said 2002 net income would have been 38 percent less than its reported $3.12 billion had it accounted for options as an expense.

us,'October Men'," ON THE EARLY EVENING of October 1, 1978, after six months of roistering with an intensity unmatched in the long history of hyperkinetic, high-proof roistering that so enriches the annals of American baseball, the New York Yankees found themselves tied for first place. The team had won 99 of 162 games, a commendable winning percentage of .611, but so had their traditional rivals, the Boston Red Sox. Autumn had taken hold along the eastern seaboard, bringing bright clear skies and quickening winds. The regular season of '78 was history. Still, in a sense, the teams found themselves just where they had been some six months earlier on Opening Day, April 8-tied, toe to toe, and glowering. As nature is said to abhor a vacuum, baseball abhors a tie, so now the Yankees were going to have to fly to Boston and meet the Red Sox yet again in a single-game playoff on October 2. As more than one sportswriter pointed out, the entire season for the two teams was coming down to one game. The regular season had ended and it had not ended. (In an interesting theory advanced by the author W. P. Kinsella, a ball game can stretch from the first inning clear to infinity. Uniquely among team sports, baseball proceeds outside of time.

Fuller had devised the geodesic dome, the great igloo that arched across the sky without benefit of intrusive struts and beams. Domes were the subject of the semester, specifically, the feasibility of creating a dome of the grandest scale, one that would, if done correctly, fit over a baseball stadium. This dome, however, was not Buckminster Fuller's idea. It was Walter O'Malley who had suggested to him just this sort of stadium for his Dodgers, in Brooklyn.

It was in early October 2001, and Dominic was not eager to get aboard a plane and fly to Florida so soon after the September 11 terrorist attack, and his wife, Emily, most decidedly did not like the idea of him driving there all by himself. ""I just don't want you driving to Florida alone,"" she told him. ""It's much too far."" They had been having dinner at a restaurant in Marion, Massachusetts, with their friend Dick Flavin, a local television personality and humorist. Flavin's boyhood hero, a mere 55 years earlier, had been this same Dominic DiMaggio, then the centerfielder for the Red Sox. Half to herself Emily had added, ""Can you imagine? An eighty-four-year-old man driving all the way to Florida by himself."" It was said in a way that precluded any argument. ""How about this?"" Flavin suggested to Dom. ""I'll go with you and share the driving."" Dominic jumped at the offer and immediately signed on. That gained Emily DiMaggio's approval, something not lightly done. ""I know what else, I'll call John,"" Dominic added, ""and see if he'll come with us"" John was Johnny Pesky, his and Ted's teammate for all those years, for whom trips to Florida were significantly harder to make.

About 6,200 of New York City's 80,000 teachers, or 8 percent, have taken preliminary steps toward retiring at the end of the school year, said Randi Weingarten, the union president. She said the teachers had requested ''retirement consultations'' with the union, the United Federation of Teachers. Last year at this time, only 5,000 teachers had requested such consultations, she said. About 5,000 teachers actually retired last year, but the number included many who had been ready to leave for several years but waited until a salary increase took effect in June. Ms. Weingarten, who testified before the City Council's Education Committee yesterday, said many veteran teachers were considering retirement because they were nervous about the new citywide curriculum and other changes that Chancellor Joel I. Klein plans to introduce in the fall. David Chai, a spokesman for Mr. Klein, declined to speculate whether the chancellor's policies were prompting teachers to leave.

On May 19, the lower court, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, overturned a trial court's decision that had rejected changes by the City Council to the term limits law. At issue is whether the Council had the authority to extend the time that some of its members could remain in office. The lawyers, Randy M.

She said the teachers had requested ""retirement consultations"" with the union, the United Federation of Teachers. Last year at this time, only 5,000 teachers had requested such consultations, she said. About 5,000 teachers actually retired last year, but the number included many who had been ready to leave for several years but waited until a salary increase took effect in June. Ms. Weingarten, who testified before the City Council's Education Committee yesterday, said many veteran teachers were considering retirement because they were nervous about the new citywide curriculum and other changes that Chancellor Joel I. Klein plans to introduce in the fall. David Chai, a spokesman for Mr. Klein, declined to speculate whether the chancellor's policies were prompting teachers to leave. ",2003-05-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Briefing | New York: Brooklyn: Financial Data Sought In Bomb Case,"A month after a prison inmate was charged with paying an accomplice to plant a bomb in a police officer's sport utility vehicle in Brooklyn Heights, prosecutors say they are seeking to subpoena the inmate's financial records to see whether he paid others to commit crimes. The inmate, Stephen Alster, 66, was charged last month with paying a jailhouse acquaintance to plant five crude bombs and two guns in the officer's vehicle on March 31. He was not seeking to harm the officer with the bombs, which had no triggers, the police and prosecutors have said. Instead, prosecutors say, Mr. Alster was trying to make it appear that he was wrongly convicted last year for setting off a pipe bomb in the officer's Brooklyn Heights home in 2001. Robert A. Solomon, a lawyer who handles Mr. Alster's finances and is representing him in a civil lawsuit, has hired his own lawyer to fight the subpoena, saying that turning over Mr. Alster's records would violate lawyer-client privilege. A hearing on the matter has been set for next month, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said.",2003-05-29T05:00:00+0000

With European approval, Fuzeon is expected to bring peak sales of 1 billion Swiss francs ($777 million) a year for Roche.

The demonstrators were arrested and questioned about their past political activities, and their answers were recorded in a computer database. Lawyers for the group that opposed the easing of limits on police surveillance say the practice shows that the Police Department is flouting court-ordered guidelines. They asked the judge, Charles S. Haight Jr. of Federal District Court, to create a mechanism so the department could be held in contempt of court.

He began his career in government, then moved to Cornell University where he was a professor and director of the Center for Environmental Research and finally switched to private practice in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. While practicing law, he developed an independent career as an honored documentary photographer.

The company said this week that it would sell the entire company or its assets. Its titles include High Heat Major League Baseball and Army Men. The company said on May 13 that it would evaluate its strategic options because of adverse economic conditions that cut revenue and access to capital. In the nine months ended Dec. 31, revenue declined to $20 million from $38.4 million a year earlier, but the operating loss narrowed to $8.3 million, from $42.3 million a year ago. The company at the time projected fiscal 2003 revenue of $80 million, with that figure inching up to $90 million the next fiscal year. Last July, the auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers said the combination of recurring losses from operations and a net capital deficiency raised ''substantial doubt'' about 3DO's ability to continue as a going concern. Trip Hawkins, the founder and chief executive, lent 3DO $3 million to meet short-term capital needs in October. Earlier this month, the company issued 1.8 million shares and a warrant to buy 441,176 shares to Mr. Hawkins in return for canceling the $3 million of debt he held.",2003-05-30T05:00:00+0000

Pro-slavery Missouri bushwhackers and antislavery Kansas jayhawkers skirmished there during the Civil War. The political machine of Tom Pendergast won notoriety for corruption but also produced Harry S. Truman. It's a great jazz town, where Charlie Parker, Lester Young and Count Basie all got their start. Drink in the history, shop at the bustling City Market, drop by a jazz club like Jardine's or the Phoenix. Sample a glistening platter of ribs or pulled pork and join the unending local arguments over which combination of smoky sweet or smolderingly spicy makes barbecue best.
