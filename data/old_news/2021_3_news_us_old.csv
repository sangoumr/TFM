Axis deer, an Asian breed, were introduced for hunting in the mid-1900s, and they still attract the sharp-shooting crowd. But as their numbers have grown to the tens of thousands, the deer are also considered to be an invasive menace, not just on the roads, but for the way they denude the landscape of vegetation, causing erosion and water runoffs that can damage coral reefs. Maui Nui, a new company, is now turning them into dinner. Across the island, it harvests wild deer at night so the animals are supposedly less stressed and uses a mobile slaughtering facility. Now various cuts of venison, frozen, in preset combinations that include succulent racks, medallions, strip loins, stew meat for a nice braise and ground venison can be shipped to customers across the United States. The meat is mild-tasting, slightly beefy and tender. Its also very lean, so add some slab bacon to your stew and plenty of olive oil to the rag. A four-chop rack serving two will take about 20 minutes at 425 degrees for medium-rare. The companys bone broth is delicious.",2021-03-01T22:50:19+0000

us,A Psychedelic Reinterpretation of Medieval Wall Tapestries,"Wall tapestries were commissioned by the Catholic Church in the 13th and 14th centuries to communicate Bible stories to the illiterate masses, but by the Renaissance, they had become aristocratic status symbols. When kings and nobles were defeated in battle, the victor often seized the huge, intricately woven textiles, with their scenes of conflict, village life and mythical beasts, and resized them to fit the walls of their own castles, where they served as both insulation and trophies. Now, Maharam, the textile maker that began at the turn of the 20th century as a fabric pushcart on the streets of Manhattans Lower East Side, has reinterpreted the traditional craft. The company collaborated with the New York-based design firm 2x4, which took hundreds of public-domain images of tapestries from the 14th to the 16th centuries to create a 10-by-20-foot digital collage titled Tableau Vivant. Maharam then digitally printed the panorama onto a cellulose and latex substrate that can be applied directly to a wall (smaller sections can be customized to fit any space). From a distance, the work appears to be a museum piece, but up close  where you can see peasants pasted next to unicorns and trees growing at strange angles  it collapses time and space with a psychedelic verve.

us,An Elusive Artists Trove of Never-Before-Seen Images,"RAY JOHNSON ARRIVED in New York City in 1949, still in his early 20s, and lived there for a two-decade span in which the dominant artists in town  abstract painters like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still  came to be regarded, especially by themselves, as seers. Johnson, however, was a prankster. Like the bunny head he adopted as his trademark  a cartoonish line drawing that appeared in much of his work, often bearing the name of a key figure in 20th-century art  he hopped lightly, merrily across this playing field. Reveling in puns and irreverence (an untitled 1973 collage known as Jackson Pollock Fillets includes cut-out recipes for Pollock Fillets Amandine and Barbecued Pollock Burgers), conducting his life as a nonstop performance, he revived the Dada tradition embodied by his hero Marcel Duchamp. In contrast to the grandiosity of Minimal art, land art, Pop Art and other macho midcentury movements, he offered something much humbler: collages or drawings of portable size and wry wit. As a response to Happenings, a term coined by Allan Kaprow to describe the participatory performances that flourished in New York in the early 60s, Johnson staged Nothings, in which a befuddled audience was sometimes greeted with an empty room. He decamped to Long Island in 1968  residing eventually in a sanctuary in Locust Valley he called the Pink House, though it wasnt pink  and over the years his ties to his New York friends weakened.",2021-03-23T12:00:11+0000
