He hit 280 home runs before he was 30, but has hit only 55 since then -- partly because he has had a bad back, as well as colon cancer in 1998, but partly because of his drinking and drug habits. Yesterday, a little over five weeks after he tested positive for cocaine, Major League Baseball gave him his third drug-related suspension since 1995, this time for a full year.

Born in 1899 on New York's Lower East Side, she graduated from Hunter College in 1920, was a NYC mathematics teacher for almost 40 years, and was a leadership member of New York's United Federation of Teachers, who honored her recently. She loved European travel and keeping up with all the marriages and births in the Turim family. But her favorite hobby was always attending adult education at Hunter.

A native of New York City, Eric was born on July 26, 1928 to Viggo and Laura (nee Knudsen) Bogedal, Danish immigrants who soon became citizens. He attended school in Queens, NY, the challenging Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, and received a BA degree from Columbia College in 1952. Eric served in the U.S. Army in communications and was honorably discharged as a T4 (Sergeant). He began his career as editor of in-house publications at Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. and later served as public relations manager for Corning Glass and American Brake Shoe. He then entered the advertising industry, joining BBDO, Inc., where he worked in account management from 1962-1978. At that time, he followed BBDO President Jim Jordan, who left the agency to form his own company, James Jordan, Inc. (later Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor, Inc.). At the time of his retirement in 1989, Eric was a senior vice president of that agency, now known as jmcp.inc. He retired to a farm in Bedford, VA, where he continued to work as a computer consultant for the company he had served for so long. In July 1995, he married Eileen Murphy and moved with her to Greene County, VA. Eric is survived by Eileen; his mother, Laura; his former wife, Barbara Taylor; his four married children Robert, Steven and David Bogedal and Debra Hocker; his step-brothers Carl and John Skinner of Slate Hill, NY; and his step-children Chris and Noreen Murphy. He also has five grandchildren. Eric was a model railroader, amateur musician and jazz buff, lifetime member of Mensa, member of the Madison Avenue Motorcycle Club and the Long Island Sports Car Association. A memorial service will be held in New York at a future date for family, friends and coworkers.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Bees Went Crazy,"''I love, love, love Jane Austen's understatement,'' Mary White says minutes before the LSD kicks in. In Matthew Sharpe's first novel, NOTHING IS TERRIBLE (Villard, $23.95), understatement and absurdity combine to make this potentially shocking book clever -- if a little creepy -- fun. Everything that happens in ''Nothing Is Terrible'' is terrible indeed: Mary, the narrator, is orphaned at 10. Months later, her twin brother dies after she insists he play ''making the bees go crazy.'' She then falls for her sixth-grade teacher, Miss Skip Hartman, a 37-year-old WASP with expressive hair and baroque syntax. Skip almost literally buys Mary from her uncle and whisks her off to Manhattan's Upper East Side where, following an introduction to the pleasures of the flesh and of crisp white duvets, she is home-schooled by a pot-dealing physics whiz and a Nietzschean supermodel. (When asked if she's read ''Beyond Good and Evil,'' Mary replies, ''No, but I've lived it.'') A truly rotten kid, Mary hurts the ones she loves and offends everyone else with her ''perpetually rejuvenating force field of hatred and suspicion.'' But through more adventures involving drugs, piercings and adult diapers, Mary's education is complete when she becomes, well, sentimental. Beneath Sharpe's cynicism and postmodern surrealism -- both of which were also on display in his first book, a collection of short stories titled ''Stories From the Tube'' -- beats a sweet heart, as felt when Mary and her tutor share their ''favorite anthology of shortbreads'': ''Intimacy is protean, and we used our mutual devotion to soft, sodden, sugary biscuits as a springboard for meaning-making activity of inexhaustible nuance.'' Warped and oddly touching, ''Nothing Is Terrible'' is brain candy for the bright and jaded. Christine Muhlke",2000-03-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Freedom From MOMA,"In 1986, Arthur Danto called Norman Rockwell's images of American life ''a shovelful of stardust.'' Rockwell's work may be more revered and heatedly debated than any other artist of our past century. The essays, by critics including Maureen Hart Hennessey, Judy L. Larson and Robert Rosenblum, in NORMAN ROCKWELL: Pictures for the American People (Abrams, $35), argue that his work helped shape popular perceptions of American culture in the 20th century. They further assert that Rockwell single-handedly turned high art into an everyday experience. Rockwell began training as an illustrator early in life, staying his traditional course even as the art world embraced modernism and abstraction. His tenacity brought success, first as the art editor of Boys' Life, the magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, then as primary illustrator of The Saturday Evening Post, for which he completed 322 cover illustrations over 47 years. Rockwell avoided themes that required explanation, once saying that he preferred to paint scenes of everyday life from Vermont: ''This is where I can find America the way I want it.'' As Thomas Hoving points out, it is high time we pay Rockwell his due: ''Rockwell is more and more identified -- correctly -- as a cultural phenomenon, one who made a sea change in the perception of art in this nation.''

His career remains a disturbing mystery. A recent, well-made CD of Blind Tom's compositions by the New York pianist John Davis, including piano solos and dance pieces similar in character to the simpler works of Schumann, Gottschalk and Chopin, has led to a re-examination of Tom's life and legacy.",2000-03-05T05:00:00+0000

Cherished grandfather of Erica and Danielle Sherman and Jodi and Michelle Tiffenberg. Devoted son of Rhoda and the late Michael Sherman of Hackensack, New Jersey. He is sadly missed by his dear brother, Marshall, sistersin-law, Rosemary Sherman and Eva Mullane, and brother-in-law, Lawrence Mullane. After graduating from Lincoln High School in Jersey City, he married his childhood sweetheart and went to work in the family business, the Sherman Paint Store in Jersey City.

During the next twenty years, he built Midtown Operating Corp. into the largest taxi fleet in New York City. For many years, he was a member of the executive board of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade. He also served on the Board of Directors of the Fort Lee Community Center. He was a generous supporter of numerous charitable and civic organizations but his philanthropic contributions were almost always made anonymously. Because he understood what was truly important in life, he retired ten years ago to devote himself to his family. He gave his love, support, counsel, and assistance to his family, his friends, his colleagues, his employees or anyone who sought it. His concern for others remained undiminished even during his quiet and courageous battle against cancer. His generosity of spirit will be his legacy to all who knew him.

A prominent member of the Bar-Ilan Global Board of Trustees, Alfred Mackler personified the greatest ideals of leadership & commitment to the Jewish people. He served with distinction for several decades as Secretary and Treasurer of the American Board of Trustees, and as the accountant and national administrator for Bar-Ilan's U.S. operation.

A man of singular integrity and tact, his involvement in every aspect of university activity established a standard of excellence for others to follow. Through the Joseph Alexander Foundation, the Macklers are major Bar-Ilan university benefactors who have made possible the establishment of the Joseph Alexander Memorial Library in the Department of Social Sciences, the expansion of the Maria Finkle and Ruth Rackman Student Couseling Center, and many other vital projects.

His pivotal leadership contributions to BarIlan University and the Jewish people make him irreplaceable, and his record of service to BarIlan University has formed a most impressive chapter in the annals of our University.

The pipe, sunk into the ground in the family's front yard, represents hidden danger to Harley's three younger sisters, and he tries to find a way to remove it. But it's also a symbol for the deep-rooted legacy of pain and perversion that runs in his blood, a peril not only to Harley but to those around him. Harley has been a victim of physical abuse, and he both fears and feels a similar impulse. Yet he generally represses it, and manages to focus instead on keeping what's left of his family fed and sheltered. Harley attends state-ordered sessions with a shrink and seeks sexual release in a doomed affair with Callie Mercer, the 33-year-old mother of his youngest sister's best friend. When Callie is found dead in an abandoned mining office in the Allegheny Mountains, Harley is the obvious suspect, though the truth behind the murder reveals the depths and horrors of the Altmyer family's vein of violence and twisted sexuality. Tense, conflicted and involving, O'Dell's novel deftly captures the voice of a teenage boy who's in trouble and facing profound challenges, even if the narrative sometimes feels dramatically inflated in order to prove its point: that evil runs deep and rooting it out is a difficult, thankless chore.

us,Children's Books; 13th-Century Talent Search,"The great Italian painter Giotto was born in the second half of the 13th century, and little is known of his childhood; even the date of his birth is disputed. The one story the historical record does provide, though, is a vivid one. Lorenzo Ghiberti's ''Commentaries,'' written about a hundred years after Giotto's death, describe a country shepherd more interested in drawing sheep and goats than in caring for them. The young Giotto used sticks to draw outside on rocks and in the dirt; he was discovered doing this by the master painter Cimabue, who was so taken with the boy's work that he immediately asked if he could become his teacher and mentor. The Italian art critic and writer Paolo Guarnieri and his wife, the illustrator Bimba Landmann, have used this anecdote to good effect as the inspiration for their picture book A BOY NAMED GIOTTO, translated by Jonathan Galassi (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17; ages 5 to 9). Guarnieri's young Giotto struggles with his artistic calling and talent and with his lack of technique. When he spies a beautiful painting being carried in a religious procession he is enthralled. '' 'Who made it? And how?' he asks in amazement.'' When he discovers the picture was created by someone named Cimabue he thinks, ''Certainly a painter would understand me.'' Later, when he meets Cimabue and goes to his workshop to see how pigments and gesso work, the young shepherd observes, ''Neither rain nor wind will ever erase this picture.'' The book's rich, gilded illustrations evoke the Byzantine style that preceded Giotto, while suggesting as well the more subtle colors and the emotional intensity for which he later became famous. In ''The Divine Comedy,'' Dante, a contemporary of Giotto, wrote, ''In painting, Cimabue thought to hold the field / Now Giotto is acclaimed by all / So that he has obscured the former's fame'' -- an achievement also alluded to in this gorgeous, deceptively simple book.

Ever since the British-made Altoids hit these shores a few years ago, breath mints have been elevated to stylish accessory. No longer just an impulse purchase at a supermarket or drugstore, designer breath mints are now turning up at trendy shops, cafes and department stores. Alfred Dunhill has started carrying apres-cigar breath mints, while Starbucks and Borders Cafe both sell mints to counteract the aftereffects of latte. Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Marshall Field's and Target sell signature mints. At less than $3 a pop, they offer shoppers an inexpensive way to flaunt a logo. Kate Spade recently cashed in on the craze, selling $4 Clik-Clak tins in red, turquoise and ''Kate Spade green'' at her New York, Los Angeles and Boston boutiques. ''They were trying to think of things that would naturally go in a handbag,'' said Susan Anthony, a Spade spokeswoman. Even Tic Tacs have become chic. In Barneys New York's revamped Co-op, dressing rooms are wallpapered with boxes of them. But the coolest mints can't be bought: Bobbi Brown, the makeup maven, handed out promotional tins at the New York fashion shows. All the better for fresher air kissing.

One Saturday night, while her mother is out with her new gentleman friend, she makes what we in the business call a ''suicidal gesture,'' which is much less than a full-fledged attempt, but obviously a sign that all is not well, and not likely to be, anytime soon. She is in the hospital from Sunday to Friday. On Friday, the ''discharge planner'' calls to notify me that my young patient will be returning home that afternoon. Her five days of covered hospitalization are now up, and since she is no longer a threat to herself (no suicidal gestures during the four full days of her hospital stay), and was never a threat to others, the H.M.O. says it is time to go and, by the way, it won't pay for family therapy. I suggest that a weekend of hanging around with her mother and the new beau is not a great treatment plan for an impulsive, nonverbal kid. A few more days might give her a chance to connect to the other kids on the unit, to have several sessions of family therapy with her mother, to come to terms with having found herself in a hospital in the first place. I tell the planner what a great girl this is (she is not a great girl yet; right now she is a sad, confused, self-pitying and irritable girl, but she might become a great girl, with some help) and the planner sighs.",2000-03-12T05:00:00+0000

Poe, the first great secular American writer, was an alcoholic and a newspaperman when the job offered neither prestige nor much pay, and since his time we can count few patricians and only a scattering of solidly bourgeois characters in our pantheon of lasting favorites. By the mid-20th century and the arrival of major postwar American writers like Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin, William S. Burroughs and the Beats, we had established a literary sensibility adamant about its status as opposition -- an opposition that, if it was not always political, was at least unmistakably spiritual.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Snazi Nazis,"In Hollywood movies, Nazis have been good (Omar Sharif), bad (Peter Lorre) or funny (Peter Sellers). During World War II, when the film industry battled Hitler, Nazis were demonized. After the war, however, Nazi characters were given more human dimensions, as in ''The Young Lions,'' in which a Wehrmacht officer played by Marlon Brando showed his vulnerable, misunderstood and tormented side. Being cast as a screen Nazi had certain advantages. What actor wouldn't be willing to dress up in such snappy (and very photogenic) garb for his close-up? Many have, as Piotr Uklanski reveals in his curiously amusing though disturbingly obsessive compilation, THE NAZIS (Patrick Frey/Scalo, $39.95), an almost wordless (save for captions in the back) picture book of film and television actors who have portrayed Nazis. The book has no real organizing structure, just page after page of posed and action publicity shots, heroic poster paintings and gritty video captures (in color and black-and-white) of men in German uniforms, including Charles Bronson in ''The Dirty Dozen,'' Richard Burton in ''Massacre in Rome,'' Dirk Bogarde in ''The Night Porter'' and Ralph Fiennes in ''Schindler's List.'' Some images are eerie, like that of Anthony Quinn in ''The 25th Hour'' as an SS guard behind barbed wire holding up a copy of a Nazi propaganda magazine with his own picture on the cover. Some are haunting, like John Shea and David Warner as SS death camp overseers in the TV miniseries ''Hitler's SS: Portrait in Evil.'' One of Sonny Bono in ''Escape to Athena,'' is, well, absurd. Uklanski also intersperses comic images, like one with Michael Palin and Eric Idle from ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' and a real surprise -- Buster Keaton in ''Due Marines e un Generale.''

The American Jewish Committee, the international Jewish community, and all people everywhere who hope for a better world, have lost a cherished friend, a powerful advocate for freedom and justice, and a man of profound moral integrity and enormous human kindness with the passing of Ambassador Morris Abram. Since his early days as President of AJC's Atlanta Chapter from 1955-1957, through his role as AJC National President from 1963-1968, and most recently as Honorary President and Founding Chairman of UN Watch, AJC has always been extraordinarily proud and grateful for his leadership, wisdom, and friendship. His active association with AJC, including as an eloquent advocate for Jewish interests and causes and as a champion of the oppressed, helped to shape the work of our agency through tumultuous decades. A brilliant lawyer and diplomat with heartfelt convictions and principles, Morris changed the course of human history in the 20th century in education, law, civil rights and human rights, at home and abroad. A tireless warrior against the evils of anti-Semitism, racism and all forms of intolerance, he was appointed to posts by five American Presidents, most recently as US Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. Through his work with UN Watch, he passionately sought to fulfill Israel's quest for a rightful place in the family of nations. When AJC honored Morris in December, 1999 with our National Distinguished Leadership Award, international leaders came out in full force to pay much deserved tribute to this giant among men, including UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who rightfully described Morris as ''a global citizen of the first rank.'' Morris Abram was a man who believed that one person could make a difference, and then did. His legacy will be an inspiration for generations to come. We send our deepest condolences to his wife Bruna, his children, grandchildren and the rest of the grieving family. Bruce M. Ramer, President David A. Harris, Exec. Director",2000-03-17T05:00:00+0000

Devoted wife of John James (Jack) Kella (deceased). Dear friend of Jerry Price of Seattle. Grandmother to Jonathan Kirkland Ferris, Kristen Joy Ferris and John William Edward Kella. Polly was the youngest daughter of Asahel Curtis, famed photographer of the Pacific Northwest, early conservationist and co-founder of the Mountaineers' Club. Polly contributed greatly to the Washington State History Museum's exhibit ''Golden Dreams: The Quest for the Klondike,'' featuring Asahel Curtis' photographs of the great Yukon Gold Rush of 1897. Polly's uncle, Edward S. Curtis, was the renowned photographer of American Indians. Edward Curtis' 20-volume opus called ''The North American Indian'' was a watershed study of more than 80 Native-American nations from Mexico to Alaska. Completed in 1930, this enormous project has been hailed as one of the finest works of photographic anthropology ever accomplished. Polly's love of music began early in her life in Seattle, where she graduated from the Cornish School of Music and studied with the noted music teacher, Madame Ingbert. Polly frequently gave concerts of chamber music in the Northwest and was a featured performer on the Alaska Steamship Line. During her time at sea, she met Jack Kella, whom she married in 1942. They moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where they raised Kathy and Jake. Polly performed with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra for more than 30 years. She also founded the International Strings, which provided chamber music performances to schools, hospitals, senior citizen homes and other under-served areas of society. Following the passing of her husband Jack in 1985, Polly moved back to Seattle and lived with her dear friend since childhood, Jerry Price, who survives her. Polly continued to enjoy music in Seattle, and performed with the Bellevue Orchestra from 1986 to 1996.

Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he grew up in South Amboy, New Jersey, where he graduated from St. Mary's High School in 1935. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941 and flew 50 combat missions as a P-38 squadron commander in Italy and North Africa. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with eight Oak Leaf Clusters. He retired from active duty in 1946 with the rank of Major. Like many of his generation, on returing from the war he used the GI Bill to complete his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Pace University in 1949. He earned his C.P.A. certificate in 1952. He married the former Rose McGuire of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1944. Mr. Lynn, a native of South Amboy, NJ, had worked for 32 years for The Continental Group, originally Continental Can Company. He helped to manage its growth as a diversified, multi-national company, supervising acquisitions in Europe, especially Germany, and planning the company's move to Stamford, Connecticut, in 1979. The company's first C.P.A., he rose through the accounting and finance ranks, retiring as Controller in 1983. Mr. Lynn lived most of his life in New Jersey. He and his wife raised their family in Metuchen before moving to Southport, CT, in 1979. They remained in Connecticut for 11 years, where they were members of St. Luke Church in Westport and the Patterson Club in Fairfield. They returned to New Jersey in 1991, moving to Little Silver. In recent years Mr. Lynn served as a volunteer at Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank, NJ.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Man and Beast,"If you were to judge a book by its cover, Yann Arthus-Bertrand's GOOD BREEDING (Abrams, $49.50) might seem perfect for the same audience that loved the rural charms of ''Babe.'' Here, gazing proudly out at us, is a smiling farmer surrounded by a swirl of astonishingly tidy piglets and their even tidier mother. Delve into the book, though, and a different impression takes hold. Arthus-Bertrand's studies of prize-winning domestic livestock -- photographed against simple canvas backdrops at agricultural shows in England, France, Italy and Argentina and lighted like Caravaggios -- turn out to be a curiously appealing blend of art and kitsch. Arthus-Bertrand, the author of more than 20 books of aerial photography, including ''Earth From Above'' and ''New York From the Air,'' prefers to get breeders and handlers in his pictures, so if you're not a connoisseur of Lincoln sheep or Chianina cattle, it's the interplay between human and animal that will catch your eye. Some of Arthus-Bertrand's not-so-still lifes -- like the action sequence of a French shepherd shearing a Rambouillet ram and ewe, pausing for a tolerantly impatient glance at the photographer -- suggest high drama tinged with comedy. Others -- like the Auxois mare and her aristocratic French owner, both caught in majestic profile, and the bespectacled Lincolnshire breeder hunkered down next to a Portland ram who exactly mirrors his expression of attentive politeness -- suggest that the old saw about pets resembling their owners might hold true for farm animals as well. Their names also provide fertile ground for speculation: Anas, the Gascon cow; the moist-nosed Limousin bull called Fripon (son, we are told, of Brutus and Sedentaire); the gigantic scrunch-faced Middle White pig whose official name, Gillhouse Fairlady V, usually yields to Little Pudding. And what about those pigs on the cover? They're Italian, not Australian: Felomena and her children, from Verona. But their sturdy owner, Giovanni Ottorino, could be Farmer Hoggett's long-lost cousin -- except for that rakishly angled fedora. Alida Becker",2000-03-19T05:00:00+0000

With Cameron Diaz, one of the stars of ''Malkovich,'' sitting just to his right and Spike Jonze, the film's director, nearby, he anxiously greeted well-wishers. No sooner did one of these people turn to leave than Kaufman's shoulders hunched and his eyes searched for something in the vicinity of his shoes. ''I am hot,'' he said. ''I am uncomfortable.

us,Footnotes,"1. David Bowie, who took his name from a knife, has always been on the cutting edge of art rock. For 30-odd (really odd) years, he's spent an undue amount of time in hair and wardrobe. How refreshing, then, that he showed up for this shoot in jeans and a sweater. Did the man who sold the world his own overbaked image suddenly fall to earth? Where's that bloodless alien whose icily distant voice and intergalactic fashions influenced so many other narcissists? Where's the glitter, the (lip) gloss? (Try the CD ''The Man Who Sold the World,'' $13.99 at Tower Records.) 2. ''Bowie is going for a clean, natural look,'' announced Herve of Frederic Fekkai, whom Bowie specifically tapped as his mane man. ''But may I plug our hair products -- Baby Blonde Shampoo ($18.50) and Smooth Hair Hydrating Hair Creme ($16.50)? Do you know Bowie has not a single gray hair? Eez fantastique!'' (For products, call 888-333-5524.) 3. Off-camera, Bowie picks up a Prada shoe, remembering that in England during the reign of mods and rockers, such items were called chiseled-toe high-pointers. Now they're the big thing in footwear ($350, at Prada, 841 Madison Avenue). 4. Fans, you have just a few hours to see Bowie's Ziggy Stardust get-up at the Costume Institute's show at the Met (closing today). The gear has devotees cooing: visionary! And detractors sneering: pretentious! Nothing clean and natural there. 5. The Bowie camp issued a food list for the shoot. Nouveau vegan perhaps? Something exotic from his wife Iman's native Somalia? No, Starbucks French roast coffee and ham and cheese sandwiches. Pity Bowie didn't know about these six-foot heroes, $96 from Manganaro's Hero Boy, 492 Ninth Avenue. ''Heroes'' was one of his more humanoid songs, and much more than a sandwich. 6. Bowie's last major film was ''Basquiat,'' in which he played a cameo as Andy Warhol in charmingly dotty fashion. Want that Warhol wig for yourself? Fifi Mahony's French Quarter New Orleans wig shop (www.fifi-mahony.com) might oblige. Or, better yet, try Fifi's harlot hair for around $120. 7. Besides ''Heroes,'' Bowie has written some memorable songs, like ''Modern Love'' and ''China Girl.'' He has also had great luck producing Iggy Pop's ''The Idiot'' and ''Lust for Life'' ($12.99 each from HMV Records). But Bowie will be best known for ''Space Oddity'' (No. 60 in VH1's greatest all-time rock songs). 8. So how does a rock star with an underwhelming string of hits rack up a huge fortune? In 1997 Bowie was the first rocker to offer asset-backed bonds paying 7.9 percent on his catalogue and future earnings. Instant jackpot: $55 million. And now there's Bowiebanc.com offering mortgages and 5 percent interest on checking. Wall Streeters like to quip: There are bulls, bears and pigs. Repulsed by the triumph of commerce over art?

While less fun than an Annette Bening doll or a frog-proof umbrella, Oscar-nominated shooting scripts for ''American Beauty'' and ''Magnolia'' can grace your coffee table in time for next Sunday's Big ''O'' festivities. Other hot releases include John Irving's screenplay for ''The Cider House Rules'' and Anthony Minghella's for ''The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' both from Talk Miramax Books. Scribner is selling Frank Darabont's take on Stephen King's ''Green Mile,'' while Faber & Faber is offering Mike Leigh's ''Topsy-Turvy'' script. ''Tie-ins work because people want to stay with characters longer,'' said Esther Margolis, a publishing consultant for Columbia Pictures and publisher of Newmarket Press, which recently added ''American Beauty'' and ''Magnolia'' to its Shooting Script series. Often illustrated, annotated and boasting an introduction by the director (features that pirated scripts bought off the street can't claim), published screenplays lend a screenwriter a certain cachet, even if they don't generate the huge sales of some film-based novelizations. While 10,000 copies is considered a successful press run for a shooting script, this year's Oscar front-runner, ''American Beauty,'' has four times that many in print. Seeing the movie on paper adds a dimension to the experience, Ms. Margolis said. And perhaps for the first time you can grasp the nuances of that overlapping dialogue in ''Magnolia.''

Performances start around now, at a pond near you, according to ''25 Nature Spectacles in New Jersey,'' by Joanna Burger and Michael Gochfeld (the authors suggest the Great Swamp, the Hirair Hovnanian Plant and Wildlife Sanctuary and a few other places). The frog concerts are the first of the list. The shad run on the Delaware and the appearance of glass eels at Cheesequake follow. Then among summer highlights are the nesting herons at Avalon, fiddler crabs at low tide on the beach and the American lotus at Mannington Marsh in Salem County. Fall is time for migrating monarch butterflies at Cape May, and bats at the abandoned Hibernia Mine in Morris County. In winter, it's migrant snow geese at Brigantine and swans at coastal lakes.

By Friday, Mr. Majidi was in Cliffside, N.J., at the home of a friend, Jamsheed Akrami, a professor of film and television at William Paterson University in Wayne, who was interviewing him for a documentary.

The New Jersey Environmental Federation, a non-profit group, said the reports were not encouraging. Only 110 of the water suppliers responded, and among those, 62 received a failing grade from the group. Newark, the state's largest municipal water utility, got an F for not providing foreign-language information despite a large non-English-speaking population.

us,Footnotes,"1. Before hitting the beach, surfers gather at Surfin' Donuts Coffee House, San Clemente's answer to the Manhattan corner deli. ''Six to seven o'clock is our busiest hour,'' says the co-owner, Doug Lemon. ''Surfers come here to get their energy fix -- a Surfin' Donut, a muffin, some coffee.'' We followed. 2. Even surfers get pasty in winter. To compensate, the groomer Maralyn Salameh mixed SmashBox foundation sticks ($28 each; 888-558-1490) with Vaseline and smoothed the concoction onto the surfers' arms and legs. 3. For messy surfer hair, ''blow-dry every which way,'' then scrunch the front pieces with a dime-sized dollop of texturizer, like Tigi's Bed Head Manipulator ($16.95; 800-256-9391) or American Crew Pomade ($8.50; 800-598-2739). 4. Much like surfer hair, surfer clothes are thrown together -- almost anti-fashion. So it's ironic that designers like Cynthia Rowley (who showed her spring collection poolside) and Sandy Dalal (who mixed sleeveless T's with knee-length shorts) would -- and did -- put these carefree looks on their painstakingly planned runways. 5. This 1955 Chevrolet ''phantom'' woodie station wagon has old-school surfer written all over it. According to David Miller, founder of www.oldwoodies.com, woodies (vehicles with wood paneling) helped conserve steel during the World War II shortage. ''By the 60's, used-car dealers had tons of cheap, beat-up woodies, which surfers found perfect for lugging their longboards.'' Interested? Contact George Coleman at (901) 373-5555. 6. ''I love listening to my sons talk about their adventures that I've had nothing to do with,'' says Dr. Dorian (Doc) Paskowitz, 79, the surfing guru who started Paskowitz Surf Camp at San Onofre State Beach in 1972. Maybe that's because Paskowitz is a risk-taker himself. The Stanford-trained doctor passed up cushy medical practices to wander the globe with his wife and nine children (see sons Jonathan and Joshua on page 91, second photograph from top), working in medical clinics and living in campers. Today, Paskowitz is still ''on call for the world'' as a missionary doctor; his son Israel runs the surf camp, and his sons Jonathan and Abraham design a line of surfwear for Tommy Hilfiger. 7. A little story about being in the right place at the right time: during this shoot, Karen Swainson, the photographer's assistant, was innocently crocheting one of her charming hats when our style department editor David Farber insisted on photographing it. Now she makes them to order for $50 to $150 each. Call the artist formerly known as the photographer's assistant (718) 398-8817.

But the lawyer, Carlos A. Martir Jr., said the mayor had declined the request to appear on Wednesday, which was made in a letter notifying him that he was a target of the investigation. Mr. Martir also said he had asked prosecutors to agree to a surrender rather than a public arrest if the mayor was indicted but was refused any assurances. The United States Attorney's office has declined to confirm any information on the jury investigation. In the recent trial of two leaders of a Camden drug ring, several dealers testified that Mr. Milan was involved with the ring and had sold drugs himself. LAURA MANSNERUS",2000-03-19T05:00:00+0000

According to Mark Loizeaux, whose Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc. has been hired to bring down the 24-year-old Seattle Kingdome so that another stadium can rise in its place, ''It's wanted to do that since the day it was built.'' But it needs help, because the Kingdome is also one of the strongest buildings in the world. The dome alone contains 25,000 tons of concrete, and each of its 40 vaulted ribs incorporates seven lengths of two-and-one-quarter-inch reinforcing steel bar. Massive columns of concrete -- and more arm-thick rebar -- support the dome. Holding everything in place at the base of the dome is an enormous ring of concrete laced with yet more rebar: this tension ring, tightened to 8.8 million pounds of tension, secures the dome's ribs like a rubber band around a bouquet of flowers. Destroying the Kingdome is the most complicated of the 7,000 demolitions Loizeaux's company has undertaken.

Downsized from his job as a security guard at an Oakland bank, homeless and penniless and reduced to crawling through the mud on his belly in order to elude the police, Roberto nevertheless sees an ''enterprising future stretched ahead.'' Like Silver Mendez and Gus Hernandez, the men who share with him the unforgiving world of Gary Soto's memorable new novel, NICKEL AND DIME (University of New Mexico, cloth, $29.95; paper, $16.95), Roberto is a man whose flawed vision and good heart make him an endearing if tragic figure. The interconnected stories here follow the declining fortunes of the three men: Roberto, whose innocent scheme to keep from starving backfires when a Christmas wreath he sells sets a man's Volvo on fire; Silver, an aging poet who hasn't sold any of his work in years; and Gus, Roberto's compadre from the bank, whose 19-year service as a security guard ultimately amounts to nothing. Soto's characters cross paths in unlikely places, and their wanderings join together the disparate lives of people who seem to have little connection to one another. Soto, who is also a poet and writer of young adult fiction, recounts with sensitivity and humor the travails of his characters, Mexican-American men who are living on society's margins. Soto's sympathy with their dreams and his refusal to preach about how society has cheated them makes ''Nickel and Dime'' a powerful novel, unpretentious and brutally honest.

Cherished wife of over 50 years, she was inexhaustibly dedicated to Sid's well-being. Above all else, she was the most caring, affectionate and thoughtful mother and grandmother possible. She never missed an opportunity to full our lives with joy, security, attention and unqualified love. Hilde was extraordinarily charitable and always giving of herself-especially to the Cultural Arts Program at the JCC on the Palisades; The Arnold P. Gold Foundation; and the Jewish Home and Rehabilitation Center. Her curiosity and love of learning were boundless-whether she was collecting Chinese snuffbottles, doing Ikebana flower arrangements, or coaching computer with her Seniornet buddies. We will cherish her memory forever. Funeral services will be held on Wednesday, March 22, 2000 at 10:00AM, Temple Emanuel-El, 147 Tenafly Rd., Englewood, NJ. Donations may be made in her memory to The Arnold P. Gold Foundation, 260 Lincoln St., Englewood, NJ 07631; Gilda's Club, 575 Main St., Hackensack, NJ 07601; or The Schonfeld Cultural Endowment Foundation, JCC on the Palisades, 411 East Clinton Ave., Tenafly, NJ 07670.

At University Hospital at Stony Brook, Tuesday, March 21, 2000, following by less than 9 months the death of her beloved and adoring husband of 66 years, Dr. Barnett Greene. Devoted mother of the late Stuart and his wife, Sherry, and of William and his wife, Beverly; grandmother of Douglas, Stephanie and Bradley and of Ilyssa, David and Lauren. Daughter of the late Samuel and Sadie Adelman and sole surviving sibling of David, Frances and Milton. Lee loved her father for ''his kindness, his loving disposition, his concern and generosity to his family and his intelligence'' and her mother for ''her devotion to her family and her great sense of humor.'' She was the embodiment of both-an Arista student at Girls' High School, a graduate of Hunter College, an outstanding public elementary school teacher and reading specialist in Brooklyn, a hard working and creative member and officer of Hadassah, and a disciplined, funny, temperate person who listened well and spoke even better. She became and remained the ''modern woman'' while retaining fundamental values of family, friendship and decency. Above all, she was Barney's partner, in marriage and in life-in the sacrifices during the Depression to support his education and early career, in the loving raising of their sons while he was in the European theater in World War II and while both she and he became and remained consummate professionals. Barney, and especially Lee, gave to their children security, morality, ambition and goals and offered the wisdom to use them wisely. But many will remember her and Barney for their partnership in ballroom dancing that was so emblematic of their lives-for 60 years, on and off the dance floor, they moved in unison, with precision, grace and superb timing; with attention to detail and appearance; and with love and enthusiasm. A woman of valor, her family and friends are devastated at their loss.

We finally met Utta Elgaard, a long-time Dutch resident of Suriname who spoke Dutch, English and Taki-Taki, a patois of the Djukas. She agreed to take us to visit the Aucaners, one of five tribes of the Djukas -- descendants of slaves who escaped into the jungle in the 18th century.

Tom Cruise is both darkly seductive and thrillingly funny as Lestat, a vampire with a past. Brad Pitt is gorgeous and tortured as Louis, his unwilling partner in crime. And Kirsten Dunst, just 12 at the time, is enchanting as the littlest of the undead, a plague victim whom Lestat and Louis snatch from the jaws of death in New Orleans and condemn to eternal childhood. And the final scene, as Mr. Cruise drives away from San Francisco, with the top down, the radio blaring, his lace cuffs fluttering in the breeze, is worth watching again and again - Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Cinemax.",2000-03-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Castoffs,"After years of prowling the fringes of Detroit looking for bargains to fill his junk store, Richard Stalling has become the king of bowling shirts and Bakelite. He's a familiar type: an emotionally undernourished, even adolescent grown-up, apparently satisfied with his carefully furnished solitude. ''I've found that people don't like dwelling on their own irrelevance,'' he says. ''Me, I wallow in it.'' Then his surviving parent -- his mother -- dies, and Richard has a few weeks to rescue the good stuff out of the family house before it's carted away. In Michael Zadoorian's colorful first novel, SECOND HAND (Norton, $23.95), the task erodes what's left of his cool, to the point where he finds himself crying uncontrollably in his shop. That's when Theresa, in her thrift-store frock and skull necklace, walks in. Theresa knows something about castoffs, too: she works at an animal shelter. The two of them embark on a romantic adventure that explores what Yeats called the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart, and it will make you feel as if Zadoorian's got you in an emotional Veg-O-Matic: it's that sad. Maybe the story isn't entirely unpredictable, and maybe its cultural references seem arcane. But if you're a yard sale lover or, especially, an animal fan, ''Second Hand'' may feel like a gift from the (Tiki) gods. Sally Eckhoff",2000-03-26T05:00:00+0000

Ostrich skin, this season's hide of choice, is ubiquitous in handbags, shoes, belts and, most noticeably, skirts -- from Prada's $2,800 tan knee-skimming design (left) to Intermix's more affordable $348 version. Meanwhile, ostrich feathers are embellishing denim skirts and trimming hats, as well as being made into full-fledged boas by designers like Jamin Puech ($114 to $170). This month, Picador USA, a division of St. Martin's Press, jumps on the bandwagon with ''Dream Birds,'' a memoir by Rob Nixon, an English professor with a lifelong fascination for the ostrich.",2000-03-26T05:00:00+0000
us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; What They Endured,"The Croatian and Bosnian children in SUNFLOWERS IN THE SAND: Stories From Children of War (Madison Books, $39.95) tell more than you will ever want to know. Take the account from a 6-year-old about being raped by a soldier -- who had first raped her baby brother. Or that of the orphans who ate rodents caught with traps they devised themselves (''There were many times when we were grateful for the boiled remains of rats''). Or that from the youngsters who watched pigs devour corpses, then heard shots as soldiers killed the pigs (''But always they took the carcasses away. The stench was awful''). These children, survivors of the Balkans war, talked with Leah Curtin, an American nurse associated with the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns who worked in a Croatian hospital. With the help of a local child psychologist, Curtin also persuaded them to make drawings of their experiences. One, of roughly painted brown and red strokes brightened at the top with a streak of blue, is captioned: ''She could not draw anything. She could only make splotches of paint.'' The children's desire to be normal again resonates throughout the book, as do the words ''peace'' and ''hate,'' words inadequate for the emotions engendered by the abuses they endured and the crimes they saw. Some children witnessed parents blown to bits and others nearly starved in bunkers; many endured both. But the children's strong, resilient voices emerge between the dark lines; they look toward the future's bright light. Dulcie Leimbach",2000-03-26T05:00:00+0000

''He said: 'Eric, you have a nice house,''' Valli recalls, ''but you come here and get bitten by fleas and eat frozen yak meat. What are you doing here?' I said, 'I'm realizing a dream.''' Lundup had a better idea: make a film recording the tribe's vanishing traditions. * Valli shot on location (a three-week walk from the nearest road) using the Dolpo-pa themselves as actors. Hundreds of porters carried the production's 5 tons of kerosene, 10 tons of rice and 4 tons of lentils. * Shooting lasted nine months; cast and crew lived in tents, enduring five-week snowstorms and temperatures of minus 15 degrees. ''In the tradition of the Dolpo-pa people,'' says Valli, ''each time a leader dies, they write a biography, or a namdar.

us,Bookend; The Storyteller,"He was James Farl Powers on his birth certificate and Jim Powers to his friends. In the history of modern fiction, J. F. Powers (1917-99) was a distinctive figure, a loner, emerging from quietness every few years when he published a book or won a prize, but otherwise content to mind his own professional business. He is sometimes described as a writer's writer, meaning that he was an artist too good to gratify the most casual reader, but he was also a reader's writer, if we assume a reader who thinks of fiction as intelligent art rather than low entertainment. Such writers tend not to be abundant. Powers published only a few books -- three collections of short stories, ''Prince of Darkness, and Other Stories'' (1947), ''The Presence of Grace'' (1956) and ''Look How the Fish Live'' (1975), and two novels, ''Morte D'Urban'' (1962) and ''Wheat That Springeth Green'' (1988). But these are treasured, guarded with jealousy by those who know of them. News of their quality is passed from one adept to another, like word of an idyllic village in an unfashionable part of France, not to be disclosed to the ordinary camera-toting tourist.

Since the United Nations had authorized a major peacekeeping operation in East Timor, Holbrooke had a perfectly valid reason to fly halfway around the world in order to spend two days there.

He was named president of Caterpillar Overseas in 1960 and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, for two years. When he returned in 1962 he was made a Vice President; he was elected Executive Vice President in 1971. For most of his career Mr. Grant was involved in international finance, establishing Caterpillar companies in a dozen foreign countries. His first trip to England was by ship; he was soon flying ''like a bird'' in small planes that could not yet climb above the clouds. In 1954 his plane crashed on landing in Rio de Janeiro Bay; he helped other passengers get out on a wing before they were picked up by the Brazilian Coast Guard. Virgil Grant was born on Feb. 25, 1913, in Southern Illinois, the son of Robert and Dorothy Simmons Grant. He graduated from a small high school in 1930, but driven by a desire for higher education, won a county scholarship to the U. of Illinois, where he earned a BS in accounting.
