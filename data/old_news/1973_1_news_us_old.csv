In fact, she isn't wearing anything if you don't count the flower painted on her waist. In Chicago, police practice the use of tear gas. A plump, middle-aged man named Bernie welcomes us to a honeymoon hotel that has heart-shaped bathtubs and round beds.In Texas, Gussie Nell Davis, who wears harlequin glasses and seems to exercise her face by smiling, talks about the values she instills in the girls who become Kilgore College Rangerettes: loveliness, poise and dependability. Somewhere else we watch as the state legally executes a terrified little man by hanging him.Whether you like them or not, these are some of the scenes you'll probably carry away from the Whitney Museum's vivid and tough new program of six short films collectively titled ""American Dreams and Nightmares.""Taken together, they suggest that America may collapse into mumbling witlessness in about five minutes. This is a legitimate suggestion from concerned social critics, people whose business is raising hell about society's sanctified idiocies. It may not, however, be an opinion shared by each of the film makers represented in the Whitney show.Short films of this sort are terribly impressionable. They acquire moods and attitudes from the things that surround them. Thus the dominant theme of ""American Dreams and Nightmares""  that America the Beautiful has become rotten and grotesque  gives to ""Beauty Knows No Pain"" an effective malignance I didn't notice when I first saw it last year in a commercial theater.On a program with the beatifically bland ""The Trial of the Catonsville Nine,"" Elliott Erwitt's 25-minute documentary, about the care and training of a group of majorettes, seemed rather sweet and sad. Here the rigors the girls so willingly endure look like the preparations for a national lobotomy.Tom Palazzolo's 14-minute ""Love It/Leave It,"" which he describes as a Chamber of Commerce film, opens the program and sets its tone. It's a montage of exhibitionism (nude beauty contests, parades, professional wrestling) intercut with shots of people (Gov. George C. Wallace) and things (riots, the White House), about which there's no doubt what our associations should be. As social criticism, it's facile, but as film-making it's riveting.Paul Kocela's seven-minute ""The End of One"" shows us seagulls going out of their small minds with delight at a huge garbage dump, crosscut with shots of one very ill bird staggering off to die alone down the beach. Although I don't have much feeling one way or the other for a seagull, I did wonder why the film maker photographed rather than helped it.""Honeymoon Hotel"" is a funny, short (three-minute) anti-commercial for some place called Cove Haven, and ""The Chromium Horse"" is a sober-sided appreciation of an overage boy who loves his Hrley-Davidson as life itself.The most effective film on the program is Charles Bailey's 15-minute, black-and-white ""Cruel and Unusual Punishment,"" perhaps because it makes no attempt at irony, no attempt to hide its feelings about capital punishment. Correction officers, penologists, professional executioners talk about their business, some quite matter-of-factly.One executioner thinks it's odd that the condemned men always sit on the edge of the electric chair's seat, ""so you have to sort of skooter them back onto the chair."" Others, including Gov. Milton A. Schapp of Pennsylvania, are passionate in their loathing. Says one penologist after witnessing an execution: ""You are no longer outside the system . . . You assume a degree of community guilt."" Which is, more or less, the point of ""American Dreams and Nightmares.""",1973-01-05T05:00:00+0000

In a series of curious, dreamlike encounters with the mistress and with the men who were his father's comrades, the young man discovers that his father had been a traitor to what seems to have been a comic opera plot on Mussolini's life.Much more than his ""Partner,"" which was shown at the 1968 New York Film Festival, Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Spider's Stratagem"" recalls the Stendhalian world of his best film, ""Before the Revolution,"" which also had to do with self-deception, political action compromised and motives almost hopelessly tangled. The settings, too, are similar, provincial towns that seem to be millions of miles from where the real action is taking place.The film's color photography is extraordinarily lovely for, like the conspirators within the film, Bertolucci has a weakness for the purely theatrical effect. Of the players, I particularly liked Alida Valli, as the aging mistress, a tough, lean lady who lives in a style fitting an impoverished princess, but who walks around, barefooted and untidy, like a peasant.""The Spider's Stratagem,"" which has opened at the New Yorker Theater, was shown at the ninth New York Film Festival.

Forget about expensive wall coverings and fragile fabrics that will need replacing because of use, soil or boredom. (His walls are washed with white, all seating slipcovered and the floors stained in a tile effect.) This designer invests in accent pieces and an occasional antique that can move to new surroundings or be sold with very little, if any, depreciation at a later date. (The antique Italian mirror, the focal point of the dining space, is an example). Ingenuity helps, too. And Bricke has a lot of that.

It is a surprising thesis but, as you would expect from Davieauthor of the best book written about Ezra Poundit is worked out in exemplary fashion. The influence is of several kinds: he sees Hardy as, stylistically, a selfconscious technician (doing a piecision job on stanza and meter), and politically, a liberal scientific humanist. He traces the influence of Hardy's attitude on British poets from Auden to the comparatively little known Roy Fisher. It appears sometimes in the attachment the British have to elaborate stanzaic form, but much more in their concern for being true to the limitation of common sense and in their distrust of large poetic claims. Both in his description of general patterns in Hardy's poetry and in close analysis Davie is more accurate and more helpful than any other critic I have read.

us,Screen: 'The First Circle':Solzhenitzyn Novel on Prison Adapted The Cast,"""The First Circle"" is a very sad film. Not because of the austerity of its place and time (a special Soviet prison camp for scientists in the late 1940's), nor because hopelessness would seem the only rational philosophy under a tyranny as effective as Stalin's. Rather it's because the movie is such a wan and ineffectual testament to the novel it is based on, as well as to the life and career of its extraordinary author, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the 1970 Nobel Prize-winning Soviet writer.Aleksander Ford, the 64-year-old Polish film maker who wrote and directed the film, has a reputation for serious work that goes back to the late 1920's. Mr. Ford, who left Poland in 1968 to live in Israel, has also lived and worked in the Soviet Union, leading one to believe that ""The First Circle"" would, at least, look and sound right. But it doesn't.It's an international mess. It was filmed in Denmark, mostly with what I assume to be Scandinavian actors, who apparently mouthed English dialogue that was later dubbed in a variety of accents, some so alarmingly American that the way the actors say their lines makes what they say sound even worse, like the dialogue in a Hollywood prison melodrama of the 1930's.""We can make you talk if we want to,"" the camp superintendent says to a prisoner who the government wants to have invent ""the absolute encoder."" Or (with a snarl): ""We'll shoot you like a dog. You'll never get away!""The absolute encoder, which sounds as if the movie wanted to talk like Flash Gordon, is a device ordered by Stalin so that no one can bug his telephone conversations. Its also the peg around which the melodrama proceeds, in lurching starts and fits, introducing us to various inmates and, through flashbacks, to their earlier lives.By trying to cram so much of the 580-page novel into a film of conventional length, Mr. Ford has gotten hold of practically nothing. A lot of events and characters are there, but the tremendous range of experience and emotion is gone. So are the novel's sense of heroisin, of history, of magnificent mission. Instead, awkward actors stand about in costumes in which they don't seem overly at ease, being photographed in the blunt, bright reds and greens and blues that I associate with Denmark's soft-core porn features, playing, essentially, good guys and bad guys with an often ludicrous solemnity.Even though they fail as films, some adaptations of great novels may work to the extent that they excite that they excite enough enough curiosity to send one to the novel itself. ""The First Circle,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts is such a clinker it just might shrivel the interest of anyone unfamiliar with Solzhenitsyn's work. The effect, though not the intent, is anti-intellectualand it's fairly unforgivable.",1973-01-13T05:00:00+0000

And in Denys de la Patalliere's ""Death of a Jew,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, you almost don't have one. What you do have is an incredible story, told in moving pictures, about a tender relationship between an old Arab police inspector (the late Akim Tamiroff) and a young Israeli spy (Assaf Dayan). The newspaper ads quote one critic as saying that the story ""can be appreciated by Arabs as well as Israelis."" And I am afraid that an ecumenism at just that level of naivet, is what ""Death of a Jew"" is all about.Shimon, the Israeli spy, is captured deep inside some unidentified Arab country, and, to make him reveal his contacts he is turned over to the police. When all else fails, even the evil technology of the police chief (Jean Claudio: ""It's not a question of courage; it's a question of voltage."" Sneer.), the old inspector, Mehdaloun, gets his licks.Mehdaloun hopes to replace Shimon's silence with a gregarious will to live, and thus to talk (so as to stay alive); and to this end he sets about corrupting him with kindness. He plies Shimon with gifts; rooms him in his own apartment; takes him eating, drinking, whoring; and grows so fond of his enemy that he begins calling him ""my son.""It is all to no avail. Shimon remains tight as a clam. But, irony of ironies, Mehdaloun falls prey to his own scheme! And he is left at the last, entering his dotage, with a new gregarious will to livenot to mention extravagant tastes for room service, vodka straight and compliant Scandinavian blondes.All this is not quite as stupid as it may seem in the abstract. Anyplace but the Middle East (and perhaps North and South Vietnam) it might have furnished a movie plot. A friend, intelligent and much too kind, has suggested analogies all the way from Claude Berri's ""The Two of Us"" to Bergman's ""Persona."" Personally, I am put more in mind of certain Shirley Temple movies; but any plot idea that has floated so far must have some buoyancy to sustain it.Assaf Dayan and Akim Tamiroff have been highly engaging actors, but they are both pretty dreadful here. The film is in English, which Tamiroff speaks with a Yiddish accent (somewhat unsettling, under the circumstances), and which all the others speak as if they had learned it at school in France. Denys de la Patalliere, (""Taxi for Tobruk,"" ""Marco the Magnificent"") directs as if he hadn't learned anything at all. ""Death of a Jew"" is the kind of film that seems to advance from scene to scene not by any inner necessity, but rather because everybody at a particular time in a particular place finds himself at a loss for what to do next.",1973-01-18T05:00:00+0000

There once was a presumption that baseball was structured with such ideal checks and balances that tampering with the code was unnecessary. Obviously, the diamond fathers no longer are sure.

us,The Screen:New Theater Showing 'If IHad a Gun',"New York is the greatest city in the world for seeing all kinds of movies, but it's also the toughest for a movie to survive in. The competition for audience attention is so fierce that, unless a film is a smash hit, it is almost instantly, a smash flop. The costs of theater operations and advertising are huge. Even with the price of tickets at first-run theaters between $3 and $4 each, most films, including many of the successful ones, lose money on their initial engagements.It simply doesn't pay to open the offbeat American film or the unknown foreign film that can hope for a mixed press at best. A few brave souls do buck the systemmost notably, Dan Talbot, owner of the New Yorker Theater on the Upper West Side. Add now the name of Associated Independent Theaters' First Avenue Screening Room, at 61st Street.The new 200-seat house, which opened yesterday with Stefan Uher's 1971 Czechoslovak film, ""If I Had a Gun,"" has an announced policy of showing what are euphemistically called difficult filmsmost of them local premieresfor engagements of one week each. The idea is to keep the overhead low and the quality high, in order to provide Manhattan audiences with the opportunity of seeing films that might otherwise be missed even in this city, the best of all possible movie-going worlds.The intent, which is noble, is gently and honorably defined in the Screening Room's first attraction, a small, mostly comic memoir of a 15-year-old boy in a Czechoslovak village during the last months of the Nazi occupation. The film is full of memories, including at least one that is not entirely happy: the World War II period recalls so many other films made in Eastern Europe in the postwar, prethaw, Stalinist years, when the only safely noncontroversial subject was the German occupation. More specifically, it recalls other Czechoslovak films made before Alexander Dubcek's brief, brilliant Prague Spring.Like Ivan Passer, Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel in their early work, Stefan Uher, the 42-year-old director of ""If I Had a Gun,"" speaks around and through a screen of official blandness. He has not, admittedly, packed his film with coded messages, with disguised slices of political or social satire. However, the sort of humaneness and wit that the film deals in are muted but real reminders of other freer times and places.""If I Had a Gun"" is the story of Vlado (Marian Bernat), an intelligent, cheerful boy whose fantasieswhich we share in the film's funniest momentseventually overtake the reality of the humdrum life in his village. Near the occupation's end, Vlado's comic dreams of heroism and yengeance are realized, though with the addition of the kind of terror and sorrow we usually eliminate from our dreams of glory.The film is not, however, especially sad, though its fine, short-focus, black-and-white photography would seem to evoke that mood in this era when almost everything is shot in color. Instead, it has the elegiac tone of a diary that is being read years after the events recorded and that makes no particular differentiation between the tragic and the comic, which time has somehow made equally important.Thus Mr. Uherquite consciously, I assumedevotes no more time or emphasis to a sequence in which Vlado and another younger boy are caught, in youth's equivalent of flagrante delicto, spying on two older girls who are bathing, than he does to the film's melodramatic, penultimate sequence. Memory has sealed but not erased the original feelings of trauma and desperation.In the film's final lines, Vlado recalls that after the liberation he and his friends returned to school: ""They said we had been lazy too long."" Among other things, ""If I Had a Gun"" is about the remarkable resiliency of children in ordinary as well as extraordinary, situations. The film, the work of a director new to Manhattan, deserves the protection and the care of the Screening Room.",1973-01-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The program called for fun By Norma Skurka,"Architects use the word program to describe what it is that clients tell them they need in a house. From it, they carve out the interiors and design the shell that is the exterior to produce an environment tailored to that family's lifestyle. The owners of this second home in the Hamptons told architects Gwathmey & Siegel that they were an active family with three children who liked swimming, sunning, playing basketball. There would be weekend guests, both children and adults. They would need a room for a maid or overseer for the children. And the owners needed solitude occasionally, a place to be by themselves. It was a complex program, says Charles Gwathmey, yet the house is remarkably simple, a rectangle that honestly expresses the program. The house has few windows on the entrance side. This insures privacy. The back is a wall of windows opening on a dining terrace, deck and swimming pool with views of a pond and the ocean beyond. The interiors are crisply modern. Most furnishings are builtin and the colors are clear and bright. A 35foot skylighted ramp rise through the center of the house.",1973-01-21T05:00:00+0000

The 15th, completed in 1971 and at first touted as an enigma, turns out to be a thinly disguised recapitulation of the composer's artistic life, in the personal genre of Mahier's late symphonies, Berlioz's Symphonic fantastique or Strauss's Sinfonia Domestics. It is neither as transfiguringly grand as the best Mahler nor as banal as the Strauss (to bracket the issue), but it does succeed as do few recent works in sustaining its musical thought over a traditionally symphonic time span.

us,'Under Milk Wood'Arrives on Screen,"""Under Milk Wood"" is the kind of film project that carries failure within it almost proudly, as if to be overwhelmed by literacy were a mark of distinction, even though a fatal one.Dylan Thomas, the Welsh poet who died in 1953, originally conceived, ""Under Milk Wood"" as a radio play, a poetic, plotless memory of life in a tiny Welsh seaport that is evoked through narration and short, occasionally brilliant gusts of comedy, drama and dreams.Although he originally thought of it as something to be listened to, or read, Thomas went on to adapt the play for the stage where, however, it's never quite as satisfactory as many people think it should be, apparently reasoning that the stage needs words and these Thomas provides  by the bushel basket.Too many words, perhaps, for the stage. Too many words, I'm convinced, for the screen. It's not simply the quantity of words, though. It's also their ornateness. They overflow the ears and get into the eyes. Great clouds of them everywhere, like swarms of big soft gnats. They won't stop, and they make the job of the film adapter almost impossible.This business of finding screen images to match those in Thomas's text can be, at best, redundant. At worst, banal, misleading or wrong. ""To begin at the beginning,"" says the First Voice (Richard, Burton), a sort of composite narrator, guide and angel of death who conducts our tour of Llareggub, ""it is spring, moonless night in the small town. . . . "" What we see, however, is night so awash in moonlight that we could, if we wanted, read the small type that guarantees a vacuum cleaner for a year.A little later he continues: ""It is night, dumbly, royally winding through the Coronation Street cherry trees, going through the graveyard of Bethesda with winds gloved and folded, and dew doffed. . . ."" Can any ordinary screen images equal those? Not easily.When Burton urges us, the members of the audience, to look into ""the blinded bedrooms"" to see ""the glasses of teeth, Thou Shalt Not on the wall, and the yellowing dickeybird-watching pictures of the dead,"" there's not much for the camera to do but to try desperately to keep up with the languagebut the language wins.Some of the dozens of characters we meet do come fitfully alive: Mrs. Pugh (Vivien Merchant), a dainty, purse-lipped, dry-fingered bitch whose husband (Talfryn Thomas) meekly fetches her breakfast and dreams of putting ground glass into her omelette; Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard (Sian Phillips), who sleeps with the ghosts of her two husbands and fears strangers breathing all over her chairs; Polly Garter (Ann Beach), the town's gentle-spirited whore who can't Help having babies because she loves them.Less successful, perhaps because he has to handle so many words, is Peter O'Toole, ordinarily a fine actor, as the old, blind Captain Cat. O'Toole's readings are so perfectly rhythmical, his wind so magnificently controlled for long eruptions of words without pause, that he almost put me to sleep.Whenever sleep threatens, however, there is the spectacle of Elizabeth Taylor, a wonder to behold though she doesn't seem directly connected to Wales. She does a short, sort of lie-in, as opposed to walk-on, as Rosie Probert, the whore out of Captain Cat's youth who now is buried in the Llareggub graveyard. ""I've forgotten that I was ever born,"" she tells us toward the end in a lovely Thomas line that recalls the greater simplicity and economy of Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town.""Burton's readings are fine, especially when you close your eyes. Nothing that Andrew Sinclair, the director, chooses to show us does more than complement the text, which often means literalizing it, making it seem smaller, less mysterious, more postcard-picturesque than need be. When Burton tells us that we can hear the dew falling, I had a small panic that Sinclair would show us even that, though he doesn't.Gone is any sense of discovery of language, which, when Thomas was working well, could make one feel very young again, almost drunk with surprise and pleasure. The problem is all those pictures. In a way, Thomas did to words what booze did to him. He shook them up, liberated them, twisted them around so that they took on, if only momentarily, a higher order of meaning. The camera has the presence of a sober-sided friend. It interrupts most of the poet's flights of fancy.""Under Milk Wood"" opened yesterday at the new East Side Cinema, on Third Avenue near 56th Street.",1973-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,"' Innocent Bystanders,' Spy Thriller, Recalls the 1960's","Paramount Pictures has provided film critics with an unusually detailed plot synopsis for its ""Innocent Bystanders."" I've read the synopsis and I've seen the picture, and I still don't know exactly what is going on, or why, through perhaps 60 per cent of Peter Collinson's new movie, which opened yesterday at local theaters. The confusion is probably intentional and not entirely unprofitable. But it results less from the extraordinary complexity than from the general inconsequence of everything that happens in the film.""Innocent Bystanders"" is a spy thriller, reminiscent of the nostalgia-drenched late 1960's, about an over-age British secret agent (Stanley Baker) who has to bring back alive one Kaplan, a brilliant Russian scientist, now defected and living modestly as a goat herder in Turkey. Opposed to Baker are his boss (Donald Pleasence), his young replacements (Sue Lloyd and Darren Nesbitt), a chief American secret agent (Dana Andrews), a conniving Turkish hotel keeper (Warren Mitchell), and an organization of Russian Jews who don't like Kaplan. Baker must also deal with his own self doubts and with a hostage, an innocent bystander (Geraldine Chaplin) who is not what she seems.Indeed, nobody is what he seems. Everybody either has a cover or is a coverwhich doesn't much matter, because ""Innocent Bystanders"" is the sort of movie in which shooting enemies in one scene become drinking companions in the next, without changing sides, and for no better reason than that the screenplay calls here for bullets and there for booze.The actual film-making is never quite as pleasantly casual as the screenwriting (by James Mitchell, from a novel by James Munro). Peter Collinson (""The Penthouse,"" ""Up the Junction,"" ""The Italian Job,"" etc.) is noted for a ponderously flashy technique. But despite its involvement in his silly cinema of obtrusive montage, improbable camera angles and forced perspective, ""Innocent Bystanders"" may well be Col-movie.Almost everything in the movie seems to come from some other movie  from ""One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,"" from a whole generation of hard-nosed disillusioned spy films, perhaps even from ""North by Northwest,"" with its own elusive Mr. Kaplan. Stanley Baker's characterization owes a lot to James Bond and a little to Richard Burton, and although not one of his better roles, it allows him enough dignity at least to keep his reputation intact.But Geraldine Chaplin's performance is so reticent and so appealing as to constitute a small personal triumph. She is saddled with the movie's dumbest sequence (restoring Baker to his long lost masculinity, just by holding hands with him) but she is also granted its only moments of quiet intelligence. She fills these moments with a delicate intimacy that contrasts with everything else in the film and that really does suggest a reservoir of feeling to oppose the lives around her that are wasted in mere action.",1973-01-25T05:00:00+0000

This is true, but the passage of time has added an environmental significance to the details originally picked to give dimension to character.In Ozu's 1952 film, ""The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice"" (another Ozu title to challenge Western patience even when his film does not), the environment that Ozu more or less took for granted, since he always made his films in their own time, seems now to play a more interestingor at least more obvious partin the drama.All of the Ozu films we have seen in this country (""Tokyo Story,"" ""Late Spring,"" ""End of Summer,"" ""Floating Weeds"") have been social comedies, but they have been told entirely in terms of character. More than any of these other films, ""The Flavor of Green Tea"" looks as much like a social history as it does a classic Ozu work.The movie, which opened yesterday at the Quad Cinema 3, is essentially a comedy, what the Japanese call a tsuma-mono, or wife film, about an upper-middle-class marriage, one that has been arranged in the old-fashioned way and now is falling gently apart as the childless couple approach middle age.She (Michiyo Kogura) gives every indication of being a rather mean-spirited snob. Among other things, she sleeps apart from her husband in an awful American-style bedroom that seems to be constructed entirely of chintz.However, he (Shin Saburi) gives every indication of being as thickheaded and boring as she says he is.That is, at the beginning. The revelationthe surpriseof the film is not that they are eventually reconciled, but that they become such appealing characters, touched by a kind of nobility.As important as the revelations of characterto me anywayis the casual picture of the world in which they occur. I am not sure if it is factually true, but I have the impression that more of this film is set in public places, that is, locations outside the home that is the emotional center of any Ozu film, than in the films of his released here earlier.What we see of Japan in 1951 and 1952 defines the time in a fashion I am not sure I would have been as aware of had I seen the film in 1952.It is a world only seven years removed from Hiroshima. Nobody in an Ozu film, seems directly affected by the American occupation, but the American influence is everywhere, in second-hand clothes, in cigarettes, in the liberation of women.The world of this film is more geographically open than those of the other Ozus, but the economy of narrative and technique is practically quintessential. Ozu never wastes our interest on connecting scenes if we can take them for granted. When he does show us a man proceeding, say from one office to another, it becomes important, perhaps as an acknowledgment of time lost or as a sort of film equivalent to the white space between the chapters in a novel.No one shrug or sigh or smile is more or less dispensible than another gesture, which explains why minor characters are so important in Ozu films.One of the funniest and most moving scenes in ""The Flavor of Green Tea"" is the scene in which the operator of a pinball parlor (Chishu Ryu) talks gloomily about his success. ""This is trash,"" he says in effect. ""It degrades the national spirit,"" and then he goes on to remember, as if with nostalgia, the beautiful nights during the war in Singapore.""The Flavor of Green Tea"" is not great Ozu. There are timesespecially in its subplot about a girl who refuses traditional wedding arrangementswhen it is almost formula comedy.No true Japanese formula comedy, however, would punctuate its climactic reconciliation scene, set in the kitchen that the wife is discovering for the first time, with the image, seen only out of the corner of the camera eye, of a can of Wesson oil.",1973-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Five Short Film Dramas Have Lucidity,"There must be poets whose life's ambition is to write short poems. And there have been great composers whose ultimate masterpieces were art songs, four or five minutes long. But nobody aspires to make short movies, especially short fiction movies, if he can make long ones instead. Short movies usually come at the beginning of a film maker's career, when he lacks money and needs experience, and they are a kind of apprenticeship, or schooling, in which he learns the potentials of his craft.Taken at this level, the program of five short movie dramas that opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum is very good and honorable and promising work. None of the films is brilliant, or very polished, or especially innovative. But at the same time, they are all intelligent, and lucid, and technically idiomatic  while avoiding the easy symbolism and pretentiousness of effect that seems the curse of the medium and a particular temptation to young directors.I suppose the greatest virtuosity, at least in concept, belongs to Philip Shafer's ""The Man Who Knocked Me Down,"" which consists entirely of a single 11-minute take from the viewpoint of a subjective camera that goes out for a walk, gets knocked down by a madman on a Greenwich Village street, and then has to listen to his plans for reshaping the world. The concept works very well, partly because John Bottoms plays the madman with enough variety to sustain the film's concentration and partly because Shafer knows just how seriously to take his visual trick.Stephen Witty's ""A Game of Catch,"" a kid's fantasy, and W. Boon Collins's ""Kettle of Fish,"" an adult's slice of unnerving reality, are dramatically the least assuming of the films. Neither seems wholly realized as a movie, though ""Kettle of Fish,"" another Village confrontation, deals pleasantly with its large cast of slightly drunken, vaguely dispirited characters.""What Fixed Me"" is the most ambitious of the Whitney movies. Filmed by Tom Rickman in Kentucky, it attempts to occupy the mind of a sensitive boy, son of a brutish backwoods preacher and of a young mother who dies trying to escape from the father. It is a rather literary film, complete with a cautionary folk song (""Old Dan Tucker"") on the sound track, but good at building a frame of mind out of the process of storytelling.Dick Bartlett stars his own stepmother, Mary Bartlett, in ""The Odyssey of Gloria Twinson"" as the contented, supernaturally ordinary middle-aged proprietor of a small-town gift shop. It is her ne'er-do-well novelist sister Renata (Ann Priest) who messes things up for Gloria, moving in with her, drinking, bitching, and repeatedly playing her tape-recording of their late father's last coughs and death rattle.Renata eventually takes off to do her own thing  cause a scandal, as it happens  and Gloria begins to think she would like to do her own thing too, if only she could figure out what that might be. Gloria and Renata really are originals. And so is Dick Bartlett, whose manner of dry deadpan humor is as good a style for the short dramatic film as any I've seen.",1973-01-26T05:00:00+0000

It's a measure of the imagination of Myrna (and of the film) that she immediately sees Angelo as a knight in shining armorand that Mr. Nebbia insists that we see it too.The way is thus immediately prepared for a film that attempts to honor squareness but ends up by demonstrating it.Angelo has these flat-footed, conveniently coherent dreams that establish the fact that he blames his father for his mother's death in childbirth, nine months after Angelo caught them making love. As Angelo is riddled by Roman Catholic guilt and keeps a plastic Jesus, on the dashboard of his convertible, Myrna fights against the burden of her WASPness. ""Daddy,"" she says on the telephone, ""Why don't you follow Christ's example and give away all your money?"" Myrna, who is always a bit cute, becomes intolerable when given access to a telephone. She calls Angelo late one night to ask, ""Isn't it awful about Abelard?""Mr. Nebbia, the director, and his screenwriter, Arthur Birnkrant, present Angelo and Myrna straight, without humor. They obviously feel affection for a girl who'd say, seriously, that she wants to be married ""in a meadow, by a river, facing the rising sun, at dawn."" If they cared more, however, they might have given the girl the wit to recognize that if it's dawn, the sun had damn well better be rising.Bartholomew Miro Jr. plays Angelo. Erika Peterson is Myrna, and a girl named Ziska is the worldly model who represents the flesh opposed to Myrna's spirit. I haven't the faintest idea if any of them can act.""Life Study,"" which opened a week's engagement yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room, pretty much defines the purposes of the new theaterperhaps too well. It is neither good enough nor strong enough to compete in the commercial market.However, it is the first directorial effort of Mr. Nebbia, whose talent as a cinematographer (""Alice's Restaurant"") should earn him the right to fail publicly as a director.",1973-01-26T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Trick Baby':The Cast,"I don't know what you might expect from a movie title like ""Trick Baby,"" But what you get is the story of a pair of engaging con men who lie themselves to their glory and to their doom, during a couple of fateful days in the grimier reaches of Philadelphia. Directed by Larry Yust, and essentially the work of not terribly well-known talents, ""Trick Baby"" opened yesterday at the DeMille and Juliet 2 Theaters.Both Blue Howard (Mel Stewart) and his young companion White Folks (Kiel Martin) are black, but only Blue looks it. White Folks, son of a white father and a black mother, is so white that he can passmainly as one Johnny O'Brien  and passing is the essence of his game. Folks plays white and Blue plays blackoppressed black  and their victims, their marks, play at economic exploitation with greater or lesser degrees of racist venality.""We got them squeezed between us . . . With your complexion and my brains, the sky's the limit,"" boasts Blue, the prospect of $90,000 inner-city real estate con almost as certain for him as tomorrow's breakfast. But a little later, with the mob after his head, and tomorrow's breakfast likely to be a last meal, if he lives that long, he pulls another cona rather beautiful one, and just for a night's lodgingand confesses that he still needs his calling: ""Lying takes my mind off my troubles.""Despite the crudity of its racial stereotypes, especially its white racial stereotypes, ""Trick Baby"" seems most interesting in its understanding of race relationswhich I assume are at issue in the friendship, almost love, between Blue and Folks. Folks really is white. The film says he's black, and he manages a few soulful turns of phrase, but your eyes and your ears tell you he's white. At the movies, that is all you have to go on. The point is that relations between Folks and Blue are absolutely normal, not very competitive, resilient, and rich in a kind of mutual professional appreciation. The playing of the cons is funny, but very restrained, and the two con men seem to demonstrate viabilityhowever precarious it may be.There are enough things wrong with ""Trick Baby"" to fill a bad review, and yet I think it deserves a good one. Half its characterizations are absurd (the female leads, Beverly Ballard and Vernce Watson, suffer particularly) and the other half are very fine. Much of the spoken rationalization is nonsense, but the physical action is often very true, not especially violent, but exciting.Larry Yust indulges in too much flashy sound montage and in the obtrusive cross-cutting into sequences that seems the curse of the newer movies. But he and Isidore Mankofsky have a lovely sense of place and perspective for the camera frame and, in the slums of Philadelphia, a bleak and fascinating cityscape in which to exercise it.",1973-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Wives in 'Limbo':Robson Views P.O.W. Families at Festival,"If it has nothing else  and Mark Robson's ""Limbo"" hasn't  you might at least expect topicality of a film about the problems facing wives of American servicemen who are either missing in action in Vietnam or prisoners of war. By using something less than the sheerest art, Robson manages to make this story (""torn from today's headlines,"" we are told) resemble any number of dreadful World War II tearjerkers.""Interestingly, however, ""Limbo"" does demonstrate the impotency of so much of the liberal opposition to the war that is now, apparently, coming to an end.Robson is, I take it, a liberal. He certainly was back in the late ninteen-forties when he directed such films as ""Champion"" and ""Home of The Brave.""In that optimistic time, political and social issues were clear cut. War against bigotry was simply an extension of the war against Hitler. It was cosily patriotic. The good, voting liberal had not yet had to wrestle with the unruly, rising consciousnesses of all sorts of impatient groups, with, for example, the new black philosophy that says to hell with integration, we'll do it by ourselves.A lot of liberals lost heart in the nineteen-fifties and sixties. It is not fun being ridiculed by the people you had always wanted to protect. Robson, for reasons of his own, has devoted most of his later career to big-budget nonsense on the order of ""Peyton Place,"" ""Von Ryan's Express"" and ""Valley of The Dolls."" Watching ""Limbo,"" you can speculate why.The mind that made it is, I suspect, outraged by the war but seems afraid to say so. It is as split in mood as a lot of other people may be split in their sympathies  feeling sorrow for the American P.O.W. fliers, yet overwhelmed by fury with those who continued to go on bombing missions.The liberals protested but mostly with a politeness born, I think, out of memories of World War II, and even Korea, when wars were declared and the stakes were easy to define. There is a similar liberal sort of politeness in 'Limbo,"" which is as obvious in its narrative structure and physical look as in anything that anyone says.The screenplay, by Joan Silver and James Bridges, set on an Air Force base in Florida, is about three wives who are three points of view, good, bad and all mixed-up.The good wife (Kathleen Nolan) is middle-aged, Catholic, the mother of four, faithful to her husband and angry about the war.The bad one (Katherine Justice) is rich, beautiful, Southern, an all-out patriot and so spoiled that she refuses to believe the eyewitness report of her husband's death.The confused one is Kate Jackson, married only two weeks before her husband's departure, and now hopelessly in love with a nice, honorable, out-of-work space technician.The situations are real enough, but Robson entombs them in a lot of bogus domestic complications, photographed and acted in a simplistic romantic style that denies any sense of real topicality and urgency. If Vietnam were a war like any other (which it is not), there might be a small point to this approach.Only occasionally does the film seem to be about a special, very confused moment in history, but Robson tends to flub these moments too, as in the sequence in which three American wives visit the North Vietnamese embassy in Paris. He opens the sequence with some nice old chop-chop music that 40 years ago used to identify a stock shot of wicked Shanghai.Robson's heart is in the right place, but his movie is unimaginative, phony and ineffectual.

More than most painters of his generation in the School of Paris, he was troubled by the fact that his art had become, both physically and spiritually, the possession of what he called a minority of privileged individuals. His political sympathies, which were more or less Communist, harbored a deep concern for what he was unembarrassed to call the people, yet he was acutely aware of the cultural barriers that separated the kind of art he practiced from the characteristic interests and pleasures of the working classes. He felt these barriers had somehow to be dissolved; that modern art hadin some senseto become more socialized and functional if it were ever going to be something more than a private pleasure of the wealthy and professional classes.

In his review Chargaff, who had himself laid some of the groundwork for that discovery, observes that scientific autobiography is a most awkward literary genre. Must such works, he says, give the impression of having been written for the remainder tables of bookstores, reaching them almost before they are published? The reasons for this, according to him, are not far to seek: scientists lead monotonous and uneventful lives and often do not know how to write. Moreover, there may also be profounder reasons for the general triteness of scientific autobiographies. Timon of Athens could not have been written, Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon not have been painted, had Shakespeare and Picasso not existed. But of how many scientific achievements can this be claimed? One could almost say that, with very few exceptions, it is not the men that make science, it is science that makes the men.
