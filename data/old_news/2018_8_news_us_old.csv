The measure was signed into law last year, but labor groups blocked its enactment through a petition drive that placed the measure on a statewide ballot. If voters reject the law,  the momentum of nationwide right-to-work efforts would be slowed after several neighboring states passed similar laws, and after the Supreme Court struck down mandatory union fees for public sector workers in June.

us,"A Dress Is Like a Passaporto, No? Welcome to Pierpaolo Picciolis Valentino","IT WAS THE FOURTH of July in Paris, and at Maison Valentinos fall couture show, revolution was in the air. Inside the ornate drawing rooms of the neo-Classical Htel Salomon de Rothschild were bursts of hypersaturated color, explosive proportions and dazzling feats of construction. Here, a gown that resembled a quivering cloud of blush-pink feathers; there, sumptuously draped, Watteau-esque garments of dusty rose and red silk. For the finale, lightweight, angel-sleeved pliss dresses in tart hues  raspberry, tangerine  swept through, the models adorned with matching floral headpieces made of chrysanthemums and orchids. There was little point in overthinking the assortment of references on display: Molly Bloom and the court of Versailles, Ziggy Stardust and classical mythology among them. Opera coats and dresses were covered in pictogramlike satin piecework depicting Pegasus and Perseus, Leda and the Swan, Europa and Taurus. This was an emotional dispatch from the domain of private fantasy, a swaggeringly exuberant collection of clothes that might make us, too, feel immortal. The show concluded with a standing ovation led by a teary, now-retired Valentino Garavani, who founded the company nearly 60 years ago. By the time Pierpaolo Piccioli, Valentinos 50-year-old creative director, emerged to kiss his wife and embrace Garavani, any lingering questions about the purpose of couture in the 21st century seemed moot, because to ask that would be like pondering what use there is to dreaming, to believing in the impossible.",2018-08-06T09:00:12+0000

Before slicing, visually map out your approach, noting where you want the knife to enter and exit.

Unlike previous speakers  to say nothing of many of those to whom he was now speaking  McGahn, himself a member of the Federalist Society, hadnt attended an Ivy League law school; he went to Widener University, a second tier law school in Pennsylvania. He had never held a tenured professorship or boasted an appellate practice, much less a judgeship, that required him to think deeply about weighty constitutional issues; he specialized in the comparably mundane and technical field of campaign finance and election law. But here we are, McGahn said to the audience, almost apologetically. In 2015, Donald Trump hired McGahn to be the lawyer for his long-shot presidential campaign. Then, after Trump shockingly won the election, he tapped McGahn, who had proved his talent and loyalty during the campaign, to be White House counsel. Trump, in other words, had made McGahns wildest dreams come true. Now, McGahn told the Federalist Society, Trump was going to make their wildest dreams come true, too.",2018-08-22T09:00:02+0000
us,When the Supreme Court Lurches Right,"In 1957, Robert A. Dahl, a father of modern political science, published a canonical article about the Supreme Courts most peculiar position in American democracy. Much of the legitimacy of the Courts decisions rests upon the fiction that it is not a political institution but exclusively a legal one, Dahl wrote. And yet, from time to time its members decide cases where legal criteria are not in any realistic sense adequate to the task. These decisions, among the courts most momentous, turned on vague or ambiguous words in the Constitution, like establishment of religion and due process of law, with precedent and expert opinions on both sides. By making these rulings, the court cast itself as a national policymaker  and in so doing raised a difficult question: When should the justices, unelected figures in robes, reflect majority will and when should they stand for Right or Justice so as to protect minorities from tyranny by the majority?",2018-08-22T09:00:02+0000
