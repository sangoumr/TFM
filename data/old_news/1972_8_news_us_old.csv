us,'Greaser's Palace',"Back in the days when he made movies for $8 apiece and had them developed at Walgreen'swildly sane movies like ""Chafed Elbows"" and ""No More Excuses"" about mother love, war, coping and bestiality, and even when he went comparatively commercial and made ""Putney Swope"" which is still my favorite film about Madison Avenue, Robert Downey billed himself as ""a prince,"" which he was.Though he was financially strapped most of the time, he remained resolutely game in that lunatic way that identifies the aristocracy of fools and moviemakers. Downey would try anything and if it didn't work, or wasn't funny, it didn't much matter because it hadn't cost a lot and he'd move right on to something else that probably would work.Downey no longer bills himself as a prince, and the surprising news this morning is that he has managed to make his ""Cleopatra,"" his ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and his ""Star"" in the form of one big-budget mistake called ""Greaser's Palace,"" which can be more accurately described as Downey's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told."" ""Greaser's Palace"" does to vulgar humor what the George Stevens film did to Christianity: it embraces it with awe and far too many technical resources.The film, which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is the gospel according to Downey, set in a Wild West ruled by a tyrant named Seaweedhead Greaser, who collects taxes, keep his mother and his favorite mariachi band in cages and suffers the constipation of the damned. The savior, who arrives by parachute, is a modest young man in a 1940ish zoot suit who simply wants to get to Jerusalem to become an actor-singer. ""It's written,"" he says, ""that the agent Morris awaits me.""En route he finds himself working miracles (""If ya feel, ya heal""), some of which aren't 100 per cent effective. He ""cures"" one old man who throws away his crutches and announces triumphantly: ""I can crawl again! I can crawl again!""The savior rather enjoys walking on water and is an immense success with his nightclub act, which concludes when he holds up his two bleeding hands, although the agent Morris thinks it's dreadful. In poor taste, really. He's just getting started on a proper show biz career when his father shows up and tells him it's time to go.""I don't want to,"" he says. ""I think I've found myself and I really don't trust you.""I'm afraid that I've made ""Greaser's Palace"" sound funnier than it ever is except in little bits and pieces, that is, in gags that have nothing to do with satire or with a send-up of Christian myth. Downey is no Bunel. He's not even an Alexandro Jodorowsky, although there are times when ""Greaser's Palace"" seems to want to be as intellectually ambitious as ""El Topo.""The film, I'm told, cost close to $1-million, and it looks it, which depresses me even more than its witlessness. Just a few yean ago, Downey could have made a couple of dozen movies with that moneysome of which were bound to be funny, and to hell with worrying about color photography, large casts, location shooting and all the other things that are known as production values.",1972-08-01T05:00:00+0000

But George McCowan's ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!"", which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is a routine Western so perfunctory in its routines that I can't recommend it even to people who, like me, delight in seeing the same thing done all overand overagain.The magnificent seven this time consist of an Arizona marshal (Lee Van Cleef,) a mildly unscrupulous journalist (Michael Callan) and five convicts who the marsal paroles so they can help him defend the women and children of a border town from a band of desperadoes that have massacred all their men.By the time the battle is over, all the right people have been killed (including four of the five convicts) and Lee Van Cleef has fallen in love with the prettiest of the town's new-made widows (Stefanie Powers), and the journalist has also fallen in love and has discovered in himself a sense of moral discrimination. This last has no purpose, but the movie makes rather a thing of it, and perhaps it adds tone to the aura of the happy ending.But the happy ending is a betrayal anyway, signifying that nothing of much importance has happened, despite the 100 minutes and maybe 50 killings that have gone before. Westerns usually deal best with the impermanence of happiness, and ""The Magnificent Seven Ride!"" would have been no exception if it had been made with the conscience and the care for certain ritual patterns of action that it might have deserved.

us,Instant Morality:'Kansas City Bomber' Stars Raquel Welch,"I can see the appeal the roller games had for a movie project like ""Kansas City Bomber."" Fast, loud, tough and violent, they provide an instant morality play with ready-made good guys, bad guys, comic interludes, and with all the incorruptibility of Saturday-night wrestling. They also provide a certain sado-masochistic kick. At least, that seems the case for this movie, in which gorgeous K. C. Carr, the Bomber herself, gets publicly beaten to a pulp, apparently at five-minute intervals, by competitors on the skating track and yet never stops coming back for more.Raquel Welch plays K.C., a basically nice girl, in the business less for blood than for money. She has two problems: the blandishments of wily roller games promoter Burt Henry and the resentment of aging roller games star Jackie Burdette, whose fading light K.C. is expected to replace. There are other problems as well, such as will K.C. ever be accepted as just part of the team, the Portland (Ore.) Loggers, despite her unpopular eminence and her superior dcolletage. But the first two are the important ones, and they suggest the quite stunning simpleness of what ""Kansas City Bomber"" is all about.Jerrold Freedman has directed ""Kansas City Bomber"" with an eye to hard-hitting action and gutsy detail. But I don't think his eye is really sharp enough or fast enough or even wide enough open. His roller-games scenes seem authentic but rather unexciting; and his major stylistic contribution is to indulge a penchant for zooming his camera back, leaving characters trapped behind windows in pretentious and often ludicrous dramatic isolation.At one point he has K.C. get out of a cab, tell the driver to wait, and then waltz off with Burt Henry, and never return to pay the fare. So far as I am concerned, that meter is still ticking.According to the M-G-M press material, Barry Sandler wrote ""Kansas City Bomber"" especially for Raquel Welch as his master's thesis at U.C.L.A. Whether or not he got his degree, he has created for Miss Welch a part for which she is absolutely adequateallowing her both to show deep emotion and to roller skate. No such laurels for Kevin McCarthy, who plays Burt Henry like a man braving out a suspicion that he has butter on his chin.But the film's one incredible performance comes from Helena Kailianiotes, as Jackie Burdette. Slouching sullenly in doorways, staring moodily into space, cadging booze from a bottle hidden in a skating boot, she goes to the dogs with an inappropriate passion rich enough to suggest an over-the-hill Sarah Bernhardt being traded off to the minors by the Comdie Franaise.""Kansas City Bomber"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.",1972-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'New Centurions':Police Patrol and Fate Make for Melodrama,"Richard Fleischer's ""The New Centurions"" is an intermittently exciting, sometimes preachy, sometimes ironic, occasionally successful film about the lives of some fictional patrol-car cops on the Los Angeles police force. Loosely based on the Joseph Wambaugh novel of the same name, it is an awkwardly modern movie. Modern not so much in its attitudes toward cops (which are really pretty traditional) as in its attitudes towards fate.Thus, when one young policeman on duty turns to another and announces excitedly ""I'm getting married!"", anybody who has ever seen a movie knows what must happen. But what actually does happen is that within five minutes that other cop is shot to deaththough in fairness to established plot devices I should add that he also was thinking of getting married and that he was, more or less, the hero of the film.Somewhere, not too deep, inside ""The New Centurions"" is the soul of an old-fashioned B-movie police-force melodrama; the kind with a rookie cop and a kindly old sergeant and perhaps the sergeant's daughter. The traditional roles are much attenuated but they are there in Roy (Stacy Keach), the young patrolman; Kilvinsky (George C. Scott), his philosophic partner, about to retire; and Lorrie (Rosalind Cash), who comes along with the right proportion of sex, warm human values and chicken dinners just as Roy seems ready to go off the deep end because of a divorce, loneliness for Kilvinsky and a lost sense of vocation.Lorrie happens to be black, and she's not the sergeant's daughter, but she does belong to that particular world of hearth and home, of something to be protected, that has always been the moral anchor of the police movie. That she and what she represents have scarcely more than anecdotal importance in ""The New Centurions"" suggests a partial rejection of some values; and the film has nothing really to take their place. Between Roy and Kilvinsky there is much talk about the end of law and order (the film's title includes an analogy with the decline of ancient Rome), but no dramatic sense of what that might mean.Compared with a real law-and-order tragedy, like Don Seigel's ""Madigan"" (1967), ""The New Centurions"" seems an oddly cold and unimpassioned construction. Its adventures are sometimes interesting (there is a fine, brief bank robbery sequence), but they are more often dully exemplary or merely gratuitous. I have rarely seen a movie in which so much could have been cut out without changing anything, and it is difficult to care about an action film that has no ideas about its events.Fleischer's direction is technically adequate and emotionally absent. He does not so much direct actors as provide a void for them to filland among the principals, George C. Scott is almost shamefully good at filling voids and Stacy Keach is not. But it is possible to develop some sympathy for Keach, striving for a plain unmannered performance and impeded half the time by a pair of glasses and a little mustache that make him resemble nothing so much as a younger, trimmer Richard Attenborough.",1972-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'La Salamandre':A Swiss Import Evokes an Age of Discovery,"Alain Tanner's ""La Salamandre,"" the Swiss film (French dialogue with English subtitles) that opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, was made in 1970 but it takes us back to the early 1960s.' In those days we could discoverat our own speed and without hysteriathe works of Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol and others at those small Manhattan theaters that hadn't yet been pre-empted by Paramount, M-G-M and the rest.Economics were different then. To survive, movies didn't have to be ""Godfather"" blockbusters or even unequivocal critical hits. As filmmakers could experiment, so could the distributors who released their films. Some went bust, of course, but some were lucky, and there was a remarkably consistent flow of unusual European films to supplement the more commercial American and English movies.""La Salamandre,"" which the Museum of Modern Art showed earlier this year in its New Directors series, evokes that age of discovery. Here is a marvelous new film by a director not yet known in this country (and thus not yet defined by reputation and the dogma of critics), acted by three young performers whose brilliance may be as much a reflection of their anonymity as of their talents.Because the director and his actors carry no baggage, no labels, no associations from earlier films, they can demonstrate in rare, witty, free-wheeling form what ""La Salamandre"" is all about, namely the quite dumbfounding nature of truthif, after all, there is such a thing.The setting is an unidentified Swiss city, which, in addition to being a location, is a state of mind, a totally normal, peaceful place that runs with the logical predictability of, well, a Swiss movement. Pierre (Jean-Luc Bideau), a journalist, and Paul (Jacques Denis), a writer who has higher aspirations but supports his wife and child by being a house painter, accept a commission to write a television script about a real-life event that, several years before, had made a couple of headlines and then fizzled out.The object of their inquiry is Rosemonde (Bulle Ogier), a pretty seemingly phlegmatic girl who may or may not have tried to kill her uncle with his old Army rifle. The uncle swore she did. She swore that she didn't, that he had accidently shot himself. Because there were no witnesses and because the uncle did not die the case was dropped.""La Salamandre"" is the story of an investigation that concludes in very un-Swiss confusion. Pierce undertakes to do the research, seeking out the uncle, Rosamonde's friends and finally Rosamonde herself. Paul abhors facts, and prefers instead to exercise his novelist's imagination.For a small fee, Rosemonde, who has been working in a sausage factory with no great esprit, agrees to cooperate. She answers all questions freely and even has desultory affairs with both, but the better the writers get to know her the more mysterious she seems, until at last she becomes practically transparent, someone whose existence is felt while she remains beyond understanding, in effect, unseen.At the same time, Rosemonde is the mythical salamander who lives in fire, not only unburnt but, to the bafflement of Pierre and Paul, also blissfully unperturbed.Tanner's method is clear-eyed and factual, almost dead-panned, growing ever more so as Pierre and Paul find themselves increasingly at a loss with their subject. Its sense of comedy reminds me of both Truffaut (""Jules and Jim"") and early Godard, whose love for the young Anna Karina in ""Vivre Sa Vie"" and ""Bande  Part"" is recalled by Tanner's fascination with Miss Ogier. She is sometimes beautiful, sometimes brilliant, sometimes a slob, sometimes beyond mortal comprehensionand always infinitely appealing. She is a woman loved.Some of these recollections of the French filmmakers in the sixties are prompted by the look of the film (fine, no-nonsense black-and-white photography that could be Raoul Coutard's), and by the narrative style, but ""La Salamandre"" is a tough, funny work that acknowledges those masters without aping them. It's an original.",1972-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Twelve innings and almost three hours later they were still waiting for the run in the bottom of the 18th which gave the Mets a 32 victory and cleared the field for heraldic pomp. When the small astronaut was declared the winner, he was the last to know, for by that time he was asleep in his mother's arms. This was heartening evidence that although the fortunes of the Mets have been failing, no cracks are showing in the patient fortitude of their followers. For staying power, the clientele of Payson Place has been an example for all of baseball ever since the club set up shop on Long Island. On May 31, 1964, a hardy band sat through the first game of a doubleheader with the Giants, which was concluded in an unremarkable 2 hours 29 minutes; after a suitable interval for meditation, prayer and hot dogs with mustard, the customers returned to their seats and some stayed put for another 7 hours 23 minutes, or until San Francisco won the second game, 86, in 23 innings.",1972-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,"'4 Flies on Grey Velvet,' Suspense Film","""Four Flies on Grey Velvet,"" is the third suspense thriller from Italy's Dario Argento. It has striking, imaginative color photography and deep-freeze pacing and atmosphere. But they're simply not enough, even in such a classy, handsome production.The plot and dnouement are not only old but farfetched, and the dialogue is banal. The characters are generally a flabby lot, ranging from young urban jet-setters to scruffy bohemians.Nor are the performances of Michael Brandon, as the jittery, badgered hero, and Mimsy Farmer, as his wife, especially compelling, though Miss Farmer does handle one scene brilliantly. Mr. Argento injects some sourly wry humor with the appearance of a fluttery private detective, an admitted homosexual and sleuthing flop, played by Jean Pierre Marielle. The nearest thing to sensibility and balance is a raffish sage alertly underplayed by Bus Spencer. And Francine Racette, as the hero's pretty mistress, does well in one scene of whimpering terror.A spine-tingling sequence of a doomed, blackmailing servant trapped in a park at dusk is superb and typifies Mr. Argento at his chilling best.In the guesswork department, Mr. Argento and his two writer colleagues simply aren't fair. All that circuitous teasing and those red herrings don't produce a shred of real evidence to nibble on. You're on your own, in pure hit-or-miss speculation.Furthermore, except for one brief segment cueing in the title (a ""scientific"" conjecture nobody will swallow), where on earth are the police? With four murders clearly leading to the hero's doorstep, his unguarded attractive residence (apparently in midtown) should be blazing with lights. Instead, Mr. Argento seals it off, in shadows and eerie sounds, like a Wuthering Heights.But you'll hang on, we guarantee, to see and hear the culprit at the end. There, emphatically, M. Agento has us.",1972-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,'Super Fly':Ron O'Neal Has Lead as Narcotics Dealer,"""Super Fly"" is the story of Priest, a successful black New York narcotics dealer who decides to quit the businessand does it. To finance his retirement he means to deal $300,000 worth of cocaine into a $1-million profit, and so ""Super Fly"" belongs in the company of all those crime movies that have had as their subject the one big last job.That it does not also belong with those movies portraying the evils of drugs, must be the result of very intelligent calculation; for there is no moralizing, not even the subtle silent kind, and the film's most eloquent spoken passage is given to Priest's partner when he defends dealing as a way of life.""Super Fly"" is almost exclusively an action movie, but with the distinction that all the action means something, and is not simply a lot of running or driving or flying around for the mechanical titillation of the customers. The film's gut pleasures are real, and there are a lot of them. But, they always connect with one another in a world so precisely, cruelly, excitingly balanced that there is no movement without countermovement, no pressure without a greater pressure in return.It is a world of the most limited optionsall leading to the question of being in or getting out. For Priest merely to win some time to make choices, he must engineer an escape that inevitably creates a prison for somebody elsethe bad guy as it happens, the Man, the biggest dealer of them all. But a feeling for absolute and fateful interdependence has always been the special glory of the best crime movies. The world of ""Super Fly"" may be hell, but it also makes sense.Tall, handsome, with flowing hair and coat, with flashing eyes, and with a gold cross around his neck that he uses to sniff his own cocaine, Priest must embody a lifetime of fantasies, with his mammoth car, his apartment downtown, his rich and elegant women. Ron O'Neal lives the part with a kind of furious authority that is sometimes excessive; more often expressive of a role that belongs as much to current myth as to reality. Carl Lee as his treacherous, timorous partner is even more impressive, partly because he speaks, whereas Priest mostly acts, and he happens to get the best lines.It would be possible to fault ""Super Fly"" almost scene by scene for its minor blunders. As a director, Gordon Parks Jr. shares with his celebrated father a difficulty in managing simple exchanges between actors, a tendency sometimes to misjudge camera placement, an occasional weak reliance on handsome cinematography. But he has gotten so many more important things right and, in his first feature, he has made such a brilliantly idiomatic films, that it would be ridiculous to do less than praise him.""Super Fly,"" a very good movie, opened yesterday at the Loew's State I and Loew's Cine theaters.",1972-08-05T05:00:00+0000

A mature couple, they planned their retirement residence on the experience of years of living in one inconvenient house after another. A few goodsized rooms all on one level that could be easily maintained this was all they cared about. And they got it (and more, too) in this elegant house with restrained modern lines designed by architects Kroeger Perfido. It's a rectangle linked to an octagonal pavilion with windows that open on a panorama of upper Man hattan and the Hudson River. The house sits in the midst of woods. The manicured lawn is only 40 by 60 feet, deliberately limited to keep it manage able so that keeping up the grounds would be a pleasure, not a chore. No stairs to climb was a must to the clients so the architects placed the living room, dining area, kitchen and master bedroom off the spacious hall way linked to the front entrance. Grown children weren't forgotten, however. At the back, the house is twostories high; the lower level con tains a garage, three guest rooms, each with bath, for visiting children and grandchildren. That level can be closed off; the upper living floor is a selfsufficient unit. To heighten the feeling of spaciousness, the same materials are used throughout the up per level. The slate floor of the entry (above) continues into the dining area (top left) and kitchen (center). The redwood paneling of ceiling and walls also covers the kitchen cabinets.

In the same category falls the concert review by a British critic in The Guard ian net long ago, which mentioned an excellent performance by the City of Birmingham Orchestra of Britten's Lazy Luminations. Mortifying though this must have been for the critic to read the next day, he must have been con soled somewhat by the realization that many readers would assume that Brit ten actually had written such a piece. And a few others would not only un derstand that he had referred to the song cycle, Les Illuminations, but that nowadays one of the critic's occasional hazards of employment is having to dic tate reviews by telephone.

us,The Screen: Russian 'Until Monday':Urban School Scene of Sentimental Film,"Stanislav Rostotsky's ""Until Monday,"" which opened last week at the Regency Theater, deals mainly with Thursday and Friday in a large urban Russian school. The school includes grades 1 through 12, but the film is mostly concerned with the students of one upper-class-home room, and with their teachers.Especially, it is concerned with the history teacher (Vyacheslav Tickhonov) and the pretty English teacher (Irina Pechernikova), who is probably in love with him as he is probably in love with her  but on both sides in a love so unspoken you can scarcely distinguish it from very sincere admiration.What does get spoken, by way of classroom confrontations and extracurricular interludes, is a series of moral positions mildly favoring: freedom over restraint, the individual over collective society, passionate historical failure over expedient historical success, poetic feeling over practical thought. This is a partial list and, of course, abstracted  but from a context, that rather invites abstractions.That context really has less to do with academic high school than with the academic traditions of Russian cinemato which ""Until Monday"" is a fairly orthodox, by no means unattractive, addition. I equate the orthodoxy not with the film's sentiments, which are largely libertarian, but with its dramatic methods, which determine that no generous desire shall go ungratified; every wayward impulse shall receive sympathetic recognition.Thus each of the film's crisesthe history teacher's crisis of conscience, a prize student's crisis in self expression, the English teacher's crisis in keeping discipline while maintaining rapport with her class, and many, many more  engenders its own solution and its own personal revelation. With epiphanies coming virtually at 10-minute intervals. ""Until Monday"" has a hard time keeping its spirits down. And yet it does. And a slightly depressed, slightly theatrical world-weariness, despite all the temptations to optimism, is really the film's happiest quality.I liked the history teacher and the young English teacher, and a middle-aged teacher of Russian literature (Nina Menshikova) who after 20 years in the profession gets a bouquet of three chrysanthemums and a brush-off from a class full of kids she doesn't understand. The kids are all uncredited, but some of them are fineas is the history teacher's old mother, who waits at home and cooks his meals and passionately watches him eat his soup.",1972-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Koestler's brief argument runs roughly as fol lows: The fact that human infants are born with thick skin on the soles of their feet casts at least a ray of doubt on neo Darwinism(!); the rays of doubt that once fell upon Newton's view of the universe have exploded into the light of modern quantum physics; modern quantum physics lends a certain plausibility to paranormal psychological phenomena; therefore the In heritance of Acquired Characteristics ought perhaps to be given the same credence that now surrounds parapsychology.

us,Screen: 'Brother Carl':Susan Sontag Film Is at the New Yorker,"""Brother Carl"" is Susan Sontag's second movie. But it is the first movie in which she seems to see film as a means to life rather than as a repository for ideas. ""Duet for Cannibals"" (1969) really dealt with a kind of rarefied mental cannibalism. In a very open way, ""Brother Carl"" really deals with human relationships.Two women, Karen and Lena, visit an island, a Swedish resort, where Lena's ex-husband, Martin, lives in comparative seclusion with a mentally disturbed ballet dancer named Carl. Carl is brother by guilt rather than blood, for Martin is somehow responsible for his breakdown, and Carl, who totally depends upon him, regards him as an enemy.Lena is young and full of life, and to some extent ""Brother Carl"" is the story of how she offers her life, first to Karen, then to Martin, and finally to Carlbefore committing it in total and apparently wasteful sacrifice. Karen is older and very tired, and to some extent the film is the story of how her life is saved by the enigmatic Carl, who forms a bond with her own desperately withdrawn young daughter, Anna, and effectively brings the girl out of her private distances and back into the world.I have greatly simplified the story, which is very complex and full of symbolic event and confrontation, and which is also a little foolish. In a sense, ""Brother Carl"" is all about learning to give, and its climactic ""miracle"" (Miss Sontag's word) is essentially to evoke laughter from a little girl. These suggest sentiments worthy of Hollywood in the 1930's and 1940's, but that Miss Sontag is willing to treat them openly and seriously is, paradoxically, perhaps her greatest source of strength.There are a directness and an awkwardness of gesture and of larger movement in ""Brother Carl"" that count among its most attractive qualities, and that go a long way to compensate for its occasionally strained pretensions. It is a very imperfect film, with one bad performance (Genevieve Page as Karen) and several performances that seem to have been directed toward an excessive inexpressiveness.But I think that it indicates the taking of considerable imaginative and emotional risks, as ""Duet for Cannibals"" did not, and the result is a real movie.""Brother Carl"" was filmed in Sweden with an English-language sound track. It opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater.",1972-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Can man improve . . .,"The current scare about the dwindling natural landscape seems to be having constructive repercussions. Never has the public been more aware of the fragility of our natural landscape and that awareness has become a concern that is having an impact. Landscape architects and their clients are coming to realize that nothing can compete with the beauty of untouched nature. And more and more landscape design is involved with capturing, or recapturing, the look and the texture of the scenic beauty of the forest glen, the open meadow or the craggy wind swept sand dune. Beside the new ap preciation of unspoiled land, there are other reasons for the growing popu larity of the natural look. Everyone wants a beautiful setting for his home; he is also appalled at the cost in money and time of keeping up the grounds. Natural landscaping cuts down on much of the work. And there's another benefit: Settings pat terned after nature usually improve with the passage of time when nature has added her own brushstrokes to the beginning that man has provided. Much of today's landscaping simply helps nature alongfor instance, planting ground covers and plants that will thrive in the particular con ditions of soil, climate and humidity. And this is not only true of the for tunate few who can afford profes sional landscaping. Much of today's resistance to the ubiquitous housing developments, is a reaction to the stark, unrelieved quality of the final productrow after row of tickytack houses withsometimesa few ever green shrubs to mask the foundations. If the houses were unobtrusively land scaped into the trees or obscured by lush plantings, the developments would appear much less like scars on the landscape. Landscaping can cover a multitude of man's sins and soften many an architect's wellintentioned mistake. We hardly need more talent from architects in building good houses, but what is desperately needed is the integration of these houses into their settings. Landscap ing holds the answer to repairing some of the damage of overdevelopment and restoring the plenet's greenery.",1972-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Well, relax. The seventies' styles are gentle. The chemise now ranges from figureskim ming shifts to soft tentlike smocks. The loosening up of the silhouette is a welcome relief to many women after years of bodyclinging clothes. Not only can they breathe again (there's nothing more comfortable than waistless dress) but they can breathe in style. Also, it's an elegant vote toward the return of the long lost dress. Just look at that evening dress on the opposite pagesoft, flowing and waistless in parchment color rayon jersey. Smocklike, yet ethereal, it has an elasticized neckline that can be worn on or off the shoulders. Bou tique Donald Brooks. It's $165 on the fourth floor at Bonwit Teller.

By Chuck Howard, $110, it is at Beekman Place, on the third floor at Bloomingdale's. Her cloche is by Adolfo. One of the most sophisticated chemises is the tent. This camel  colored version in cashmere and Dacron falls soft and loose from very narrow shoulders and is worn over a beige cashmere turtle neck sweater.

us,"Archie Bunker's British Cousin, Alf, Comes to Screen","Admiration for the national character isn't a uniquely British proclivity, but it seems more highly developed, more institutionalized in England than anywhere else. It is also more ambitious, and potentially more fun.As E. M. Forster put it while placing his works beside Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and Blake's ""Song of Innocence,"" to commemorate his own centenary in a 21st-century editorial for The Times of London: ""Like Beethoven, like Blake, Forster was essentially English, and in commemorating him we can yet again celebrate what is best and most permanent in ourselves.""And now, after Forster, after Beethoven, after Blake, comes Alf Garnettas essentially English as any of them, and very permanent. Alf is the hero of ""Alf 'n' Family,"" a movie by Norman Cohen and Johnny Speight, which opened yesterday at the Juliet I. Neither an artist, nor even-quite a thinker, Alf is a man whose opinions are his truest memorial. Of these he has a plentiful supply.The film picks Alf up in 1939 and drops him in the 1970's, during which time the world changesthough he doesn't. A working-class Tory; a patriot; a coward; scorning Hitler, the Pope, ""Lili Marlene""; he begins as a loud-mouth fool and, by simply staying himself, ends as something of a loud-mouth hero.Along the way he begets a daughter, gains a son-in-law, loses a house, hangs onto his prejudices and (the film is cagy about this) keeps his principles intact. There are problems inherent in presenting a lovable, laughable old chauvinistic racial bigot; and ""Alf 'n' Family"" mainly solves them by looking the other way.Thus Alf says he hates ""coons"" but actually embraces blacks, despises socialism but likes his daughter's Socialist husband, still worships Churchill butwell, whom is there left to worship? By growing firmly out of date, Alf moves into sentimental history. The times have assured that there is all the difference in the world between the braggart idiot on the home front laughing off Dunkirk, and the little fellow more than 20 years later stubbornly holding onto his house despite the urban demolition plans of the Greater London Council.Though it covers a lot of time, ""Alf 'n' Family"" is really a strung-together succession of short, comic situations. (The same characters appear in a British TV series which was the model for the American ""All in the Family."") It follows that some of the skits are good, some not so good, sometoo manyending in a kind of laughter-begging personal embarrassment as Alf discovers that he has jumped to attention without any clothes on, or stuck his foot in hot water or cracked his skull on a window frame.But there are also moments of heart-warming pleasure, such as whenduring war rationingAlf steals milk for his tea from his own baby's bottle. Or, when Alf's wife announces she is pregnant, and the two of them sit in mute astonishment, wondering when the child could have been conceived.Dandy Nichols plays Alf's wife, and Una Stubbs plays his daughter, and they both furnish good conventional British comedy caricatures.As Alf, Warren Mitchell seems to improve as he ages and as he has more detail to put into his role. He is better with such detail than he is with comic invention. But he manages to project beneath his conservatism an undercurrent of sly anarchy; and it is this that allows him in drunken good humor to reduce his daughter's wedding to chaos, or, while praying in church for divine assistance, to cheat God out of a few shillings at the collection box.",1972-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Slaughter' Opens,"Except as another instance in the continued misuse of Stella Stevens, a talented and beautiful actress, there is almost nothing of interest in Jack Starrett's ""Slaughter,"" which opened yesterday at several New York theaters.""Slaughter"" is a sex-and-violence melodrama  with heavy ambitions toward violenceabout a black ex-Green Beret captain who begins by seeking revenge for his father's gangland murder in Cleveland and ends by more or less demolishing half of Central America for the F.B.I., or the C.I.A., or the I.R.S.or whatever Government agency is supposed to be making use of him. Between that beginning and this ending there is a partly incomprehensible plot that allows Slaughter to travel a bit and that involves him romantically with Miss Stevens and dangerously with many very bad people.All the bad people die; most, 100 or so, shot by Slaughter. And they die poorly. I don't mean that in a moral or religious sense; I mean that they tend to double over before a shot is fired or that, when shot, they obviously leap rather than fall from their rooftop perches. Such sloppy stunt work, combined with the director's penchant for visually distorting his climaxes by means of an an anamorphic lense, gives the film a kind of haphazard pretentiousness that seems exactly the wrong disposition of an action movie.As the principal bad guy, Rip Torn plays as if evil were his only vocation. For the Creature from the Black Lagoon this might be a good characterization. Jim Brown plays Slaughter as if he hated doing it, which is to his credit. Among other indignities, he is subject to racial insults on the order of ""Just who do you think you are, boy?""which put ""Slaughter"" perhaps five years behind current fashions in movie bigotry.",1972-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Let's start a campaign here and now.This sprightly, clever and hilarious treatall that a comic strip should be on the screenis even better than ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown,"" which began the series. And wise parents who have been praying for something right for the youngstersneither tame nor icky-pooshould light out immediately for the Guild Theater. The children, with their intuition, probably have already started running.The difference between the two pictures, both written by Mr. Schulz, is the emergence this time of Charlie's flop-eared pet beagle, Snoopy, and his own tiny yellowbird chum, Woodstock, in full glory.What a pair! Yes, they might not make bad public officials with their frisky energy, nimble sagacity and knack for handling intolerance, the human kind. This go-round they skip off to comfort Snoopy's original owner, a cute little hospitalized blonde named Lila.Meanwhile, back at home, Charlie and his playmates learn the worst about the supposed foundling. ""Charlie,"" yelps one lad in horror, ""you've got a used dog!"" Which owner will Snoopy and Woody pick, that's the question. Find out for yourself, young and young at heart.The unfrilly animated backgrounds glow in pretty pastels, the comic-strip figures move as though ""Peanuts"" had come to life, and the bouncy, tender flavoring is further enhanced by some really nice tunes. One waltz, ""Do You Remember Me?"", is beautiful.Most of the time you'll smile or chuckle. The funniest sequence has a disgusted Snoopy being given the stray-dog treatment by a cheerful, blundering little brunette, who collars him and slaps him into doll's clothes, ""I think I'll name you Rex,"" she gushes. Snoopy thereupon gags, seconded by Woodstock. One banquet send-off scene, with Snoopy, his master and his friends bawling over beribboned boxes of bones, is a riot.You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

Finally, in the acoustics department, the language is aggressively monotonously ""with it""filthy.The rest is strictly O.K. With a good cast headed by Calvin Lockhart and Rosalind Cash, eagled-eyed direction by Hugh A. Robertson and a nimbly turned script by Lonne Elder 3d, ""Melinda"" is an engrossing tingler.In ""Play Misty for Me,"" Clint Eastwood had his hands full as a white disk jockey fending off a pretty psychopath, Mr. Lockhart, at the same post, spins off trouble from all directions as a black celebrity. Mysteriously framed for the slaughter of two girls, he finally tangles with the slimy chief of a crime syndicate, who is white and as slimy as they come.To the credit of the movie, the predominantly black gallery of well-defined characters allots cunning and evil on all sides.

Yes, ""Boxcar Bertha,"" believe it or not. Here is an interesting surprise.Set in the South and Southwest of the Depression years, with old-time clothes and cars, this is the drama of two derelict criminals and sweethearts who finally meet a horrible doom. Does that sound familiar? Well, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" still leads the parade.However, while there is a striking similarity in general content, background, fine color photography and even the use of hillbilly music, the new, more modest film stands curiously on its own.The main reason is the character of the hero, a kind of stumblebum union organizer, whose battered altruism sharply reflects the labor despair of the era, even as he detours into crime and wars on the railroad bosses. David Carradine is excellent in this role. Matching him, as the childlike boxcar itinerant, is Barbara Hershey. Fine, too, as their confederates, are Barry Primus and Bernie Casey.The thoughtful, ironic script by Joyce H. Corrington and John William Corrington thins only toward the middle and the whole thing has been beautifully directed by Martin Scorsese, who really comes into his own here.The picture credits as its source an autobiography by Boxcar Bertha Thompson. I can't vouch for the facts. Bertha was before my time.But this is for sure. You'll be wasting time and money on junk like ""1,000 Convicts and A Woman."" Subtitled ""The Story of A Nympho,"" it has a warden's poisonous, teen-age daughter wiggling around a kind of country-club prison until the joint more or less caves in.

A constant thesis among the many ad vanced to account for this is that the East's cold, wet spring and its effect on ocean temperatures has had some thing to do with the situa tion.",1972-08-18T05:00:00+0000
us,Screen: 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' at Music Hall,"In the dismal history of Neil Simon screenplays and adaptations for the screen, ""The Last of the Red Hot Lovers"" may represent the lowest ebb. I missed ""Plaza Suite,"" but in the other Simon films it always seemed that everybody concernedexcept the audience  got pretty much what they deserved. But nobody deserves ""Last of the Red Hot Lovers"": neither the actors (for memories of past performances), nor Gene Saks, the director (for the memory of at least a few minutes of ""Barefoot in the Park""), or even the writer, whose occasional good ideas and clever lines simply sink into a general gloom beyond his making.Barney Cashman is the lover. He has a wife, kids, a house, a Buick, a successful seafood restaurant and, at 45, a desperate timid fear that life will never offer him any of its illicit goodies. So three times on his mother's charity day at Mount Sinai Hospital, he occupies her midtown apartment and makes assignations. The first is with a sharp-tongued woman, who puts him down. For the second he finds a crazy young theatrical failure, with whom he can't keep up. And the third is his wife's best friend, whose own depressions may one day lead her off the Verrazano Bridge, but never into Barney's mother's fold-away bed.Put them all together, and they make a convenience for a three-act play. They make something of an embarrassment for a non-three-act movie, which adds to them some incredibly misjudged extra materialexternal locations (in Philadelphia, for a New York movie) and scenes from the frustrated private life and thoughts of Barney Cashman.Although Neil Simon is widely thought to be a leader in contemporary kvetch comedy (""the Shakespeare of our time,"" according to Howard W. Koch, the film's producer), the movies that come out of his plays are almost never funny. Bitter, strident, full of the miseries of city living or suburban living or simply living into middle age, they attempt not so much to understand as to exploit a general unhappiness. And, lacking an uncommon grace in performance and direction (which they always seem to lack), they become yelling matches productive mainly of sharp discomfort.There is obviously profit in that discomfort, and a kind of recognition value (like the dark side to a TV situation comedy) and sometimes a kind of sour wit. I can imagine a very hammy production of ""Last of the Red Hot Lovers"" that might satisfy for as long as it took to say the lines. But this movie version strives for a dismal realism that plays under the lines and doesn't even support their potential for theatrical excitement.Of Barney's three women, Rene Taylor (the wife's friend) probably suffers least, having a certain durable comedy style of her own. Sally Kellerman, the waspish vamp, has no business attempting verbal wit. And Paula Prentiss, the girl between, is wholly out of the range of her very real capabilities.I think that Alan Arkin does everything wrong that can be done to the role of Barney Cashman, denying him any hint of ebullience or vitality, and leaving him only a loud mouth, a clumsy manner and an attitude that seems to bespeak a perpetually upset stomach.""Last of the Red Hot Lovers"" opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall.",1972-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Richard Burton as Bluebeard:He Plays Slayer of 7 Beautiful Women Baron Relates Story in Series of Flashbacks,"Even before Baron von Sepper drove off for the day leaving his pretty young American wife with the keys to his castle, she had already heard strange noises in the corridors and found the baron's mother's mummy decaying in a guest-room rocking chair. So she cannot have been too surpriseda little disturbed, maybeto discover that the small golden key, the one she had been warned never to use, opened the door to a refrigerator full of seven dead women, dramatically arranged, whole or in dismembered parts.They are the Baron's six former wives, and one luckless prostitute, who found their way to the freezer (via decapitation, suffocation, drowning and the like) because he really loved his mother and thus preferred to kill rather than consummate his other relationships. This last bit of analysis comes from the American, as, through 90 minutes of flashbacks, the Baron tells her his story; and it is one of several modern variations upon the traditional tale in Edward Dmytryk's ""Bluebeard,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama, R.K.O. 59th Street, and R.K.O, 86th Street Twin 2 theaters.Richard Burton plays Bluebeard, and a cast of international beauties  Virna Lisi, Raquel Welch (as a former nun), etcplay the wives. There is a lot of decorous titillation, on the level, say, of a Playboy center spread, and I guess the real distinction of the movie is that before its ends just about everybody gets undressed  except for Burton and Miss Welch. Among all those bodies there is at least one fine actress, Nathalie Delon, and there may be others. Joey Heatherton plays Anne, the only wife who survives. She is very lovely, and very fresh and open. But for all the use that ""Bluebeard"" makes of her, she might as well be grooming as the 1970's semi-nude answer to Sandra Dee.Seated at his organ, three Great Danes at his feet, a pet falcon perched high above his head, Richard Burton plays the brooding Baron as if ""Bluebeard"" were really another skit for ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* But Were Afraid to Ask."" To a certain extent it is. I have rarely seen a horror film so coyly aware of its own camp potential.

Here they are  Delaney and Bonnie, David Crosby, Graham Nash, John Sebastian, Clarence Whiteall backing up Don and Phil's unique brand of close harmony with encouragement, material, and some mean licks from their own specialized fields. With song by Sebastian, the Bramletts, Jesse Winchester, Kristofferson, and Dennis Linde, the Everlys take a tour of the best of many varieties of country rock, stopping off once to make a point in I'm Tired of Singing My Song In Las Vegas,  and once to render a classic example of the triedandtrue Everly atmosphere in Up in Mabel's Room, a beautiful, haunting, slow latenight ballad about Mabel the essential (hip) lovin lady who teaches boys to be men. Appropriately, the next song vibrates with the crash and twang of pounding rock instrumentation. How could the album fail? Still, it's more than gratifying to see one of the seminal outfits of Fifties Rock and Roll cumCountry boogaloo getting back on the ball and doing it well.",1972-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Bullring's Mystical Lure Reclaims Arruza of Mexico,"In the late 1950's the great Mexican matador Carlos Arruza came out of a self-imposed retirement and began to practice rejoneo, a way of fighting bulls from horseback, and a difficult art in its own right. Riding superb Portuguese-bred horses, Arruza began to appear in bullrings, starting each fight from horseback, as a rejoneador, but making the kill on foot, as a matador. He was again fantastically successful, triumphing finally, in 1966, in the huge new bullring of Mexico City. A few weeks later he died in an automobile accident. He was 46 years old.The events of Arruza's late career were filmed by the American action-movie director Budd Boetticher (""Comanche Station,"" ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond, etc."") in a project that reportedly took eight years. I believe the time span; you can see Arruza's kids growing from childhood to adolescence in the course of the film. Boetticher finished his work in 1967, and there has obviously been another long lapse, because ""Arruza"" opened just yesterday at the Plaza and Murray Hill theaters. It was worth waiting for. It is a magnificent documentary.It is also a slightly old-fashioned documentary, with some tacky passages of real-life dramatization (all involving the Arruza family), and with an intelligent interest in celebrating its subject and what he does rather than ridiculing him, or pitying him, or deploring his life's ambition. Occasionally the film makes jokes with Arruza, and the voice-over narration (read by Anthony Quinn) identifies his driving forces as ego and pride. But it lets the cruel victories of the bullring speak for themselves. And it is supremely reticent in presenting a life cursed by a need to progress always from triumph to triumph, capable of no reasonable conclusion, and perhaps best ending, the man undefeated, in an accidental death that was no part of the life's meaning.In a good recent study of Budd Boetticher, Jim Kitses, the film critic, compares Arruza with Randolph Scott in so many of the Boetticher Westerns: ""like the Scott hero . . . complete and serene when we meet him, the film only recording countless confirmations of who he is."" Arruza even slightly resembles Scottas handsome, but slimmer, more delicate, with the look of an introspective, highly educated scientist or engineer.The look is enhanced by his fighting costume, somber gray or black, complementing the ravishingly beautiful economy of his provocative and defensive movements. But the bull is also beautiful, bleeding from the knife stabs of the rejoneador, tortured by the colorful expertly placed banderillas (an Arruza specialty) splaying out from its shoulders like a gaudy flower of pain. The film makes no humanitarian protest over killing bulls. It couldn't. The terror and the fascination would simply undercut any rational shudder of the conscience.""Arruza"" is not much given to mythologizing, and its interest in the bullring has more to do with the camera's field of view than with anybody's depth of interpretation. And what is held by the cameras of Lucien Ballard and Carlos Carbajal, Boetticher's cinematographers, often in shots of breathtaking duration, becomes virtually an essay in the rewards of seeing clearly and seeing whole. ""Arruza"" avoids almost all false rhetoric, including the false rhetoric of too much plainness. For this, and for the genuine complexities revealed in its spare and lovely style, it may belong among the last great examples of classical filmmaking.",1972-08-24T05:00:00+0000

In fact it is terrible. But it is terrible in such eccentric ways and with such a desire to instruct that I can't deny it certain values, though probably never the values it intended.Christine Button (Joan Hackett) runs an art gallery, and her son, Jaimie (Scott Jacoby), a 10-year-old independent filmmaker, pretty much runs his mother's life. One day Christine meets Peter (Robert Klein), a childlike 33-year-old independent guided-tour leader, who hustles her into a guided tour of Manhattan, and, after a whirlwind courtship, marries her.Distraught, Jaimie regresses, gives up moviemaking and begins playing with his electric train. Peter wants to be friends, but Jaimie will have none of him. Jaimie tries suicide, with no luck, and, as an act of revenge, tries making love to his baby sitter. She is quite willing, but Jaimie is only 10, and the resulting failure wounds him deeply. With desperate skill he plans Peter's murder. The plan works but for the wrong victim, and, helplessly, Jaimie stands by as his mother is incinerated in flaming coils of his own 8mm film stock.The source of Jamie's anxiety is a puzzle. An early flashback seems to indicate that it might somehow have been overstrict toilet trainingthe first toilet-training flashback I have ever seen in a movie. But later on we learn that his being born (by natural childbirth) was such a joy for Christine that it may also have been a sexual experience for himand I do believe that is supposed to be why Jamie is so exceptionally fond of his mom.""Rivals"" tends to be very heavy in psychology and a little flighty about lesser matterssuch as plot, dialogue, characterization and the like. Given its situation, it is of course much concerned with criteria of age differentiation. Everyone seems to be measured on a scale running from infantilism to maturity  so we must not be surprised to notice that Jaimie's psychiatrist's office is a place full of oral, for example gratifications. But the psychiatrist is played by James Karen, an actor probably best known to New Yorkers for his recent television commercials advertising Pathmark food stores.

Two hundred years pass, and in a Los Angeles warehouse holding a shipment of Transylvanian antiques sits Mamuwalde's coffin with the prince still insidewaiting, undead, not a bad sort really, but cursed.So begins the story of William Crain's ""Blacula,"" a new and probably inevitable look in vampire movies, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and Juliet 2 Theaters.Mamuwalde (William Marshall) escapes his coffin and makes his entrance into Los Angeles society. But although personable and polite, he is never quite accepted. Maybe it is his long black cape, or his unavailability during the day, or his curious manner of speaking: ""Please forgive me. I must depart now. I have indeed had a rare pleasure."" (He is off to sink his teeth into a pretty nightclub photographer.) ""That,"" observes a casual companion, ""is one strange dude!"" We can only agree.Mamuwalde's problem is that although he really enjoys drinking people's blood, he unfortunately falls in love with Tina, whose best friend, Michelle, works for Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala) of the police department. The police, of course, are powerless  one even grows fangs and joins the other side  but not Dr. Thomas, who does his research, sharpens his wooden stakes, and brings matters to their necessary conclusion. But for Mamuwalde, while he lasts, there is at least the compensation that Tina loves him too, and she is played by Vonetta McGee  just possibly the most beautiful woman currently acting in movies.Anybody who goes to a vampire movie expecting sense is in serious trouble, and ""Blacula"" offers less sense than most. But it does provide such bits of knowledge as the ""well-known fact"" (not well-known to me) ""that vampires multiply geometrically . . ."", or the useful information that a silver cross will also work against Third-world vampires from emergent African nations.For answers to other questions we may have to wait, perhaps until ""Blackenstein,"" due to open next Christmas.",1972-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Salzburg Connection' Opens:MacInnes Spy Thriller Furnishes the Plot Nazi War Documents Sought by Agents,"With twice too many characters and three times too much plot, the Oscar Millard screenplay of ""The Salzburg Connection"" might have defeated the best of directors. Against Lee H. Katzin (""Le Mans,"" ""Heaven With a Gun"") it isn't even a contest. I'm told that the Helen MacInnes spy thrillers have had an uncommonly unfortunate history on the screen, and ""The Salzburg Connection,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, does nothing to discredit the record.I shall not attempt to detail the plot, but readers of the novel will remember that it has to do with a chest full of incriminating Nazi war documents long buried in an Austrian mountain lake, recovered by a free-lance photographer who is immediately murdered for his pains and whose widow (Anna Karina) is next in line to be eliminated. But an American lawyer (Barry Newman), virtually an innocent bystander, enters the case, and he befriends her and protects her and ultimately makes the chest safe for democracyor, at least for the Western democracies.Among those interested in hiding or unearthing or preserving or destroying the chest are agents of Great Britain, Israel, Austria, Russia, Czechoslovakia (I think), Rumania (I guess), the United States, and some unspecified band of neo-Nazis. In addition, there are double agents and would-be agentsand before the film is into its second half hour, virtually the only interest left lies in figuring out what great power each new inexplicable character is working for, or hoping he might work for, or wishing he could go home and forget.Katzin's direction responds to all this with a program of cross-cutting at times so extensive that you have to strain to remember that every new and disorienting crisis really does connect with part of the actionlast visited maybe 10 minutes of film time before. This does not build excitement; it merely eliminates continuity. But this seems reasonable from a director who in a major sequence can place two men riding toward each other on a mountainside chair lift, one an assassin, the other his intended victim; and by the time they meet, can dissolve all the situation's inherent tension merely by the ineptness of his photography and editing.There seems no point in blaming anything or anybody elseeither Salzburg for its un-picturesqueness or the performers for their general helplessness. The appearance of Anna Karina, the only talent visibly involved, sadly takes me back to the better days of ""Vivre Sa Vie,"" ""Alphaville"" and ""A Woman Is a Woman.""",1972-08-31T05:00:00+0000
