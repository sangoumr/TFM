us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  FYBISH, PEGGY ROMANO","FYBISH-Peggy Romano. On January 26, 1999, at her Manhattan home. Dearly loved wife and companion since 1971 of Stephen Fybish. Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.",1999-03-01T05:00:00+0000

He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year",1999-03-01T05:00:00+0000

Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.",1999-03-02T05:00:00+0000

He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year",1999-03-02T05:00:00+0000

He retired in 1983 and continued service to the company as a director until 1988, and thereafter as a valued advisor. Ever a modest man, he attributed his success to good luck and timing. Mr. Shinn guided the company through a decade of tremendous change.

He was 84. He retained and enjoyed an active role as company chairman until his last day. Born July 9, 1914, in Minneapolis, Mr. Carlson was recognized for his generosity, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit. Known worldwide as the ''ultra-entrepreneur'', he founded the Gold Bond Stamp Company in 1938 with a $55 loan and a desire to succeed. After World War II, the business grew dramatically. Two-thirds of American households saved stamps, and Gold Bond captured about one-third of the market. Mr. Carlson's ''Horatio Alger'' qualities were key to the continued expansion of his business, which has become one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the world. To reflect its global expansion and diversification, the corporation became Carlson Companies, Inc., in 1973. Today, Carlson Companies is an international leader in providing hospitality, travel and marketing services and solutions to corporate clients and consumers. The company operates in more than 140 countries. Its brands employ 160,000 people worldwide and generated more than $22 billion in systemwide revenues in 1998. Carlson Companies brands and services include Regent International Hotels, Radisson Hotels Worldwide, Country Inns & Suites By Carlson, Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, T.G.I. Friday's restaurants, Carlson Leisure Group (leisure travel) and Carlson Marketing Group, the largest relationship marketing company in the world. In 1997, Mr. Carlson was instrumental in establishing a global partnership with Accor of Paris, which combined the business travel interests of both companies under the name Carlson Wagonlit Travel. A 1938 graduate of the University of Minnesota, Mr. Carlson was a staunch supporter of his alma mater. In 1986, he made a $25 million gift to the university, at that time the largest single gift ever given to a public university. To recognize his contributions, the university renamed its school of management the Curtis L. Carlson School of Management. He and Arleen (Martin) met at the university and were married in 1938. Together, the couple was devoted to strengthening family bonds with their children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Mr. Carlson's honors include the prestigious Linnean Medal, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, presented by H.M. Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden; the Viking Baron Award from the American Swedish Cultural Foundation; the Horatio Alger Award; the Swedish-American of the Year Award, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1981; the Town and Country magazine ''Philanthropist of the Year'' Award, 1987-1988; the International Citizen of the Year",1999-03-03T05:00:00+0000

Beloved mother of Emily Prager and Nora Elcar, loving grandmother of Lulu Prager. In her chief career as actress Peggy Romano, she combined outward beauty and grace of movement with a voice ranging in tone from gently poetic to powerfully expressive. Born on September 19, 1929, Peggy was first onstage at age five with her British-born actor father, Charles Romano, in ''The Great Waltz'' and with her actress mother, Mary Ricard, in ''The Old Maid''. As a child, she enjoyed the company of such family friends as Leslie Howard, Ruth Gordon, Noel Coward, the Lunts, Basil Rathbone, Judith Anderson and Margalo Gillmore. Her favorite playwrights and producers were Moss Hart, George Kaufman, and Max Gordon. A teenage star in both ''Junior Miss'' and ''Dear Ruth'', she went from Broadway to California with the national touring companies of these plays, performing in theatres in all 48 states during the 1940's. Married and a mother at age 18, she maintained her stage career less intensively through the 1960's. Peggy's brilliant, inquiring mind, keen sense of humor, and numerous talents were a rare combination. She was a painter of colorful landscapes, flowers and portraits, author of two novels, gifted costume designer, cartoonist, puppeteer and dancer. Her letters, diaries, and tape recordings delightfully conveyed her almost photographic memories of her favorite people, places and events, such as the 1991 solar eclipse at Oaxaca, Mexico, described at her memorial service on January 29, 1999. She cared passionately about her family, her country, and the survival of the earth's endangered animals, native cultures and natural habitats. Her knowledge of archaelogy and history enriched her travels to Europe, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean Isles. In the 1990's, her summer vacations with her husband, Steve, by the tropical seashore of Isla Mujeres, gave her great pleasure. She listened joyously to birdsongs from the trees of Mexico and Manhattan, and the ballet music of Prokofiev's ''Cinderella''. The inspiration she gave to the lives and accomplishments of her two daughters, grandchild, Lulu, and her three husbands-Arthur Prager, Dana Elcar and Stephen Fybish-will always be remembered and cherished.",1999-03-03T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  VON LIEBIG, WILLIAM J.","von LIEBIG-William J., an honored inventor, entrepreneur and philanthropist died on Sunday, February 21, 1999 at Mayo Hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona. Born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, William von Liebig earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Juniata College, a Masters of Science degree from the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Sciences and a Masters of Business Administration from New York University. During World War II, he served as Alternate Lead Pilot with the 8th Air Force in Europe. The operations officer to whom he reported was Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Stewart with the famous 389th Bomb Group. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters and a Presidential Citation for his military service. After the war, he embarked on a career in textile sales and manufacturing which coupled with his interest in medicine, led to the development of Meadox Medicals, Inc. in 1961. Meadox Medicals manufactured and distributed vascular grafts and other devices designed to treat cardiovascular disease. Mr. von Liebig holds 33 patents for vascular prostheses and his inventions have made significant contributions to the field of vascular surgery, particularly to the technological advancement of textile vascular grafts used in the reconstruction and replacement of human arteries. Over the years, he received a host of achievement awards including the Gold Hektoen Award from the American Medical Association, the 1995 Independent Inventor of the Year Award from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Carothers Medal from the Textile Institute in England. In 1991, Mr. von Liebig received the national Alumni Achievement Award from Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. In 1975 he established The von Liebig Foundation which generously supports medical research, primarily for the treatment of vascular and cardiovascular diseases. In 1981, the Foundation established an award for Residents and Fellows to be granted annually to encourage and recognize research among young trainees interested in a career in vascular surgery. The von Liebig Foundation and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute jointly funded a grant to the Lifeline Foundation in 1998 to sponsor the Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Awards for the benefit of vascular surgeon scientists in the early stages of their research careers. The purpose of the award is to support the development of clinician research scientists. In 1990, William von Liebig and his wife, Suzanne, relocated to Naples, Florida. They have continued their philanthropic efforts expanding their mission to affect an even broader population. Together they have supported the arts and education with substantial gifts to Juniata College and, in their community, the Naples Philharmonic, the von Liebig Art Center and the Naples Depot. Surviving family include his loving wife, Suzanne, of Naples, Florida, his sister, Edith Liebig of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, his daughter and son-in-law, Barbara and Bill Thomashower of New York City, and his grandchildren, David and Charley.

us,A New Tack for Republicans,"President Clinton put Republicans on the defensive when he proposed to tap most of the budget surplus in the next 15 years to shore up Social Security and pay down the national debt, not to cut taxes as they wanted. Most voter surveys show that Americans embrace Mr. Clinton's choice. Now, in their first formal response to the President's budget, the Republicans have tried to outdo him by setting aside even more money for Social Security than Mr. Clinton proposed. They would also defer their tax cuts for at least two years. Their new approach is a step in the right direction. But it has many flaws, including unacceptable cuts in Medicare and other domestic spending.",1999-03-07T05:00:00+0000

In this upset, the Democrats were able to capitalize on the fact that the Republicans nominated a weak candidate, were weakened by internal divisions, and were easily pictured as the party of ''boss rule'' in that the longtime party chairman, J. Russell Sprague, would be running the county government from behind the scenes. Mr. Nickerson, with his Ivy League background and lack of association with a powerful political organization, appealed to the better-than-average-educated voters moving into Nassau County. The lesson would seem that if the county Democrats could overcome their internal problems and nominate appealing candidates, they could again win county offices.",1999-03-07T05:00:00+0000

Twenty-three centuries later, two 14-year-old students in Westport may have rewritten a chapter; they discovered an alternate solution to one of the ancient mathematician's classic theoems. During the summer of 1995 while working for extra credit in an accelerated math course at Greens Farms Academy in Westport, David Goldenheim and Dan Litchfield stumbled on an original approach to equal partitioning, a corollary to Proposition 10 in the sixth book of ''Elements,'' the 13-volume work on mathematics that Euclid created.

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION; Ninaninaninaninanina,"Al Hirschfeld sold his first published drawing (of the French actor Sacha Guitry) to The New York Herald Tribune in 1926. The next year, his drawing of Sir Harry Lauder, the Scottish vaudeville singer, was published in The New York Times, the beginning of a relationship that has lasted ever since. As he says in HIRSCHFELD ON LINE (Applause, $49.95), he has learned to draw in the dark with a pencil stub in his pocket, in a kind of shorthand only he can decipher: hair can be Brillo, corn silk or cue ball; eyes can be fried eggs; noses can be dots; mouths can be caverns, dots, slits. Later in his studio, seated in his trademark barber chair, Hirschfeld distills the essence of a personality, be it an actor, a singer, a dancer, a musician, a conductor, a political figure, a comedian or a literary icon. ''Hirschfeld on Line'' contains more than 400 drawings, paintings and photographs, augmented by Hirschfeld's own joyous, illuminating and often droll commentary. Mel Gussow contributes an engaging biography of the artist, and there are lively essays by Arthur Miller, Kurt Vonnegut, Grace Mirabella, Whoopi Goldberg and Hirschfeld's daughter, Nina, who discusses what it's like to be a ''name'' -- her father first introduced his daughter's name in a poster (''Nina the Wonder Child'') that appeared in the background of an illustration of ''Are You With It?,'' an otherwise forgettable musical that opened the day she was born in 1945. ''This little folly was, over the decades, to turn into a monster,'' Hirschfeld writes. ''I am now incapable of discontinuing the process.'' In 1960, he began adding a numeral to his Chinese-choplike signature to disclose the number of times ''Nina'' appeared in that drawing. Finding them, by then a readers' ritual, was also considered (to Hirschfeld's astonishment) by the Pentagon as a means of testing the ability of Air Force pilot trainees to detect targets. A piece on his working methods is contributed by Louise Kerz Hirschfeld, the ''darling wife'' to whom this book is dedicated. Leila Hadley",1999-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,The Trail Boss Was a Rabbi,"Other writers have related the brave stories of Jewish immigrant pioneers who made their way from tiny villages in Eastern Europe to the vast open spaces and new possibilities of the American West, but Ruhama Veltfort, in her impressive first novel, THE PROMISED LAND (Milkweed, $23.95), recasts the tale in a spiritual dimension. She delves into the religious yearnings of a group of travelers, bound together by faith and family, who flee the pogroms and poverty of 19th-century Poland. Here the inner adventure is as striking as the landscape they navigate. Yitzhak, a gentle rabbi with mystical leanings and large visions, heads the group of migrants, which includes his wife, Chana, a woman of quiet piety whose practical bent balances her husband's loftiness; his twin sister, who is able to see his dreams; her husband, whose religious conviction is tested many times over; and a fiddler whose tunes take on American rhythms as they travel. In their ecstatic prayer they find solace, singing the songs of Yitzhak's enigmatic rebbe, whose deathbed message inspired their journey. After a sojourn in St. Louis with some wealthy Jewish merchants whose ownership of slaves surprises them, they set out for Oregon, hoping for freedom and a better future in the western wilderness. Veltfort, who is the granddaughter of the psychoanalyst Otto Rank, tells this story in chapters from Chana's and Yitzhak's alternating perspectives. Their path is filled with violence and loss, but comic moments also lighten the narrative; in one memorable scene, they are introduced to the earthly pleasures of watermelon.

A long-time resident of Scarsdale, N.Y., Dr. Tucker had suffered from kidney failure and heart disease for many years. He was born September 5, 1927 in Brooklyn, N.Y. to Isaac and Belle Cooperstein Tucker, formerly of Russia. Dr. Tucker was an early graduate of Brooklyn Tech, attended R.P.I., and served with the U.S. Army in the Phillipines in 1946-1947. He received a B.S. in Chemistry from Columbia and graduated from Cornell Medical School in 1953. From that time until his death, Dr. Tucker conducted a private practice in psychiatry in the same office on Sutton Place. Long affilated with Payne Whitney, he was an early researcher in the use of chemicals to treat mental illness. During his distinguished career, he was a valued couselor to many prominent people and a source of wisdom, comfort and joy to all who had the good fortune to know him. Dr. Tucker was also a life-long sports fan; his first job, at fourteen, was selling programs at Ebbetts Field, for which he was paid $2 a day. At sixteen, he was a member of the New York All-City Championship Handball Team. In later years, he would often return to the handball courts at Coney Island to reminisce about his year of glory. Over his life time, he grew to forgive the New York Yankees for not having been situated in Brooklyn, and his emotional health rose and fell with the fortunes of his beloved New York Giants. Dr. Tucker was proud of his Jewish heritage and raised his children in his faith. Dr Tucker was also a reader of great acuity, breadth and curiosity; he triumphed weekly over the most difficult crosswords; his sense of humor was that of a true New Yorker. He married the late Barbara Irving in 1957. They had four children: Douglas Tucker, of Berkeley, CA., a forensic psychiatrist, Duane Tucker, of New York City, a database administrator, Holly Tucker, of Berkeley, CA., a research administrator and Randolph Tucker, a lawyer, of Ojai, CA. In 1991, Dr. Tucker married Amy Ellis Tucker, of Bronxville, N.Y., who survives him. He is also loved and survived by three grandchildren, Sam, Alan and Barbara Tucker of Ojai, CA., a sister Gertrude Tucker Weker, of Bethesda, MD. (his other sister, Evelyn Tucker Feinstein, pre-deceased him); a niece, Laurie Weker Lipton, of Rockville, MD. and four nephews, Richard Feinstein of Cranston, R.I., Lester Feinstein of Littleton, CO., Jonathan Weker of Mount Pelier, VT. and Robert Weker, of Winnewood, PA. Funeral service will be on March 10th at Congregation Kol Ami, 252 Soundview Ave, White Plains, N.Y. at 10AM.

For more than a millennium, women's feet and footwear have played a major role in defining femininity. Fifteenth-century samurai warriors picked concubines by their feet, often without bothering to inspect the rest. In 19th-century Edo (old Tokyo), presenting a woman with sandals was the prelude to any sexual relationship. And until about 30 years ago, Kyoto geishas treated favored clients with the sight of their bare feet. ",1999-03-13T05:00:00+0000

She went on to sing 236 performances of twelve roles with the Met. Her most frequent roles were her touching Mimi in Puccini's ''La Boheme,'' and her graceful Susanna in Mozart's ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' Her ability to incarnate youthful, fragile and vulnerable characters while singing with a consistently beautiful tone and great musicality was unique. As charming offstage as she was on-stage, Ms. Sayao was held in the highest esteem by her colleagues and friends in the opera house. She continued to be a strong supporter of the Met after her retirement, and in 1983 became a Member of the Metropolitan Opera Association, a position she held until her death.

us,The Technique of Skim-Coating a Plaster Wall,"PLASTER walls frequently develop a network of hairline cracks that are too narrow to be filled with patching plaster, yet they cannot be covered with paint. The best way to restore the wall surface is by skim-coating it. Skim-coating is the technique of applying thin layers of gypsum-based joint compound over the entire surface. The layers are so thin that even after applying several coats, the total thickness of all the layers together is less than an eighth of an inch. Skim-coating can also be used to smooth a textured surface.",1999-03-14T05:00:00+0000

While it lacks the exuberant tang of ''Wild Meat and the Bully Burgers'' and the wrenching pathos of ''Blu's Hanging,'' her first two novels, HEADS BY HARRY (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24) makes up for that with its own subtle charms. Again the story focuses on a young woman's coming of age ait's about how she learns to balance the sometimes conflicting obligations to family and self. The novel's spirited heroine, Toni Yagyuu, resists her parents' plans for her to go to college and escape the limitations of life in Hilo; instead, she wants to learn the art of taxidermy from her father, Harry O. (The novel is chock-full of animals, living, stuffed and at every stage between.) Toni must also contend with an occasionally adversarial tag team made up of her brother, Sheldon, whose unspoken but obvious homosexuality infuriates her father, and her more beautiful and popular sister, Bunny. On her side, usually, are Maverick, the town hunk, and Wyatt, his angry brother. Toni stumbles from disappointment to failure to heartbreak, all the while trying to convince her hardheaded but not hardhearted father that home is where she belongs. Yamanaka ends the novel, as she did her first two, with a long list of thank-yous. In doing so, she hints at the deep bonds of community and family that inspire her raw, rich stories.

The Goernment based its study on an analysis of assessed property value and market value for more than 11,000 residential properties sold in Nassau between August 1, 1995, and July 31, 1996. It then compared the results with the latest demographic data available from the Census Bureau. The analysis, broken down by census tract in two maps accompanying the study, showed a strong correlation between race and the property assessment rate, according to Zachary W. Carter, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.

''By engaging with their physicality, we partake of their essence.'' The central issue of Velzquez's career was how to reconcile his artistic genius with his desire to attain social status. Brown, a professor of fine arts at New York University, explains in his brief, cogent essay how Velzquez (1599-1660) conquered the royal court of Philip IV of Spain, eventually being appointed curator of the royal collection. Garrido, the head of technical services at the Prado in Madrid, uses techniques like X-ray and infrared images (examples of which generously pepper the text) to show that Velzquez rarely started with a fixed idea, preferring to work by trial and error and invent new techniques as he went along. Eventually, he ''devised a succinct way to reach the desired effect,'' Garrido writes. ''As time went on, he was able to do more with less.''

He studied fine art, his love, at the Maryland Institute College of Art and moved to New York in 1977 to study architecture and design. He designed and renovated many residential and commercial spaces in Manhattan and eventually formed his own company to develop and restore city properties. Fine art remained his first love.

He sponsored several artists whose work represented what he considered to be traditional values, and he worked with the Maryland Institute College of Art to begin an exchange program for art students in the United States and Israel. His mother, Elizabeth Dagani-Cohen, and a brother, Eitan Cohen, survive him. Both reside in Tel Aviv. Mr. Cohen will be interred at the Mount of Olives Cemetery in Israel.

A long-time resident of Scarsdale, NY, Dr. Tucker had suffered from kidney failure and heart disease for many years. He was born September 5, 1927 in Brooklyn, NY, to Isaac and Belle Cooperstein Tucker, formerly of Russia. Dr. Tucker was an early graduate of Brooklyn Tech, attended R.P.I., and served with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in 1946-1947. He received a B.S. in Chemistry from Columbia and graduated from Cornell Medical School in 1953. From that time until his death, Dr. Tucker conducted a private practice in psychiatry in the same office on Sutton Place. Long affilated with Payne Whitney, he was an early researcher in the use of chemicals to treat mental illness. During his distinguished career, he was a valued counselor to many prominent people and a source of wisdom, comfort and joy to all who had the good fortune to know him. Dr. Tucker was also a life-long sports fan; his first job, at fourteen, was selling programs at Ebbetts Field, for which he was paid $2 a day. At sixteen, he was a member of the New York All-City Championship Handball Team. In later years, he would often return to the handball courts at Coney Island to reminisce about his year of glory. Over his life time, he grew to forgive the New York Yankees for not having been situated in Brooklyn, and his emotional health rose and fell with the fortunes of his beloved New York Giants. Dr. Tucker was proud of his Jewish heritage and raised his children in his faith. Dr Tucker was also a reader of great acuity, breadth and curiosity; he triumphed weekly over the most difficult crosswords; his sense of humor was that of a true New Yorker. He married the late Barbara Irving in 1957. They had four children: Douglas Tucker, of Berkeley, CA, a forensic psychiatrist, Duane Tucker, of New York City, a database administrator, Holly Tucker, of Berkeley, CA, a research administrator and Randolph Tucker, a lawyer, of Ojai, CA. In 1991, Dr. Tucker married Amy Ellis Tucker, of Bronxville, NY, who survives him. He is also loved and survived by three grandchildren, Sam, Alan and Barbara Tucker of Ojai, CA, a sister Gertrude Tucker Weker, of Bethesda, MD; (his other sister, Evelyn Tucker Feinstein, pre-deceased him); a niece, Laurie Weker Lipton, of Rockville, MD, and four nephews, Richard Feinstein of Cranston, RI, Lester Feinstein of Littleton, CO, Jonathan Weker of Montpelier, VT and Robert Weker, of Wynnewood, PA.

Now, if the Clinton Administration carries out a well-designed plan to declassify its information on Chile, the details of America's role may be known.",1999-03-16T05:00:00+0000

Instead, they decided, the land should be used for an arts institution to develop a ''new culture'' for the ''new man,'' said John A. Loomis, an author and architect. So, Ricardo Porro, Vittorio Garatti and Roberto Gottardi, architects, designed five schools -- for plastic arts (top far right, as photographed in 1965), modern dance (bottom far right, 1965), music, theater and ballet. These brick and tile buildings, with Catalan vaults (right, 1992), fused Afro-Cuban culture with Hispanic-American and modernist ideas. Mr. Porro's School of Plastic Arts was inspired by the fertility goddesses of Afro-Cuban animist beliefs. It was, he said ecstatically last week, ''a city of breasts.'' But in 1965, construction was suspended, and the schools were opened unfinished. Castro had aligned himself with the Soviet model of standardized buildings.

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says the demonstrations are being conducted ''for a highly partisan political purpose.'' But it is also true that nonviolent sit-ins have become an established form of dissent when communities confront polarizing issues, and orderly protests can challenge elected officials to respond to civic concerns they might otherwise ignore.

She correctly notes that there is tremendous variation in how men and women live their lives but at the same time fails to suggest from what real central patterns the variation flows. The implication that there is no human sexual nature at all, which follows hazily if finally from her argument, is a bizarre cousin of post-modern intellectual nihilism. One would be hard put from her article to suspect that Darwinian theory remains one of the sturdiest in modern science and that its very success provides Angier the platform of data and theory on which she is able to stand.",1999-03-21T05:00:00+0000

The real explanation is that the van carrying the shoot's clothes and accessories was late the first day. Day two, the driver simply didn't show. Fortunately, the clothes had already been unloaded. The van company eventually reported that the driver had taken ill and driven himself and the accessories to the hospital. 2. James Intveld can now add fashion model to his roster of credits as singer, songwriter, actor and producer. Intveld, who has played with Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan, and acted with Sean Penn and Willem Dafoe, refers to his own blend of rockabilly and swing as ''roots rock.'' (a) Charlie Overbey's band, Custom Made Scare, has a little more fire -- he calls it ''cow punk'' -- than its rockabilly counterparts. Its first CD is ''The Greatest Show on Dirt.'' 3. Eddie Nichols started Royal Crown Revue in 1989. The swing band's big-screen debut was ''The Mask'' in 1994, when it played while Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz danced. ''The Contender'' is its latest release. 4. The rockabilly look isn't complete without a black leather jacket. After all, Marlon Brando in ''The Wild One'' would hardly have embodied cool in a corduroy blazer with elbow patches. Vintage leathers from the 40's and 50's can be found at Reminiscence, 50 West 23d Street. 5. ''I've tried everything in my hair, from axle grease to Crisco, and I tend to like Murray's the best,'' says Buster Kretin of Mr. Badwrench, a rockabilly band. Daniel Howell, the hair stylist for this shoot, recommends a similar pomade, Dax Wave and Groom. 6. It's got to be a classy joint if Harry Belafonte stayed there. In fact, the Beverly Laurel Motor Hotel in Los Angeles has been host to several musicians, entertainers, writers, models and photographers. And it's a Lindy hop, skip and a twirl from Swingers, the diner in the same building that offers breakfast until 4 A.M. 7. Pinup girls, daggers through roses, cards, guitars and cars are all typical rockabilly-style tattoos, says Eric Maaske, a tattooer at Classic Tattoo in Fullerton, Calif. ''I do a lot of traditional American tattooing from the 1940's and 50's,'' says Maaske, ''simple designs that are easy to look at.'' But not so easy to get. The process ''feels like a constant bee sting,'' he says. This original design by Maaske, a 90-minute bee sting, costs about $200. 8. On location at Bar Deluxe, where Janice Desoto, the owner, pictured here in her fake fur with Charlie Overbey, was recruited to scout likely models. ''All rockabilly guys are into style big time,'' she says. 9. The photographer Ben Watts, here with Buster Kretin, left, and Chopper Von Franklinstein, right, isn't even into rockabilly music. He picked the style because he admires both musicians and their look. He collects books on fashion cults, and was once a mod in his native England. Odd, then, that he chose rockabilly, which could be considered the archenemy of mod. Watts says, ''I don't care if the music stinks, just as long as you look good.''",1999-03-21T05:00:00+0000

A memorial service was held on February 26, 1999, at the Penn State Capitol Campus where she had been instrumental in founding both the Community Psychology and Women's Studies programs. An internationally known advocate for women and children, Towns also founded PROBE, a non-profit career counseling service for single parents, homemakers, and pregnant teens; it was the model for a network of programs in Pennsylvania. She was the Executive Director for 22 years until her death. A woman of ''fierce decency'' and a consummate educator, Towns was a brilliant effective force for equality in development of the human potential without regard to race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Her stellar career spanned over half a century. After earning a B.S. from Miami University, in 1944, she was a mathematician on the Manhattan Project and then a meterologist in the WAVES. She spent the next 12 years teaching in high schools in Ohio and Pennsylvania. She then earned an M.Ed. and Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from Penn State in 1970. In 27 years at Penn State, she taught a wide range of graduate subjects from multivariate analysis to child development. She authored 121 papers. Among the many awards honoring her dedication and inspiration, she particularly cherished the Penn State Jordan Memorial Award for Teaching Excellence, the Artist of Life, from the International Women's Writing Guild, the first Service to Women award given in Pennsylvania and being designated Pennsylvania Woman of the Year by then Governor Thornburgh. She will be remembered by the thousands of people she empowered including students, colleagues, counselors, friends, and family. She changed lives. Her great spirit and ''yes, do it!'' will live on in heads beyond counting and across many cultures. Kathryn Towns is survived by a son, Michael Starkey in North Carolina, three daughters, Kristin Dukay in Washington state, Rhonda and Ann Starkey, both in Massachusetts, and two grandchildren.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Not Your Average Beach,"There is nothing usual about the guests staying at the Almayer Inn, a seaside hotel ''perched on the last narrow ledge of the world'' and the main setting for Alessandro Baricco's euphoric new novel, OCEAN SEA (Knopf, $23), splendidly translated by Alastair McEwen. In Room 3 resides Professor Bartleboom, who is compiling an encyclopedia of limits, including an entry for where the sea ends. Almost every evening he writes a letter to the as yet imaginary woman he hopes to meet and marry. Ann Deveria has been sent to the hotel by her husband so that the sea air might calm her and induce her to forget her lover. The artist Plasson, a renowned portrait painter, is devoting the rest of his career to painting a portrait of the sea. Elisewin, an extremely delicate girl fading from life, comes to the inn as a last hope, accompanied by a priest who unintentionally says precisely what he thinks. A man known only as Adams, who has ''the look of an animal stalking its prey,'' waits at the inn to commit a murder. And, of course, there is the ocean sea lurking just beyond the threshold of the inn, holding the guests' intertwining fates in its mysterious and musical embrace. As in his previous novel, ''Silk,'' Baricco hypnotizes us with exotic language and erotic entanglements. Only occasionally does his prose seem pretentious. More often, ''Ocean Sea'' is highly romantic and breathtakingly lyrical. Jenny McPhee",1999-03-21T05:00:00+0000

Babatu, the eldest brother and the Amazing Vitas' spokesman, was not the first to meet the photographer Dewey Nicks, flanked here by the Vitas. Nicks learned of the brothers when he met Osei Vita on a photo shoot. As their self-described ''biggest fan,'' Nicks jumped at the opportunity to work with them. For many of the preceding photographs, he was perched high on a giant ladder to capture the brothers leaping on a trampoline. Reaching heights of 20 to 30 feet, ''they were moving really fast,'' Nicks says, ''but their technical beauty was so smooth, it felt like I had a lot of time to get the shots.'' The Vitas brought rap music to perform to, and every time ''Ruff Ryders' Anthem'' by DMX played, they'd stop whatever they were doing and burst into a routine. ''These guys really are amazing,'' raves Nicks. ''They're a dream come true in terms of subject matter.'' 3.

While arms and legs flailed, the Vitas' hair stayed nicely put, thanks to the hair stylists Johnny Villanueva and Jennifer Davis. Davis used, and recommends for braided hair, Dirt from Jonathan Product. Massaged into the scalp, this pomade helps keep flyaways at bay and gives hair a deep shine. For the Vitas without braids, Davis used Kiehl's Silk Groom, which, when worked into dry hair, gives it luster. Davis also recommends that people with braids ''sleep with a silk cap.'' She adds, ''It preserves the braids and keeps the ends from splitting.'' 5. What better to blast what Omari Vita calls the ''hip-hop culture'' sounds of the Vitas' CD, tentatively titled ''Soul Patrol''? JVC's Kaboom Box RV-B99, $330. For stores, call (800) 252-5722. Two of the CD's tracks are ''Chosen 4'' and ''Soul Patrol,'' which, according to Omari, is ''what we do. We patrol the soul.'' 6.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Sublime Science,"Physics makes the world more beautiful. But convincing people with little scientific background of that has been difficult. Now it may become a little easier. The American Physical Society and the American Institute of Physics have co-sponsored a book by Curt Suplee, a writer for The Washington Post, that is the most comprehensible authoritative survey of all of physics for unscientific readers. In 217 pages PHYSICS IN THE 20TH CENTURY (Abrams, $49.50) gives state-of-the-art accounts of developments in physics in the last 100 years, a time when we have learned more about the universe than all human beings before us were able to discover. The thrill of intellectual adventure is palpable in the book, and Suplee makes it fairly easy for anyone to see the vast range of this science by showing how its theoretical and experimental discoveries fit together. In seven short chapters he leads us through the structure and function of atoms, the astonishing intimacy of light and matter, the often amusing improbabilities of quantum mechanics, the architecture of exotic materials, the elusive lives of subatomic particles that are the stuff of all creation, and chaos and order in nature -- until we arrive at a vision of the entire universe. He does it without equations or misleading analogies, and often with humor (yes, the idea for bubble chambers did occur to a physicist looking at a glass of beer). Many of the 220 illustrations speak eloquently about the subtlety of matter, like a photograph of 48 atoms in a circle that clearly reveals particles that act like waves, and others display scientific machines so gorgeous they are almost erotic. Unfortunately, pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope here lack the brilliance and depth of those at the Hubble site on the Internet. And the typography can annoy: the design of some pages is distracting and the type is so lightweight it tires the eye. That said, take a look. The world is more beautiful than you suspected. D. J. R.

This anomaly makes it difficult to reckon years from B.C. to A.D., and impossible to determine whether the new millennium begins in 2000 or 2001. In July a letter arrived, smelling faintly of petits fours and scrod -- it having been forwarded from The Atlantic's Boston offices -- from a Colleen Cullinan, a student at the University of Chicago Divinity School, who expressed her disappointment that I had neglected to mention the contributions of Bibfeldt, the eminent neosyllogistic existential theologian.",1999-03-28T05:00:00+0000

Fourteen years earlier, Aisling, the favored eldest daughter, fled her clinging mother, her institutionalized father (a man stricken with ''the doubting disease,'' obsessive-compulsive disorder) and the four siblings she virtually raised to travel the world, never to return home. The mother, now ailing, asks Keelin, her youngest and most dutiful child, to leave a promising teaching job and search for Aisling. So Keelin flies to Japan, Aisling's last known residence, and follows her sister's circuitous trail through Hiroshima's transvestite subculture, Tokyo hostess bars and finally to Central America, all the while grappling with acquaintances' tales of Aisling as an idealistic hippie, a lesbian obsessed with an African artist, a call girl. Keelin occasionally travels with her likable but troubled siblings -- Orla, an earthy Bronx baker who mourns the son she gave up for adoption; Siobhan, a London fashion maven who battles anorexia; and Patrick, whose compulsive habits have shaped his aimless existence -- and with her uncle, a wealthy, rather debauched Jesuit priest with secrets of his own. While the peripatetic narrative sometimes wanders astray, Martin's wry, trenchant prose keeps things animated. What is more impressive, Aisling becomes a nuanced symbol for the family's lost ideal -- one startlingly refuted by her actual appearance. Keelin's odyssey movingly reveals the harm of clinging to the past, even in the name of family. Megan Harlan",1999-03-28T05:00:00+0000

us,Decades of Work From the Elusive Will Barnet,"WILL BARNET is one of those artists whose work is much better known than he is. It was not that long ago that every other dorm room or young person's apartment was decorated with a poster of one of his familiar images: a languid woman boldly drawn, often paired with a sinuous cat. Perhaps the appeal of these images is that they are presented with great clarity, but still remain enigmatic, and thus endure. Much of Mr. Barnet's elusiveness is dispelled by a satisfyingly full survey of his prints from the 30's to the 90's at the Thomas J. Walsh Art Gallery at Fairfield University in Fairfield; Mr. Barnet turns 88 this year. He was born in Beverly, Mass., and studied, as did so many figurative artists of the era, at the Art Students League in New York. Early on he turned out typical New York social realist works with titles like ''Subway'' and ''Central Park Siesta.''",1999-03-28T05:00:00+0000

Famous as the largest beach on Molokai, and, some claim, anywhere in Hawaii, Papohaku extends for more than two and a half miles. So after unpacking, I had hurried to its edge, only a 10-minute walk from our town house door. I was happily imagining a week of brisk early-morning walks from one end of the beach to another. But when I scrambled down to the soft, deep sand, I immediately sank in to my ankles. Walking on Papohaku, I realized, would be very slow. If I were going to enjoy it, I would have to abandon my usual high-speed pace. That, it turned out, was the best way to approach our week on Molokai.",1999-03-28T05:00:00+0000
us,Hollywood Haggadah,"In America, promotional tie-ins to the Haggadah, the text recited at a Passover seder, are almost as much a tradition as gefilte fish. Maxwell House coffee sponsored a standard version used in Jewish homes for decades -- and now there's ''The Prince of Egypt Passover Haggadah'' by Dreamworks and the Orthodox Union ($12.99 at West Side Judaica, 2412 Broadway, near 88th Street). What makes this Haggadah different from all others? Oscar-winning song lyrics for starters (''River, O River, flow gently for me'') and animated stills including a glossy centerfold of the Hebrews trekking between the Red Sea's parted waters. In the margins there are questions to generate discussion of Passover themes (''Was Moses a mover or an agent?''). Critics of the edition liken it to stuffed Torah scrolls and other religious artifacts that are turned into toys or kitsch for the sake of mass appeal. Some rabbis don't see any problem. ''I remember when I was a kid there was a comic book of Bible stories, and I loved it,'' said Rabbi David H. Lincoln of the Park Avenue Synagogue. ''Anything that attracts people to a greater interest in the seder is to be encouraged.'' SARA IVRY",1999-03-28T05:00:00+0000

He was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, the son of Rosato and Barbara Poscente Fabiani. He received his early education in Waterbury and graduated from Crosby High School in that city in 1934. A 1938 graduate of Tri-State University, Angola, Indiana, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting, Mr. Fabiani made a lifelong commitment to his alma mater. He was elected to the Board of Trustees in 1967, served as Chairman of its Development Committee for eight years, and was awarded a Doctor of Business Administration degree in 1973. He was the first alumnus to Tri-State to serve as its Chairman of the Board of Trustees, a position he held from 1976 to 1979. After serving as Chairman he accepted the responsibility of chairing the endowment campaign to bring TriState into its second century with financial resources to ensure the university's solid position as a small private educational institution. In 1979 he was elected Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees and was the 1980 commencement speaker. A strong believer in the free enterprise system, Mr. Fabiani often encouraged young people to work within this system to find ways to meet energy and natural resource needs, be willing and prepared to take educated risks with their own capital and skills in the future, and to strive to innovate new & better methods of production.
