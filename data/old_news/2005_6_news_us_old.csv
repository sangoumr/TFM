As a scientist, Dr. Horwitz was internationally renowned for his study of the biology of adenoviruses, particularly his development of cell-free systems for adenovirus DNA replication. His most current research focused on understanding how the virus causes disease and how it interacts with the immune system. As a colleague, clinician, scientist, and mentor, he touched the lives of countless individuals throughout the Einstein community. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife and longtime member of the Einstein family, Dr. Susan B. Horwitz, cochair of Molecular Pharmacology and Rose C. Falkenstein Professor of Cancer Research; to his sons, Joshua and Bruce, and to the entire Horwitz family. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M.

Reuter, announced yesterday that 120 closed-circuit television cameras were installed last month at nine subway stations along the D, F and N lines in Brooklyn. Mr. Hikind, a Brooklyn Democrat, used $1.2 million in discretionary funds available to Assembly members for the project. The stations are in the Borough Park, Midwood, Kensington and Parkville neighborhoods, which have large Jewish populations, and Mr. Hikind said the project was prompted by ""concerns that the Jewish community would be targeted"" by terrorists. He added that he was not aware of any current threats. The transit agency does not plan to install cameras as comprehensively in other stations, Mr. Reuter said, but he also said more cameras could aid the police in investigating crimes.

Under current law, those arrested for selling 28 grams of powder cocaine face the same five-year sentence as those selling one-half gram of crack cocaine. Critics have argued that the mandatory minimum sentences are tilted against poor and minority defendants, who are more likely to be arrested for possession of crack cocaine than for the more expensive powdered cocaine favored by wealthier drug users. Mrs. Rell agreed that the penalty should be the same for both, but she proposed legislation that would lower the threshold to 14 grams of either one. Stacey Stowe (NYT)",2005-06-02T05:00:00+0000

The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council note with sorrow the passing of our longtime friend and colleague Bill Lieberman, who began his career at MoMA in 1943 as a volunteer for Monroe Wheeler in the Department of Exhibitions and Publications. In 1945, he became assistant to Alfred H. Barr, Jr., and in 1949 he became the first curator of the Department of Prints at the time of the opening of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Print Room. Under Bill's leadership, the department expanded to become the Department of Drawings and Prints, and in 1967 he was concurrently appointed a curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. The Museum's curatorial departments were reorganized in 1971, and Bill became the founding director of the Department of Drawings. Bill organized over forty exhibitions at MoMA, including Modern Masters: Manet to Matisse, Max Ernst, Joan Miro, Modigliani, Etchings by Matisse, and Art of the Twenties. He left the Museum in 1979 to become Chairman of the Twentieth Century Art Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also became an Honorary Member of MoMA's International Council that year. Bill had an eye finely attuned to quality and elegance, and his friends formed an expansive network of artists, writers, and colleagues. Collectors with whom he was close forever enhanced the Museum's collections, perhaps most notably Florene May Schoenborn and Joan and Lester Avnet. Bill will be sorely missed, but the immeasurable impact of his thirty-six years at the Museum will be apparent for generations to come.

Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Emeritus Agnes Gund, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Museum of Modern Art LIEBERMAN--William S. The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn with deep sadness the passing of William S. Lieberman, one of the most brilliant curators in the Museum's history, who leaves a stunning legacy of great modern art acquisitions. At the Met since 1979 (after an illustrious 35 years at the Museum of Modern Art), he served first as Chairman of 20th Century Art here, and later as the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Chairman of Modern Art. In that time, he mounted more than 35 exhibitions, enlarged and enhanced the modern art collection, and oversaw many gallery installations both before the opening of the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing for modern art in 1987, and over the years since. He was often called a ""collector of collectors"" because of the astonishing number of gifts and bequests to the Met that he inspired, including scores of works by the great icons of 20th-century art, among them Balthus, Braque, Giacometti, Klee, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Picasso, and Pollock. He knew many of these artists personally and, in a life intensely devoted to art, brought their work together for study and for the enjoyment of visitors to the Met for generations to come. After June 2004, as Jacques and Natasha Gelman Special Consultant for Modern Art, he continued to work each day at the Museum. By his many donors, colleagues, and friends, this erudite, witty, profoundly talented man was universally respected and will be just as universally missed. James R.

us,The Listings: June 3 -- June 9; ANTONY GORMLEY: 'CLEARING IV',"This installation is art's latest one-room wonder. It belongs on a list with similarly dazzling, implicitly populist sensations like Lucas Samaras's ""Mirrored Room"" of 1966, Walter De Maria's ""Earth Room"" or Yayoi Kusama's ""Fireflies on Water,"" which was a hit in the 2004 Whitney Biennial. Works of this sort often present one material in mind-boggling quantity. In Mr. Gormley's case, the material is a single strand of aluminum rod approximately 1 inch square (12.7 mm.) and nearly three miles (6 km.) long. The rod has been coiled into the main gallery at Sean Kelly in Chelsea, creating a new kind of walk-in drawing in space that also resembles a messily coiled Slinky in a very tight box. Moving around in the piece can make you feel like a small child on the loose in a storybook space. Jack's fallen beanstalk; the thorny vines protecting the sleeping Sleeping Beauty and Hansel and Gretel's forest may come to mind. At the same time, the piece relates to Minimalist sculpture, to Richard Serra's torqued and spiraled plates and Fred Sandback's stretched string sculptures. ""Clearing IV,"" above, suggests that the closer Mr. Gormley gets to the abstract, the better. The artist, who won the Tate's Turner Prize in 1994, is best known for life-size cast iron or lead sculptures of male figures -- usually based on his own body -- that convey a lugubrious and conservative humanism. The new figures in this show forsake the monolithic for the cumulative. Two are made of small blocks of mild steel. Another, installed on the gallery's roof, is an open, nearly transparent network of short bars of stainless steel. A fourth, resembling an extremely buff human porcupine, is made of hundreds of thin rods of mild steel. Evoking computer renderings, these works slightly update Mr. Gormley's earlier realism. They enter the realm of Tim Hawkinson's or Tom Friedman's figures, except that they are rendered in enduring materials that Henry Moore would have approved of.

The organization opens its 2005 summer season with free programs this month in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The neighborhood has certainly not been untouched by open-air arts festivals in recent years. But with gentrification rearing its silken head it may soon be too late to loose oneself in Red Hook's eccentric charms, particularly the old commercial structures of the port area. Some dull and some fantastic, the worn buildings and even the refurbished ones have a mysterious, filmic quality. The series begins tomorrow afternoon from 2:30 to 3 at Red Hook's Beard Street Pier with a master-class workshop with members of Rennie Harris Puremovement, above. The stylish, sizzling hip-hop and modern-dance company returns for a repertory performance from 6 to 7:30 p.m. tomorrow in Coffey Park on Visitation Place between Dwight and Richards Street in Red Hook. Two more Saturday afternoon performances will take place in the park, each with some form of community participation. Battleworks performs next Saturday, followed by three professional companies and one student group on June 18. Dancing in the Streets then moves north to Dag Hammarskjold Plaza opposite the United Nations for afternoon performances by Taylor 2, the vibrant junior Paul Taylor troupe, on July 9 and 10.

us,Open Roads: New Italian Cinema,"Paolo Sorrentino's film ""The Consequences of Love"" is set mostly in a Swiss luxury hotel where its poker-faced, 50-year-old protagonist and narrator, Tita (Tony Servillo), an accountant for the Mafia, has lived for years. The eeriest scenes of the film, which won five David di Donatello Awards (including best film, best director and best actor), show Tita supervising a room filled with workers grimly counting untold millions of dollars by hand. Why not do it electronically, one asks? Tita says he prefers the human touch. He is a kind of super gambler held virtual prisoner there because of a costly mistake he made years earlier. In the film, he makes one last life-and-death bluff for a woman. What makes ""The Consequences of Love"" (with Adriano Giannini, above left, and Olivia Magnani) more than a cerebral thriller is the metaphysical weight of Tita's self-knowledge. In a world where money rules more than ever, he is an existential fatalist for the 21st century. ""Consequences,"" which has two screenings today at the Walter Reade Theater, is one of the deeper films in ""Open Roads: The New Italian Cinema,"" the Film Society of Lincoln Center's annual Italian film series, which continues through Thursday. It shares with many of this year's films a visual fascination with the outer limits of modernity. That fascination links it to such Italian films of the 1960's as Michelangelo Antonioni's ""Eclipse."" In Renato De Maria's ""Love Me,"" Isabella Ferrari plays a beautiful 35-year-old woman, married at 15, who explores her own sexual power after her husband of 20 years leaves her. As she drifts through a world of elegant nightclubs and hotels in one close encounter after another, she suggests a reversal of the alienated neurotic beauty once played by Monica Vitti; she blooms. ""Love Me"" has screenings tomorrow and Wednesday. (Walter Reade, (212)875-5600.) STEPHEN HOLDEN",2005-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Unless the sons of the art dealer Daniel Wildenstein, Alec and Guy, reach a settlement with Daniel's widow, Sylvia Wildenstein, a significant collection of paintings and drawings will be sold at auction in early July, Mrs. Wildenstein said in an interview. The family's real estate holdings in New York and Paris and a string of thoroughbred racehorses and breeding stock are also under court order to be sold and the proceeds divided among the heirs. Under French inheritance law, Mrs. Wildenstein would get at least 50 percent of the proceeds. In its four generations of art dealing, the Wildenstein family has amassed works by old masters and Impressionists including Renoir, van Gogh, Czanne, and many others. The family has rarely disclosed details of its holdings, but court documents made public during divorce proceedings of Alec Wildenstein in 1999 estimated the value of its collection at as much as $10 billion. Daniel Wildenstein died in Paris in 2001 at 84. According to the decision by the Cour d'Appel in Paris, his sons persuaded Mrs. Wildenstein, now 71, to sign away her inheritance in the days after his death by telling her that she would face huge tax bills and a possible criminal investigation.

According to the League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade group, the box office gross for the season was $768.6 million, just short of last year's record $770.9 million. (The Broadway season runs from one year's June Tony Awards to the next.) Paid attendance for the 2004-5 season also dropped slightly, to 11.5 million, the fourth-highest figure on record. But after a fall that brought only three new musicals, none successful, the season's final quarter yielded better sales, with $222.1 million in gross receipts over the last 13 weeks. And in an encouraging sign for producers, both domestic and international tourism continued to recover from the effects of the 2001 terrorist attacks; out-of-town visitors made up 60 percent of the Broadway audience.

Citigroup, which shares control of Brasil Telecom with a group of Brazilian state-run pension funds, contended that the deal would hurt the value of its investment.

Deities may not accept branding, but music sometimes does, and the fast-food giant has latched on to the not-so-secret ingredient in African-American pop. Gospel has always kept up a two-way traffic in ideas with secular music, from blues to hip-hop, shifting idioms while trading pop's worldly joys and woes for Christian certainties. The annual McDonald's Gospelfest is a showcase for established gospel stars -- including, this year, current R&B-influenced singers like Donnie McClurkin and Vickie Winans -- as well as a steppingstone for winners of gospel talent competitions. But the headliner for this year's Gospelfest is a singer who grew far more famous outside the church: Aretha Franklin, above. A preacher's daughter who packed gospel dynamics into her 1960's soul classics, Ms. Franklin grows both fervent and flamboyant on the rare occasions when she drops her secular repertory and returns to gospel songs. There will be plenty of impressive voices onstage, and Ms. Franklin, a fiercely competitive singer when she chooses to be, just may sing rings around all of them.

Under current law, those arrested for selling 28 grams of powder cocaine face the same five-year sentence as those selling one-half gram of crack cocaine. Critics have argued that the mandatory minimum sentences are tilted against poor and minority defendants, who are more likely to be arrested for possession of crack cocaine than for the more expensive powdered cocaine favored by wealthier drug users. Mrs. Rell agreed that the penalty should be the same for both, but she proposed legislation that would lower the threshold to 14 grams of either one. Stacey Stowe (NYT)",2005-06-03T05:00:00+0000

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with deep sorrow the untimely passing of the distinguished American pianist Ruth Laredo on May 25 in New York City at the age of 67. A highly valued member of our Steinway Artist family for twenty years, Ms. Laredo was an accomplished soloist and chamber musician, and an indefatigable spirit in the New York music world. A native of Detroit, Ms Laredo studied with Rudolf Serkin at the Curtis Institute of Music. She was drawn to the music of Maurice Ravel, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Alexander Scriabin, and her performances and Grammy-nominated recordings of those composers' works, among others, won her a large and devoted following. Her acclaimed series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ""Concerts with Commentary"", was in its seventeenth season at the time of her death. Ms. Laredo was warmly received as a participating artist in Steinway & Sons' 135th anniversary concert at Carnegie Hall on June 2, 1988.

At 5 p.m. yesterday, the station largely abandoned acts like Tom Jones, the Four Tops and the Supremes in favor of the Beastie Boys, No Doubt, Tom Petty and Duran Duran. Analysts say the change by WCBS's corporate parent, Infinity Broadcasting, reflects demographic shifts and a gradual redefinition of what constitutes oldies for today's radio listeners. The Jack format, devised by a Canadian company, Rogers Media, is playing on a growing number of stations in the United States. Programmers have been adopting the format, which is built from a bigger-than-usual music library and results in odd mixes of songs from various eras and genres, partly as a response to the popularity of iPods and satellite radio, which offer deep playlists with no commercials. WCBS had been playing the oldies format since 1972. Infinity said its program director, Dave Logan, and its morning host, Micky Dolenz, above, of the 1960's made-for-television band the Monkees, had left the station. The company said the oldies format continues at www.wcbsfm.com. Infinity's Chicago oldies station, WJMK-FM, is also changing to the Jack format. JEFF LEEDS",2005-06-04T05:00:00+0000

Here's hoping that Rothman has overcome his nasty fabrication habit, because if the stories and people in his new book, ""Early Bird,"" are real, he has produced a warm, wry bit of reportage. Rothman earned some ignominy in 2000 when an article he wrote for The New Yorker turned out to have fictions mixed in with its facts, causing the magazine to run an apology. That article involved his posing as an employee at a dot-com company, and in ""Early Bird"" Rodman poses again, in a way: he retires to Florida, in his late 20's, moving into a Century Village senior citizens' complex. Rothman manages to be both an observer of these strange beings about three times his age and a sad-sack newcomer trying to blend in with them. He is working a bit of a stereotype, but his descriptions of the loneliness, the cliquishness, the slow-motion desperation of the place ring true and bittersweet. Most surprising is that his tales contain not an ounce of mean-spiritedness -- this from someone who once wrote for David Letterman. ""Young people often think old people all look the same,"" he writes in a passage typical of his tone, ""but that misconception works both ways. To elderly people, young people merge into one tender pink blob. Elderly people always seem to think I am 18 or 19, which is flattering until I remember that their eyesight is failing and that a certain percentage of them suffer from dementia.""

It's an entertainingly gruesome book, and Palahniuk (it is pronounced POL-a-nick) has come up with some entertainingly gruesome ways to promote it. His well-choreographed readings will not remind you of Cynthia Ozick's. At bookstore appearances, Palahniuk likes to read a section of ""Haunted"" about people who are boiled to death in natural hot springs -- but not before he has handed out teriyaki-scented air fresheners that make the local Barnes & Noble smell like the world's nastiest steakhouse. After that, he said in a telephone interview, ""I bring the energy level back up by lobbing fake bloody, severed appendages into the crowd."" (The fake-appendage plan went awry on his last tour when some of his bookstore visits nearly overlapped with those by Aron Ralston, the climber who wrote a memoir about how he amputated his own arm after it was pinned by a boulder. ""He had a real sense of humor about it,"" Palahniuk said. ""He said he wants them for his paperback tour."") Palahniuk ends his events by handing out, to those who ask him questions, rugs that resemble pieces of meat. His best-known novel is, of course, ""Fight Club."" There are always a few people who hang around after his readings to ask him how to find a fight club, or to invite him to the ones they've started. ""I always say, 'No, thank you,' "" Palahniuk said.

Palmer was a loving and dedicated husband to Polly, his wife of 42 years; to his children Chip, Dave and Jeff; to his daughters-in-law Sheila, Sarah and Cindy, and his grandchildren Palmer, Regan, Matthew, Charlie, Clay, J.P., Lucas, James and Sam. Palmer would certainly describe his family as the crowning achievement in what was a very rich life. Palmer worked as a commercial real estate broker for over 30 years, as a result of his successes as a promotional broker the Uris Buildings Corporation asked the Cross and Brown Company to name he and his partner David Hoffman as rental agents for 300 and 320 Park Ave. Over the years he would serve in that capacity for many buildings, including 3,90, 200, 300, 320 and 410 on Park Ave. alone. Many of the Fortune 500 companies found their headquarters offices through his efforts, the likes of which included National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and International Paper. Palmer was Executive Vice President and served on the Board of Directors for the Cross & Brown Company. Later in his career, he was also a founding member of Sealy, Hoffman & Sheehan, Inc. Palmer graduated from the Millbrook School in 1954, and Brown University in 1958, where he received his BA in history, beginning what would be a lifetime passion for US history. He toured Civil War battle sites with friends, and explored the genealogy which dated back to Walter Palmer, settler of Stonington, CT, in 1652. Following Brown, Palmer served his country as a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps for two years. Palmer also pursued a lifelong passion for tennis, something passed to him from his father Palmer Sealy Sr., a USTA doubles finalist. He ran the West Side Tennis Club Junior Program during the 1960's introducing many young, promising players to the game, most notably Vitas Gerulaitis, who later went on to win the Australian Open. A memorial service will he held 11 AM, on Saturday, June 11, 2005, at the Brookville Reformed Church, Brookville, NY. Further information, Whitting Funeral Home, 300 Glen Cove Ave., Glen Head, NY.

Gospodinov flits and buzzes among various subjects -- from graffiti in public toilets to the movies of Quentin Tarantino -- in this tale of a young Bulgarian writer who decides to create his own version of a ""natural novel"" assembled from the bits and pieces of everyday life. At its center is a poignant story about the narrator's divorce and the fact that he isn't ""the author"" of his soon-to-be-ex-wife's pregnancy. Maybe he's suffering from attention deficit disorder; maybe he's just stuck with a skewed if stoic appreciation of life's messy flux.

But the film's three biggest jumps were executed without anyone at the wheel -- an increasingly common way to save money on ambitious stunts. For the climactic scene shown here, in which Bo Duke (Seann William Scott) rockets over a police barricade to arrive at the courthouse in time to save the day, the special-effects team used a technique known as ratchet launching to hurl the car, known as the General Lee, some 170 feet.

us,The Real European Union,"The Eurovision Song Contest, that venerable multinational forerunner of ""American Idol,"" wrapped up its 50th edition recently, awarding the top prize to Helena Paparizou of Greece and the song ""My Number One."" (Ms. Paparizou is seen at right in the finale in Kiev, Ukraine, demonstrating skills we haven't seen from Kelly Clarkson or Ruben Studdard.) Both contests involve mass balloting by television viewers and intense debates about voting patterns. But in Eurovision, those patterns are a lot more complicated: this year's contest involved voters from 39 countries, representing multiple languages, cultures and historical animosities. Those relationships drew the attention of Neil F. Johnson, a professor of physics at Oxford University, who, in ""How Does Europe Make Its Mind Up?,"" set out to quantify how geopolitics factors in with lyrics, voice and smile. The paper (online at http://arxiv.org/PS--cache/physics/pdf/0505/0505071.pdf) was written with three other Oxford scholars. ""Like so many other systems,"" Mr. Johnson said, ""Eurovision is an economy where things are exchanging information over time."" Among his findings, based on voting from 1992 to 2003: (1) While many voting affinities were geographically predictable, some were surprising. For instance: Scandinavian and Estonian voters tended to favor the same songs. Looking deeper, Mr. Johnson found that Estonia's large Finnish population was probably the reason. (2) While Britain is often branded the most Europhobic of European nations, its voters were the most ""in tune"" with the continent; they gave more points to new Central European countries than voters from other older nations, and they began voting for eventual winners earlier and in greater numbers. (3) France, on the other hand, was ""the most out of tune"" in its voting; French viewers consistently failed to vote for the countries that were most likely to vote for France. All of this, of course, has wounded various European sensibilities. ""You wouldn't believe my e-mail box,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""I open it in fear every morning.""",2005-06-05T05:00:00+0000

On Sunday, American Airlines and Northwest Airlines ""decided, no, we're not going to play"" and rescinded their increases, Mr. Trippler said. Other major airlines quickly followed, except Delta, which was maintaining fare increases of up to $20 one-way on some long routes as of yesterday.

Born Aaron Nadler in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on April 11, 1924, to Samuel Nadler (from Bucharest, Romania ) and Clara Rubin (from Iasi, Romania), he came to the United States in 1955. An accomplished graphic artist, his first enterprise was a marketing and publicity firm, Arch Nadler Associates. He then established with Rober Larimer the New York advertising agency, Nadler and Larimer, Inc. It soon established itself as one of the major and innovative firms in the world, with additional offices in London, Paris and Bremen. Its clients included Faberge, Austin Nichols, Lionel Toys, New York State Lottery, and Conde Nast. He was the Chairman of the Board until his retirement in 1983. He married Sarah Shirley Friedmanin 1949, and their daughter Linden (now living in Jerusalem, Israel), was born in 1950. After a divorce, he married Nancy Sharon Hertz in 1957. They had three children: Steven (of Madison, WI); Lauren (of Wilton, CT); and David (of LLoyd Harbor, NY). He also had nine grandchildren: Rose and Ben Nadler (Madison); Cameron Nadler (Wilton); Caroline, Sydney and Savannah Nadler (Lloyd Harbor) and Eliezar Zev, Ariel and Rachel Stromberg (Jerusalem). He is also survived by his brother, Sidney Nadler. He was a loving and deeply beloved husband and father, and a devoted, generous, and doting grandfather. He was blessed with wisdom, a brilliantly dry sense of humor, quiet digity, and (something he tried to impart to his children) an unfailing sense of ""menschlicheit"". He never forgot his impoverished roots--he lost his father when he was 14, and worked to support his family--and his personal and professional success never clouded his sense of who he was and where he came from. May his memory be for a blessing. With love, from his children",2005-06-07T05:00:00+0000

The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday, said that although Mr. Blatty had been paid for one of the sequels, ""Exorcist: The Beginning,"" released in 2004, he had not been paid for last month's release, ""Dominion: A Prequel to the Exorcist."" The suit said Morgan Creek Productions had been granted the right to make these sequels pursuant to a 1996 settlement agreement, in exchange for which Mr. Blatty would be paid $930,000 for the first theatrically released sequel and $750,000 at the start of principal photography of a subsequent sequel.

The clerk hit an alarm button, and a passing motorman also called for help. The woman was taken to a hospital, where she was in stable condition.

Mr. Rioult, a former Martha Graham principal and now a modern-dance choreographer in his own right, shifted the setting of the exotic ballet classic from a Russian fairytale forest to a grimly empty modern-day world. The magical bird of the original, who saves two courtly young lovers from monsters, became an innocent young girl who attempts to humanize the lost men and women around her. Now Mr. Rioult is at it again, in dances to be performed at the Joyce Theater starting onTuesday. This time he has taken on ""Les Noces"" (above), a 1914 classic in which the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska evoked a bride's intense fears as she prepares for her wedding. Once again, Mr. Rioult has kept the ballet's Stravinsky score. But his ""Noces"" explores the anxieties of both women and men as they become equal partners in sexual discovery. Also on the program is a restaging of an earlier Rioult work that took a new look at a classic. ""Kansas City Orfeo,"" a work in progress set to the Gluck opera score and Kansas City jazz, moves Orfeo and Eurydice from the underworld to Kansas City clubs during Prohibition, all recalled by a disillusioned older Orfeo. The Juilliard Jazz Ensemble will perform. Mr. Rioult's ""Firebird"" completes the program.

It is a finely distilled comment on the inane red-state-blue-state formulation. A painted mural, above, is more puzzling. It takes a while to figure out that the letters P N U U M L D E -- alternately painted black and gray and diminishing in height toward the middle -- resolve into the word ""pendulum"" when you read back and forth one letter at a time from outside to inside.

Sean was the loving husband of Meg, the beloved brother of Una, Patrick, Teddy, Noel, Mari Byron and the late Kathleen O'Brien, and the dear uncle of many nieces and nephews. Born in Ireland, Sean has lived in NYC for the past 38 years. Sean attended a Jesuit seminary in Ireland and served as Jesuit missionary in Peru and Bolivia. Sean was the Chief Executive Officer of TML Information Services, Inc. and the Chairman of the Board for the North American Driver Safety Foundation. Sean's passion for driver safety and protecting individual's privacy rights was exemplified in his innovative and creative work using official Department of Motor Vehicle driver records of the various states of the US and several foreign jurisdictions in Mexico and Canada for promoting highway safety both in law enforcement and in the rental and insurance industries. Sean's pioneer work in this field created a large source of revenue for many jurisdictions. Sean was active as an Associate Member of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) and a member of AAMVA's Industry Advisory Board. Sean was also a leader in the Insurance Industry Committee for Motor Vehicle Affairs and a member of the Board of the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety. Sean provided his international leadership skills to the US Department of Transporation for implementing a technology transfer that developed commercial driver and motor carrier safety initiatives and a safety information system infrastructure between the US and Mexico. As part of his contributions with the US Department of Transportation on safety data exchange between the US and Mexico, Sean served in the Transportation Consultative Group of the NAFTA Land Transportation Standards Subcommittee. Sean made significant contributions to the US Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration's Team/Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's working group facilitating the opening of the USMexico borders for commercial motor vehicle operators. Sean was a leader in promoting safe driving and was coauthor of the CDL Effectiveness Study for the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Services Administration, a Report to Congress that was instrumental in the implementation of updated federal regulations embodied in the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act. Sean will be remembered for his brilliant and creative mind, vast depth of knowledge in history, government, mathematics and the technical fields related to computers and information transfers, insatiable curiosity, inquiring mind, generous heart, love for his fellow man, and dedication to his friends, his business partners, and employees, all of whom Sean regarded as his family. Sean loved life which he faced with a sense of adventure and a zest for the joys this world brings; it was said of him that he lived life as a poet would like to record it, with intensity and uncompromising dedication. For Sean there was no other way. Sean's sense of humor and ""twinkle in his eyes"" will be with us always. Sean will be missed, but what wonderful memories and shared adventures he leaves for his family and friends to remember and cherish.

Dr. Pirani, who founded Columbia's Renal Pathology Laboratory in 1973, was one of the most influential pathologists of his day. His work forged the transition from autopsy-based studies of the kidney to modern biopsybased pathologic interpretation. The semiquantitative method he developed for evaluating needle biopsies of the kidney is not only essential to establish an accurate diagnosis, but also provides valuable clinical information about disease activity and reversibility that has helped guide optimal therapy. His systematic approach has been instrumental in describing for the first time the defining features of many major renal diseases. Dr. Pirani was born in Pisa, Italy, and attended medical school in Italy. Because of racial laws enacted by the Mussolini government, he immigrated to the United States in 1939. His early career in pathology was at the University of Illinois, and he was appointed chairman of pathology at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago in 1965. In 1973, he came to Columbia University Medical Center as professor of pathology and director of the newly created Renal Pathology Laboratory. He retired from that position in 1985, becoming professor emeritus of pathology. Dr. Pirani lectured widely and published more than 200 research papers and textbook chapters over a 30year period. He is best known for his seminal observations on the clinical-pathologic features of lupus nephritis, diabetic nephropathy, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and myeloma-related renal disease, which helped form the basis of our modern understanding. In 1977, he founded the course ""Renal Biopsy in Medical Diseases of the Kidney,"" which is the longest-running continuing medical education course in the history of Columbia University Medical Center. Lectures in his name are given every year at Columbia and at the Mario Negri Institute for Renal Research in Bergamo, Italy. In 1987, he received the prestigious John Peters Award of the American Society of Nephrology for his lifetime contributions. Dr. Pirani is survived by his wife Luciana of Lenox, Mass.; three children, Barbara Alberts-Pirani of Bolton, Mass., Sylvia of Albany, N.Y., and Robert of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.

us,'Au Hasard Balthazar',"Forget the Sith, Tom and Katie, the big movie news this summer is the release on DVD on Tuesday of one of the greatest films in history: ""Au Hasard Balthazar."" Written and directed by Robert Bresson, and shot in limpid black-and-white, this 1966 allegory tracks the journey of two innocents, the teenage Marie (Anna Wiazemsky, above, who later married Jean-Luc Godard) and the soulful donkey of the film's title that's adopted by her family when she and the animal are very young. In the course of Bresson's short tale, both Marie and Balthazar will endure a crucible of suffering -- she at the rough hands of a punk in a black leather jacket, the donkey at the equally rough hands of various vicious masters. The critic J. Hoberman has observed that ""Balthazar"" is about a donkey in about the same way that ""Moby-Dick"" is about a whale, but it is also true that this is a story about an animal. Inspired by a passage from Dostoevsky's ""Idiot,"" Bresson makes Balthazar the moral center of his film, perhaps because, unlike Marie and the rest of the men and women in this fallen world, the donkey doesn't need to die to achieve grace. (It's worth noting that Bresson used a Schubert Sonata as ""a kind of language for the donkey's soul."") Over the years, some critics have classified Bresson's work as unapproachable, even punishing. For these professional philistines the idea that movies can be serious, more than tricks and trashy entertainment, is apparently anathema. Don't you believe it: ""Au Hasard Balthazar"" is a masterpiece of the art, but a masterpiece that stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind. Released by the Criterion Collection, the DVD features a pristine print with a new translation and includes a 1966 television program about the film. MANOHLA DARGIS",2005-06-10T05:00:00+0000

Fiercely intelligent yet quietly patient and warm, she was a source of inspiration for many and of deep and loving comfort for the lucky few with whom she shared her life. She is survived by her husband, John J. Richardson DPM; son, Justin Richardson MD, and his partner, Peter Parnell; daughter, Martine Sacks MD, and granddaughter, Lita Sacks. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to a fund established in her memory to support patient care at Rockland Psychiatric Center and NKI. Contributions payable to the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene may be sent to the Mary Ann Richardson Fund, c/o RFMH at NKI, 140 Old Orangeburg Road, Orangeburg, NY 10962. Viewing will be at Frank Campbell, 1076 Madison Ave, Friday & Saturday from 2-5 & 7-9 PM & Sunday from 9-11 AM. A memorial service is planned for the fall.",2005-06-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: June 10 -- June 16; LCD SOUNDSYSTEM,"If you visit lcdsoundsystem.com, you can watch the video for ""Disco Infiltrator,"" the unreasonably propulsive new single from the disco-punk band LCD Soundsystem, above. It's a performance video, although the performance itself unfolds for only a few seconds, in a scene that occurs more than halfway through. The rest of the time, you're watching the band members as they go about their day: they wake up, run errands, stumble down to the venue and then, inevitably, find their way to the after-party. The group's leader is the singer and producer James Murphy (one-half of the team known as DFA), who is credited with ""most sounds"" on the band's self-titled debut album, released by Capitol Records. By releasing a series of great underground singles (included with the album on a bonus disc), LCD Soundsystem became known as one of the city's most entertaining dance-music acts, and fans were no doubt hoping for an album that included a few more DJ-friendly tracks. That's exactly what the CD provides -- no more but also, more important, no less. Mr. Murphy loves to rifle through the record racks, paying tribute to his favorite finds by dropping names (the first track is called, ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House,"" after the French house duo) and borrowing beats; among other things, the album is a tribute to the diversity of early-1980's new wave. ""Disco Infiltrator"" is the moment where everything snaps into place: there's a keyed-up backbeat and a one-note bass line, and Mr. Murphy yelps -- then, near the end, croons -- the lyrics; the only thing wrong is that, at five minutes long, the track is over too soon. Expect an ecstatic version (and, perhaps, a longer one) during a pair of appearances this week. (Tonight at 6:30, with the Juan Maclean, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)533-2111, $20. The band is also scheduled to open for the Pixies and Interpol: Tuesday night at 7, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, $35 to $40.)

Though his acquittal was upheld, the authorities said they would deport him within two weeks. According to The Associated Press, Moroccan authorities have said they have no warrants for Mr. Mzoudi, and United States officials have refused comment on whether they are interested in him.

The play, based on women's stories about the role of their vaginas in their lives and encompassing topics that range from childbirth to rape, is especially difficult to render in Russian: translators often lament that the language for sex is limited to clinical terms or expletives. Vasily Arkanov, the United States correspondent for NTV, a Russian television network, said he was inspired to translate the play after he wrote an article about it for the Russian version of Elle magazine. He told The Moscow Times that for the Russian title he ultimately chose to transliterate the English word ""vagina"" rather than use the standard Russian equivalent, which he concluded was too vulgar. Joel Lehtonen, the play's director, told The Moscow Times that he had had problems securing financing and finding actresses comfortable enough to speak their explicit lines.

us,Interrogating Ourselves,"I. The Silence After Abu Ghraib In order to get to the nub of the question of what we as citizens really expect and require of American interrogators facing supposed terrorists -- how far we're prepared to allow those asking the questions to venture into the dark realm of brutalization and coercion -- let's for argument's sake put aside the most horrific, shameful cases, those of detainees who died under interrogation: that of Manadel al-Jamadi, for instance, whose body was wrapped in plastic and packed in ice when it was carried out of an Abu Ghraib prison shower room a year and a half ago, where he'd been handcuffed to a wall; or Abed Hamed Mowhoush, who, elsewhere in Iraq, appears to have been thrust headfirst into a sleeping bag, manhandled there and then, finally, suffocated. By anyone's definition of torture -- even that of the Bush administration, which originally propounded (and later withdrew) a strikingly narrow definition holding that torture occurs only when the pain is ""of an intensity akin to that which accompanies serious physical injury such as death or organ failure"" -- these cases answer the question of whether torture has been committed by our side in what's called the global war on terror. No one steps forward to condone what's plainly illegal under United States and international law. And although we've seen no indication that blame will attach to any official or command officer at any level for these killings, there are small signs that conclusions have been drawn somewhere between the Pentagon and White House, signs of an overdue housecleaning, or maybe just a tidying up. By the coldest cost-benefit calculation, a dead detainee is a disaster: he cannot be a source of ""actionable intelligence,"" only fury. So there's now a new policy, ""Procedures for Investigations Into the Death of Detainees in the Custody of the Armed Forces of the U.S.,"" that was duly conveyed last month to the Committee Against Torture, a United Nations body, in a subsection of a longer report. The subsection's heading even carried a whiff of contrition. It was ""Lessons Learned and Policy Reforms."" Also, the Pentagon has let it be known that it's preparing a new manual for interrogators that prohibits physical and psychological humiliation of detainees. What interrogation techniques it does allow are listed in a classified annex as, presumably, are any hints of what can happen when those techniques fail to produce the desired results. Can the detainee then be handed over to another agency, like the Central Intelligence Agency, that may not be constrained by the new directives? Or to units of a foreign government like the counterterrorism units now being financed and coordinated in Iraq by the United States?",2005-06-12T05:00:00+0000

At present, the lobby bar (a lovely room a floor above the street, designed by Piero Lissoni) is open, but the ground floor (which will include a restaurant by Mr. Wanders) and the penthouse (which Ms. Hadid is no longer designing) are still construction sites.

It stands in a glass case next to a date palm tree; directly in front of it, on a floor of sand littered with bricks and rocks, is the actual metal box that held the $750,000, in American $100 bills, that Mr. Hussein had in his possession; to his left is a makeshift prayer rug representing the entrance to the spider hole.

us,Inside the List,"DATING GAMES: When a serious writer has a serious new book to sell, he or she tends to drop it on bookstores in the spring or the fall -- the ""prestige"" seasons, when it's cool enough outside to plausibly wear tweeds at readings. The historian David McCullough cuts against this grain. He likes to publish his books around Memorial Day, just in time for beach readers, and it's a strategy that's been good to him. His new book, ""1776,"" makes its debut on the nonfiction list this week at No. 1. His last book, ""John Adams,"" released in late May of 2001, also entered the list at No. 1, and lingered on the hardcover chart for 60 weeks. McCullough's biography of Harry Truman, published in June of 1992, rose only as high as No. 2, but it too had a long, lazy run on the hardcover list -- 43 weeks. McCullough is not what you would call a trendy writer, but the title ""1776"" does seem to confirm a new vogue for narratives that trace the arc of one specific, earth-rattling year. Already this spring we've had Winston Groom's ""1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls,"" as well as Jonathan Mahler's ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning,"" a look at New York City in the bumptious year of 1977.

The most famous recantation in history was that made by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, when threatened by the Inquisition in 1633 with dire punishment for advocating the theory of Copernicus that the earth was not the center of the universe but that it moved around the sun: ""I abjure, curse and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies,"" swore the intimidated scientist, legendarily adding under his breath, ""eppur si muove"" -- ""but it moves.""

You can see this in her appearance (the tailored suits, the chiseled face, the exotic appearance) and the elite rsum (stints as a lawyer at Skadden Arps and as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers). You can also see it in her personal history and opinions. Born in England, raised in poverty in Australia by a mother who is half-Russian and half-Ugandan, Mowbray-d'Arbela, 38, has never smoked. In her view, no one should. And those who do should quit. Those who have failed to quit should try again. She does not take issue with the World Health Organization's projection that 500 million people now alive will eventually die from smoking-related diseases; when I first met her for breakfast late last winter in Manhattan, she actually pointed me to that very statistic. She then made an impassioned presentation about the toxins in tobacco, a display so granularly detailed and footnoted and cross-indexed that when she began to talk about the 4,000 or so chemicals (including some 60 known carcinogens) released by every burning cigarette, a tally now agreed upon by virtually all tobacco scientists, I feared she might list every one.",2005-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Try Convincing a Child These Are Real Penguins,"Children today, reared on a steady diet of lifelike computer-generated imagery, know their animation. It's real life that may trip them up, if reports from screenings of the documentary ""The March of the Penguins"" are any indication. The film, which opens in New York on June 24, follows emperor penguins on their winter mating journey. The French filmmaker Luc Jacquet and his camera crew spent 13 months following the penguins as they traveled hundreds of miles, single file and in very short steps, into the frosty depths of Antarctica. There, after a courtship involving an intricate ritual dance, the flightless birds pair off. Apparently it's not the bizarre penguin watusi that has the ""Madagascar"" demographic scratching their heads, but rather shots of the birds waddling in unison in the intensely colorful, foreign environment of the ice shelf and swimming in the ocean.

Hayder's wrenching third novel was originally published in Britain last year as ""Tokyo"" -- a less memorable but more appropriate title for a beautifully controlled thriller about culture clash and especially about a strain of cruelty running through Japanese history. Grey, a young woman from England with some morbid ideas about her sexuality, has been obsessed for years with a particular atrocity committed by Japanese soldiers during the Nanking massacre in 1937. She comes to Tokyo in 1990 to find an elderly Chinese professor who has the only copy of a film depicting it; he agrees to help her if she'll ferret out the secret of a life-prolonging elixir from a yakuza gangster in a wheelchair. (The professor, naturally, is one of the massacre's survivors, and his diary from those days alternates chapters with Grey's narration.) Working at a Marilyn Monroe-themed ""hostess club"" called Some Like It Hot, Grey flirts with businessmen, overcomes her terror of sex with the help of an American co-worker and tries to figure out how to get past the gangster's terrifying bodyguard, a gigantic, murderous woman called ""the Nurse.""",2005-06-12T05:00:00+0000

But the biggest casualty at the box office this weekend might have been ""Cinderella Man"" (Universal), the boxing drama starring Russell Crowe and Rene Zellweger.

Mr. Petta said that the fire, which was reported about 8 p.m., was in a manhole near Second Avenue and 57th Street, and that the affected buildings, all residential, were along 57th Street between First and Second Avenues. The cause of the fire was still under investigation. About 5:30 p.m., power to some 2,100 customers was cut in Rossville in southeastern Staten Island. By 10 p.m., power had been restored to all but 90 customers, Mr. Petta said, adding that he did not know the cause of the failure. In the Bronx, a fire in a manhole on the Grand Concourse at East 167th Street cut power to one block along the street, said Firefighter Charlie Markey, a spokesman for the Fire Department.

This brought to a close a life devoted to education and community service, including 30 years of distinguished service at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. Cooney was born in 1933 and raised in McDowell County, West Virginia, where his father and grandfather were involved in the coal industry. Graduating from Elkhorn High School as class president, he continued his education in 1952 at the McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, one of the nation's top college preparatory schools. Cooney obtained his bachelor's degree from Marshall University in 1956, studying philosophy and Greek. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary from 1956-1958 and transferred to Harvard University, where he received his divinity degree (theology) in 1959. In 1962, he completed credits for his doctoral degree in political science at Rutgers University. Cooney's early professional years were spent in the church. He served as minister of the Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Califon, New Jersey, from 1959-1966. He was a member of Newton Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church (honorably retired). Cooney was the organizing chairman of the Northwest New Jersey Community Action Program, the antipoverty agency still serving Hunterdon, Warren, and Sussex counties. He then worked for New Jersey Governors Hughes and Cahill in the Department of Community Affairs, in the areas of education and youth. Among his many duties, he served Governor Cahill as staff director for the White House Conference on Children and Youth (1969-1972), assembling and directing the New Jersey committee that included, among others, future New Jersey Governor and 9/ 11 Commission Chair Thomas Kean. In 1972, Cooney began work representing Rutgers University in the local community and as a liaison to the state government, local government and community organizations, and coordinating visits of national and world dignitaries while serving Rutgers University President Edward J. Bloustein. He continued to serve in that role under Bloustein's successor, Francis L. Lawrence. Cooney retired from that position in 2002. At Rutgers, Cooney administered programs that brought distinguished visitors to the institution: the Victoria Program in Contemporary Issues, the Clifford P. Case Fellowship Program, Senator Bill Bradley student programs, and the Holland Program on Ethics in Government. Among the visitors were former Presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton, former Speaker of the House Thomas Tip-O'Neill, and former Vice President Walter Mondale. He coordinated the royal visits of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and the Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan. Cooney also administered the University's Kirkpatrick Chapel for many years. He established the first day care program for the children of faculty, staff and community residents. The Senior Citizen Audit Program was administered by his office. Cooney held leadership positions in a number of community agencies, including the United Way of Central New Jersey, serving as its President and on its Board of Directors. His office at Rutgers was also responsible for organizing and directing the University's annual drive for its combinedcharities campaign. He served on the boards of: the Raritan-Millstone Heritage Alliance; the Business and Education Partnership of Somerset/Hunterdon counties; the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Blindness; the New Jersey Teen Arts Festival; New Jersey Special Olympics, the Boonton Hospice; and the Friends of New Jersey Public Television as president from 1968-1972. On his retirement from Rutgers, Cooney was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Family and Community Services program for Somerset County, to the Board of Trustees of Centenary College, and to the Board of Directors for the Harvard Divinity School Alumni Advisory Council. Cooney is survived by his wife of 50 years, Nancy Evans, and by his four children: James M. Cooney (wife Myriam, and his daughter Nancy), Carolyn LaMontagne (husband Robert, daughter Erin, son Evan), Christine Sullivan (husband Kenneth, sons Patrick and Kevin, daughters Kelly and Lauren), and Mark Cooney (wife Lisa, daughters Morgan and Margaret).

Meanwhile, the board of PBS voted to adopt an updated set of journalistic standards to govern programming and content development, in large part to make the policies, last revised in 1987, more reflective of media other than television. The moves come at one of the more politicized moments in the history of public broadcasting. Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, a Republican who is chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funnels about $400 million in federal money to public television and radio, has pushed to change what he and other conservatives say is the liberal bias of some public programming, particularly on PBS. Last week, a House Appropriations panel approved a spending bill that would cut the corporation's budget by about a quarter. And the corporation announced early in April that it was naming two ombudsmen of its own, even though National Public Radio already had one and PBS was expected to add one of its own soon.

It was the first time the military has presided over a same-sex marriage, now legal in almost all of Canada following a series of court decisions over the last two years. The soldiers were married by a United Church minister after the base chaplain, an Anglican, refused to officiate for religious reasons. The guidelines of the armed forces treat same-sex couples the same as unions between men and women. Legislation to expand marriage rights to gay couples nationwide is awaiting enactment in Parliament and has the support of Prime Minister Paul Martin. Clifford Krauss (NYT)",2005-06-15T05:00:00+0000

The Department of Pathology of NYU School of Medicine mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Zoltan Ovary, M.D., Professor of Pathology, who died June 12, 2005, after 47 years of service on the faculty. One of the founders and early leaders in the field of immunology, he was internationally recognized for his discoveries and break through methods in the study of allergy, the control of the immune response, and the quantification of antibodies. Dr. Ovary was a consummate man of the 20th Century, his rich life spanning 98 years. Born in Kolozsvar, Transylvania, then part of Hungary, he lived in several countries in Western Europe before coming to the United States as a Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. In 1959 he accepted a position at NYU, where he educated and inspired countless students and colleagues. Convinced that life, science, and art are inseparable, he initiated the NYU School of Medicine Artist-inResidence program, which ran from 1965 to 1976. He was instrumental in putting the Aston Magna Foundation for Music and the Humanities on the cultural map, and at NYU he belonged to a nucleus of renowned immunologists-including Nobel laureate Baruj Benacerraf, Lewis Thomas, and Edward C. Franklin--who were devoted to the arts. He worked in his office until eight days before his death, sharing his passion for science and art. Dr. Ovary exuded an infectious zest for life; he was an extraordinary raconteur with a quick wit capable of reducing his listeners to tears of laughter. Even during recent periods of ill health, he displayed an ability to accept life at whatever cost, finding joy at museums and concerts and in communication with his devoted friends, both nearby and around the world.

Weak demand in the United States, which is the main market for Canadian-made automobiles and auto parts, and a relatively high Canadian dollar will lead to three consecutive quarters of declining production, the report said. The study predicted that by the end of the year the auto sector would increase production by only 0.1 percent. The report was not all bad news, however. The Conference Board, which is based in Ottawa, expects that auto industry profits in Canada would rise sharply because of declining costs for labor and materials. The Conference Board forecast profits of 3.6 billion Canadian dollars ($2.9 billion) in 2005 compared with 1.4 billion last year. Ian Austen (NYT)",2005-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; VIJAY IYER,"He appeared about 10 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area, a very young jazz pianist bursting with micro- and macro- and meta-theories. He wanted to unite jazz and funk, Indian drone elements and swing; he also seemed to want to synthesize four pianists, related but still diverse: Duke Ellington, Andrew Hill, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor. (There were urgent political themes, too, addressed in liner notes.) His music was usually based in odd meters and played hard and dry; it could be daunting. He wasn't working in a vacuum, though, and kept sanding down his sound. Some of his most important early colleagues, like the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa and the guitarist Liberty Ellman, ended up in New York around the same time that he did, in 1998; then the circle expanded again, bringing in the drummer Derrek Phillips and the bassist Stephan Crump. Now Mr. Iyer, above, leads a quartet that includes Mr. Mahanthappa, Mr. Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, who is only 19 but has the potential to become one of the bulldozing presences in New York jazz. The band's most recent album, ""Reimagining"" (Savoy Jazz), is its best, and Mr. Iyer's gigs are attaining a newly urgent momentum, with some genuine lyricism offsetting the rhythm attack. He's a jazz musician of the moment, and now's the time to hear him.

us,The Listings: June 17 -- June 23; MARY ANN CURRIER,"A glance at the illustrated brochure announcing Mary Ann Currier's exhibition could lead you to mistake her for an obscure 19th-century still-life painter. In fact, Ms. Currier, 78, lives in Louisville, Ky., and is known for still-life paintings and oil pastels that give traditional Chardin-like realism a distinctly contemporary resonance. This fall, the Speed Art Museum in Louisville will present a 30-year survey of her career (Oct. 4-Dec. 18). The recent paintings in her current show depict one, two or three dying roses larger than life on 24-inch-wide sheets of paper (above). It is an almost impossibly clichd subject, but Ms. Currier revives it, painting with a satiny, soft-edged touch and an intense, nonphotographic attention to texture, light and detail that gives the deep red or peach-colored blossoms a strange, almost fleshy palpability. Lying on otherwise empty surfaces and still connected to dried and faded stems and leaves, the roses are extravagantly florid and even erotically sensuous. While Romantic and Freudian overtones reverberate, the paintings also evoke the antique tradition of the vanitas -- the still-life that allegorizes the futility of material attachments in a world where no one escapes death.

He was the son of Sadie Gombrich (the French actress Claudine LeDuc) and Robert Kenneth Lindsay, a salesman, and was born in Winnipeg, Alberta. In spite of an itinerant childhood, and the early loss of his father, Mr. Lindsay distinguished himself academically at a very young age and graduated first in his class from Ridley College in St. Catherines, Ontario at the age of 14. He graduated from Oberlin College at the age of 18, and from the University of Michigan Law School at the age of 21 where he served on the Law Review. Mr. Lindsay married Priscilla Shepherd, a fellow alumna of Oberlin College, in 1942, and raised a family with her. Early in his corporate law career he worked for Republic Aircraft, Hayden Chemical Corp., and the Manhattan law firm of Fulton, Duncan, and Halley. He became vice president of Tenneco, Inc. He then established his own law practice. Mr. Lindsay fought actively for social justice in many arenas. He served on the board of directors of the New York City Mission Society for 12 years and was its president for six years. He was an advocate for low-income housing and served on the Fair Housing Commission of Briarcliff, NY. He was an active Episcopalian who taught Sunday school and served on the vestry of All Saint's Church, Briarcliff, NY. He was an avid crossword puzzle fan, who was famous in his family for completing the daily NY Times puzzle on his commuter train as it traveled nonstop between 125th St and Grand Central Station. After the death of Priscilla in 1972 he married Shirley Blois Brown, a musician and teacher who was embraced by his family. Mr. Lindsay retired to Savannah, Georgia where he initiated a volunteer program at Georgia Legal Services and was a moving force coordinating legal services, domestic violence advocates, and the police in the establishment of a Safe Shelter for battered and abused women and their children. Mr. Lindsay was honored by a 'Jim Lindsay Day' there for his efforts in 2002 when the shelter opened its new facility. After suffering several strokes he moved to Jacksonville, FL where he lived until his wife died in 2004. He is survived by his brother Dennis J. Lindsay, Esq, of Portland, OR; three children from his first marriage: Rev. Susan Tobias of Lower Cabot, VT; R. Kenneth Lindsay of Amherst, MA; Dr. Pippi Ellison of Newton, MA; six grandchildren, one greatgrandchild, and eight nephews and nieces.

Mr. Wopat is one of the great surprises of this acclaimed production, proving with only a few lines, none of which, by the way, include curse words, that he will not be typecast. After ""Hazzard"" finished its run in the mid-80's, he continued playing robust and ruggedly macho characters in the sitcom ""Cybil"" and in musicals like ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""42nd Street."" Mr. Wopat (above left,with Liev Schreiber) uses his history playing confident leading men to his advantage in ""Glengarry,"" fleshing out how his character's weakness makes him such an easy person to manipulate.

Arcoxia is part of the group of painkillers that came under fire from government officials and consumer groups after Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., withdrew Vioxx because of its link to heart attacks and strokes. One Merck study includes 23,500 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and compares the cardiovascular safety of Arcoxia with the drug diclofenac.

us,Nonfiction Chronicle,"ONE SOLDIER'S STORY: A Memoir. By Bob Dole. (HarperCollins, $25.95.) Memoirs are generally exercises in revelation. Dole's is a study in reticence. By his studiously self-deprecating account, he was a decent athlete, a below-average student, and -- after joining the Army's fabled 10th Mountain Division in World War II -- a mediocre lieutenant. It is only after he is horrifically wounded on the Italian front that we begin to get a hint of the strength that helped Dole ascend almost to the pinnacle of American politics, or a flash of his bone-dry wit. (""The mere thought of being back on American soil sent electricity through me,"" he writes of his time in a hospital bed encased in plaster. ""At least, I think it did."") It took more than a year of agonizing physical therapy before Dole could even stand again, and months of operations to allow him to so much as hold a pen in his battered right hand. But the moments of intimacy -- as when Dole confesses that to this day he cannot bear to look himself in the mirror, save to shave or comb his hair -- are rare.

Patrick Filbin, Bloomfield Hills, Mich. It's a fine thing to play with your kids but a dubious thing to lie to them. One way to distinguish between playing and lying is that play occurs with the understanding and consent of all involved. This is a simple enough matter to work out when it involves adult fantasy, from novels to movies to more personal play: consent can be explicit. With kids, it's trickier, a problem every parent grapples with when deciding how to answer a child who asks if there really is a Santa Claus or if the coin under the pillow really comes from the Tooth Fairy. Is the child eager to continue a kind of game, or is he or she requesting honest, if game-ending, information?

us,Movement,"Clive Gillinson transformed himself from musician into manager at a moment of crisis. In 1984, the London Symphony Orchestra was more than $600,000 in debt and sinking. The orchestra moved two years earlier into the Barbican Center, a mazelike modern-arts complex located in the City, the financial district, which in those days shut down after dark. In that confusing and out-of-the-way destination, the orchestra administration programmed unorthodox concerts (a festival of Berlioz and Michael Tippett, for example) in tightly clustered stretches. Each Barbican concert lost an average of $3,000. An orchestra that is governed by its players, the L.S.O. reacted to this desperate plight with an act of desperation. It forced out its managing director and, looking within the ranks, recruited Gillinson, a young cellist whose chief business credential was running an antiques shop with his wife in his spare time. Before accepting, the prudent cellist insisted that his chair in the orchestra be kept open for a year in case the new job didn't work out. Just as characteristically, however, he never looked back.",2005-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Since companies are exposed to interest rates, currencies, oil prices and the like when they open for business, executives must make smart decisions about risk from the get-go. Derivatives help in two ways. They help managers to know the value -- and potential changes in value -- of those risk positions, and they make it easier to shed the risks they don't want and take on those they do. Not every decision will be profitable, and some companies will fail, just as they did before the growth of derivatives. But making it easier to shift risk has led to good decisions that strengthen companies and make the financial system more resilient.",2005-06-19T05:00:00+0000

But his curiosity quickly got the better of him: after that promising start, he promptly set about his true life's work, which was to look at the world around him as hard as he could, and to keep his creative identity from becoming too solid, too well defined.

us,Inside the List,"LAW REVIEW: Lisa Scottoline writes tangy legal thrillers that are set in Philadelphia, her hometown, and she is often called ""the female Grisham."" The comparison is apt enough, though Scottoline's jokey and brittle entertainments make Grisham's books, with their laconic detachment, read like Graham Greene. Scottoline -- ""rhymes with fettuccine,"" she has said -- has published 12 novels, beginning with ""Everywhere That Mary Went"" (1994). Until now, they have mostly been about the often imperiled employees at an all-female law firm called Rosato & Associates. Her new novel, ""Devil's Corner,"" is a departure of sorts. The book, which enters the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 9, introduces a frisky new heroine -- a prosecutor named Vicki Allegretti. Commercially speaking, it was probably time to give Rosato & Associates a rest. While each of Scottoline's previous five novels made the Times list in hardcover, her last one, ""Killer Smile,"" was her poorest showing in years -- the book entered the list at No. 14 and vanished two weeks later. A former litigator, Scottoline goes to extreme lengths to make sure she gets the details right. According to her Web site, she has, alarmingly, ""driven up the front steps of the Art Museum in Philadelphia (the famous Rocky stairs) just to make sure it could be done."" Some writers of thrillers like to cultivate a certain air of bristling aloofness. Not Scottoline.

The film, which opened on Wednesday, made $71 million in its first five days, according to studio estimates. This suggests a strong comeback for the ""Batman"" franchise, whose luster was tarnished by ""Batman and Robin"" in 1997 with George Clooney wearing the cape, but the film's numbers were not quite enough to pull Hollywood out of its long box office slump: figures have been down from those of the previous year for several months now. ""If these numbers hold,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office monitoring service Exhibitor Relations, noting that the figures are only estimates, ""this will be the 17th down weekend in a row, matching 1985's record -- definitely a box office record that no one wants."" This weekend's receipts were off 2 percent compared with last year. ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" (Fox), starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, dropped to No. 2 with $27.3 million in its second week of release, bringing its cumulative sales to $97.9 million. Three holdovers rounded out the Top 5 this weekend: ""Madagascar"" (DreamWorks) took in $11.1 million, for total sales of $147.2 million; ""Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" (Fox) was No. 4 with $9.7 million, bringing its five-week cumulative sales to $348.8 million; and ""The Longest Yard"" (Paramount) was No. 5 with $8 million, for total receipts of $131.9 million.

The votes by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee came just 10 days before the Legislature is required, by law, to produce a balanced budget. But the Senate and the Assembly, though both controlled by Democrats, do not agree on how much the rebates should total and whether any new taxes should be imposed. How those negotiations are resolved could have major political implications, and not just for the Assembly members who are facing re-election in November.

The survey, which reflects fares paid by clients of American Express Business Travel, a corporate travel management company, encompasses first-class, unrestricted coach and discount coach tickets. American Express said that fares were depressed because of continuing competitive rate cuts on many routes, as well as aggressive corporate negotiating on fares. The recent rounds of fare increases appear to be having an effect, though. In April, the average domestic one-way fare was $210, up $8 from the first-quarter average, American Express said. By comparison, for all of 2000, the average domestic one-way fare was $259. International fares are going up, meanwhile. On 160 monitored routes, the average fare rose 4 percent in the first quarter of 2005, largely reflecting strong demand for business-class and first-class travel.",2005-06-21T05:00:00+0000

The woman was hit about 8 a.m. at Carlton Avenue and Fulton Street in Fort Greene. A man driving a BMW followed the van into Manhattan and tried unsuccessfully to pull in front of it on Eighth Avenue near 23rd Street, then pulled alongside an off-duty United States postal inspector and told him the van needed to be stopped. The inspector, James Buthorn, said that a man -- it is unclear who -- even hopped onto the side of the van to stop it, but the van swerved and the man fell, although he was not injured. The police said Mr. Buthorn pulled over the van's driver, identified as Richard Williams of Brooklyn, who was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended license. The pedestrian was taken to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where she was listed in stable condition, the police said. Michelle O'Donnell (NYT)",2005-06-23T05:00:00+0000

The concert itself was also widely criticized for the organizers' decision to present it at a small park, which holds just 35,000, in the tiny city of Barrie, Ontario, at least an hour's drive north of Toronto. A column in The Toronto Star said the concert, featuring aging Canadian musicians like Bryan Adams, Gordon Lightfoot and Burton Cummings, ""feels like a lazily programmed, rather halfhearted afterthought.""

Now owned by Universal, as are most of the pre-1949 Paramount films, these titles have gone largely unexplored since their television exposure in the 1970's, and there are many that have not been seen at all since their original release. Now, thanks to Bob O'Neil, Universal's vice president for film preservation, many pre-code Paramount films are returning to the scene, most in 35-mm prints. Among the 46 programs that Film Forum will be screening from today through July 21 are a handful of famous titles, such as the double bill of Ernst Lubitsch's ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932) and Josef von Sternberg's ""Blonde Venus"" (above with Marlene Dietrich and Sidney Toler), which opens the series today and tomorrow. Paramount's most celebrated directors, Lubitsch and Sternberg prospered in the freedom that reigned before the censorship crackdown, Lubitsch to create his sensual and suggestive comedies, Sternberg to spin his shadowy erotic fantasies starring Dietrich. While the studio's image was closely associated with Sternberg and Lubitsch's continental sophistication, Paramount also turned out quite a few of the gritty urban melodramas usually associated with Warner Brothers, and this fine series, programmed by Bruce Goldstein, gives pride of place to some surprising rediscoveries from this neglected side of the studio's output. Sylvia Sidney, Paramount's Bronx-accented answer to the innocent ingnues played by Janet Gaynor at Fox, stars in a double bill on July 5 and 6 of ""Ladies of the Big House"" (1931) and ""Pick-Up"" (1933), two gruff, working-class dramas directed by Marion Gering, and even Sternberg made his contribution to the genre by casting Sidney in his 1931 adaptation of ""An American Tragedy"" (July 9), one of his most underrated films. Paramount's confectionary, cosmopolitan side is also much on display, as in the double feature of July 1, Frank Tuttle's droll romantic comedy, ""This Is the Night"" (1932), and Harlan Thompson's musical ode to plastic surgery (really!), ""Kiss and Make-Up"" (1934), both featuring a young Cary Grant. In other words, it's pretty hard to go wrong once you plunge into the schedule, available at www.filmforum.org. DAVE KEHR",2005-06-24T05:00:00+0000

(The list, which reflects sales for the weekend ended June 18, will be published in the newspaper on July 3 and will be available online next week at nytimes.com/books.) ""The Historian"" received a huge publicity push from its publisher, Little, Brown & Company, a division of the Time Warner Book Group. Before publication, Little, Brown said that it planned to spend $500,000 promoting the book; it paid a $2 million advance in June 2004 for rights to it. Booksellers have been discounting the book heavily, which also probably helped sales; last weekend Borders Stores was selling the book at 40 percent off the $25.95 cover price, a bigger-than-normal discount for new titles.

The deal in Nablus, a hotbed for militants, is the most comprehensive agreement so far. Most of those joining are from Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, linked to the Fatah movement led by Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president. The campaign is part of Mr. Abbas's effort to persuade militants to halt attacks against Israel. They are supposed to turn in their weapons as well, though compliance has been spotty, Palestinian officials say.

Hervey White founded the series, named it after the arts colony he had established on his farm near Woodstock, N.Y., and built a large barn (above) that served as a concert hall. That barn still stands, and so does at least some of the adventurous spirit in concerts that bridge chamber music favorites with newer or more unusual works. This weekend, Maverick opens its 90th anniversary season with two such programs: tomorrow night, the Contrasts Quartet juxtaposes Beethoven and Schubert with works by Aaron Jay Kernis and Peter Schickele; Sunday, the violinist Charles Libove and the pianist Nina Lugovoy offer a recital of Saint-Saens and Mozart offset by Henry Cowell, Robert Starer and others. Running through Sept. 4, the season features both established ensembles like the Tokyo Quartet (Aug. 14) and younger groups on the rise, like the Mir (July 16) and Pacifica (July 24) Quartets. Alexander Platt, in his third summer as music director, has also woven through the schedule a five-concert tribute to his predecessor, the flutist Georges Barrre, and his fruitful relationship to the early-20th-century American composer Charles Tomlinson Griffes.

us,ARTHUR SIMMS,"Some homeless people contrive the illusion of owning property by bundling found and mostly useless material into great aggregates that they load onto shopping carts or other wheeled vehicles. The sculptures of Arthur Simms, a Brooklyn resident who represented his homeland of Jamaica in the 2001 Venice Biennale, call to mind this sort of roving, often mentally eccentric pack rat. The earlier pieces in his show of works dating from 1989 to the present consist of quantities of junk -- rags, old shoes, milk crates, tools, plumbing parts and so on -- wrapped in dense cocoons of rope. These massive, bulging constructions, some standing on wheels, exude an uncanny power in proportion to the urban poverty that they evoke. In recent works, like ""Blue Chair"" or ""Carnival"" (above), the found constituents are more discernible: the frames of a blue metal chair and an old wooden one wrapped in a delicate net of copper wire in the one instance; the gold-foil wrapped skateboard, the clear bottle, the wooden shoe form and the bird cage all pulled together by twine webbing and looking a bit like a small dog in the second case. The tradition of the Surrealist assemblage lies behind these works, but they are not so self-congratulatingly witty as such objects can be; Mr. Simms's works are sophisticatedly absurd, but there is a touching pathos about them, too.

Monson opens with a chart, closes with an index and pocks the intervening text with radio wiring diagrams as he merges metaliterary form with a grim subject (kids falling to their deaths through the ice of a frozen lake) in a poetic, startling, even funny collection of linked stories. As bored locals run laps inside the wintry cage of Upper Michigan and his occasional narrator mourns an ex-flame who went into the water on prom night, Monson turns this lost corner of America into the setting for a unique brand of mudroom Gothic. There's a diver reciting the procedures for recovering the dead, a cop reminding himself of the right way to notify the next of kin, and a catalog of the temperatures at which different items freeze. The funniest list identifies the things a woman must do to lessen her chances of being murdered: ""Do not go on dates with men. Do not go on dates with men who drive. . . . Do not spend time with any kind of men at all."" The drumbeat of particular words -- snowmobile, sauna, Superior, meth -- roots the reader in a very specific place, and Monson is its loving curator.

At The Times, his appearances have been equally various: notes on Arnold Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign for the Op-Ed page, an article for The Times Magazine on DVD's and Arts & Leisure essays on James Dean, World War I and Federico Fellini.

The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, which President Bush signed in April, explicitly protects this approach from copyright-infringement lawsuits. By downloading ""filters"" configured for specific movies onto a DVD player equipped with the ClearPlay software, viewers (i.e., parents) can censor 14 types of violent, sexual and linguistic content in some 1,500 films.

Wilsey's book takes no prisoners. It details the very public implosion of his parent's marriage -- his father was a charming multimillionaire, his mother a pushy and glamorous society columnist -- and his later life under the watchful eyes of a hated (and similarly well-connected) stepmother. ""Oh the Glory of It All"" is selling particularly well in San Francisco, Wilsey's hometown, where the book landed like a fragmentation bomb aimed at the city's elite. (Even Danielle Steel didn't escape the shrapnel; she was forced to deny Wilsey's claim she had an affair with his father.) The San Francisco Chronicle has treated the book like a major news event, printing a week's worth of excerpts, listing the names of those who dared to attend Wilsey's book party and drawing up lists of actors for the movie. While San Franciscans with long memories are buying Wilsey's memoir for the old-school dirt he dishes, Wilsey has cred with younger readers, too. He's an editor at McSweeney's and an F.O.D. -- a friend of Dave, as in Dave Eggers. Wilsey's book seems unlikely to be the kind of cultural phenomenon Eggers's ""Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" (2000) was; Eggers's book stayed on the hardcover list for more than 3 months, and spent 34 weeks on the list in paperback. But ""Oh the Glory of It All"" is strong enough to put to rest -- for a while, anyway -- some critics' fears that the worker bees at the McSweeney's word-colony were too coy and insular to introduce many other memorably distinctive writers.",2005-06-26T05:00:00+0000

The move follows an unsuccessful bid for Noranda, Canada's largest mining company, by China Minmetals, which is controlled by the Chinese government. While the Canadian government said the proposed legislation, which was presented last week, is not related to any specific case, many Canadian critics of the Minmetals bid argued that it threatened Canada's national security. Other opponents of the deal cited China's human rights record, an issue not addressed by the proposed changes. Under its proposals, the government would also acquire the ability to review takeovers of any size for national security reasons. Under a law passed 20 years ago, takeovers can be challenged for economic reasons if they are worth more than 250 million Canadian dollars. Ian Austen (NYT)",2005-06-28T05:00:00+0000

In the recording, the woman asks if her lead could fall below a million votes and expresses concern about areas in the south. The man tells her, ""We will do our best."" The final tally gave her more than a million votes over her chief rival. In her address, Mrs. Arroyo said she had spoken to the election commissioner not because she wanted to influence the outcome of the election but because she was anxious to protect her votes.

The Briton, Tom Hurndall, 21, was shot in the head after helping children move away from the Israeli forces in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip, witnesses said. He never regained consciousness and died nine months later. He belonged to the International Solidarity Movement, a pro-Palestinian group whose members have often placed themselves between the Israeli forces and Palestinians. The court found that the former soldier, Taysir al-Heib, above, an Israeli sergeant at the time, had shot Mr. Hurndall with a sniper rifle using a telescopic sight. He was also convicted of obstruction of justice, submitting false testimony and obtaining false testimony. Sentencing is set for next week. Rights groups and Palestinians say that the Israeli military has killed many unarmed Palestinians, and a number of foreigners, and that the shootings are rarely investigated. Israel says that civilians are not the targets of military action and that it conducts inquiries in cases where soldiers are suspected of wrongdoing. Greg Myre (NYT)",2005-06-28T05:00:00+0000

For the third week in a row, CBS's Sunday was No. 1 in total viewers but failed to win the 18-to-49 category. Its lineup, repeats of ""60 Minutes,"" ""Cold Case"" and the movie ""Changing Lanes,"" drew an average of 7.78 million viewers in Nielsen's estimates. Among 18-to-49-year-olds, however, CBS was No. 4. Fox, which was in fourth place among total viewers, won that age group. Its best performer was a new episode of ""Family Guy"" at 9 p.m., which drew an audience of 7.29 million. But a repeat of ""American Dad,"" which followed, lost nearly a million of those viewers. It was the only half-hour of the night when Fox failed to place first among adults 18 to 49. ""American Dad"" was outpaced in that demographic by the last 30 minutes of a particularly tear-jerking, two-part episode of ABC's ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" (7.38 million), in which the team remade both an 8-year-old cancer patient's hospital ward and her family's home.

Officers had been looking in the Port Authority Bus Terminal for a man wanted in a rape case in Brooklyn from 2002, police officials said. A man who seemed to match a photo of the suspect was chased down Eighth Avenue before he scurried into the building. The police did not find him there, but around 7:45 the man was taken into custody in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the police said, declining to release his name or other details. Around the time the police were searching the building, a suspicious package was found on a sidewalk at 50th Street and Eighth Avenue. The surrounding streets were cordoned off and a Rite-Aid store on the corner was evacuated. Firefighters said the package was deemed harmless. Michael Luo (NYT)",2005-06-29T05:00:00+0000

Two matches, pitting humans against computers, ended recently with decidedly mixed results for the humans. On June 21, Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, the reigning champion of the World Chess Federation, ranked No.32 in the world, played one game against a version of Fritz, a popular commercial chess program. Fritz was running on a tool bar, created by Accoona Corporation, that searches for files on personal computers and on the Web. That game ended in a tie. Another match, six games between Michael Adams, above, of Britain, No.6 in the world, and Hydra, a chess supercomputer developed by Pal Group of the United Arab Emirates, was easily won by Hydra, 5.5 to 0.5. While other people have lost matches to computers, most notably Garry Kasparov, who lost to Deep Blue in 1997, the margin of victory for Hydra stunned some in the chess world.

It was not immediately clear who had organized the protest or how seriously injured the prisoners were. Nor was it clear how so many prisoners, all in a camp in the Kursk region, about 300 miles south of Moscow, were able to acquire so many sharp instruments. Russian prisons remain fearsome places, with poor rations, overcrowding and high risks of tuberculosis and H.I.V. infection. They are often criticized by former inmates and human rights organizations. C.J. Chivers (NYT)",2005-06-29T05:00:00+0000
