He fabricated a fire cage to hold burning wood on one side of the carts top and hung a grill beside it, on cables that allow it to be cranked up and down over embers raked from the fire. You can cook six or seven racks of ribs or legs of lamb or an entire case of eggplants on the thing.

Weiss., the creators of Game of Thrones, recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called Confederate, which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the shows cancellation. Detroit, a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: No. However, Im able to tell this story. Earlier this year, Open Casket, an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial.

But she hadnt made much progress when she fell ill, and was still working out details of the plot with occasional help from her friend and fellow novelist Joan Hess. So her estate, naturally enough, asked Hess if she would finish the book that Mertz had started.

This 4,800-square-foot Brooklyn restaurant is the first of several projects for which Ms. Brefere is the culinary director. A sleek, modernized brasserie with an open kitchen and seats for 120, it also has a separate retail bakery and cafe. The companys executive chef, Rostislav Kemelman, who worked at restaurants owned by Bobby Flay, April Bloomfield and Shelly Fireman, relies on local purveyors whenever possible, and the restaurant proudly lists more than a dozen. The menu includes dishes like bouillabaisse, pot-au-feu, salmon choucroute and French onion soup. Lighter fare, like a croque-monsieur and various tartines, will also be served. In the fall, there will be a bigger KarVr (pronounced kar-VAIR) opening in Chelsea, and another in Downtown Brooklyn. Ms. Brefere said the location for the companys first restaurant was chosen because many of the investors were Russian-Americans with roots in the neighborhood. It also makes for a good testing ground for the launch before we go into Manhattan, she said.

The family embraced Tim, but the adjustment has been rocky, especially among some of the men. Tim has earned back this trust by being both husband and physical caretaker of our ailing relative. One recent evening, while his husband was ill, Tim and I sat alone in their home. The conversation turned to gun politics; Im a closeted gun rights sympathizer. Perhaps sensing some undue camaraderie, Tim stole away to the foyer, then returned with an unloaded black shotgun and ammunition. Tim told me not to mention this to our family  or to my relative, who doesnt know about the shotgun even though they live together. We also have children in the family, who visit Tim and his husband with frequency, and Im well aware of the statistics about households that keep guns. I plan to advise Tim at least to move the gun elsewhere, out of the house. However, that does not seem to be enough. Having the gun in the house suggests a lack of judgment; it seems like a serious breach of trust and, God forbid, potentially dangerous. Doesnt this directly contravene Tims claim to being a responsible caretaker, an ethical impetus that overrides confidentiality? Another twist: I also know that if the gun (or ammunition) were discovered, it could be just the excuse our extremely anti-gun family needs to disavow Tim. This seems like a bitter pileup of issues  gay equality, gun safety and family loyalty. Name Withheld",2017-08-09T09:00:06+0000

Inside, the house was an oasis of calm and carefully considered details, orchestrated by her mother, the renowned English antiques dealer Hilary Batstone. It is from these surroundings that the London-based Uniacke, now a mother of five, developed the sumptuous but restrained look that characterizes interiors for clients such as Jo Malone and David and Victoria Beckham. While living near Toulouse in the 90s, Uniacke began collecting pieces from flea markets across France. A decade later, she opened a shop on the design-boutique-rich Pimlico Road, which has become a pilgrimage site for local and visiting aesthetes. Sparingly appointed with Regency chairs and Art Nouveau sconces  as well as simpler pieces, including a giant copper planter designed by Uniacke and stocked with firewood  it also carries her own line of furniture and her newly launched fabric collection, which, as one might expect, is exactly what you need for modern country life: supple linens from the U.K. and mohair velvets in earth and jewel tones  and nothing more.",2017-08-09T15:00:55+0000

Over the past year, Gall has visited kite festivals around the world, everywhere from Long Beach, Washington to Cervia, Italy and Fano, Denmark. Part performance, part social gathering, the festivals draw thousands of kites, which are choreographed into dances, fights and competitions. But this is not what calls me, Gall says. What spoke to me was the transformation of the ordinary into the extraordinary. The cartoonish kites become planetary forces orbiting; the sky becomes a vast sea full of creatures.

The right answer is of course (C), and thanks to Brown  I like to picture him introducing himself at cocktail parties as Dante Brown  there is recent precedent for borrowing a classics title in hopes that its posterity might rub off. (It worked for Brown. His Dante-influenced thriller spent more than a year on the hardcover and paperback fiction lists.) Even so, the Republican senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has raised eyebrows by calling his new anti-Trump manifesto Conscience of a Conservative. Thats because Barry Goldwaters 1960 book of that title, which stayed on the Times nonfiction list for 31 weeks, is still revered as a founding document of the modern conservative movement. Right-wing commentators who arent as ready to abandon the president see Flakes appropriation of the name more as apostasy than as the homage Flake intended, and object to the books attacks on the Republican establishment. (We pretended that the emperor wasnt naked, Flake writes. Even worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.) Brent Bozell III, president of the conservative Media Research Center and son of Goldwaters collaborator (some say ghostwriter), recently insisted that Jeff Flake is not a conservative, nor does he have a conscience, and he called on his conservative brethren to denounce this impostor. You know youre in trouble when your critics are using the word brethren. Not that liberals are much happier. In The New Republic this month, Alex Shephard applauded the books message but said that Flake  who has voted with Donald Trump 95 percent of the time  was the wrong person to deliver it.",2017-08-11T14:34:50+0000

As Hodgman recalls in his introduction to Campbells sequel, Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of a B Movie Actor, when a book editor finally bit, he was taking a gamble based on what Campbell had shown everybody: You can cultivate a good and profitable artistic career by knowing your audience and keeping them close, Hodgman writes.

I was retrieving a package and he grabbed me in a bearhug and growled. Days later, when he was in my apartment making repairs, he pulled me into another embrace, kissing me above my bosom. When I told the board president, she described him as a good family man and refused to intervene. I wrote the board and the managing agent a letter. They responded, saying that I should not speak with him until investigations are complete. That was a year ago. Now, I cannot ask the super for services, while other shareholders can. For example, the building has a plumbing issue. While the super has repaired other units, I was told to hire a licensed plumber at my own expense. What do I do? ",2017-08-26T14:00:01+0000

Ellmanns Joyce didnt read like a biography: it read like a work of art, Atlas writes. It had the authority of great fiction; it was scholarly but not academic; and behind its facade of objectivity you could detect, if you listened closely enough, the biographers own voice. This was the kind of book I aspired to write. Atlas went on to become a publisher, editor and the author of biographies of Saul Bellow and the poet Delmore Schwartz. His new book is about the art of biography: how Atlas came to love it; how its been practiced through the ages; the magic it can work and its shortcomings.

Statistics have an even harder time gaining mainstream acceptance, so it must be strange for a newbie to tune in to a Yankees game this year and see Aaron Judge, baseballs largest son, hit a towering shot into the bleachers and hear the commentator say something like, Wow, that ball traveled out of here with an exit velocity of 115.3 miles per hour!",2017-08-29T09:00:03+0000

First elected in 1982, Schultz placed himself within the progressive tradition that made Wisconsin, a century ago, the birthplace of the state income tax and laws that guarantee compensation for injured workers. In the months before his visit to Michael Best, Schultz cast the lone Republican vote against a bill that stripped collective-bargaining rights from most public employees. But if Schultz had doubts about some of his partys priorities, he welcomed its ascendance to power. For the first time in his career, Republicans controlled the State Senate and the State Assembly as well as the governors office, giving them total sway over the redistricting process that follows the census taken at the beginning of each decade.

We didnt talk much because we were focused on our food, but when we did, it was about the mysteries of the delicious. A chicken-fried steak is nothing to champion, after all, at least on its face. Its just cheap beef pounded thin, dressed in seasoned flour and fried, an Americanized taste of the schnitzel brought to Texas by German immigrants in the 19th century. Peppery cream gravy generally accompanies the steak. That gravy can be gummy when its not prepared well. And the steak beneath it can be dry, or soggy, or both. Ours was neither. Walsh and I marveled at the way the texture of the meats crisp exterior was heightened by the silkiness of the gravy, at the way sweet and salty combined in the dish and at the manner in which the whole experience was so much greater than the parts. Soon enough I went home to recreate the meal.",2017-08-31T09:00:02+0000
