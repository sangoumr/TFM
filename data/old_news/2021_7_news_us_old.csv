This is my restaurant, not something I inherited, and I was looking for fresh ideas, she said. Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms  bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu  this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isnt offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. Its a vast departure, but what I want right now, she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like Andr Soltner and Jacques Ppin; a painting by Mr. Ppin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her fathers favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staffs Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurants name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers. (Opens Thursday) ",2021-07-06T16:15:26+0000

In making these images I wanted to reflect on the idea of becoming something else. Ovids physical and emotional landscapes are constantly shifting.

Some were hospitalized, some were placed on ventilators and more than a few have long Covid symptoms. When the vaccines became available, not only did I and my staff get vaccinated, but we also assisted our patients in procuring vaccination appointments. By spring, more than 80 percent of my patients were fully vaccinated, and we can now offer unvaccinated patients the convenience of vaccination in our office. A significant segment of our practice consists not of vaccine hesitant but of vaccine refusing. We attempt to create a nonjudgmental, nonshaming atmosphere for our patients to express their reasons for refusing the vaccine. Many have bizarre, almost delusional reasons for not getting vaccinated. Others have fallen prey to misinformation online. Because our patients often take mass transit to their appointments and because our office is in a high-rise and because I offer telehealth appointments, is it ethical and in the interest of public health to restrict vaccine-refusing patients to telehealth appointments?

Yoshinori Horii, who runs the company, decided that New York would be its first overseas branch, but the pandemic stalled the opening. In the warmly decorated New York restaurant, the chef Tsuyoshi Hori (the name is a coincidence) and his staff make the soba that they use. They also make more traditional buckwheat soba using some wheat flour, and diners can select which type of soba they prefer. There are more than a dozen soba dishes, cold and hot, many served with tempura and involving seafood, meats like duck, and vegetables. Several sauce options are also available. In addition, the restaurant offers appetizers like deep fried tofu, grilled eel with eggplant, crab cake, fish carpaccio and a soba roll.

So she acquired a few loose four-by-four-inch tiles from the man who operated the local kiln and, after glazing them with various configurations of conjoined fetuses connected at the neck, torso and belly, using four tiles per image, returned to have them fired.

They are, however, all redolent with the sense of disconnection the last year and a half has brought on. Kristen Radtke, the cartoonist and art director of The Believer magazine, where she publishes cutting-edge comics, has a follow-up to Imagine Wanting Only This, her melancholy 2017 debut memoir, which chronicled her pervasive sense of loneliness throughout her 20s. SEEK YOU: A JOURNEY THROUGH AMERICAN LONELINESS (Pantheon, $30) amplifies her previous effort (its longer by 75 pages), expanding the topic through extensive research interwoven with stories from her own life. Part literature review, part essay, part autobiographical meditation, Seek You exemplifies the capaciousness of nonfiction comics today. In the realm of fiction, the English cartoonist Lizzy Stewarts mournful, lovely ITS NOT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE (Fantagraphics, $24.99), nine interlinked vignettes about girls and young women, often embodies what Radtke makes explicit in her documentary form.",2021-07-29T09:00:05+0000

Eagle-eyed readers may notice that this tale of gin-soaked backwoods Cape Cod is dedicated to the authors grandmother Muriel Maurer Cowley, whose fierce love never wavered. Fun fact: Hellers grandfather Malcolm Cowley was a renowned critic, historian, editor, poet, essayist and regular Book Review presence, who died in 1986 at the age of 90. In a 1973 item about one of Cowleys books, Works and Days of the Lost Generation, William Styron quoted his take on the shape and meaning of a literary legacy: A generation is no more a matter of dates than it is one of ideology. A new generation does not appear every 30 years.
