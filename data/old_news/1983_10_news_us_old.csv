THE DEMANDS OF HIGH-TECH LAWYERING","^Roy N. Freed, a Boston attorney, writes frequently on legal questions related to high technology and is founder of the Computer Law Association. ^By ROY N. FREED ^c.1983 N.Y. Times News Service Picture a scenario along the following lines. The head of computer operations at a major research hospital is shocked to learn that a group of ''hackers'' in Podunk has got into its computer system, destroyed records of many years of research work done under a grant from a medical device manufacturer and apparently rummaged around in patients' records besides. The story hits the national press. In an atmosphere of great public embarrassment, the hospital's president calls in its eminent, gray-haired legal counsel. He is asked for guidance on how to bolster the institution's reputation by teaching the hackers a lesson, and to fend off lawsuits by the manufacturer whose research money is at stake, by patients whose privacy is invaded and by the supplier of the systems security software program, whose reputation is besmirched. If you think that this story is fanciful, reread your newspapers of recent months. And think how much the hospital will have to pay for the complex legal assistance such a situation demands. Will it get its money's worth? Much depends on the care with which it chooses its legal counsel and the extent to which its attorneys have educated themselves in the intricacies of high technology. Not many decades ago, such questions were unimagined, because most corporate legal matters were much simpler than they are today.",1983-10-02T05:00:00+0000

But sometimes the I.R.S. itself makes a change after studying a thorny issue. Some recent changes provide a mixed bag for taxpayers, but should have a widespread impact, since they involve some of the most sought-after tax breaks. Two court decisions concern the home office deduction, and one of them might literally be music to the ears of those who prefer a liberal interpretation in this area. The other will likely strike a discordant note. Another court case may make interest-free loans more attractive. And an internal I.R.S. ruling on individual retirement accounts may help increase I.R.A. returns for millions of Americans. HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION. A Federal appeals court has ruled that a musician employed by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra who maintained home practice studios was entitled to this deduction. But another appeals court rejected a claim by a man who used a room in his house to receive telephone calls connected with his job as a condominium manager. The musician involved was Ernest Drucker, a violinist for the Metropolitan Opera. Mr. Drucker set aside one room of his five-room apartment for exclusive use as a practice studio, and furnished it with stereo components, a piano, hundreds of books, records and tapes, musical scores, music stands, a desk and three violins. He used the studio about 30 hours a week and, during opera season, spent about 26 hours a week performing or rehearsing at Lincoln Center, where the Met is located. Mr. Drucker argued that his studio fulfilled an I.R.S. requirement that a home office serve as the principal place of business.",1983-10-02T05:00:00+0000

us,PRESSURE GROWS TO RENOUNCE DEBT,"The president of Argentina's central bank was held for questioning today on his return from an International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, as nationalist sentiment mounted to halt talks on repayment of Argentina's huge foreign debt. Repaying the $40 billion is increasingly seen as an affront to Argentine sovereignty. Officials of the Economics Ministry who have been negotiating with creditors to delay repayments have been charged in courts with treason. Argentine lawyers representing American banks have been threatened in anonymous phone calls. And a federal judge in Rio Gallegos has forced the central bank to halt all movement of foreign exchange out of the country, blocking payments for imports. The military Government of President Reynaldo Bignone has scheduled national elections, the first in nearly a decade, for Oct. 30 and every major political party has demanded the suspension of debt negotiations until a civilian government takes over in January. The drama heightened today when Julio Gonzalez del Solar, president of the central bank, was taken into custody. He was ordered held by the judge in Rio Gallegos, who is investigating ''violations of sovereignty'' in a contract that refinanced debts owed by Aerolineas Argentinas, the state airline. Mr. Gonzalez del Solar, who was not charged, holds a position similar to that of Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. The judge in Rio Gallegos, Federico Pinto Kramer, said a $230 million agreement signed three weeks ago by international banks and the airline violated Argentine sovereignty by giving New York courts some jurisdiction over payment disputes.",1983-10-04T05:00:00+0000

us,OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS ON THE IRISH STAGE,"Imagine the English-language drama without Farquhar, Sheridan, Wilde, Synge, O'Casey and Samuel Beckett, and you'll speedily see how tremendous Ireland's contribution has been and is. Indeed, it wouldn't the least surprise me to learn that Shakespeare's oeuvre was really written by Seamus O'Draimatoigh, an obscure penpusher in Francis Bacon's secretariat. It would be foolish to generalize very far about so diverse a collection of playsmiths, but one quality they would seem to share, along with humor and verbal brio, is a highly skeptical turn of mind. Nowhere is this more marked than among those who, instead of assimilating into cultures overseas, continued to write about their own fellow- countrymen. ''We are bound to notice, as a continuing and determining factor,'' declares the critic Raymond Williams - Synge and O'Casey especially in his thoughts - ''how little respect, except in the grand gestures, the Irish drama had for the Irish people.''",1983-10-09T05:00:00+0000

He gave them a cast of characters, a resilient plot, a setting, a repertory of images, a style, a keyhole view of society, an ethos and, above all, a hero. Sam Spade is an old American type brought up to date, Hawkeye become private eye with fedora and street smarts instead of leatherstockings and wood lore, his turf the last frontier of San Francisco. The invention of a new popular genre is to the lesser world of literature what the invention of a new form of government is to the larger world of institutions - and just as rare.

It also cut subsidies on basic foodstuffs in half and promised to support the value of the bank shares. Such austerity measures were cheered by some and scorned by others. Israelis flooded stores, buying up goods before the devaluation took effect, and many called for the resignation of Finance Minister Yoram Aridor, whose economic policies have been under attack for months.

By Ken Kashiwahara AIPEI ON THE MORNING OF Aug. 21 was hot and humid, so warm that Ninoy was not wearing his bulletproof vest underneath his cream-colored safari suit with a patch bearing his initials, ''BSA'' - for Benigno S. Aquino. It was the same suit he had worn when he left Manila three years ago. We left the Grand Hotel for the airport at 9:30 A.M., resembling the archetypal tourists loaded down with cameras, shoulder bags, hand luggage and other traveling paraphernalia. Traffic to the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, where we were taking the 11 o'clock China Airlines flight to Manila, was unexpectedly smooth and we arrived at 10:10 A.M., which was far too early for Ninoy to enter the terminal. Since he wanted to proceed to the boarding gate at the last minute to reduce the chances of being detected, he had his car circle the airport. Earlier in the morning, a friend had taken our tickets and passports to check us in ahead of time; Ninoy was prepared to have military officials meet him at the airport and escort him to prison, and he had asked that his baggage claim stubs be stapled to my ticket.",1983-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Now the actor has returned to the part - playing it on stage for the first time in the revival of the musical ''Zorba'' - and you might say he is tempting the fates. One exaggerated move, and Mr. Quinn would lose the spontaneity that made the image of Zorba first grab us.

The officials said that in case of an emergency, the Jordanians would be airlifted not only by their own planes but also by United States transports that would go to the region. Initially, officials said the Administration was seeking $220 million for military equipment to start up the Jordanian force and there was no mention of any United States Air Force involvement. (Page 1, Col. 6.) A warning about Central America was voiced by Henry A. Kissinger, chairman of the President's commission on the region, who said that the situation there was ''graver than most of us had expected.''

Samuelson, now 68, is Institute Professor of Economics at M.I.T. He was awarded the prize for his influential and widely read works, which raised the level of scientific analysis in economic theory. Having completed a revised volume of ''Foundations of Economic Analysis,'' he is working on the 12th edition of his classic beginning textbook, ''Economics''; a fifth volume of his lectures will appear next year. 1971 - Simon S. Kuznets, 82, is professor emeritus of economics at Harvard University. He was honored for his contributions to national income accounting that made possible quantitative studies of the comparative growth of nations. He retired from active teaching in 1971. His most recent research and writing has been in the field of income inequalities. 1972 - Kenneth J. Arrow, 62, is Joan Kenney Professor of Economics at Stanford University. He won the Nobel award, with Sir John R. Hicks of Britain, for work in the abstract field of equilibrium theory. (See article above.) He is now studying the role of small companies in the innovative process and, separately, developing a theory to account for information transfer problems within organizations. 1973 - Wassily W. Leontief, 77, is director of the Institute for Economic Analysis at New York University.

The Pickens group, which includes the Belzberg family from Canada, told the S.E.C. that its purpose was to increase the value of Gulf stock. It recommended the company either split into a number of parts or, particularly, place its key oil and gas properties in a royalty trust, which would give shareholders a direct interest in the assets and avoid double taxation. Gulf has reportedly lined up $4 billion in bank credits and is expected to fight Mr. Pickens fiercely.

Will they cover many areas of the arts and entertainment, or will they settle on a few most popular formulas?

When vintage material goes out of fashion, it may remain so, never returning to the price levels it once enjoyed.

The obvious question, of course, is why someone who merited an invitation in years past doesn't still merit one. And the first thing to clear up is that merit has nothing to do with it. The individual who has been crossed off the list hasn't changed from friend to enemy, or from a pleasant human being into a miserable wretch.

Its edge is serrated into a labyrinthian pattern of points and coves; a network of backwaters, rivers and creeks intrudes far inland; everywhere land and water intertwine. With thousands of miles of shoreline, it is no wonder that the life of the Eastern Shore is focused intensely around the Bay. Houses - stately old colonial manors, farmhouses and shacks - are set at water's edge. Travel is often conducted by water. Docks are as commonplace as picket fences.

On the surface, this may seem obvious - it shouldn't be surprising that Russian music sounds peculiarly Russian. But think about it in more global terms: In Germany and France, for instance, musical language has changed so radically that mid-20th-century German and French works have precious little in common with their late 19th-century predecessors. With Russian music, by contrast, once you look beyond certain superficial harmonic developments, you can't help but notice that the qualities that make Shostakovich's music sound Russian are the same as those that make Tchaikovsky's sound Russian.",1983-10-23T05:00:00+0000

 FOR A SONG","Convinced that Long Island harbors legions of unsung songwriters just waiting for their big chance to be heard, the Babylon Citizens Council on the Arts has moved into the vacuum with a song-writing contest. And today at 8 P.M., after a committee sifted through 80 entries by 40 different tunesmiths, 24 finalists will get the exposure they've dreamed of when the council stages the contest at the North Babylon High School. Drawn from all walks of life - ''We've got businessmen as well as musicians,'' said Mike Kenny, executive director of the council - the finalists offer songs that run the gamut from country-western to pop to soft rock music. In addition to having their work performed in public, the songwriters are vying for prizes that will be awarded by seven judges. The high school is on Phelps Lane, and tickets are $3 or $2 for students and the elderly. TIMERMAN ON L.I. ",1983-10-23T05:00:00+0000

us,THE KEY TO REFORM: FINDING THE TEACHERS,"RACINE, Wis. white s THERE is no lack of generals who are calling for a campaign to improve the public schools. But what is lacking is an army of teachers trained to fight the battle for reforms. The nation's major universities, by largely abandoning teacher training, have done little to provide those important troops. The research universities haven't had teacher education on their agenda,"" J. Myron Atkin, dean of the School of Education at Stanford University, complained last week at a gathering of the deans of education of 17 leading universities. The meeting, held at the Johnson Foundation's Wingspread Conference Center here, was called to discuss how to build up a teaching force without which all the calls for better schools will fizzle. And while the deans agreed on the need to join forces to improve teacher education, they seemed less certain about how to do it. Although they never admitted it in so many words, they left little doubt that teacher education is in chaos. Schools of education attached to major universities today train fewer classroom teachers than in the past, and some have gone out of the teacher training business altogether. They prefer to do research, leaving the crucial task of teacher training to lesser institutions. Research is more glamorous than service in the trenches. Dealing with bright Ph.D. candidates, as one dean admitted, is more exciting than preparing teachers for the first grade. Although there was no formal agreement on the issue, the sense of the meeting was that leading universities must once again make teacher training first in priority. But what kind of training? The profession is seriously split. One faction would follow the medical model, with its internship and residency; another faction charges that such ""apprenticeship"" fails to imbue future teachers with fundamental philosophies of education. Most of the deans seemed to feel that reliance on apprenticeship limits the apprentice too narrowly to one model. ""The public needs to make the decision - do we really want somebody teaching the children who is merely an apprentice?"" asked Robert H. Koff, dean of the school of education at the State University of New York at Albany. Others view apprenticeship as an essential but currently missing, ingredient that should be added to, rather than replace, theoretical training. They consider current reliance on once-over-lightly student teaching insufficient to prepare future teachers for the classroom. Most new teachers face their first assignment with a sense of inadequacy, if not outright terror. Some observers critical of this way of teacher education say it is as if physicians got only their theoretical training in medical school and came face to face with real patients only after being licensed. Despite disagreement on such crucial questions, the deans unanimously insisted on the need for solid grounding in the subjects the trainees would be teaching: teachers must know what to teach before learning how to teach it. In fact, most of these prominent educators recommended that all future high school teachers at least major in the academic subject they want to teach during their four undergraduate years. This would be followed by a one-year master's program in education. The educators worried about a new trend: As critics of the schools, and particularly legislators, impose tough requirements for licensing teachers, local schools that are unable to find enough teachers, particularly in mathematics and science, are given waivers to permit unqualified people to teach. This is new, but the deans find the situation getting worse. They see a rash of quick-fix retraining. ""You go into a six-week summer course as a social studies teacher, and come out as a math teacher,"" one of them said. The trend is dangerous because it creates the impression that children are taught more science, mathematics or whatever other subjects the reform proposals call for; but the added subjects appear only on the students' records, not in their minds. The deans were not overly optimistic about prospects for a dramatic rise in the number of high-ranking high school students who want to become teachers. ""We are crazy to think we are going to get the best and the brightest,"" said one of the educators, who did not want to be identified. ""We need to do a better job of training that middle third from whom most of our teachers will come."" Until pay and conditions improve greatly, the the best students will shun teaching. Does this mean that the schools will have to give up all hope of drawing outstanding young people into teaching? Not, said the deans, if high-quality colleges and universities refrain from abandoning their teacher training function, as some have already done or are contemplating. Instead, the deans agreed, these schools should be trying to seduce some outstanding students into teaching. This can only happen, however, if the universities as a whole, not just their schools or departments of education, take an interest in the needs of the public schools. What emerged was an admission that the generals would have to spend more time with their troops. Painful as it may seem to many university- based teacher education people, status-rich research may have to take a back seat to activism in the field. One dean put it bluntly: ""We can't blame the politicians who are pushing in all directions, if we don't tell them where we want to go."" - ABOUT EDUCATION",1983-10-25T05:00:00+0000

But the invaders' advance was reportedly slowed in the afternoon by heavy fire in the capital. (Page A1, Column 5.) President Reagan announced he had ordered the invasion of Grenada by nearly 1,900 Marines and Army airborne troops to protect United States citizens and to help restore democratic institutions in the Caribbean island. The casualties were said to be low. Mr. Reagan said the operation was launched in response to an urgent request from countries close to Grenada, some of which provided 300 troops for the assault. The United States, he said, ''had no choice but to act strongly'' to oppose ''a brutal gang of leftist thugs'' that violently seized power on Oct. 12 and later executed the ousted Prime Minister and other Cabinet members.

A founder of Futurism, the Italian homage to speed and movement, Carr a went on to join with Giorgio de Chirico in the ''metaphysical'' school of painting, winding up as a slightly revisionist Renaissance old master.

If the rock genre was invented by unsophisticated people as a mode of spontaneous self-expression, Mr. Simon has used it to analyze his own very literary kind of angst in albums that want to be both commercially successsful and critically recognized art works. These contradictions run to the core of Mr. Simon's latest album, ''Hearts and Bones'' (Warner Bros. 23924-1), his first studio album since the soundtrack for his movie ''One Trick Pony.''

All reported substantial earnings for the third quarter - normally the industry's low point. Yet the weak sister, American Motors continues to struggle, reporting its 15th consecutive quarterly loss. G.M. posted record third-quarter earnings of $737 million, a fivefold increase from 1982. Ford recovered from a $325 million loss last year and earn $333 million, while Chrysler's earnings rose tenfold to $100 million. Analysts predict that the money will continue to pour into the auto makers' coffers during the fourth quarter. They add, however, that the Big Three can expect the unions soon to begin claiming a portion of those profits for themselves in the form of higher wages. And the industry strength continued into October. Domestic car sales rose 41 percent in the mid-October period to an annual selling rate of 7.6 million cars, somewhat higher than the 7 million rate during September. Meanwhile, Japan appears to have decided to take a bigger slice of the market. Its new trade minister told the White House that Japan would not go along with the requested import quotas of 1.8 million cars in 1984.
