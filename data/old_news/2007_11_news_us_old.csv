us,Croatian Rocker Draws Anti-Nazi Protests,"Two concerts by a Croatian rocker scheduled for a Midtown Manhattan church center have ignited protests from Jewish and Serbian groups incensed by shows that they say glorify a puppet Croatian government that collaborated with the Nazis, The Associated Press reported. The focus of fury is Marko Perkovic, who goes by the stage name Thompson (as in the submachine gun) and whose folk-inspired heavy-metal music has drawn crowds in Europe. He has been criticized for a song that uses a slogan employed by the puppet Ustasha regime in World War II, and critics say some of his fans have given the Nazi salute and worn black T-shirts and caps styled after the uniforms of the puppet regime. Mark Weitzman, a spokesman for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, said that while some of Mr. Perkovics songs have a positive message of patriotism and peace, there is also an element that appears to glorify the regime that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II and that was responsible for thousands and thousands of deaths of Jews, Serbs and other Croats. Similar criticism came from Nenad Milinkovic, president of the board of a Serbian-American church in Manhattan. Mr. Perkovic, 42, said his performances had been misinterpreted. Im a musician, not a politician, he said in June after a concert for 50,000 fans in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. At my concerts I sing about love, God and the homeland  only about that and nothing else. Mr. Weitzman urged Cardinal Edward M. Egan, the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, to cancel the concerts, at a cultural center operated by the Croatian Church of St. Cyril & Methodius, at 10th Avenue and 41st Street. Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said church officials were investigating but had found nothing to substantiate the accusations.

In its news release, the station did not mention Bernard McGuirk, the producer whose on-air observation about the Rutgers womens basketball team touched off the racially and sexually tinged exchange that got Mr. Imus fired. But the plan is for Mr. McGuirk to return in a role off microphone, said one person apprised of the stations plans who would speak only anonymously about matters not mentioned in the release. In a telephone interview, Phil Boyce, vice president of news-talk programming for Citadel, noted Mr. Imuss more than three decades of experience on New York City radio before adding, The chance to get Don is something we couldnt pass up. Mr. Boyce said he expected other Citadel radio affiliates to carry Mr. Imuss show, but he was not ready to say which ones. The Imus show will replace that of Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby. Mr. Boyce said he hoped to find another place on the WABC schedule for Mr. Sliwa but did not expect to keep Mr. Kuby, a civil rights lawyer. Asked why, he said he had no further comment.",2007-11-02T04:00:00+0000

Be patient with him, Forster urged. He does not go with a swing, and only gradually draws you into his mesh. And be intelligent. It is so easy to read books stupidly, not with our full powers, and Proust makes no concessions to stupidity. Some writers  and they are great writers  do make concessions.

In a time known in trendier circles for literary exile, Russo is the unofficial poet laureate of uneasy stasis, of fixing yourself to the place where you were born. Out the window goes the dynamism of American self-invention; in comes something almost more mysterious: a reckoning with an apparently seamless life continuity.

us,The Turning of an Atheist," Unless you are a professional philosopher or a committed atheist, you probably have not heard of Antony Flew. Eighty-four years old and long retired, Flew lives with his wife in Reading, a medium-size town on the Thames an hour west of London. Over a long career he held appointments at a series of decent regional universities  Aberdeen, Keele, Reading  and earned a strong reputation writing on an unusual range of topics, from Hume to immortality to Darwin. His greatest contribution remains his first, a short paper from 1950 called Theology and Falsification. Flew was a precocious 27 when he delivered the paper at a meeting of the Socratic Club, the Oxford salon presided over by C. S. Lewis. Reprinted in dozens of anthologies, Theology and Falsification has become a heroic tract for committed atheists. In a masterfully terse thousand words, Flew argues that God is too vague a concept to be meaningful. For if Gods greatness entails being invisible, intangible and inscrutable, then he cant be disproved  but nor can he be proved. Such powerful but simply stated arguments made Flew popular on the campus speaking circuit; videos from debates in the 1970s show a lanky man, his black hair professorially unkempt, vivisecting religious belief with an English public-school accent perfect for the seduction of American ears.

After eight years, I was due for another collection of nonfictional prose. To which one might add that he seems determined to give everyone his or her due. Indeed, in a highly affable preface he wonders if his only fault might be a tendency to be critical  in the ordinary sense of the term  at all. Rereading his book reviews, he wonders aloud if their customary geniality, almost effusive in the presence of a foreign writer or a factual topic, didnt somewhat sour when faced with a novel by a fellow-countryman. Should he perhaps have been a little kinder to E. L. Doctorow, Don DeLillo and Norman Rush or (by implication) a fraction more harsh with Ngugi wa Thiongo and Haruki Murakami?

us,"Performa 07: Adam Pendleton, Artists and Statistics","My first Performa outing, to Adam Pendletons The Revival, on Thursday night, was a pretty impressive experience. The setting was the cavernous, immaculate space of the Stephan Weiss studio in Greenwich Village (what did the sculptor do with all that space?), outfitted with benches in a slight fan shape around the stage  and it was packed with fashionable Performa people, some standing near the back. The back was where Mr. Pendleton emerged from, but first his disembodied golden voice floated over the crowd, and over the choir and musicians on the stage. With a mixture of oratory, poetry, politico-speak and strident gay protest, he held sway for just on an hour, alternating his resonant, often repetitive text with the choirs gorgeous sonorities.I had my reservations about the text  for one, the section where Mr. Pendleton quotes Aids statistics and talks about the Bush Administrations responses to HIV infection felt like an obligatory gay rights insert rather than integral to the piece. But the man is the most charismatic performer Ive seen on stage for a long time  and the acoustics at the studio were extraordinary  for once, the meaning of crystal clear seemed appropriate: you could hear everything from a whisper to the full-throated roar of the choir with utter purity.It was also an extraordinarily polished and well-paced show, from the grave processional entrance of the choir to their departure and Mr. Pendletons final monologue and slow exit  out back, the way he had come in. But despite that, there was a relaxed enjoyment of performance and involvement amongst the choir that was a pleasure to see. And their singing really did communicate the uplifting joyousness of that religious tradition without quite speaking directly of religion.But quite aside from the piece itself, what struck me strongly was that it was the second time in one week that a performer was up there on stage quoting statistics about life in America to an audience. In his wonderful new work, Misuse Liable to Prosecution, the choreographer John Jasperse offers the audience numbers about the war, the arts, the salaries of various figures, and the costs of his production. Adam Pendleton does something similar in his Aids section. Are artists feeling that things are so bad that their art forms  poetry, the dancing body in these cases  are too inchoate for what they need to say?

The face of the golden pharaoh is amazing, said Zahi Hawass, above center, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo, adding, It has magic; it has mystery; it has beauty; and his buck teeth are similar to the rest of his familys. The occasion was the removal of the pharaohs mummy from its ornate stone sarcophagus, discovered in 1922, to a nearby climate-controlled case where experts say it will be better preserved. Putting the mummy in this case will make the golden king live forever, Mr. Hawass said. Each day, hundreds of visitors file through his tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor, carrying with them bacteria, humidity and pollutants. The mummy risked being reduced to dust because of the rising levels of humidity due to the visitors, Mr. Hawass said. Rejecting a popular theory that Tut died of a blow to the neck at 19, Egyptian, Swiss and Italian experts have deduced that he did die at 19, after a 10-year reign, but that the cause was an injury to his left leg, which then turned gangrenous. When Tuts tomb was discovered, his embalmed body was encased in three sarcophagi, one of them solid gold, and his face lay beneath a 24-pound solid-gold burial mask encrusted with lapis lazuli and other semiprecious stones. The latest in the popular King Tut exhibitions is to open in London this month and will return to the United States next year.",2007-11-05T05:00:00+0000

For the night, NBCs Sunday Night Football edged past CBS for first place among adults 18 to 49, while ABC had a rare third-place finish, despite leading the 9 p.m. hour with Desperate Housewives (18.5 million).

The novel is narrated by a ghostwriter for a former British prime minister, Adam Lang, who is writing his memoirs. Lang recently stepped down after a sharp slide in popularity because of his support for an American-led war, and his first collaborator has mysteriously died. In an interview, Mr. Polanski, who lives in France and had been working with Mr. Harris on a film adaptation of Mr. Harriss novel Pompeii, said he read The Ghost and knew right away that he wanted to turn it into a film. A political thriller is exactly what I wanted, said Mr. Polanski, the director of Chinatown and Rosemarys Baby, who won an Oscar for The Pianist in 2003. I like books that I cant put down, and at the same time its a kind of satire on certain political situations with which we are only too well acquainted. A large portion of The Ghost takes place on Marthas Vineyard; Mr. Polanski wont be able to film there because he has remained a fugitive since fleeing the United States in 1978 to avoid prison after pleading guilty to statutory rape. It doesnt really matter where you do it, Mr. Polanski said, referring to filming The Ghost, which he hopes to begin next fall.

Mike and Paula have dreaded this moment for years: Earlier this evening they planned a terminal supper, and made love in a special, a poignant, a farewell way. As the narrator sees it, the ordeal to come is her husbands real moment of judgment, and she tells her children that they will be in a position to decide in his favor or not. She says she has no idea how Nick and Kate will react to his news: I picture a bomb going off and this house falling to bits. I picture everything remaining oddly, precariously, ominously the same. An unexploded bomb. It still might go off  next week, the week after, any time. The big secret, which seems pretty obvious to the attentive reader early on, is revealed about halfway through the novel  and this is fair warning to readers who would prefer not to know: that Mike is not the twins biological father, that they were conceived by artificial insemination, using an anonymous donors sperm.

The ruling on Thursday was in response to motions filed by a group seeking to stop this financially troubled school from selling the works to increase its endowment. The paintings, including Men of the Docks (1912), below, by George Bellows, were to be sold through Christies this month in New York, for an estimated $25 million to $35 million. Judge J. Leyburn Mosby Jr. of the Lynchburg Circuit Court found that the harm if the art is sold is greater than the harm if the art is not sold. The injunction is to take effect once the opponents to the sale post a $10 million bond. The college, in Lynchburg, will appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court and hopes to have the decision reversed before the first auction on Nov. 19, a college spokeswoman said. Another motion previously filed by Randolph College asks the circuit court to determine whether the school can legally sell or share 36 pieces of art bought from a trust bequeathed by a former professor.",2007-11-10T05:00:00+0000

I just never took to him. And I don't like Jimmy Stewart as a cowboy. I love him, but just not as a cowboy; ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' is one of my favorite films. I love Capra. I love Preston Sturges. But we're talking about westerns. ... I have always admired Clint Eastwood's westerns. The spaghetti westerns were a great discovery. And ''Pale Rider.'' As a child, the John Ford film ''Cheyenne Autumn'' made a big impression on me. And ''Five Easy Pieces.'' It's not really a western, but it is about the possibilities that can be found in the West. Jack Nicholson is sublime in that film, just sublime. It's the most stultifying portrait of middle-class life. You want to flee from that world and head anywhere less civilized. Which is, of course, the appeal of the West: It's not tamed yet. ",2007-11-10T07:34:00+0000

He won over the country by beating top-ranked U.S.C. as a 41-point underdog. Now can he win over recruits?

This led to Stanford beginning an innovative new program where they actually buy houses for their football team coordinators to live in and give the assistant coaches a $3,000 per month housing stipend. That would buy a mansion in Muncie, Ind., the home of Ball State and the least expensive university town. A 4-bedroom house there costs an average of $150,000.

Chief among these were William and Ceil Baring-Gould, who in The Annotated Mother Goose (1962), asserted connections between famous people and such characters as Jack Horner and Miss Muffet; the spider who sat down beside her, incidentally, was said to be the Protestant reformer John Knox. Equally quotidian was Geoffrey Handley-Taylor, whose humorless disapproval of Mother Goose in 1952 appears in his census of crimes to be found therein: under means of murder, for example, two cases of choking and one each of devouring, being cut in half, decapitation, squeezing, shriveling, starvation, boiling, hanging and drowning.

This powerhouse of a book spans a dauntingly complicated time in Picassos life and in European history as well, taking us from World War I and Picassos adventures with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes to the riotously erotic images of Picassos youthful mistress, Marie-Thrse Walter, and the darkening situation of the early 1930s. Richardson obviously delights in a life that in this account takes on some of the bewildering complexity of a three-ring circus. And why not? Picasso himself often chose to refract his experiences through the world of clowns and jugglers and gymnasts, whether in the melancholy portraits of saltimbanques that absorbed him in the first years of the 20th century or in the long series of etchings, with their densely plotted, sometimes wildly comic dream-narratives, that are a commanding achievement of the years leading up to his death in 1973 at the age of 91.

Officially, of course, its death has been documented again and again, with regret and, sometimes, with satisfaction. But as soon as the obsequies have been pronounced and the coffin lowered into the sandy earth, the rumble of hoofbeats sounds on the horizon, and the western rides again. In 1991, for example, the critic J. Hoberman published a thorough and persuasive essay called How the Western Was Lost, documenting the waning of a once-vigorous form. That same year, however, Kevin Costners Dances With Wolves won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, a feat Clint Eastwoods Unforgiven would match two years later. But Hoberman surely had a point. The movie western had retreated from its position as a quintessential and vital form of American storytelling, undone by the same cultural tumult that had put paid to other manifestations of midcentury consensus. The newer westerns, the ones made since Vietnam, were either revivalist or revisionist, seeking to bury the old myths or to exhume them. ",2007-11-11T05:00:00+0000

And before 2000, Hertzs chief executive reported directly to senior managers such as the chief financial officer and vice chairman of Ford, a previous owner of Hertz; the chief executive did not report to lower-level managers.

It was a real illumination, Day-Lewis told me late in August as he sat at the rough wood dining table of a duplex apartment in downtown Manhattan, where he and his wife, Rebecca Miller, and their two boys stay when in New York. I saw Taxi Driver five or six times in the first week, and I was astonished by its sheer visceral beauty. I just kept going back  I didnt know America, but that was a glimpse of what America might be, and I realized that, contrary to expectation, I wanted to tell American stories. It was raining hard outside, and Day-Lewis, who has the look of an elegant vagabond, was wearing clothes seemingly chosen many years ago for their utility and subtle details. His loose denim jeans were worn soft and white by use and the once-vibrant red plaid of his shirt had aged into a warm maroon. Day-Lewis is tall and lean and has tattoos circling his lower arms and the permanently inked handprints of his and Millers two sons climbing up his body to his shoulders. There were gold loops in each earlobe, and although he had left his sturdy, beat-up leather work boots outside the front door and was padding around in his socks, Day-Lewis still had a kind-of-jaunty porkpie hat on his head.

Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, his national security adviser and, later, secretary of state, were simultaneously visionaries and cynics, according to the historian Robert Dallek (pictured below). Both were ruthless pragmatists and insecure loners who distrusted and abused those around them, including each other. Their partnership produced bold foreign policy advances like the opening of relations with China in 1971-72, but also prolonged and expanded the Vietnam War and overthrew the democratically elected government of Chile. Relying on recently declassified material, including thousands of pages of transcriptions of Kissingers phone calls, Dallek argues that the careers of both men reflect the extent to which great accomplishments and public wrongdoing can spring from inner lives. Another secretary of state with a complicated relationship to his president is the subject of SOLDIER: The Life of Colin Powell (Vintage, $17.95), by the Washington Post editor Karen DeYoung. Her presentation of Powells early career draws heavily on his 1995 memoir; six long interviews with Powell inform DeYoungs sympathetic account of his contribution to the Bush administrations case for war. DeYoung sees Powells willingness to promote a policy he questioned as rooted in his habitual caution and his view of his duty: His job was to serve the president, not to undermine him, Michael Lewis explained in the Book Review.",2007-11-11T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Dudamels many musical gifts aside, he manages to project a good-natured sincerity, an earnestness that seems entirely genuine. When Emanuel Ax, the soloist, played an encore, Mr. Dudamel sat down right in the string section and listened. When he took his bows, he did so off the podium, shoulder to shoulder with the string players, his arm draped over a cellist.***The orchestra players did their signature act, donning jackets with the Venezuelan colors (red, yellow and blue) after a solemn and grandiose Beethoven Fifth Symphony and generally turning into the definition of flamboyance  spinning instruments, standing up and jiving, shimmying, pointing their horns into the air  for the Latin-inflected part of the program. But the same kind of physical enthusiasm, not choreographed and not premeditated, was evident in the Beethoven, where the first violins rocked back and forth together, almost synchronized. For those who missed the concert, the unbridled Latin act  totally infectious  can be seen in several previous versions on YouTube, most prominently from a London Proms concert.***Venezuelan pride was not just on the stage. Several audience members hung the nations flag over the rail of the first balcony and waved it during applause.***On the groups big night at Carnegie, a mishap hit the viola section. A string appeared to break on a first-stand instrument during the first movement of the Beethoven. The players passed it back to the tail end of the section. A last-stand violist passed a replacement instrument forward and changed strings on the viola that had come down the line.

As previously reported, the band will sell the album in an arrangement with ATO Records and a related spinoff label, TBD Records. Representatives of the band, which is fronted by Thom Yorke, above, said yesterday that ATO planned to seek radio airplay for two of the albums songs, Bodysnatchers and Jigsaw Falling Into Place. Questions about the prospects for selling a CD version of In Rainbows have lingered since the band let fans name their own price  even nothing  for downloading the album from a Radiohead Web site, inrainbows.com. So far, the band has declined to detail how many copies were distributed, or for what price, and has disputed a recent outside study suggesting that more than a million copies were downloaded. (The price of the CD has not yet been set.) The shift to an independent label comes after Radiohead fulfilled its long-term contract with the music giant EMI Group. EMI said last week that it planned to package Radioheads six previous studio albums and a live album in a CD box set, and in other formats, for sale on Dec. 10.",2007-11-13T05:00:00+0000

So far confined to Canada, it is characterized by angry outbursts in bookstores and, more specifically, by the hurling of books, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The causes: the declining United States dollar, the rising Canadian dollar and dust jackets imprinted with prices making books more costly for Canadians. For more than 30 years the value of the Canadian dollar has lagged that of its American cousin; five years ago it was worth 62 American cents. As a result, book jackets customarily show a United States price and a higher Canadian price. But last week the Canadian dollar hit $1.10 against the United States dollar; yesterday it stood at $1.03. Thus book rage and widespread reports of unhappiness among buyers expected to pay the higher price. Some Canadian booksellers, including Wal-Mart Canada, have begun to offer their wares at United States prices; others are giving discounts on the Canadian price, rebates or simply marking down the books.",2007-11-13T05:00:00+0000

(Photo: The author, the day she arrived in the United States, walking off the plane at J.F.K. airport. (Photographs courtesy of Hollee McGinnis.)) I, on the other hand, seemingly dropped out of the sky on a Boeing 747, walking, talking and potty trained. I was adopted in May 1975 at the age of 3  with just the clothes on my back: a little red pant suit and vest, and white sweater trimmed in red. I have no memories of that day I arrived in America  but I have been told stories so many times that I feel like I remember: running up and down the escalators of John F. Kennedy airport after being cooped up in an airplane for 28 hours; my parents giving me lollipops because I was too big for a pacifier to quiet me on the ride to my new home in the suburbs of New York City; and pushing the Uncle Ben's white rice on the floor the first morning and eating the Entenmanns's coffee cakes instead.  My parents told me that summer of my arrival I would sing and talk in Korean. Of course they never knew what I was saying. They also told me that in those first weeks I would run up to the front door, throw my body up against it and cry and cry and say in Korean, ""Jip e ka le!"" My sister, born to my parents and age 9 at the time, thought it might be some strange Korean game. So she would run up to the door, throw her body against it and say, ""Jip e ka le!"" I can imagine my sister doing this over and over  and turning my tears into laughter. Years later my parents learned what my Korean words meant: I want to go home.   (Photo: The author, front row lower left in the red outfit at the orphanage on Tok Chok Island founded by the Maryknoll priest, Ben Zweber (center).)   This illustrates two things: first, that no matter how old a child is when adopted  whether as an infant, a toddler, or young child  they come with a history, a past that is real. Secondly, it illustrates that when we adopt, there is movement. There is a movement from one place to another, from one culture to another, from one family to another, and in these movements there are both losses and gains. The only way a child gains a family through adoption is by losing another family in some way. This paradoxical nature of adoption raises serious questions that need to be resolved: What are adoption gains and losses? And do the gains outweigh the losses?   Growing up, I was not aware of the losses in adoption, just the gains: parents and siblings and friends who loved me. Like many adopted people who have the fortune of being raised in a supportive home, I did not think much about the fact of my adoption. I thought of my adoption as one thinks about breathing  it was simply part of who I was. I was not necessarily conscious of it as a child growing up unless someone pointed it out to me. And I certainly did not feel like there was anything ""wrong"" because I was adopted. I grew up knowing very clearly who I was: I was Hollee.   My personal awakening to the losses of adoption began in my late adolescence when I became aware that strangers assumed I was not an American because I did not have blond hair and blue eyes or assumed I spoke Korean (or Chinese or Japanese) or complimented me on my English. I, on the other hand, did not think of myself as Korean  although I felt pride that I was  because I was raised by a non-Korean family. I felt like an imposter because people assumed I knew Korean culture based on my race, but I only knew American culture.   Thus, in my first year of college I sought to fulfill the stereotypes and assumptions people had of me based on my race. I studied Mandarin  because my college did not offer Korean at that time  and took classes in Asian art and history. But it angered me that people would make assumptions about who I was based on things I could not change: my gender, my race, my adoption status  and judge me not for the individual I was. And so in my sophomore year I changed my major to American studies because I wanted to understand how I, as an Asian woman with an Irish last name and blond-haired mother, could be an American too.   Ultimately I realized this conflict about my identity arose because I felt I had only two choices: Korean or American. The reality was that I was both. I felt to identify simply as being Asian would be to deny the love and nurture of my adoptive parents; and to identify solely as American, I would be denying my Korean ancestry and heritage. When I began to embrace both identities rather than trying to ""fit in"" I realized the gains in my life that came from this duality. I realized, ""Well, hey, not everyone gets to be adopted internationally and have two countries and two families.""   Learning about the history of intercountry adoptions, I knew I was not the only person who might feel caught between these two worlds. In fact, I was inspired by the fact that there was such a large community of adult international adoptees  an estimated quarter million in the United States  who could share their experiences, especially with the younger generation of families being formed through intercountry adoption. I felt that as a community we could truly create a space in which we could explore, and come to embrace and celebrate our dual heritages given to us by birth and adoption.   Thus, two years after college at the age of 24 I started a non-profit organization for adult intercountry adoptees in New York City  Also-Known-As. The goal of the organization was and is to share the unique experiences and identity of intercountry adoptees and their families and to celebrate the broader transcultural community. The organization works to empower those who have been adopted internationally by providing mentorship to adopted youth, building cultural bridges through awareness and appreciation of one's birth culture, and transforming racial stereotypes.   In accepting my identity as an international transracial adoptee, and rejecting the identities imposed upon me, I realized the question, ""Who am I?"" can only be answered by my declaration ""Who I am.""   Who I am is a transcultural, multicultural, interracial, hybrid, bridging worlds, being. I am Hollee McGinnis also-known-as Lee Hwa Yeong. I have an Asian face, an Irish last name, a blond-haired mother.   But who I am is not just about who I know myself to be, but who I want to also be known as in this world. At its best, intercountry adoption demonstrates to me the greatness of our human spirits to love across race, nationality and culture. But I also know that it takes a lot more than just love to make a success;  it requires courage, honesty, and commitment.   This means we must be willing to talk about the hard stuff  the discrimination, inequalities, and prejudices that exist in the world. We must also be willing to change and challenge our societies so that the gift we give our children  adopted or not  besides the love and security of a permanent family is a world that values them for who they are and who they will be  regardless of race, nationality, culture or circumstance.

He said yesterday that he is returning to his hometown, Seattle, to be near his 13-year-old daughter, whose wistful voice-mail message he played in making the announcement. In an interview, Jay Kernis, NPRs senior vice president for programming, said, I think it was just too difficult a situation for Mr. Burbank to be a long-distance dad. While the show is sorry to lose Mr. Burbank, Mr. Kernis said, if we thought we couldnt do it without him, we wouldnt have released him from his contract. NPR budgeted $2 million for the start-up of this New York-based program, which was more than a year in development and has a conversational style intended to appeal to a younger audience than traditionally tunes in to NPR. Audience reaction has been mixed. Visits to the programs Web site have grown markedly, but listeners to Salt Lake Citys KCPW, which precedes the popular Morning Edition with the new program, complained that it isnt substantive enough and some have said they will withdraw financial support. Mr. Kernis said that NPR hoped to have a replacement join the co-host, Alison Stewart, by the time Mr. Burbank leaves in mid-December.",2007-11-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Gomorrah,"The container swayed as the crane hoisted it onto the ship. The spreader, which hooks the container to the crane, was unable to control its movement, so it seemed to float in the air. The hatches, which had been improperly closed, suddenly sprang open, and dozens of bodies started raining down. They looked like mannequins. But when they hit the ground, their heads split open, as if their skulls were real. And they were. Men, women, even a few children, came tumbling out of the container. All dead. Frozen, stacked one on top of another, packed like sardines. These were the Chinese who never die. The eternal ones, who trade identity papers among themselves. So this is where they'd ended up, the bodies that in the wildest fantasies might have been cooked in Chinese restaurants, buried in fields beside factories, or tossed into the mouth of Vesuvius. Here they were. Spilling from the container by the dozen, their names scribbled on tags and tied with string around their necks. They'd all put aside money so they could be buried in China, back in their hometowns, a percentage withheld from their salaries to guarantee their return voyage once they were dead. A space in a container and a hole in some strip of Chinese soil. The port crane operator covered his face with his hands as he told me about it, eyeing me through his fingers. As if the mask of his hands might give him the courage to speak. He'd seen the bodies fall, but there'd been no need to sound the alarm. He merely lowered the container to the ground, and dozens of people appeared out of nowhere to put everyone back inside and hose down the remains. That's how it went. He still couldn't believe it and hoped he was hallucinating, due to too much overtime. Then he closed his fingers, completely covering his eyes. He kept on whimpering, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. ",2007-11-14T10:24:00+0000

That weight-loss competition matched its highest ratings of the season among adults 18 to 49, Nielsen estimated. In total viewers, a category in which NBC ranked fourth for the night, the show drew a modest 8.2 million, far short of the nights most popular shows. NBC led the 10 p.m. hour, as usual, with Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (12.5 million). Meanwhile House attracted 16.9 million viewers while dominating the night in the 18-to-49 set. CBS and ABC finished in a virtual tie for third in that demographic. Both networks had bright spots on their schedules, particularly in terms of total viewers: CBSs NCIS at 8 and ABCs Dancing With the Stars at 9 outdrew House, each with more than 17 million viewers. But new shows on ABC and CBS continued to struggle. CBSs Cane delivered its lowest ratings to date at 10 (7.3 million), as did ABCs new comedies, Cavemen at 8 (4.6 million) and Carpoolers at 8:30 (5.2 million).",2007-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Ms. DeGeneres returned to her syndicated daily talk show last week after sitting out just one day of the strike. That decision drew strong protests from the Writers Guild because Ms. DeGeneres is a member of the union. Her writers have been on strike, but Ms. DeGeneres has said she felt obligated to continue taping shows because other staff members would otherwise be laid off. She received support from a different union, Aftra, which argued in a letter to the Writers Guild that Ms. DeGeneres was obligated as a member to continue to work. Her supporters also noted that unlike other shows, including those of Jay Leno and David Letterman, Ms. DeGeneress is syndicated and could be canceled if obligations were not met. The guild countered that Ms. DeGeneres should have made a personal decision to support the writers. Cancellation of the New York shows does not mean Ms. DeGeneres has joined the strike. She will simply tape the shows at her regular studio in Los Angeles, a representative of the show said.",2007-11-15T05:00:00+0000

Warhol created the original reproductions of Brillo soap pad cartons as part of a 1964 exhibition of art resembling supermarket products. (At right is a version of the 1964 original.) The museum, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, said it had investigated the six Brillo boxes, donated in 1995 by its former director, Pontus Hulten, after a Swedish newspaper claimed that they were copies. In a letter to the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York, the museum director, Lars Nittve, confirmed the claims. These boxes are not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo boxes, Mr. Nittve wrote. The Swedish paper Expressen reported in June that Mr. Hulten, who was director of the museum in the 1960s and the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris in the 1970s and 1980s, had Swedish carpenters build 105 copies of the box for an exhibition in Russia in 1990.

(right), is devoted entirely to one-off, locally owned stores and restaurants  no chains allowed, not even Starbucks. Although a few public efforts, like San Franciscos Hayes Valley (see Page 38) and Denvers Cherry Creek North shopping district (which is 75 percent chain-free), have succeeded in fending off franchises, SouthBridge is the first private urban development of its size to go completely indie. Other projects have made a similar effort. The Second Street District shopping center in Austin, Tex., opened in 2005 with 65 percent local tenants, and the owners of Larimer Square in Denver have spent the last several years letting the leases of places like Williams-Sonoma lapse and replacing them with regional businesses. It all adds up to a more exciting urban landscape. When I go to New York, I love to find the little restaurant no ones heard of, says the SouthBridge developer Fred Unger.

The numbers have been steadily increasing since 2001, when 2,544 resigned; last year 4,273 teachers did so. Of the 7,069 teachers who were hired in 2006, nearly 14 percent resigned by the end of the year, the union said, up from about 11 percent the year before. The numbers showed that losing good teachers is the predominant staffing issue that the City Department of Education needs to address, said Randi Weingarten, the president of the union.

The film, with a screenplay by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, cost Paramount Pictures about $150 million to make and employs technology similar (though updated) to that used by Mr. Zemeckis in The Polar Express in 2004. More than 40 percent of the total receipts came from the 742 3-D theaters showing the film.

The movies cumulative total to date is $93.9 million. Also dropping one spot, to No. 3, was American Gangster (Universal), the 1970s crime thriller starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. That film, directed by Ridley Scott, took in $13.2 million in its third weekend, bringing the total haul so far to $101 million. Falling from third to fourth place was the Vince Vaughn comedy Fred Claus (Warner Brothers) with $12 million in its second weekend and a total of $35.8 million to date.

The former curator, Marion True, did not attend the hearing.

(The Getty acquired the wreath in 1993 and agreed to return it nearly a year ago, citing concerns about its provenance.) Greek investigators assert that the gold wreath was illegally excavated from an archaeological site in the northern province of Macedonia. Ms. True is also on trial in Italy on charges of trafficking in stolen antiquities acquired for the Getty. She has denied wrongdoing in both cases. In a related development The Associated Press reported that a judge in Pesaro, Italy, yesterday dismissed a local prosecutors legal claim to a bronze statue of a youth that is in the Gettys collection. (The statue has also been claimed by Italys national government.) After long negotiations, the museum agreed in August to return 40 other artifacts to Italy.

The law firm, the Center for Individual Rights, filed the suit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on behalf of three Chinese-American parents whose children were denied admission to the Specialized High School Institute, which prepares students for the test determining admission to schools like Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science.

(AAA has a state-by-state gasoline cost and fuel-mileage calculator at www.fuelcostcalculator.com.) While other surveys show that rates at luxury and big city hotels are up, there is some good news. Rates at midlevel hotels with AAA Three-Diamond ratings are down 3 percent from last year.

In Newark, where a new arena recently opened, that city decided at the last minute that at 20 feet from the curb, the arena was too close to the street for comfort, so now Newark closes streets around its arena during events.",2007-11-21T21:43:48+0000

(The final price includes the auction houses commission.) The painting was purchased for $55,000 at auction in 1977 by a Houston man as a present for his wife, but disappeared after being placed in storage in a warehouse about a decade later. Then in 2003 Elizabeth Gibson, who was perusing trash on an Upper West Side sidewalk, spotted the canvas and took it to her apartment, little realizing that it was by a celebrated painter.

Their books did indeed reflect the experience of people like themselves, who were strongly committed to ideals of freedom and individualism. But they did not represent what happened to millions of other people who were not opponents of the regime and did not engage in any kind of substantial dissent, but were still dispatched to labor camps, to exile in remote settlements or to summary execution. As Figes, a leading historian of the Soviet period, concludes in The Whisperers, his extraordinary book about the impact of the gulag on the inner world of ordinary citizens, a great many victims silently accepted and internalized the systems basic values and conformed to its public rules. Behind highly documented episodes of persecution, famine and war lie quieter, desperate stories of individuals and families who did what they could to survive, to find one another and to come to terms with the burden of being physically and psychologically broken. But it was not only repression that tore families apart. The regimes reliance on mutual surveillance complicated their moral burden, instilling feelings of shame and guilt that endured long after years of imprisonment and exile.",2007-11-25T05:00:00+0000

The plaintiff attorneys equate error with negligence (and therefore payment) without exception. I counter that while certainly not desired, and as you point out when someone's life is in your hands we strive to ""avoid mistakes as much as possible"", perfection is not humanly possible. Negligence is, or should be, harmful action beyond the range of customary or expected outcome. In my opinion, this is not the same as error free which is an unattainable standard. Yet, try and convince a lay jury in retrospective analysis a decision, diagnosis, judgment was ""wrong"" but not negligent. ",2007-11-26T06:30:00+0000

The project is to include the partial re-creation of its facade and a towering cupola. A panel of specialists, including the architects David Chipperfield, Giorgio Grassi and Petra Kahlfeldt, is to judge entries in a competition lasting until November 2008, the German building minister, Wolfgang Tiefensee, said. Construction of the new building, which is to house some of Berlins antiquities and art holdings as well as parts of Humboldt University and the city library, is expected to begin in 2010 and be completed in 2013 or 2014, he said. To make way for the reconstituted castle, German lawmakers ordered the razing of the Palace of the Republic, home of the former East German parliament, a huge steel-and-concrete building with bronze-colored windows that opened in 1976. Critics have protested the demolition of the old building, asserting that it holds a beloved place in the citys popular culture and that a rebuilt Baroque castle would be a parody of history.

It also accuses the sergeant, William Sikorsky, of having used unreasonable force to subdue the man, David Mills, on April 21. Jonathan J. Einhorn, the lawyer representing the mother, said yesterday, that theres no question that Mr. Mills was on PCP, an illegal drug, at the time of his death and that the police were justified in responding to an altercation in the neighborhood. The question is, Mr. Einhorn said, did they use excessive force? Connecticuts office of the chief medical examiner ruled in June that the death was an accident.

The move aims to end years of tension and disputes between the current director of the festival, Francis Menotti  the son of the composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who founded the festival in 1958 and who died this year  and local administrators who have objected to the way the festival is managed. The culture ministry has been an important financial supporter. Critics have complained that the infighting had begun to take a toll on the quality of the festivals offerings and its international standing. Mr. Rutelli said the new Spoleto festival, which may operate under a different name, would offer more opportunities to young artists, play host to performances throughout the year and open up to other cultures. Mr. Menotti has not yet responded to the proposed changes. It is a decisive step, based on the desire to recreate, in a few years, an event of national and international standing, Mr. Rutelli said.

Bloomberg of New York and Richard M. Daley of Chicago, have made pronouncements that amount to a race to see which metropolis is the greenest in the country. Theyre retrofitting old city buildings to cut energy waste and greenhouse gases, trying to curtail traffic, putting up solar panels. (For two independent analyses of green cities, go to the Green Guide and Yahoo.)  In the latest move, New York Citys Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, illuminated last night, shines not with old-style incandescent bulbs but with 30,000 electricity-sipping light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, powered in part with solar panels. (And the tree was even cut with a hand saw, the city says.)  There are some signs of spreading green tree envy.   A recent article in The Minneapolis Star Tribune questioned the cost and carbon dioxide emissions from lighting St. Pauls giant, and incandescent-lit, Christmas tree. The headline asked: A bright and shining energy waste?  The reporter, Karen Youso, wrote that the citys tree-lighting practices, with 60,000 incandescent bulbs burning around the clock for five and a half weeks, costs about $1,300 and results in 18.7 tons of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping emission from human activities.  She asked state energy officials to calculate the financial and environmental cost if St. Paul erected the tree and bulbs now blazing in Rockefeller Center. The answer was $136.80 and one-tenth as much carbon dioxide.   Itll be interesting to see what St. Paul and the corporate partners that pay for the display do next year.   What are other cities doing about the kilowatt-hours and carbon dioxide that come with holiday decor? ",2007-11-29T15:50:16+0000

Ill never forget it, he came in to audition and he had the book for Fiddler on the Roof and basically did pretty much the whole song book, Mr. Burton said. I knew he could do it. He has no fear.Mr. Burtons most palpable fears involved Stephen Sondheims reaction to his film. I was so nervous. I think I was more nervous showing it to him than anybody.Before they showed the movie to Mr. Sondheim he told the producers, You show him the movie. Ill be down at the pub down the street.

This past January, at the Dior show, David told me he was planning to bring out a magazine of fashion illustration and asked if Id write something about Joe.
