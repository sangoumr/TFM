The intent is to make the salaries for those jobs more equitable with the salaries for jobs traditionally held by white men. The settlement - with the Civil Service Employees Association - provides at least $16 million for the fund in each of the contract's second and third years. But details of exactly how that money will be distributed and what jobs will be affected remained to be worked out, pending the results of a study and future negotiations.

Today, in its 26th edition, the event will follow tradition, starting at 1 P.M. with the parade itself along Franklin Avenue and ending at the Village Hall, 351 Stewart Avenue. At the hall there will be an Easter egg tree, costumed bunnies handing out lollipops, an exhibit of the cars and the awarding of trophies.

The effect on the artist (which began with the artist's effect on the public) is a statement with which I strongly agree. The artist's effect on the public is the only way in America for dance to survive; he lives, works and relates to his own environment and through that, builds his support. My question about the article is: Are the 58 million dance attendees all in New York?

There are the adventures with the inevitable car chases or the inspirationals with their uplift payoffs. Of course, the results have a failure rate of shameful proportions, but the formula mentality, in tandem with the phenomenon of production by committee, effectively works against originality and almost guarantees a certain level of numbing mediocrity.

us,  Hedberg's 'Fight' Against Violence,"PHILADELPHIA ling$12The lasting image of Anders Hedberg's professional hockey career will include so much more than the stick-raising celebration of a goal. The memory will include scenes like those at The Spectrum Thursday night, in the playoff game between the Rangers and the Flyers, when the buzzer to end each period merely provided an opportunity for everyone to push and shove and grab and fight without being thrown out of the game, and when the officials condoned the type of game Hedberg has long despised. When Hedberg's Ranger teammate Barry Beck reached around a pile of bodies to punch Rick Tocchet, the linesman Will Norris fell to the ice and writhed in pain. When the pile was dispersed and the linesman was still lying on the ice, Hedberg was the one to go back and check on his condition. When the game was over, the Rangers were one game away from the end of their season - Hedberg's last season - and the Spectrum organist was playing the theme from ""Mission Impossible."" Hedberg went around the dressing room, giving little pats of encouragement to his teammates. And when the time came to discuss what had just happened, Hedberg looked each questioner right in the eye and swore that his career had more than one game to go. ""I'm not going to play my last game Saturday; I'll tell you right now,"" he said. ""We're going to be back here next Tuesday. That's it."" His testimony bore no resemblance to the customary empty-sounding words that come from a mediocre team this close to the end of its season. For two nights the Rangers had been far from mediocre. The difference between the best team in the league and the team with the most losses ever to make the Stanley Cup playoffs had been minimal. ""Nothing,"" Hedberg said. He does not wear a captain's ""C"" on his shoulder, but his actions seemed a quiet attempt to squeeze every effort out of his final Ranger team. After 11 consecutive losses to the Flyers, including two in this three-of-five series, Hedberg knows that his insistence on making his 11th professional season his last means that yesterday's practice could be the last of his career, and the game tonight could be the end. But after a loss in overtime, and another in a game that was tied 1-1 in the third period, there is too much work ahead to allow for sentiment. Hedberg seemed offended at the thought that the end could be on his mind. ""I'm not thinking about that,"" he said. ""Why should I? Not at all. I think forward. I'm not thinking backwards."" There are athletes who become misty-eyed near the end, realizing that an important part of their life will soon be over. As Hedberg's final season drew to a close, Ranger management suggested a ceremony and a presentation at a Garden game; he wanted no part of it. The same person who has stood so firmly against the game's fighting preferred to carry out his own fight quietly. A comeback victory over the Flyers, Hedberg said, would mean ""nothing other than we would go on to the next series. That's it. I don't think it would mean any more to me than to a guy who has 10 years to go in this league. I just refuse to believe we're not going to go on to the next series."" His lasting satisfaction can come from his importance as a leader of the European influence into the North American game. In four seasons in the World Hockey Association, and especially when they became Rangers in 1978, Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson were curiosities who were often treated as if they had come from Mars rather than Sweden. Seen as hockey pacifists, they became targets in a sport that often considered thuggery a necessary ploy. Hedberg eventually saw the game take a more positive shape. At least now, the confrontations, the posturing, and the illegal and ignored stick violence in this series is an exception, not the norm. ""I accept it, obviously,"" Hedberg said. ""Otherwise I wouldn't play. Support it? Absolutely not. But hockey has changed tremendously towards a direction where you have a lot less dirty play. And that doesn't mean it's less physical."" The beatings he took in the W.H.A., Hedberg said, were no worse than those in his early days as a Ranger. ""But times have changed,"" he said, ""and teams have changed. Personnel has changed. Thoughts have changed."" For now, though, he remains unwilling to accept any consolation prize. His entire effort now is aimed at postponing that final, playoff-ending handshake. ""Our breaks might come any day,"" Hedberg said, and smiled a thin smile. ""Unfortunately, we can't wait that much longer."" - PLAYERS",1985-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Does a co-op conversion prematurely terminate a sublease agreement? . . . A.S.R. The Bronx Answer: No, unless the lease has such a stipulation, points out Martin A. Shlufman, deputy counsel for rent administration for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. A lease or a sublease is a contract that normally cannot be terminated prior to its expiration date. The $125,000 Exemption Question: I own a two-family house. I rent one apartment and use about half of the other as my home and business. I take a tax deduction for the part I use for business. I am over 55 years old, but my accountant says I cannot take the $125,000 tax exemption on gains from the sale of the house. Is this true? . . . S.F.

Its art could hardly seem more immersed in a continuum, more at ease with itself and more discreet.

The law already forbids any mandatory retirement age for Federal employees. A companion bill to Representative Pepper's has been sponsored for several years in the Senate by Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democrat, who is 70. A similar bill, introduced by Senator John Heinz, a 47-year-old Pennsylvania Republican, would give colleges and universities another 15 years to continue to require that professors retire at 70.

So they have set aside the pristine beauty of the pared-down look and are filling those empty table tops and mantels with beautiful objects old and new, expensive and not so expensive. The result is rooms that are more personal and, to many, more inviting than those of the recent past.

Lutyens was England's greatest architect of great houses in modern times - a crafter of villas that were this century's equivalent of the chateaus and country houses of the past, a maker of buildings that were sprawling in size and grand in scale. But it is not these aristocratic associations that have put Lutyens so much in fashion these days; it is the fact that he was among the most dazzlingly inventive architects who ever lived.",1985-04-14T05:00:00+0000

I was born there, in 1939, on the eve of the outbreak of World War II, and was promptly evacuated with my family to a safer spot - wisely, as it turned out, for Sheffield, the heart of British armaments manufacture and of the steel industry, was very heavily bombed. The air raids of 1940 killed more than 700 people, rendered many thousands homeless and destroyed the commercial center. When we returned after the war, the scars of the blitz were everywhere: in the town's principal shopping street, willow herb blossomed purple from craters and in the surrounding suburbs, intimate domestic interiors were exposed to the public gaze and forlorn scraps of wallpaper flapped from half-demolished walls - abandoned, and abandoned, moreover, for many years, for in the period of austerity after the war nobody could afford to rebuild. Prosperity returned gradually, and it was not until the late 1950's that vast new monuments of public building and socialist aspiration - the municipal government has long been staunchly Labor - began to arise from the ashes, creating the dramatic skyline that Sheffield now presents of high-rise apartment buildings and factory chimneys set against the surrounding hills.",1985-04-14T05:00:00+0000

The plot, whose final twist is all too reminiscent of the movie ''Under Fire,'' follows the adventures of Jack Nash (Bill Tatum), a successful, thrice-married journalist who travels to an unnamed Central American country to interview a famous humanitarian doctor named Paul Barenti (Charles Honce). A contemporary Albert Schweitzer type who runs a jungle clinic, Barenti is given to ponderous pronouncements. ''I think God invented the Devil to test us,'' he reflects.

us,TROTTIER AND JARVIS: KEY FACEOFF,"Hundreds of times, thousands of times, Doug Jarvis has seen everything Bryan Trottier has to offer. But he saw something new this time. ''Different,'' said the Capitals' veteran center, after the Islanders' 6-4 victory tonight knotted the three-of-five-game playoff series at 2-2. ''It was a little different for him,'' said Jarvis, who lost a key draw to Trottier that led to the winning goal with only 68 seconds to play. ''He took a step inside on me, and the puck just seemed to be sitting there. Then he just took his shot.'' With each team having four skaters on the ice, Trottier and Jarvis, with a combined total of over 1,500 regular-season games between them, met in the faceoff circle to the right of Al Jensen, the Capital goalie. With the score 4-4, Jarvis was essentially in a defensive situation, hoping to prevent a shot on net. Both are among the league's toughest faceoff men, but Trottier was in an offensive frame of mind. He wanted to force the puck forward, but when asked later to explain the mechanics of the situation, he would not admit to much more. ''I was just hoping,'' he said. On the drop, the two clashed their sticks together and the puck momentarily stopped. Jensen was holding his ground in the crease. And Rod Langway, a defenseman, began to move toward the dormant puck. ''I anticipated too much,'' said Jarvis, blaming himself for Trottier's success. ''It was a four-on-four situation and I anticipated getting out of the faceoff circle and up ice to the point too quickly.",1985-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,CONFERENCE ON AIDS BEGINS IN ATLANTA,"Preventing the spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS, could eventually require that everyone in the United States be vaccinated against the disease, when and if a vaccine is developed, the director of the Government's AIDS surveillance program speculated today. Researchers are still far from developing such a vaccine, however, according to reports presented here at an international conference on the disease. The conference was sponsored by the Federal Centers for Disease Control. When such a vaccine is developed, said Dr. James W. Curran, head of the Federal centers' AIDS Task Force, ''It will probably be desirable to vaccinate all Americans.'' Current efforts to prevent the spread of the illness, which has struck more than 9,000 people in the United States since 1978, are limited largely to counseling and educating the public, Dr. Curran said. He said that within the next year, AIDS will strike another 9,000 people, many of them homosexual men. Preventing the spread of the illness in homosexuals is becoming nearly impossible, Dr. Curran said, because although homosexuals are having fewer sexual partners, a higher percentage of those partners already will have been exposed to the AIDS virus. Furthermore, as the group of people exposed to the virus ages, the number of AIDS-related cancers and brain diseases will increase, Dr. Curran said. The AIDS virus recently has been shown to affect the brain as well as the immune system. In other presentations at the conference, researchers gave progress reports on two drugs that have shown some ability to block the growth of the AIDS virus in patients. However, it is too soon to say whether either drug will lead to a practical, effective treatment, the researchers said. Both drugs - suramin, being studied at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and HPA23, being investigated at the Pasteur Institute in Paris - have shown some anti-AIDS activity in trials with a handful of patients.",1985-04-16T05:00:00+0000

THE ADVANTAGES OF DIRECT SEEDING","A READER requested information about flowers that can be seeded directly in the garden without having to be transplanted. This method does present several advantages: Seeds usually cost less than plants; the extra work of transplanting is avoided and, not having to withstand the shock of being transplanted, many plants get off to a better start. Conversely, the one disadvantage is that seeding may lead to flowering that is later, since transplants have usually been started and grown indoors well ahead of the time when their seeds can be sown outdoors. But this disadvantage does not always hold true. A number of the so-called winter annuals can be seeded in the garden in early September. They will produce a small rosetta foliage before freezing that will withstand the ravages of winter. Among this group are Shirley poppy, annual larkspur, cornflower and California poppy. They should be protected with a winter mulch of salt hay or straw as one would protect perennials, applying the mulch after the soil has begun to freeze. These plants will start to develop as early as the frost leaves the ground in the spring and will be in flower earlier than all but the largest of greenhouse- started plants. Sweet peas are another old favorite that can be planted in the fall. They are best sown just before the soil freezes, so that they do not germinate until spring. The soil must be well drained so that the seeds do not rot, and they should be planted about six inches deep.",1985-04-21T05:00:00+0000

The same few ideas - big shirts, overscale jackets, short slim skirts, curtain-shirred cocktail dresses - were shown by almost all of them. Often, one well-known designer's interpretation was impossible to distinguish from a colleague's. In the aftermath of last fall's blanketlike obsession with man-tailored clothing - a season in which it was equally difficult to individualize designer offerings - this paucity of creativity, even of clever styling, justifiably produced an aura of apprehension.",1985-04-21T05:00:00+0000

THE ADVANTAGES OF DIRECT SEEDING","A READER requested information about flowers that can be seeded directly in the garden without having to be transplanted. This method does present several advantages: Seeds usually cost less than plants; the extra work of transplanting is avoided and, not having to withstand the shock of being transplanted, many plants get off to a better start. Conversely, the one disadvantage is that seeding may lead to flowering that is later, since transplants have usually been started and grown indoors well ahead of the time when their seeds can be sown outdoors. But this disadvantage does not always hold true. A number of the so-called winter annuals can be seeded in the garden in early September. They will produce a small rosetta foliage before freezing that will withstand the ravages of winter. Among this group are Shirley poppy, annual larkspur, cornflower and California poppy. They should be protected with a winter mulch of salt hay or straw as one would protect perennials, applying the mulch after the soil has begun to freeze. These plants will start to develop as early as the frost leaves the ground in the spring and will be in flower earlier than all but the largest of greenhouse- started plants. Sweet peas are another old favorite that can be planted in the fall. They are best sown just before the soil freezes, so that they do not germinate until spring. The soil must be well drained so that the seeds do not rot, and they should be planted about six inches deep.",1985-04-21T05:00:00+0000

THE ADVANTAGES OF DIRECT SEEDING","A READER requested information about flowers that can be seeded directly in the garden without having to be transplanted. This method does present several advantages: Seeds usually cost less than plants; the extra work of transplanting is avoided and, not having to withstand the shock of being transplanted, many plants get off to a better start. Conversely, the one disadvantage is that seeding may lead to flowering that is later, since transplants have usually been started and grown indoors well ahead of the time when their seeds can be sown outdoors. But this disadvantage does not always hold true. A number of the so-called winter annuals can be seeded in the garden in early September. They will produce a small rosetta foliage before freezing that will withstand the ravages of winter. Among this group are Shirley poppy, annual larkspur, cornflower and California poppy. They should be protected with a winter mulch of salt hay or straw as one would protect perennials, applying the mulch after the soil has begun to freeze. These plants will start to develop as early as the frost leaves the ground in the spring and will be in flower earlier than all but the largest of greenhouse- started plants. Sweet peas are another old favorite that can be planted in the fall. They are best sown just before the soil freezes, so that they do not germinate until spring. The soil must be well drained so that the seeds do not rot, and they should be planted about six inches deep.",1985-04-21T05:00:00+0000

(Yes, he is a politician and, yes, he has been in smoke-filled rooms, but do not make too much of that cigar. It does not affect the image. As he says, you can smoke a cigar and still be a maverick, which is how he sees himself.) Finally, when people see the cigar coming, they say, ''Hey, Doc, how's it going.'' (He is called ''Doc'' because he is a naturopathic physician, which is not exactly a chiropractor and not exactly an osteopath, but, as he says, ''same church, different pew.'') George L. Gunther, 65 years old, was first elected to the Connecticut State Senate in 1966 and has won every Senate campaign in his district here since. In 1984 he overwhelmed his opponent by 19,588 votes.

Hutton to bid up your stock, although their cashless package of junk bonds seems a risky proposition, especially if interest rates rise. You applaud the Turner audacity and await a more solid offer. If you are CBS management, you root for your own continued control. That means beating off raiders and sneering at any ''unfriendly'' offers - even those rewarding to stockholders - that would snatch away your jobs. If your obfuscatory or intimidating tactics fail, this may mean you seek shelter from a ''white knight'' - like G.E., or American Express, where Henry Kissinger is a director - to take over your company and guarantee your jobs. Or you may elect to ''take the company private,'' using the CBS assets as collateral to borrow the money to buy out the present stockholders. If you are Ted Turner or a corporate raider , you cloak your bid for power and self-enrichment in pious concern for stockholders' rights and undervalued assets.

First make sure you are using a good quality air filter, one fine enough to do the job. Second, check to make certain the filter, and the channel or frame in which it sits, fit properly. Air could be slipping past or around the filter instead of going through it. Also, make sure the filter is properly installed in the right place to catch all the dust. If everything checks out O.K,, perhaps you should think about having an electronic air cleaner installed in your new system.

Astronomers and mathematicians, they devised a remarkably accurate calendar system. Artists and artisans, they produced a body of sculpture, painting and ceramics that ranks with those of the world's great cultures. And, of all the New World ancients, they developed the only true written language.

But many on Wall Street doubted that Sir James was giving up his effort to win control of the company. The withdrawal followed a day of turbulence for the forest products company in which a proposed takeover by the Mead Corporation fell through and Zellerbach then announced it would undertake a radical restructuring that would split the company into three parts. [Page 31.] Confusion abounds over what caused the collapse of the Mead offer for Zellerbach. [33.] Ford's earnings dropped 12.7 percent during the quarter. The company said the decline, to $783.3 million, was caused by higher taxes and increased product-development costs. [31.] Unocal must postpone its annual meeting for two weeks, a Federal judge ordered. The delay had been sought by T. Boone Pickens, who has been leading an effort to take over the company. [33.] Another bid was made for Multimedia. Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington Redskins, offered $63 a share, or $1.05 billion. Multimedia's chairman said its founding families had rejected the offer, which is the third recent one by an outsider. [32.] U.P.I.'s board authorized a bankruptcy filing. The news agency did not say when it might file for protection from creditors but did say service would not be interrupted. [7.] A 3 percent increase in private-line long-distance rates charged by A.T.&T. was approved by the F.C.C.

For the most part, Mike's all right and, being a sort of cautious fella, he keeps pretty much to the middle of the road. Still, there are these weird swerves every now and then. Like the time he quit his management job (after 16 years, no less) and got into restoring old houses. Or the time his feet got itchy, and he wound up bumming around Finland. One can never tell when one of these Walter Mitty episodes will strike next, and sure enough, Mike sets out one day to buy the morning papers, and finds himself on a plane to Tokyo.",1985-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,  Rent-Controlled Units,"Question: Can you tell me how many rent-controlled apartments there were when vacancy decontrol was passed and how many there are now? . . . A. B., Manhattan Answer: Vacancy decontrol for rent-controlled apartments was passed in 1971, when there were about 1.2 million rent-controlled apartments. In 1974, the Emergency Tenant Protection Act placed decontrolled apartments in buildings with six or more units under rent stabilization after rents were allowed to go to comparable market levels. The New York City Housing Vacancy Survey by the United States Bureau of the Census says there are now about 219,000 rent-controlled apartments. Old Sublease in New Co-op Question: The apartment in which I was living was converted to a co-op on a noneviction plan. But just before I bought the apartment, I arranged to sublet it for three years. Now the board is requesting only one-year leases, Does my subtenant abide by the existing sublease, or does he have to enter into a new one-year lease? . . . A. C., Manhattan Answer: If the prior landlord gave permission for the sublet, then the sublease ordinarily should be valid and binding until it expires, said David Clurman, a lawyer who specializes in co-op conversions. He noted that there have been situations in which sponsors have granted permissions after a closing and before the new board was elected when the board challenged the sublet. See a lawyer.

In this century there have been Vladimir Nabokov and Kingsley Amis, Tom Disch, James Dickey and mavericks like Charles Williams - though you could more properly put Mr. Dickey into the category of poets who write novels, along with Louis MacNeice (one pseudonymous novel), C. Day Lewis (detective stories), John Masefield (books for children), Roy Fuller and John Fuller. Among the Victorians, we remember Emily Bronte, Thackeray and Meredith. Dickens interpolated ''The Ivy Green'' into ''The Pickwick Papers,'' along with Mrs. Leo Hunter's famous ''Ode to an Expiring Frog'' and the anonymous ''Lines to a Brass Pot.'' In fact, Victorian novelists had a tendency toward parody and light verse - very noticeable in Thackeray (''Little Billee'' and ''Sorrows of Werther'').",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

PRESSING WALNUT OIL IN THE DORDOGNE","Starting in the fall, everyone in the Dordogne in southwest France seems to be engaged in an off-season Easter egg hunt. People are seen all over the countryside and along the roadways, tagged by children and family dogs, doubled over and scrutinizing the ground with eagle-eyed concentration. What they are seeking, however, are not eggs but walnuts. The Dordogne is walnut country, where production of the nut is a study in waste-not. Walnuts figure in nearly every aspect of a menu, from bread and salad dressing to ice cream, walnut cake and liqueurs. (Fresh walnuts macerated in the French brandy called eau de vie also make a mellow aperitif - liqueur de noix - when served over ice.) One of the best byproducts of the region's walnuts is oil (huile de noix). An appreciation for it is heightened by a visit to the mill at Ste.-Nathalene, which is about five miles northeast of Sarlat, just off Route D47. The mill, powered by water and employing wood-burning fires for heat, has not changed its method of production, and has been in constant operation, since the early 16th century. How this ancient method, compared with a modern mechanization, affects the final product may be a matter of debate, but the Ste.-Nathalene oil is unquestionably a highly refined version. Whereas some local walnut oils can be so harsh and assertive in flavor that they need some olive or peanut oil to cut the intensity, Ste.",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Lloyd Cutler, who was President Carter's counsel, bemoans our inability to ''form a government'' in the European sense of a coherent leadership that wins office on a given program, promptly enacts it and is judged on the results at the next election. Richard L. Strout, the dean of the Washington press corps, points with increasing vehemence to the virtues of the parliamentary system. James MacGregor Burns has been sounding the alarm at least since 1963, when he published ''The Deadlock of Democracy.''

The collection has one masterpiece, Vermeer's ''View of Delft,'' exceptional works by Paulus Potter, Rembrandt, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan Steen and others, and numerous paintings which contribute in some way to our understanding of 16th- and 17th-century Dutch and Flemish art. However, the ''View of Delft'' and a major Rembrandt did not travel. When those paintings that were sent were installed in large American museums, so alien in character and scale from the 17th-century house that is the collection's home, it may have been hard for visitors unfamiliar with the Mauritshuis to imagine why some people return to the intimate, stately Dutch institution again and again.",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

us,  THE AGE OF MUSICAL ARCHEOLOGY IS AT HAND,"Western music is in an excavation period, a time when hunting for old manuscripts occupies the energy of a surprising number of talented artists and musicologists as well as legions of dust-sifting scholastics. The recent exhumation of 33 lost chorale preludes of Bach stirred the imagination of many people, aside from the musical importance of the find, simply because the idea of buried treasure fascinates us all. It appeals to the hunting instinct in the human animal. We avidly follow the detective work that results in the discovery of mislaid pages by Debussy or Verdi, of Strauss's last song or of an entire opera by Donizetti (by my New York Times colleague Will Crutchfield). And we speculate about what wonders may yet lie undetected in libraries and opera house basements. No musicologist has yet come upon the fabled 100 lost cantatas of Bach, which would rank with Heinrich Schliemann's coup in unearthing the four layers of Troy, but in this age of computerized scholarship who knows what is possible. At any rate, serious fans of treasure hunting, fed from youth on Robert Louis Stevenson and Poe, feel free to daydream.

us,  CONFRONTING A CRISIS WITH INCENDIARY PASSION,"Ibsen described Dr. Thomas Stockmann in ''An Enemy of the People'' as ''muddle-headed,'' and he is, in the sense that he never learns, he cannot learn, the positive uses of pragmatism. In his headstrong pursuit of truth he consistently ignores political, economic and personal realities. Blunt, outspoken and adversarial, he is an innocent in a land where, in his words, people chase after expediency. He further weakens his own case by proclaiming that the majority is never right, thereby alienating those who could provide a measure, if not a maximum, of support. Although Stockmann's position may seem like moral elitism, there is a certitude in the purity of his vision. At the end of ''An Enemy of the People,'' stripped of his medical practice and treated as a pariah by the community he is trying to save from disease, he quixotically clings to his self-respect. It is his conviction that ''the strongest man in the world is the man who stands alone.''",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Now, as the State Legislature faces renewal of the laws that govern the rent-regulation system, the Real Estate Board of New York has proposed a new plan to allow owners to buy out of the system. In an interview, Larry A. Silverstein, chairman of the board, and Richard M. Rosan, president, discussed the proposal. Q. How would your proposal work? MR. SILVERSTEIN: Roughly 125,000 housing units turn over each year in the five boroughs. If and only if an apartment becomes vacant, the owner would pay $1,000 into a state-controlled housing fund for the privilege of having that unit freed from rent stabilization. He can then take that apartment and rerent it at market value. Say 75 percent of those 125,000 units paid $1,000 to a state-controlled fund. Then about $93 million would be paid into that fund in the first year. Over 10 years, about $750 million would find its way into that fund.",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Jeffrey Burton Russell, who teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara, knows the trickiness of his subject: ''The history of the concept of the Devil reveals all that can be known about the Devil, and it is the only way that the Devil can be known.'' Some history! The Devil has been around next to forever. But Mr. Russell is undaunted. In ''The Devil'' (1977), he tracked old Nick from antiquity through the New Testament; in ''Satan'' (1981), he followed him through the fifth century; ''Lucifer'' brings him up to the 16th, and a fourth volume is in the works. Mr. Russell begins ''Lucifer'' with the speculations of a sixth-century Serbian monk who opens the door onto Byzantine diabology. Byzantine devils were interesting but tame. It was in the West that they got really vicious - and sometimes comic. In this account they romp through plays, poetry and legends, belch brimstone from pulpits and torture saints and witches in ingenious hells. But it is the devil in the mind that is important to Mr. Russell. He recounts theolo-gians' arguments with an economy and clarity that makes them exciting. And his conclusion is a surprise - the Devil was sidelined not by skeptics but by St. Anselm of Bec and St. Thomas Aquinas who argued that Christ's death is not a ransom of captive sinners but an act of satisfaction to God for mankind's original sin; their resolution of the problem of evil and salvation in a world ruled by a just God made Lucifer a bit irrelevant in theology.",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000

Is it a discipline of survey-takers who make charts and graphs and publish them in academic journals or one in which deep thinkers are free to let their minds wander, perhaps onto the best-seller list? To use their own words, is it quantitative or qualitative? To a certain extent, the split became public in the case of Paul Starr, a 35-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner (for his book, ''The Social Transformation of American Medicine'') who had been called ''the most brillant sociologist of his generation,'' but who was nevertheless denied tenure at Harvard. Although most of the senior members of Dr. Starr's department at the university generally favored his promotion, an outside academic team called in by Harvard to guide the sociology department was split and Derek Bok, the school's president, sent him packing (to Princeton, as it turned out). The divisions among sociologists are not just academic, of course. Most Government social programs rely on sociological research for their focus, and its influence can be felt in fields from education to welfare. The Week in Review asked several sociologists last week to discuss their discipline and where it is - and should be - headed. Excerpts follow.",1985-04-28T05:00:00+0000
