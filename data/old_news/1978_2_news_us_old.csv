us,"Screen: 'Coma,' Hospital Mystery:Snooping in the O.R.","""COMA"" is a hospital thriller that has the manner of a cool, brisk night nurse. It does what must be done and moves on before you can really see what it looks like. The film, adapted and directed by Michael Crichton, himself a doctor, is based on the best-selling novel by Robin Cook, who is also a doctor. It's the kind of story that, after you've seen ""Coma,"" you might suspect a couple of waggish surgeons of having cooked up in the operating room while removing a brain tumor.One can only hope the surgeons would be more efficient in cleaning up after the brain tumor than they've been in tidying up the plausibility questions that remain after the movie. Plausibility is not always important, but in a film as bereft of distinctive style and wit as ""Coma,"" it helps to believe in something. It can even help if one is offended. The aftereffect of ""Coma"" is a catlike yawn, benign and bored.The movie is about the Nancy Drew-like adventure faced by pretty, plucky Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold), a resident surgeon at Boston Memorial Hospital, after her best friend suffers irreparable brain damage in the course of a minor operation. Against the advice of her lover, handsome, hearty Dr. Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas), a young surgeon on the make for money and position, pretty, plucky Dr. Susan Wheeler initiates her own investigation and discovers that in the last year, something like a dozen other patients, all young and in good health, have met similar fates.It soon becomes apparent to pretty, plucky Dr. Susan Wheeler that there is a conspiracy afoot. All of the fatal operations have been performed in the very same operating room, a fact that handsome, hearty Dr. Mark Bellows dismisses as the merest coincidence. Even gruff, kindly old Dr. George Harris (Richard Widmark), the hospital's avuncular head, refuses to listen to her suspicions. What can a pretty, plucky girl do?Well, the last thing she ever thinks about in this movie is going to the police. Instead, like Nancy Drew, she snoops around alone in the hospital basement and up its air shafts. She receives a promise of vital information from a hospital maintenance engineer and then is a witness to his not quite accidential electrocution. Still pretty plucky Dr. Susan Wheeler pushes on and on, tempting fate and, more dangerously, our patience.In his first film as a director, ""West-world,"" Mr. Crichton made very efficient use of some Disneyland-like robots. ""Coma"" is the kind of movie that turns real-life actors into robot-like functions of the story. Miss Bujold, Mr. Douglas and Mr. Widmark, as well as Rip Torn, Elizabeth Ashley and a stunningly beautiful actress named Lois Chiles, are as mechanical as dolls whose expressions are controlled by a computer's console.""Coma,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language and some fleeting nudity in a sequence in which a lot of bodies, which are in a state of suspended animation, appear to be sleeping in fancy, Danish-modern hammocks.",1978-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Company C':Five in Vietnam,"ACCORDING to a recent ad, ""The Boys in Company C"" are ""the craziest group of men this country ever sent off to war."" Here's why: Dave Bisbee is a hippie who says, when he is drafted into the Marines, ""I guess that's my karma coming out,"" and who is seldom without his guitar. Vinnie Fazio is a fast-talking ladies' man from Brooklyn. Alvin Foster is a sensitive type, and he keeps the journal upon which the movie is supposedly based. Billy Ray Pike is an even more sensitive type, because he worries about having left his young sweetheart pregnant and later winds up hooked on drugs in Vietnam. And Tyrone Washington is a former ghetto dope dealer who turns out to have astounding leadership abilities, plus the soul of a philosopher and a heart of gold.""You may want to forget the war, but you'll never forget the Boys in Company C,"" this same ad continues. One reason you won't forget them is that they're already so familiar. In fact, they are so stereotypical, and hence so constricted, that they don't seem to have any feelings of consequence about what they do or what happens to them. This amounts to a failure to take any stand on Vietnam, something that a more slapdash movie might be able to pass off as mere irresponsibility. But ""The Boys in Company C"" is, in every other respect, as calculating as can be. As a film about heroism, it is chiefly remarkable for its gutlessness.The mood is a carefully balanced one: sure, there are mines in the rice paddies and there's murder in the air, but there is also a spirit of cute camaraderie. In addition, there are a madcap ballgame finale out of ""M*A*S*H,"" tidy where-are-they-now? closing credits out of ""American Graffiti,"" and an odd clarity of purpose that, under the war's confusing circumstances, is out of the blue.The movie is so determined to create instant heroes that it must have its instant villains too; in this case, there are corrupt South Vietnamese officials and excessively gung-ho Marine officers to be blamed. Less visible, but also under indictment, are drugs, the Vietcong and American racism. But there's no real evidence of the troubled American political climate of 1967, which is when the story takes place. As far as the screenplay is concerned, this might as well be World War II.An opening sequence, which typifies the film's teasing tactics, introduces the five protagonists and establishes them as wildly different from one another, then robs them of all eccentricities as soon as they hop into uniform and have their heads shaved. Next thing we know, they're in boot camp, being told things like ""You see that guy next to you? You think he's a $%/& or a *)%/ or a &!!/)? I don't care, cause he's gonna save your $%/$%&!* life some day!"" Next thing after that, the boys have shaped up and shipped out, each one retaining only one-note remnants of his original nature.The cast is made up of new young actors, all of whose performances are eclipsed by the cheap ironies of the screenplay (recruit accidentally discovering a body bag: ""Hey, I got it, you sleep in it! It's a lightweight sleeping bag!"") and by the banality of their roles. The wise guy, Vinnie Fazio, is particularly grating, but the actor who plays him (Michael Lembeck) seems to be doing exactly what's expected of him. James Whitmore Jr., who plays a reasonable officer to Scott Hylands's fanatic, gives the only performance with even a trace of the unexpected. But the actor likely to make the biggest splash is Stan Shaw. As the black recruit, Mr. Shaw is handsome and more than competent, and the character he plays is wonderful in a way that only movie characters can ever be.In fact, it's hard to recall anyone on the screen who has demonstrated such unremitting nobility, such unmitigated righteousness, in recent years. And it's hard to imagine a less appropriate occasion on which those qualities might reappear.",1978-02-02T05:00:00+0000

The flying saucers look like hubcaps, the spacelings' bodysuits are baggy and the Christopher Lee part isn't even properly played by Christopher Lee.Mr. Lee does appear in the film, playing an extraterrestrial from a planet whose sun is about to explode, and he scouts Earth as a possible new home for his dislocated people. But Mr. Lee's people do not speak, except in voice-over; this, plus some black costumes with pointy hoods, is supposed to indicate that they come from somewhere other than B-movieville. Wherever they're from, they should have stayed there.Information about the earthlings is scanty, and it all seems to come from magazine covers. Professor Duncan, played wearily by Robert Vaughn, is evidently a Very Famous U.F.O. Expert, because we glimpse his picture on the cover of People magazine one day. And the star wars, which are cheesily staged and should be of no interest even to the most avid science-fiction buffs, generate a mysterious wave of despondency on earth. ""Suicide Epidemic!"" screams a fake cover of Time, which depicts a bleeding wrist. As the subhead adds, ""Will There Be a Tomorrow?""""Starship Invasions"" is full of outmoded plexiglass props that look as though they've been remaindered at Bloomingdale's, and cardboard sets that are painfully underdecorated. The movie's only truly futuristic touches are in its exterior shots, which are so grainy they make the air look even muddier than it actually is.""Starship Invasions"" is rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) because one scene features a recreation center stocked with cuties from outer space.

This time Mr. Villechaize, who is 3 feet 11 inches tall, plays a good guy, or at least as good a guy as his character's licentiousness allows.Milton (Mr. Villechaize) is a part-time wrestler and a full-time Romeo and, in the one and only funny moment in the new movie, he is mysteriously smitten with a timid, square, middle-aged, Midwestern housewife. She sits primly on a sofa, hands in lap, attending to her husband's clichs. Milton sits next to her, smiling up at her in a way intended to be sweet but actually the expression of rampant sexuality. He inches closer to her. She inches away. Suddenly he slips his tiny wicked hand onto her lap. She screams andthat more or less is that.What? That doesn't sound especially funny? Well, it is funny and in the context of the rest of ""The One and Only,"" it's something of a privileged moment. Mr. Villechaize is a remarkably gifted comic actor who just happens to be smaller than most. He has a fine appreciation for the ridiculous and possesses a slack-jawed leer that would tone up any French farce.He also tones up ""The One and Only,"" which opens today at three theaters. ""The One and Only"" is a far cry from French farce and any other kind of farce, being instead an attempt to make a heart-warming comedy about a fellow who, in the film's own terms, is an arrogant boob.When we first meet Mr. Winkler's Andy Schmidt, he seems to be a comparatively elderly undergraduate at a midwestern university where he successfully courts another undergraduate, a woman named Mary Crawford (Kim Darby), who looks old enough to be a tenured professor of physics, by talking to celery stalks, singing (badly) in public places and telling her how great he is.Some forms of egotism can be extremely funnyI think especially of Oscar Jaffe's in ""Twentieth Century""if only because we know that the egotism, though infinitely elastic, is a fragile skin enclosing a gigantic inferiority complex. At any moment it might pop. There are no such self-deceptions and no dangers in ""The One and Only."" Mr. Winkler's Andy Schmidt is all brass, which means, I assume, that we are meant to like him for what he appears to be, which is noisy and untalented.Mr. Reiner, who once directed a hilariously vulgar film called ""Where's Poppa,"" subsequently found God (and great popular success) with ""Oh, God."" ""The One and Only"" is more of that sort of safe, schmalzy comedy, but fatally lacking the presence of someone like the great George Burns.Steve Gordon's screenplay, which shows us how Andy Schmidt accidentally becomes a professional wrestling star called the Lover, a sort of combination of Gorgeous George and Liberace, plays with bad taste but never really lets it triumph, which was one of the reasons why ""Where's Poppa"" succeeded. ""The One and Only"" makes some mildly bigoted homosexual jokes, but even these can be supported as part of the picture of a bygone era.Mr. Winkler's performance alternates between the coy and the cute, which is monotonous and never as endearing as Mr. Villechaize's random leers. Miss Darby seems miscast and Gene Saks is nicely rude as the foul-mouthed fellow who promotes Andy Schmidt to sleazy stardom.""The One and Only,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), talks dirty but its heart is as pure as a biodegradable detergent.",1978-02-03T05:00:00+0000

Even though he's poor, his father has long since left his mother (Cicely Tyson) and his mother's lover (Paul Winfield) is a formidable disciplinarian, Benjie's spirits are still high.In no time at all, though, Benjie has become a heroin addict, a development for which the screenplay lays too much groundwork and Ralph Nelson's soft-pedaling direction lays none at all. This is a tragic tale told by film makers who don't seem able to believe that such things are really possible.As its title perhaps indicates, ""A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich,"" which opens today at the Embassy I and Columbia I Theaters, is a movie that spells out everything but never manages to be entirely lucid. The boy's drug problem is hashed over endlessly, and it takes enough up-and-down turns to sustain a full-length movie, but neither its cause nor its resolution is well enough defined to make the story plausible. However, Mr. Scott is a winning young actor, able to charm and fast-talk his way through the fuzziest situations.Although Mr. Winfield and Miss Tyson have performed together often, they are not, at least in this instance, an ideally matched pair. Mr. Winfield, as a maintenance man struggling valiantly to provide the boy with a surrogate father, is tough and persuasive, so much so that it's hard to see why Benjie can't take more comfort in his presence. Miss Tyson, on the other hand, is paper-thin; the boy's mother might just have well been played by Donna Reed.One measure of Mr. Nelson's confused approach to his material is the sequence that shows Benjie undergoing drug withdrawal at a clinic; Mr. Nelson's montage of sepia-toned stills, prettily scored, clashes crazily with the tortured expressions on the boy's face.Another measure is the film's presentation of George Washington Carver Junior High School, where the only two teachers we meet are the harshly opposite Cohen (David Groh) and Nigeria (Glynn Turman). Nigeria is shown to be a smart, stimulating teacher of black history; he is also shown to be a headstrong and slightly unreasonable character who has managed, a little puzzlingly, to raise the best-adjusted son in town. Mr. Winfield seems so much more helpful a role model, even as a stepfather, that it's hard to understand why the boys' fates should diverge so drastically.""A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") because of its subject and because it contains a good deal of harsh language.",1978-02-03T05:00:00+0000

The fact is that Carroll actually created and named the character Mock Turtle because of the soup which had widespread currency in English kitchens long before Alice came about. It is made with a calf's head  and that's no joke. Calves heads are available at wellsupplied butcher shops in metropolitan areas  and the reason for the name is that the meat of a cooked calf's head has much the same texture as that of turtle in real turtle soup. The ingredients for the dish include the classic spices that provide the flavor of real tle soup. After you have made a kettle of mock turtle soup, you can put it to a marvelous second use, as the base of Lady Curzon's soup. This soup is otherwise almost impossible to make in certain areas of America, where the sale of canned turtle soup is forbidden by law because green turtles are among the endangered species of the world. Lady Curzon was a Chicagoan christened Mary Leiter in 1870. She became the wife of Lord Curzon, the British viceroy to India. As the vicereine, she occupied the most powerful position ever held by any American woman in the British empire. Position aside, it would be sufficient unto the day if she were responsible only for the creation of the soup that bears her name. It is irresistible.",1978-02-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Happy Melange of Peasants and Ex-Parisians Meets to Eat,"ON THE EVIDENCE of ""Cousin, Cousine"" and now ""Blue Country,"" Jean-Charles Tacchella's specialty is the madcap crowd scene. By gathering together a band of zanies on an appropriately festive occasion, Mr. Tacchella can tickle his audiences with a disjointed, determinedly fluffy-headed brand of comedy. He can also, by allocating one or two piquant remarks to each character and never allowing anyone to conduct a sustained conversation, create the impression that this is merriment with a message.Mr. Tacchella's messages, upon close inspection, don't amount to much: He offers endless variations on the notions that people must do what makes them happiest, that they don't always live up to their dreams and that they must be forgiven their foibles. But the thematic banality of his films in no way compromises Mr. Tacchella's most useful talent, which is for sleight-of-hand. In ""Blue Country,"" he once again manages to suggest that the lightweight mood of his films bespeaks an inner seriousness. Mr. Tacchella's peculiarly circular gift is for lending ephemeralness and insubstantiality the appearance of virtues.In ""Blue Country,"" the obligatory zanies meet in a rural setting, a breath-takingly beautiful French valley populated by a happy mixture of peasants and ex-Parisians. The peasants have more children than they can keep track of, and long for the luxuries of city living; the Parisians like to bake bread, speak knowingly of their newly acquired goats and talk of the landscape in terms of Corot or Czanne (""No wonder peasants don't buy paintings!"" one unreconstructed bourgeoise exclaims).The valley's populace meets gaily and often for communal dinners so appetizing that viewers headed for the 68th Street Playhouse, where the film has opened, would be well advised to arm themselves with bread and pat. At least half of ""Blue Country's"" appeal is based on its sheer pastoral pleasantness, and on the gusto with which its principals indulge their appetites.As in ""Cousin, Cousine,"" there is a romantic subplot that seems strangely tangential to the film's predominant hustle and bustle. Louise (Brigitte Fossey), an ex-Parisian, meets Mathias (Jacques Serres), a country bachelor, and both are so fiercely independent that they vow not to fall in love. Fall in love they do, though, very picturesquely, and each makes a few sacrifices to accommodate the other. But they never move in together, even after 10 years of courtship, which is the film's rather lumbering way of reminding us that they have retained that fierce independence.Here, as before, Mr. Tacchella seems unable to integrate the romance with all the brouhaha, and it's the romance that suffers. Miss Fossey is unflaggingly radiant and Mr. Series attractively stalwart, yet the director seems unaccountably uneasy when his screenplay leaves him alone with these two very agreeable lovers.""Blue Country"" is less structurally coherent than ""Cousin, Cousine,"" and its delightful eccentrics seem a little more contrived in their delightfulness. Both films are likely to appeal to the same audience, thoughto viewers who ascribe a certain Gallic cachet to films with the consistency of cotton candy, and who approach with utter fearlessness the prospect of being charmed to death.",1978-02-06T05:00:00+0000

This new game, developed for badminton courts, features small perforated balls that approximate the flight of the feathered shuttlecock. Special racquets, rather loosely strung, come with the game, but the balls can be used with regular badminton racquets too. The balls last longer and cost less than shuttle- cocks and can be used for solo practice. They rebound off a wall, for instance, and can be hit on a bounce (which is allowed in the rules of play). The game can be played indoors or out, even when, there is some breeze, because the ball is less affected by wind than is a shuttlecock. There are three classes of ballswhite for slower indoor play; yellow for faster outdoor play, and a competition model (not yet on the market) for serious badminton plpyrers. The balls cost $1.60 for a set of three, and the game sets range from $7 to $20, directly from Norca Industries, 235 Monte de Lisse, Ville St. Laurent, Mortreal H4TIP5.",1978-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Coup de Grace,' A Film Parable","THE TIME is winter, 1919-20, shortly after the end of World War I. The setting is that Baltic territory where the Allies, for a while represented by troops of the defeated Kaiser, waged a desultory campaign against the Bolsheviks who had come to power in Russia. That war, too, was already over but the people fighting it hadn't been told. As the war became Increasingly fragmented, the battles became increasingly violent, bitter and personal.On one of the great Latvian estates near Riga, still comparatively serene in spite of food shortages, disease and defections to the Rod cause, the last act is played out as the kind of domestic drama that comes perilously close to farce. No one quite understands what's happening, but then when they do, they continue to pursue doom not as duty but as conscious choice.Volker Schlondorff's ""Coup de Grace,"" adapted from Marguerite Your-cenar's 1939 novel (published here in 1957), has the form of a violent nightmare now dimly remembered. The film is the recollection of a Prussian officer who participated in specific events from which all pain has long since vanished. What is now remembered is the series of curious occurrences that, in hindsight, appear to have been inevitable.""Coup de Grace,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinema Studio, is an extremely studied, sorrowful movie, photographed in a fine, chilly black and white that has the important effect of removing the story even further away from our emotions. We don't respond to it viscerally. We contemplate it with a certain amount of detachment, which, in this movie era of fast-cutting and obligatory shock, is almost refreshing.I'm not quite sure that I know exactly what Mr. Schlondorff (""Young Torless,"" ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum,"" etc.) and his wife, Margarethe von Trotta, who collaborated on the screenplay and has the leading role, see as the point of the movie, though it's a vivid and haunting experience.The film is, I suppose, a kind of parable about the collapse of one order and the survival of another. It's the story of Sophie (Miss von Trotta), a handsome, strong-willed aristocrat, her younger brother Konrad (Rudiger Kirschstein), and Erich (Matthias Habich), the Prussian officer who commands the White garrison at their country house. Sophie loves Erich, Erich loves (apparently from afar) Konrad, and Konrad, having not much passion for anything, exists passively, to be supported by those around him.Though Sophie loves Erich, her sympathies are with the Reds, a political commitment she doesn't act upon until she learns about Erich's feelings for Konrad. As the campaign against the Bolsheviks collapses, only Erich the true Prussian, maintains some sense of purpose. Life at the great house falls into disorder. The crazy old aunt, who talks French and wears horrendous makeup, presides at formal dinners as artillery shells land in the garden. When the Bolsheviks triumph, only Erich survives to musein voice-over narrationabout the depth of Sophie's love and fury.Does Erich survive to support the later rise of Adolf Hitler? ""Coup de Grace"" remains at such a distance from its characters that one must make all sorts of assumptions about them, which is the reason it is disturbing without being entirely satisfying.""Coup de Grace"" raises many questions that it refuses to answer in any easy fashion, which is just the opposite of Mr. Schlondorff's ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum,"" a film that had an answer for everything. Since I'm suspicious of answers in art, I much prefer this new film.",1978-02-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: On the Auto Front:The Assembly Line,"""BLUE COLLAR,"" directed by Paul Schrader and written by him and his brother Leonard, is a film about which you are likely to have very mixed feelings. It is a sort of poor man's ""On the Waterfront,"" a movie that simply  often primitively  describes corruption in a Detroit auto workers' local without ever making the corruption a matter of conscience. Corruption is there. It exists. It's part of the system.This emphasis on inevitability, which is one step away from complete passivity, may be the essential difference between a certain kind of pop culture today and that of the mid-50's when Elia Kazan made his furious, idealized film about crooked locals on New York piers. The Kazan film dramatized one man's fight against corruption and made a hero of a fellow brave enough to testify before a crime commission.At the end of ""Blue Collar"" we see a man more or less cornered into turning state's evidence. His testimony probably won't do any good. The movie even implies that his decision to testify may make him an unwitting tool of the system. His fate isn't especially tragic. It's a pop tune with a big beat.At least, this is the way I reacted to ""Blue Collar,"" which opens today at three theaters. ""Blue Collar"" is the first film to be directed by Mr. Schrader, who was one of Hollywood's hottest young writers even before the appearance of ""The Yakuza,"" his first screenplay to be filmed. Since then he has been represented by ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Obsession"" and ""Rolling Thunder,"" all movies containing a lot of highly cinematic violence and a certain amount of intellectual confusion. Is ""Blue Collar"" an action film or a meditation upon the American Dream? I suspect it wants to be both though it's not very serious at being either.The movie is at its best in describing the quality of the day-to-day life of its three leading charactersZeke (Richard Pryor), Jerry (Harvey Keitel) and Smokey (Yaphet Kotto), friends who work together on the assembly line at the automobile plant. Zeke, who is married, is irrepressibly rude and in debt to the Internal Revenue Service for claiming six children instead of his actual three. Jerry, also married, also is in debt and works two jobs to make ends meet. Smokey is the sophisticated one. An ex-con and a bachelor, he throws parties that he imagines Playboy would admire. All three work nonstop to afford the material comforts they've been told they deserve. Each in his own way is a very angry man.Where ""Blue Collar"" starts to go awry is in its melodramatic plotting that has the three friends attempting to rob their union headquarters. Instead of a large amount of cash, they find a ledger that records the details of the union's loan-sharking activities. When they attempt to use this information as blackmail, the results are predictably disastrousfor the friends and for the movie that otherwise shows us a kind of existence seldom accurately depicted on the screen.Everything in the characters' private lives looks right, from the pictures on the walls (and stuck into the corners of mirrors), to their color television sets, plastic slipcovers and bowling costumes. You suspect that each item was bought yesterday on time and will be worn out tomorrow before the payments are completed.The performances are excellent. Mr. Keitel's Jerry is all itchy ignorance, baffled by the circumstances in which he finds himself to do the right thing but having no idea of what that is Mr. Kotto's Smokey appears to be as much a matter of his sheer presence as it is of his cool, self-assured performance.The center of the film, however, is Mr. Pryor who, in ""Blue Collar,"" has a role that for the first time makes use of the wit and fury that distinguish his straight comedy routines. It's a sneakily funny performance right up to the film's angry, freeze-frame ending, which, by this time is a mannerism that almost any film could do without.Mr. Schrader's decision to use that freeze-frame calls attention to the phoniness that haunts the film at other moments. The scene in which a fussy I.R.S. man calls on Mr. Pryor is funny, but do I.R.S. men often make house calls at night? If the television programs that Mr. Keitel's family watches are always black programs, how did something like ""Rhoda"" become so popular? I'd even question whether the Keitel character, given the probable prejudices of a man in his position, would have two blacks as his only friends.The movie, which is so accurate in other ways, manipulates life to create the sort of idealized, color-balanced reality we are force-fed by television.",1978-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Wajda's Study Of War's Aftermath:No Place to Go,"ANDRZEJ WAJDA'S 1970 Polish film, ""Landscape After Battle,"" is a movie whose sorrow is sealed off by its beautiful images as if behind thick, protective glass. We see the sorrowits expressions and movementsbut it's so special that it seems silent and remote. How can anyone who was not in the Holocaust begin to comprehend it? Even to attempt to understand it seems an impertinence, as if this would be an invasion of an especially privileged privacy.""Landscape After Battle"" is based on the autobiographical stories of Tadeusz Borowski, the Polish writer who, having survived Auschwitz and Dachau and the postwar displaced-persons camps, committed suicide in 1951 at the age of 29. That knowledge gives particular poignancy to the Wajda film, which is about a young poet named Tadeusz who goes through this landscape trying to convince himself of the validity of the advice he gives a Jewish girl he loves: ""To live, one must forget.""Mr. Borowski could not forget, which is why his stories, published here by Penguin in a collection called ""This Way to the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,"" comprise one of the most measured, calm and harrowing books about the Holocaust you're ever likely to read. Mr. Borowski was an extraordinary writer. Mr. Wajda, who made ""Ashes and Diamonds"" and ""Kanal,"" can be an extraordinary film maker, but his style is more lyric and contemplative than the writer's, which is to the film's advantage.""Landscape After Battle"" is Mr. Wajda's recollection of an idealized Borowski, played with a kind of sweet cynicism by Daniel Olbrychski as a handsome young man who wears spectaclesMr. Wajda seem to belong to that school of film makers that still feels that writers must be identified by the glasses they put on, take off and drop. This is the only unworthy note in the movie, which is a series of vignettes that follows Tadeusz from the day his camp is liberated until he decides to strike out from a benignly mismanaged displaced-persons camp to return to Poland.Because Tadeusz is obsessed with a sense of homeland, which has less to do with conventional nationalism than with mythic roots, there is throughout the film the unstated irony contained in our awareness of what eventually happened to Tadeusz.The landscape of the title is postwar Europe, whose mood is caught in the film's opening sequence, when Mr. Wajda shows us how the prisoners of a concentration camp, at first jubilant with their freedom, come to realize at the end of that first day that they have no place to go but back to the camp.""Landscape After Battle""? has no dominant story line. Some of its sequences may mystify those of us not familiar with Polish history or with the spheres of influence that were allocated after the war. Yet it's so beautifully composed, so elegiacal, it compels attention and will be likely to stay in the memory for a very long time. I've no idea why it's taken almost eight years for such a special work to reach us.The film opened yesterday at the Film Forum, where it will be shown tonight through Sunday at 7:45, and again, next week, Thursday through Sunday, at the same time.",1978-02-10T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Of Cars, Sex Money and 'The Betsy':Family Affair","MEET the Hardeman family, the oversexed czars of Detroit's most Harold Robbinsy auto empire. They're all descended from Loren Hardeman Sr., a rough-and-tumble First Tycoon played by rough-and-tumble Laurence Olivier. This Hardeman, a.k.a ""No. 1,"" is about 90 years old now, but he is often described as ""amazing . . . for his age."" Loren Hardeman Jr. (Paul Rudd) was a no-good weakling, so they don't talk much about him any more. They talk even less about his beautiful wife, Sally (Katharine Ross), who used to fool around with her father-in-law. On her wedding night, Sally caught No. 1 fooling around with Roxanne, a French maid, and the spectacle gave her ideas. ""I've wanted it to be like that ever since  just once,"" Sally whispered.Loren 3d (Robert Duvall), who saw quite a primal scene in his day, is a mean-tempered fellow who hates being called Loren 3d. He likes playing a savage game of squash, running the family business, and forsaking his glum wife Alicia (Jane Alexander) for his high-toned English mistress, Lady Bobby (Lesley-Anne Down).But Lady Bobby is not exactly what you'd call a one-man woman, and so she inevitably winds up in the arms of Angelo Perino (Tommy Lee Jones), the hot-blooded Italian racing driver and automotive designer who is in No. 1's employ. Just before she flings herself at Angelo, they drink a toast.Lady Bobby: ""To fast cars, and the men who race them.""Angelo: ""To their women, who wait and worry.""Last in line is nubile young Betsy (Kathleen Beller), whose poolside love scene with this same Angelo will get a huge hand, and an even huger giggle, if you go to see ""The Betsy"" with a properly punchy crowd. Betsy has the movie's finest line, which she delivers while lying on a lounge chair: ""I knew it would be like this,"" she coos. ""You're a beautiful child,"" Angelo coos in reply. ""No Mr. Perino, I'm a beautiful woman,"" she corrects him. ""It's my 21st birthday, remember?""The Hardeman's have their incest, their infidelity, their homosexuality and all the rest, and they have another problem so awful that no one ever talks about it: The Betsy, which is being designed by Angelo in great-granddaughter's honor, is going to be a cheap car. Trouble is people don't go to see big-budget adaptations of Harold Robbins stories to find out about cutting costs and getting better mileage; they want to know about luxury and limousines and what Lady Bobby does in her spare time. How can a movie about the invention of something like a Pinto have much of a gloss?""The Betsy"" careens recklessly from the 1930's to the 70's and back again, from Hardeman generation to Hardeman generation, in a vain effort to generate the illusion of a storyline. Laurence Olivier doesn't change much over 40 years, and he never seems to have the unscrupulousness of a real magnate, but that hardly matters: What he does have are a roguish Scots accent, a lot of lines like ""I'll be horn-swoggled,"" and a twinkle in his eye, as befits the material.There are some good performances here (such as Edward Hermann's, as a corporate yes-man, Mr. Duvall's and Miss Alexander's), and some terrible ones (Miss Ross is deadly serious, and just awful). But only Olivier manages to play his role and wink at it simultaneously, and his is surely the most sensible approach.For the most part, the director, Daniel Petrie, has a classier cast than he knows what to do with. He also has at his disposal an unwieldy script and the worst set of costumes to be seen in a movie in years. (All the men wear ill-fitting suits, even the zillionaires, and Betsy's yellow ballgown for her birthday party is a lollapalooza. Mr. Petrie, who also directed ""Lifeguard"" and the television movie ""Sybil,"" regularly dissolves his love scenes into shots of city skylines, and he treats the Hardemans with a reverence they in no way warrant.Mr. Petrie was in no danger of making a good movie out of ""The Betsy,"" but he might easily have made a funnier or more enjoyable smarmy one. Without much of a plot, ""The Betsy"" often sags, and a movie this frivolous has no business being dull.",1978-02-10T05:00:00+0000

She signed off with warning that she would definitely not give this book to a friend. The critic has my sympathy; best sellers are not supposed to be so odd. And yet, there stands Even Cowgirls Get the Blues high on the sales charts for 1976 and 1977, and, beside it, a companion volume from a few years back, the equally puzzling Another Roadside Attraction. There are nearly two million copies in print of these two books. Almost all of them are in paperback, where the name of Tom Robbins has risen to stand beside those of Pynchon, Brautigan, Vonnegut, Pirsig and Castaneda. Together they form, if not a school, then certainly a breed: the paperback literati.

But Courbet enjoyed the great advantagebeyond, that is, the advantage of an enormous talentof coming before the public as an artistic radical, and this is a stance that contemporary Realism is denied by historical circumstance.

us,"Film: 'Ceddo,' a Pageant From Sembene's Africa:Stately Power Struggle","AT HIS most engaging, as in films like ""Xala"" and Mandabi,"" Ousmane Sembene, the talented Senegalese writer-director, is a sophisticated social satirist who considers the follies of his countrymen with the humanistic appreciation of a Jean Renoir. His heroes are often fools or slightly cracked, self-deluding imitations of the recently departed French colonials. Whatever they are, the Sembene landscape they inhabit is always the same whether urban or rurala land where one culture has been all but squashed by another, yet refuses to die.Mr. Sembene's newest film, ""Ceddo,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, is also about cultural continuity and the threat of displacement, but with a major difference. ""Ceddo"" is a folk tale presented as the kind of pageant you might see enacted at some geographic location made famous by history and now surrounded by souvenir stands. It's not cheap or gaudy, but it's an intensely solemn, slightly awkward procession of handsomely costumed scenes designed to pass on a lot of information as quickly and efficiently as possible.Set in some indefinite time (mostly the late 19th century with bits and pieces of the mid-20th century in it as well), it's the sad, formally told tale of what happens to life in a small rural village after the king becomes a convert to Islam and invites a Muslim teacher, the Imam, into his circle of advisers. As goes the king, so go the nobles. The little Roman Catholic church is quickly abandoned. Only the Ceddo, or common people, who earlier resisted Rome, refuse to follow the king.In the ensuing power struggle, the Ceddo kidnap the king's daughter to force him to meet their demands. The film is composed of meetings of state, of parleys between opposing factions, of trials or strength and cleverness between the loyalists and the rebels, always conducted according to time-honored traditions. Then the ambitious Imam steps in and, through deceit and murder, effectively wipes out an entire people.This is more or less the content of ""Ceddo,"" though the manner is reserved, cool, almost stately. There are no characterizations in the film, only rather grand impersonations. Most of ""Ceddo"" has been photographed in the sort of medium-long shot from which one might observe an outdoor theatrical. Only twice, in fantasy sequences, does Mr. Sembene allow himself the imaginative film maker's freedom to distort history to achieve some kind of dramatic truth. The rest is picturesque.It is interesting to note that ""Ceddo,"" which takes a very dim view of the Muslim influence in Senegal, has been banned in that country though not, reportedly, because of any religious sensitivity, but because Mr. Sembene insists on spelling ""ceddo"" with two d's while the Senegalese Government insists it be spelled with one.",1978-02-17T05:00:00+0000

Yet millions of them apparently care passionately about who controls it. A cartoon in The New Yorker captures this anomaly. Two men are standing in a bar, the first saying to the second: What's wrong with me? For thirty years I never gave a thought to the Panama Canal. Now I can't live without it.

us,What's Doing in EL PASO and JUAREZ,"INTERNATIONAL CITY - Lying beneath a pass in the southern end of the Rocky Mountains, El Paso faces Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, from the north side of the Rio Grande at the western edge of Texas. In the early settlement of the region El Paso and Juarez were a single community called El Paso del Norte (Pass of the North), most of which was concentrated on the south side of the river. In 1848, as a result of the Mexican War, the territory north of the river became part of the United States, but for years the business districts of the two cities grew almost as one. The larger population (about 500,000) has remained in Juarez, but El Paso lags only slightly behind (about 400,000), and its cluster of 20story buildings gives it a skyline that towers over its more sprawling and serene Latin neighbor. The forces of urban renewal have also come into play, producing a $20 million Civic Center modern in scope and distinctly Southwestern in design, with a theater shaped somewhat like a huge sombrero and an exhibition hall that has graceful twostory arches reminiscent of adobe construction. The center is one reminder that El Paso, which calls itself the International City, has not forgotten its early heritage.",1978-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Headliners,"In the end, Muhammad All could not shake free of his 36 years. He had it over Leon Spinks in weight, reach and without question  talent. But a 36-year-old boxer is an old man, and the hubris of Ali, thinking he could fight a determined 24yearold as though he were the same age, cost him his heavyweight title in a split decision last week. Ali remained the consummate showman almost to the end: He danced in nearly every round, and in the early going he made faces for the crowd. In the late going, the changes in his face were involuntary. There may be more fights ahead for him, but perhaps never as champion. Thus ends an era of a man who was much more than the dominant prizefighter of the postwar period. He was a symbol of black assertiveness since the 1960's. As such he rankled much of ,white America, and not just because he was loud.. In 1964, as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., a Christian, he wrested the title from Sonny Liston. Instead of humility, he offered defiance, the news that he had become a Muslim who called himself Ali. It was too much, especially for many sportswriters, some of whom still cannot write his name without putting an a.k.a. after it. He became a symbol to underdeveloped nations around the world with his protest against the Vietnam war in 1967, when h refused to be inducted into the Army. It was no idle gesture. Outraged boxing authorities stripped him of his title even before the courts got around to convicting him of draft evasion. It was not until 1971 that the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and not until 1974 that Ali recovered the heavyweight crown. Throughout, he never doubted his own worth or hesitated over hyperbolic expressions of his selfesteem. I'm fighting for people all over the world, he once said. If I win, people all over the world's going to win. If I lose they're all going to lose. Ali was chastened, even gracious, in defeat last week. But he will soon weary of diffidence. There is not only the lure of becoming the first heavyweight to win the titlethree times, butthe millions to.be added to the $60 million he has earned in almost two deca6s of fighting. He could use the inciney. For all that he has made, he has retained relatively little because of enormous expenses.'A rematch is likely: Leon Spinks, a reallife Rocky, is willing, but he also knows what he is up against. When Ali entered the ring in Las Vegas, Spinks joined in the applause. He recognized a role model; after the fight, he was quick to supply Aliesque doggerel. He's still The Great est,' the new champiqn said. 'But I'm the latest.'",1978-02-19T05:00:00+0000

us,NEW & USEFUL,"It's been a long, cold, snowy winter, and it's time for a bit of harmless fantasy in our lives: something along the lines of a night light that looks like a mythical fish's head, a pitcher fashioned after a penguin, or a pink box shaped like a seated pig. They're all amusing to look at, but totally practical as well. The handmade ceramic fish head, which is about the size or a human head, emits a faint reddish glow through the mouth and gills. The price tag of $100 is steep, but the fantasy fish needn't be relegated to a child's room. A spotted dog's head wearing a jaunty baseball, cap, though, is definitely meant as a child's night light; few grandparents who could afford it (it's $80) would be able to resist its happy grin. And since it's a good 12 inches across, it's large enough to be a charming wall accessory even when the light is off. The penguin, which sports a, sturdy handle on its back, is 10 inches tall and holds nearly a quart of liquidwhich might as easily be water for the bar as milk for the kitchen; $40. The pig box, seven inches across, could hold anything from sugar to paper clips. It sells for $20.

(The film plays part of this week and next at the Film Forum.)""The point,"" write the co-directors in a set of accompanying program notes, ""is not so much to distance the spectator from the narrative, but to split his/her interest and tension between the story line and the workings of the camera (and soundtrack)."" But with all his/her work done by the film makers, the poor spectator will be hard pressed to function as an interested observer. A technique this ironclad loses its power to provoke.Some of the early 360-degree shotsone around the woman's kitchen, and another that circles the inside of her house as her husband packs and leavesare coolly effective. But the latter part of the film is so hamstrung by this format that it becomes numbing. Aside from the 13 pans, there are shots of Miss Mulvey pondering the story of the Sphinx and Oedipus, extreme close-ups of the Sphinx to establish that film is indeed a grainy medium, and other equally overbearing episodes.

us,'Dona Flor' Film On Local Screen:Indivisible,"DONA FLOR'S first husband is dead, but that's just as well, since he was a grievous no-goodnik in his lifetime. He was a gambler, a wise guy and a womanizer, and he beat his pretty young wife shamelessly, pacifying her with the occasional moonlight serenade or nice gesture. Once he took her out to a fancy nightclub, where he bought her champagne and caviar and didn't even pinch the waitress.Apparently, this man's only note-worthy talent was for lovemaking, and ""Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,"" at the Paris Theater, devotes more than enough screen time to that aspect of the marriage. And Dona Flor's second husband, a dopey druggist who drops a medicine bottle the first time he sees the pretty widow, is a sorry successor. So Dona Flor mopes and broods and smiles wanly, until one day her prayers are answered. Husband Number One is such a devil that he manages to come back, sans clothing, and pay his wife amorous visits while Husband Number Two isn't looking. Even if Husband Number Two were looking he wouldn't catch on, because he is slow-witted anyway and because death has conveniently rendered Husband Number One invisible.This story, adapted from the novel by the Brazilian author Jorge Amado, would seem to have the makings of a bawdy ""Topper,"" and indeed the film's final 20 minutes make reasonably amusing use of the dead man's return. But Bruno Barreto, who directed the film, devotes far more time to setting up the situation than he finally does to exploiting it, and the early part of the film has a dangerously uncertain tone. Dona Flor's life looks terrible, yet this is not a didactic film or even a particularly satirical one, so there's little to be learned from her plight.There are various glimpses of Bahia and its customs, circa the 1940's, but the only interesting bit of local color is Dona Flor's recipe for crabmeat casserole. Dona Flor teaches a class in gourmet cooking: Husband Number One liked to sit in on the class and, by the by, fondle the students.Sonia Braga, a Brazilian model and actress who plays Dona Flor, is called upon alternately to frown and to engage in various soft-core shenanigans. She is adequate to these demands, but her role is really little more than that of the butt of a family dirty joke.",1978-02-27T05:00:00+0000
