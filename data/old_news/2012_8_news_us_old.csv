Diocesan employees discovered hundreds of images of girls genitals on a laptop computer the priest had taken in for repair in December 2010. Father Ratigan then survived a suicide attempt, and was reassigned to live in a church facility where he continued to have contact with children. The case led to the indictment of his superior, Bishop Robert Finn, and the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, on a misdemeanor charge of failing to report suspected child abuse.

us,High Style on the North Fork,"The North Fork of Long Island has many attributes  great wines, (relatively) affordable summer rentals and a lovely carousel  but shopping has never been the areas strong suit. Last weeks opening of Eureka Beach on Main Street in Greenport will give the area a much-needed retail boost. The brainchild of the fashion designer Lucy Barnes, the television producer Heidi Kelso and the antiques dealer Fran Lombardi-Reilly, the shop reflects the trios personalities and specialties, with offerings ranging from new and vintage womens clothing and accessories to childrens items and decorative accessories for the home. The opening also marks the debut of the Eureka Beach collection of caftans, tunics and dresses. We created the line because while there are other things out there, they were just too expensive for what youd get, Kelso explains. Ours are cotton, linen and silk pieces that arent too precious and arent too expensive. The line, which ranges from $100 to $350, hangs alongside pieces by Barnes (look for the stretch denim Miracle skirt), jewelry by the North Fork weekender Paige Novick, Chascona bags by the stylist Karan Schijman, Riudavets summery leather slip-ons, childrens clothing by Wovenplay and textiles from Bali, Turkey and Morocco.

By that definition Karl Taro Greenfelds Triburbia qualifies as a novel, which is what his publisher calls it, though Id be inclined to call it linked stories. I suspect that if Dubliners had been published in recent years it would have been marketed as a novel. If Tom Rachmans Imperfectionists and Jennifer Egans Visit From the Goon Squad are novels, if Flann OBriens At Swim-Two-Birds is a novel, then so, perhaps, is Triburbia.

Her inspiration: the pieces in her most recent collection, called Sutana. Im just so fascinated by fossilized woolly mammoth and walrus ivory; no two pieces are the exact same, says Pan about the thousands-of-years-old Peruvian treasures that star in Sutana. I thought it would be exciting to magnify them, to show their intricate natural patterns. And that she did. With the help of the photographer Marshall Troy, Pan put a selection of her jewelry  a necklace made of olive-tinted ivory and earrings made of cognac fossils, opals, black jade and diamonds, for example  under the camera lens to capture their constellation-like compositions. She then magnified and printed a total of five pictures onto large canvases that underwent a 72-hour Mark Rothko-like top coat of paint, to mimic the fossils reflective and translucent textures. The human eye doesnt necessarily recognize the natural beauty of the fossils within jewelrys small scale, Pan says. There are many people that see different patterns in the paintings, and make guesses, like, Are they bursts of sun?

United States, which for a time in the 1950s and 1960s was the fastest and most advanced ocean liner ever built. It was the lifelong project of William Francis Gibbs, Americas preeminent naval architect, a self-taught engineer who, among his many other achievements, was instrumental in transforming a German liner captured during World War I into the Leviathan, the pride of Americas postwar passenger fleet. Then, during World War II, he pioneered a revolutionary process to construct the so-called Liberty Ships, which became symbols of Americas industrial might. All along, Gibbs nursed plans to build a revolutionary superliner. But his designs, hatched in his parents Philadelphia attic as early 1916, were not realized until 1952. Ten years after its christening, his transatlantic ship would prowl the icy North Atlantic as a kind of floating anachronism, jet planes having turned its record three-day, 10-hour crossing time into a sorry joke. Such is the sweep of A Man and His Ship (Simon & Schuster, $30) an absorbing, transporting new history by Steven Ujifusa, which coincides with a show about the S.S.

Officer," Judicial authorities said Thursday that they had taken the unusual step of appointing a senior judge to hold a long-planned inquest into the death of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer poisoned in London in 2006 with a rare radioactive isotope, polonium 210. The case soured relations between Britain and Russia, and the new development may put at risk recent improvements. At British inquests, judges replace coroners only in the most high-profile cases, like the inquiry into the death of Princess Diana. The hearings to be overseen by the judge, Sir Robert Owen, could provide the first opportunity in the case for witnesses to testify under oath. A procedural hearing is to be held next month. British prosecutors have accused another former K.G.B. officer, Andrei K. Lugovoi, of Mr. Litvinenkos poisoning  a charge he denies  and are seeking his extradition, which Russia has refused. Mr. Litvinenko, who fled Russia in 2000, had secured British citizenship shortly before he died, and he accused Russias leader, Vladimir V. Putin, of responsibility for his poisoning.

The next morning, hed reheat the leftovers until the chocolate melted, then dunk sticky slices into his coffee. ",2012-08-10T14:12:43+0000

Stealth jihadis use political, cultural, societal, religious, intellectual tools; violent jihadis use violence, Newt Gingrich told the American Enterprise Institute in July 2010. But in fact theyre both engaged in jihad, and theyre both seeking to impose the same end state, which is to replace Western civilization with a radical imposition of Shariah. During the Republican presidential primaries, every candidate weighed in on the Shariah threat. In November 2010, Oklahoma voters approved a constitutional amendment banning the use of Islamic law in court.

Stedman  whose new novel, The Light Between Oceans, enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 7  is a hedgehog. The book carries no author photograph, and only a brusque biography: M. L. Stedman was born and raised in Western Australia and now lives in London. The Light Between Oceans is her first novel. Go away. (O.K., so I added the last sentence myself.) Stedman has mostly shunned press interviews as well  but not entirely, and because this is the age of the Internet its possible for a determined reader to track down a couple of profiles that ran in her native Australia this spring. They are, refreshingly, less about her personality than her novel, the story of a World War I veteran who moves with his wife to a remote island for work as a lighthouse keeper. There is something that appeals to the human psyche about lighthouses because of their isolation, Stedman told The Sydney Morning Herald in March. Their presence offers up a marvelous set of dichotomies the human imagination likes to explore  darkness and light, safety and danger, stasis and movement, isolation and communication. The story throws up the role of isolation on morality  when you dont see the impact of your actions. Perhaps its easier to fool yourself when you cannot see the face of those who are affected by what you do. The article does offer a few glimpses of the private Stedman (the M stands for Margot, and she has worked as a lawyer), but for the most part she stands her ground with admirably Pynchonian resolve.

The series is about South Dakotas fictional Prairie Rose Indian Reservation and Dashiell Bad Horse, who left the reservation as a teenager and returns as an undercover agent for the F.B.I. He hopes to get enough evidence to bring down Lincoln Red Crow, a corrupt casino owner. This volume reprints issues No. 50-55. The series will end with issue No. 60, which goes on sale on Aug. 22. The final collected edition is scheduled for Oct. 31. Its difficult to discuss the book without giving away plot points, but a couple of characters have major changes of heart that result in a dynamic shift in the power struggles. And, as always, there is a bounty of sex, violence and intrigue. Scalped has been a compelling read and the creators have developed rich characters, but it can be difficult to find an audience in the comic-book market place. Issue No. 59, which went on sale in June, had estimated sales of slightly more than 6,000 copies. The collected editions, at least, have done a little better: Volume Seven hit the Graphic Books Best Sellers list in March. ",2012-08-10T18:39:40+0000

The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal both wrote editorials promoting Mr. Ryan for the Republican ticket: The Journals editorial on Thursday (Why Not Paul Ryan?) and The Weekly Standards editorial dated Monday but online earlier (Go for the Gold, Mitt!). Perhaps this is the reason, Michael Barbaro writes, that Mr. Romneys camp was eager to announce the day he made the decision, Aug. 1: Mr. Romney is sensitive to the perception that he acts at the behest of the partys right wing.

The latest detox craze isnt something you can ingest, but it has plenty of people drinking the proverbial Kool-Aid. A cardiovascular procedure called External Counter Pulsation therapy, cleared by the F.D.A. in 1987 for the treatment of angina, claims to stimulate and clear collaterals (small blood vessels) to bypass narrow or clogged arteries. During the procedure, a patients legs are strapped to an adjustable bed using pressurized cuffs hooked up to a heart monitor. The cuffs inflate and deflate in sync with the heartbeat, pumping blood upward, so it can oxygenate more rapidly and distribute with greater ease. Now rebranded as Pure Flow Pulsation at New Yorks PureFlow, E.C.P. is being offered, under the guidance of the cardiologist Dr. Samir Shah, as a multipurpose remedy for everything from fatigue to weight gain. (Andrew Barile, PureFlows co-founder, says that a 45-minute session is the aerobic equivalent of a seven-and-a-half-mile walk.) Some New Yorkers are swearing by it. At first I wasnt convinced, but by the third session I noticed that, for the first time in 20 years, I was able to enjoy a full nights sleep without interruption, says Celeste Fierro, a restaurant and nightclub consultant. Her tolerance for alcohol is lower, too. I used to be able to drink a bottle of wine at dinner, and now I can only take a glass.

So while watching the the Balmain fall 2012 collection unfurl it was easy to embroider a line between the elaborate, mosaic-style beading that the designer Olivier Rousteing dreamed up and the exquisitely embellished clothes worn by Lady Mary and company. The obvious parallels, of course, lie in the richness of the workmanship. But there are less evident similarities between the Downton costumes and Rousteings clothes, as well as those of Erdem Moralioglu, who embroidered lace onto rubber; Marios Schwab, who layered sequined gowns with chiffon; and Gucci, where the designer Frida Giannini sent out a cocktail dress dripping with coq feathers. These creations (and many others, every season) beg the inevitable question: How are they to be cleaned?

This fall, the company is giving its womens line a similar treatment. For the first limited-edition womens collaboration, Olivia Kim, Opening Ceremonys vice president of creative, and her pal Jen Brill, a brand ambassador for Chanel and creative consultant, have created a collection of shoes that can be worn from day to night. Being able to run around the city comfortably and still look cute is always a challenge, Brill says. That was the starting point of the design process. Both women grew up wearing Cole Haan shoes, and for inspiration they turned to looks from the companys archive, like a leather fisherman sandal from the mid-1990s and a 1970s clog. The twist? We wanted to use colors that were different from what you may expect traditionally from Cole Haan, Kim says of their collections three styles: a strappy sandal ($528), an ankle-strap pump ($528) and an ankle boot ($548), all rendered in jewel-toned Italian suede. We personally love rich, saturated colors, added Kim, whose hair is sometimes frosted pink. (Brills signature is red lips.) The Chelsea collection will be available Sept. 10 at the Cole Haan SoHo store (128 Prince Street; 212-219-8240).

This former gold-rush town suffered in the aftermath of apartheid, but the revitalization that came with South Africas hosting of the soccer World Cup in 2010 has blossomed. With a major face-lift of the citys infrastructure  including the two-year-old mass transit rail system, the Gautrain, which was completed in June  Johannesburg is showing off its virtues and overcoming its vices. Although crime in some precincts remains stubbornly high and a bit of caution is recommended, downtown Johannesburg is in the midst of a revival. Nowadays, young Johannesburgers from different backgrounds are working together to remake their city for the next generation, tapping into a wellspring of creative energy and entrepreneurial spirit. Parts of Johannesburgs once-decrepit inner city have turned into a vital gathering place, including an old parking garage that now houses a food and fashion market, and a one-time alcohol warehouse that is today stocked with galleries and restaurants.

They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didnt know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted.

But I like to think I can do many things, from full drag to scrubbed clean, and somehow make it look like my hand. He may be versatile, but one thing that carries through all his work is sex appeal. Ive been accused of making girls look oversexed, he admits. The sultry makeup he did here has a tough-girl edge. I wanted to play with the idea of youth, which for me means a bare face with one statement, like a drawn-on eyebrow or a matte black eye. No foundation, no blush  just lots of attitude. While lipstick is optional (I dont believe in the rule that says you shouldnt wear a strong eye with a strong lip  its a good-taste trap), great skin is imperative. Carrasquillos trade secret? A special arnica oil-based luminizer he whips up in his East Village kitchen. Every model I use it on asks me to make some for them, he says. I wont reveal all the ingredients, but its healing and leaves skin with a beautiful, glowing finish. Maquillage magic can only do so much, though, he adds. A woman can have incredible skin, but if shes not happy in it, all the makeup in the world wont help.

Corn on the cob that is sold in supermarkets is an irrigated crop, like other vegetables and fruits grown on large farms. However, smaller farms that sell their produce at farmers markets in drought-stricken areas are having a difficult time with their yields, so you may see a spike in prices there.

And its developer, Andrew Zobler, the C.E.O. of Sydell Group (which owns the NoMad Hotel and brought the Ace Hotels to New York and Palm Springs), is betting that its a game changer in the hospitality business. He hired Roman & Williams, which designed the Ace New York, to create the interiors  colorful spaces, some with bunk beds, that look like a styled-out room at sleepaway camp. Think seaside boathouse, lifeguard school, a homemade summer camp near the ocean, says the designer Robin Standefer. Zobler, who traveled to hostels in the States and abroad and says he found that they offered something lacking in many hotels  a culture where the guests were open to and often seeking out meaningful interactions with each other and where new friendships were being formed. To that end, Freehand will have a vegetable garden, swimming pool, table tennis, bicycles and even art classes, as well as a restaurant and bar run by the folks behind local favorite Broken Shaker. And there will be towels, sheets, pillows and an amenity-stocked bathroom for every room  not always a given at hostels. As Standefer puts it, its not a place with cheap beds to just crash in. About 15 of the 60 rooms will be private (for one or two guests), while shared rooms will accommodate up to eight beds, with rates starting at about $50 for a bed in a shared room.

In 1988 the teen idol reteamed with her Pretty in Pink co-star Andrew McCarthy for Fresh Horses, a talky drama about a tough, sullen Kentucky country girl who catches the eye of an engaged engineering student. For moviegoers who went in expecting the plucky high schooler she played in the earlier movie, or Sixteen Candles, Fresh Horses was a real downer. The group of much more popular friends to whom I recommended it abandoned me halfway through for Ernest Saves Christmas and never hung out with me again. I loved it, though  in part because you could see how hard Ringwald was working to be not just a teen-movie star but an actress. That she couldnt yet pull it off made Fresh Horses poignant, and no less enjoyable  and as fans of the ABC Family series The Secret Life of the American Teenager know, in the end she has become an actress, and not a bad one at all.",2012-08-23T14:19:01+0000

Winning an Oscar earlier this year for best animated short after appearing, last summer, as a lauded animated app, William Joyces story of a natty Southern loner was a feat of digital imagination, a dazzlingly polished animation and a wordless tribute to a fading literary age. Now, realized at last as a childrens book, his tale gains elegance but loses depth. The print-edition Morris Lessmore is a stylishly paced, vividly illustrated parable for young readers, yet it somehow lacks the dreamy creativity of its animated precursors.

The cover of that issue  featuring the two heroes in flight canoodling  got comic book fans talking when it was released last week. Those strong reactions, good and bad, were exactly the goal of Geoff Johns, the writer of Justice League, and Jim Lee, the books artist. In 2011 Mr. Lee was named co-publisher at DC Comics along with Dan DiDio, and Mr. Johns was named chief creative officer of DC Entertainment. In an interview they said that the Superman-Wonder Woman romance had been one of the most exciting elements they had conceived of when DCs heroes were given a reboot last fall. When we thought about relaunching the entire DC universe, we considered not what we were going to remove, but what we could add to the mythology, Mr. Lee said. Mr. Johns said the romance and how it affects the characters, their teammates and their supporting casts will affect the DC universe for years. Fans with longer memories will recall that in 1986, after a previous reboot, Superman and Wonder Woman had another flirtation but eventually decided they were not right for each other. That version of Superman eventually revealed his identity to Lois Lane. He proposed to her, and they were married.

The flavor is nutty and rich because of the whole-wheat flour, but the dough isnt heavy.

Major Hasan told his lawyers that he began growing a beard because of his Muslim faith. But the judge overseeing his pretrial hearings at Fort Hood said that Major Hasan was disrupting the proceedings and violating Army regulations, and that he would be forcibly shaved if he did not do so voluntarily. Major Hasans lawyers appealed, but on Monday the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces said that since the judge had not issued a definitive order for a forcible shaving, it was too early for them to decide. The court said that if such an order were issued, Major Hasan could appeal to a lower Army appeals court. But the court appeared to agree with Major Hasans lawyers on elements of the case, asking the judge to address, if an order for shaving was given, why a forcible shaving was the least restrictive means of intruding on his religious liberties.

us,On Chris Christies Flop,"I wrote my Campaign Stops columntoday about Ann Romneys convention speech, but I should say something about Chris Christies address, given how quickly its been branded as a solipsistic flop. There is, of course, no real way to disprove the conventional wisdom in a case like this: Nobody (to my knowledge)conducts insta-polls of the TV audiences reaction to a keynote speech, so if the chattering and political classes agree that Christie laid an egg, then thats how his remarks will be remembered. But its worth noting that the indictment against the New Jersey governor is  distinctly underwhelming. He stands accused of talking too much about himself and not enough about Mitt Romney (or maybe not enough about Barack Obama, depending on which critique you read), and generally of failing to deliver the kind of tour de force that reporters are accustomed to seeing in his YouTube clips. But as even the big Politico piece calling the speech a flop allows, the most famous keynotes Mario Cuomo in 1984 and Barack Obama in 2004 were less about touting the nominee than laying out a broader vision of what the party stood for, and that was pretty clearly what Christie was trying to do as well. And I dont think he did it all that badly.

ABO Blood is targeted to the under-eye area, specifically dark circles and puffy or crepe-y skin, but Simon slathers it over her entire face. Its especially great for city dwellers, she says.

Still, the traditional Japanese garden, esoteric as it is, has an ancient and undeniable appeal. Its about secrets, perspectives, initiation, memory and time. It may take ages for a Japanese garden to come to maturity, to say nothing of the gardener. And yet, for all its mystery, the Japanese garden reveals itself as a capacious symbol of the human soul, replete with exactly the kinds of borrowed landscapes we live with.

It sees the kind of steps required to potentially expand that 51 percent to, say, 53 percent as simply too risky  in a polarized country and with a restive base  for the Republican candidate to undertake. And if you accept those two premises, last nights speech was well-conceived and well-delivered: It was a genuinely humanizing and even moving performance that addressed whats been his biggest liability to date  his career at Bain Capital  head-on while otherwise supplying only the most general, non-threatening account of what a President Romney might actually do in office.

As a former participant on similar programs, I suspect not. Equipped with a tour guide and camera, travelers become poverty tourists, observing locals through an invisible but palpable barrier.

us,Telluride Film Festival: A Sneak Peek at Argo,"TELLURIDE, Colo.  Telluride is not exactly a secret film festival there are enough journalists and publicists here in the San Juan Mountains to get the word out to the masses below  but discretion is among the local traditions. According to custom, the lineup for the 39th edition of the festival was announced only Thursday, 24 hours before the first screenings, and as usual a number of spaces on the schedule were left mysterious, marked TBA. Some of those slots are reserved for sneaksmovies that pop into town like sudden thunderstorms  and rumors immediately began to fly about what special extras might be in store this year.

The ex-boyfriend, Jose Orozco, a Mexican immigrant hired by Sheriff Babeu to run the Twitter account and the Web site for his Congressional campaign, also will not face charges over accusations that he improperly manipulated them. Mr. Orozco had accused Sheriff Babeu of threatening to deport him if he made their relationship public, but the authorities said the allegations could not be proved.

us,Wyoming: Federal Protections End For Gray Wolves ,"Concluding a long effort to take the gray wolves in the Northern Rockies off the endangered species list, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service lifted protections for most Wyoming wolves on Friday. The move allows the increased hunting of wolves in Wyoming, where there are about 270 outside Yellowstone National Park. Protections have already been lifted in Montana and Idaho. Major environmental groups immediately protested the move and will most likely sue to block it. They have long maintained that without the protections, hunters and ranchers in the area will kill wolves indiscriminately and ruin one of conservations biggest success stories. Ranchers argue that even if the overall cost of wolf attacks on cattle may be small, it can mean the difference between profit and loss in marginal operations. ",2012-08-31T23:58:51+0000
