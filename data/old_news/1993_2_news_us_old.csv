Glen Featherstone provided the Bruins with a 3-1 lead, scoring his fourth of the season before Sweeney extended the margin, finding the empty net with 13 seconds to play. Joe Sakic, with his 34th goal five minutes into the game, connected for the Nordiques, who entered the game with three victories and two ties in their previous five outings.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
Music Into Paint","More than four years after his death at the age of 27, Jean-Michel Basquiat is still the subject of critical debate over his place in art history. The ambitious Basquiat quickly left the streets, where he gained his first celebrity as a graffiti artist, for the studio, where he painted on a grand scale, both physically and emotionally. His brilliantly colored canvases were covered with anguished figures and sardonic printed phrases like ""Haloes fifty nine cent"" or ""Milk$;."" In JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT (Whitney Museum of American Art/Abrams, $65), Richard Marshall, a curator at the Whitney Museum, analyzes Basquiat's iconography as the fruit of a voracious visual curiosity that took in everything from ancient Rhodesian rock art to product symbols. This handsome catalogue for a retrospective exhibit of Basquiat's work, which is at the Whitney through Feb. 14, contains essays by five critics, including Greg Tate of The Village Voice, who compares Basquiat to other black artists who combine words with images. The Yale art historian Robert Farris Thompson explores how Basquiat transformed ""music into paint"" in such densely detailed canvases as ""Zydeco."" Basquiat's nervous calligraphy and flayed-looking figures, often depicted in attitudes of helpless exposure, contrast with his rich surfaces, as in ""Leonardo da Vinci's Greatest Hits."" The artist's recognition of the depths of human dishonesty wrapped his works in an angry gloom, but his paintings' unflagging vitality stands in counterpoint, and marks Jean-Michel Basquiat as a quintessentially American painter.",1993-02-07T05:00:00+0000

From the moment he met James Forman, the executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -- who promptly put him to work photographing the segregated drinking fountains in an Albany, Ga., courthouse -- Mr. Lyon became S.N.C.C.'s first staff photographer, the visual historian of the movement. In the remarkable MEMORIES OF THE SOUTHERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT (University of North Carolina, cloth, $39.95; paper, $19.95) are images of armed police officers and tear-gassed demonstrators, a hooded Klansman, and S.N.C.C. organizers like Robert Moses, John Lewis and Marion Barry, the future Mayor of Washington. There is also a photograph of shattered stained-glass windows, hanging loose like broken limbs, in the Birmingham, Ala., church where a 1963 bombing killed four adolescent girls. Mr. Lyon's commentary complements the powerful narrative of his photographs. Describing a shot of policemen hauling away a demonstrator, Mr. Lyon writes: ""Albany was quiet when I was there, so two people went out and got arrested on my behalf."" An image of the S.N.C.C. office in Greenwood, Miss., shows a decal reading: ""COME . . . TOGETHER. Let Us Build a Nonviolent World."" ""The office is firebombed the next day,"" the caption tells us. Mr. Lyon includes such documents as the minutes of S.N.C.C. meetings and a letter Robert Moses wrote while in jail in Magnolia, Miss.

Secretary of State Warren Christopher offered the six-point plan, which could commit United States ground troops as part of an international enforcement group. A1 A CENTER ROLE FOR MOSCOW News analysis: For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow is moving into the center of the diplomatic arena as a result of President Clinton's conclusion that Russia can exert significant influence over the fate of his plan to end the war in Bosnia. A12 54 DIE IN BOSNIA FIGHTING Battles between Serbian and Muslim forces in eastern Bosnia have reportedly exacted a heavy toll over the last 24 hours, killing 54. A13 POPE SEEKS HELP FOR SUDANESE Comparing the plight of Christians in the Sudan to that of Jesus on the cross, Pope John Paul II urged the country's Islamic leaders to cease what he called religious persecution of Christians and end ""the terrible harvest of suffering"" caused by civil war in the south.

A4 National A16-29, B16 CLINTON'S 'TOWN HALL' Three weeks into his term, the President traveled to Michigan for give-and-take with a television audience, hoping it would help his Administration recover from early controversies and make the case for economic sacrifice. A1 A MODERN-DAY FIRESIDE CHAT News analysis: The President's question-and-answer session skirted a skeptical Washington press corps and marked the start of a politically crucial effort to build a constituency for programs resisted by entrenched interests. A1 Clinton's arrival in Michigan was carefully choreographed. A27 Clinton ordered a cut of 100,000 jobs from the Federal work force.

Still paved with their original cobblestones with a middle gutter for the rainwater, they twist and sharply climb the slopes of the rock on which they cling.

In the iconography of American Presidents as seen from Tokyo, the World War II veterans who went on to occupy the Oval Office never bore a grudge. Instead, they were magnanimous victors who, after vanquishing the old Japan, took an almost fatherly pride in its reconstruction. They remembered the occupation, and regarded the Japanese as a bright, industrious ward who grew into America's strongest ally in the Pacific. Most important, they were usually indulgent of the country's mercantilist tendencies, viewing them as a problem that should not be allowed to threaten the relationship.",1993-02-14T05:00:00+0000

Growing numbers of college graduates are becoming part of a new ""subsidized generation,"" in which financially able parents cheerfully underwrite apartments in the city so that both their children and they themselves may continue to enjoy their independence.

us,Business Diary/February 7-12,"Even with the battering it's taken in recent years, General Motors remains larger than life. And last week, true to form, it dominated the news -- a public-relations bull's-eye one day, a mind-boggling loss the next. First, refusing to just lick its wounds after a jury held it responsible for a teen-ager's death in a G.M. pickup, the company roared onto the offensive, suing NBC for tampering with a truck in a news report. It scored a direct hit, as NBC -- to settle the suit -- issued a stunningly long (three-and-a-half-minute) on-air apology. Then, with no qualms about kicking the downed network, the auto maker suspended advertising on all NBC News programs. (After just a day, however, saying it was satisfied with the apology, it rescinded that ban.) And to thicken the plot, a judge dealt G.M. a setback in its grand plan to close numerous plants -- and gave at least a temporary reprieve to 2,500 auto workers whose jobs are threatened. Saying that by accepting tax abatements G.M. had effectively promised to keep its Willow Run plant, in Ypsilanti, Mich., open through the 1990's, the judge blocked it from closing the plant. G.M. had planned to close it this summer and consolidate operations in Arlington, Tex. Calling the ruling ""unprecedented and contrary to both the facts and the law,"" G.M. said it would appeal. The company had tried to forfeit the tax breaks, but Doug Winters, the Ypsilanti city attorney, said, ""We want the jobs, not the money. G.M. is not above the law."" Sprinting for the Red Has Carl Lewis gone into accounting? He must have, the way records are getting broken. But corporate America surely hopes these records will last. First, Ford reported a $7.4 billion loss for 1992, mainly because of its retiree accounting, erasing I.B.M.'s recent record for the nation's largest loss. But its title lasted just a day, as General Motors came in with a stunning $23.5 billion figure. Without the special charges, though, there were signs of improving operations. G.M. stock did well, ending the week at $40.625, while Ford shares slipped to $49.25. A Poorer Sears, a New Sears Another fixture of the corporate landscape dumped some hefty numbers onto its balance sheet last week. In reporting a $3.9 billion deficit, Sears, Roebuck cited hurricane-related losses at its Allstate Insurance unit and the costs of scrapping its catalogue. Not to mention its charge for retiree benefits -- $1.87 billion. Later in the week, after pausing to let the news sink in, the retailer looked squarely at the future, vowing to spend $4 billion to give its stores face lifts. More Shrinkage at I.B.M. It may have to rename itself I.B. if it gets any smaller. I.B.M. only recently said it would cut its work force by 25,000, but word spread last week that it could be more like 40,000. The numbers tell the tale of the incredible shrinking company. Workers: 407,000 in 1986, 300,000 at the end of '92 . . . and 260,000 at the end of '93? Stock price: over $100 last summer, $50.75 on Friday. Short Chapter at Random House Joni Evans has had a bumpy ride at Random House. In 1987 she was recruited to start her own imprint. Then she was named to head the adult trade division. That lasted just a few years, and she then created Turtle Bay Books. But now Turtle Bay is no more. Ms. Evans said she always thought ""it would be three to four years before we broke even, and I thought he did, too."" But ""he"" -- Alberto Vitale, Random House chairman -- said, ""Conditions have changed."" Survival of the Techiest It makes the head spin. You're slogging through the evening's cable offerings -- the 12 talk shows, the 15 football games -- when some long-distance company calls to explain its convoluted advantages. Now it's all getting mixed up together; the cable and phone businesses are cross-breeding, embarking on an odd Darwinian struggle. Last week, in the first deal of its kind, Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two cable systems from Hauser Communications -- the onset of a race to deliver all manner of communications services, like more cable offerings than you'll ever keep track of. Soon, perhaps, you'll reach for the phone to turn on a movie, or turn on the set to call Aunt Nellie -- or finally, in low-tech despair, sit down and read a book. Hello, Phone -- Get Me Rewrite Meanwhile, phone technology moves relentlessly on. In Nynex's latest bid to improve the human lot, you can say ""Mom"" and the phone calls your mom. And only yours, mind you. Other voices get other moms. In the system Nynex will soon begin testing, each household member compiles a separate voice directory of dozens of names. Is the system perfect? Well, no. Nynex officials concede that if Dana Carvey barked out ""Barbara,"" the former First Lady's phone could easily ring. HB>THE ECONOMY",1993-02-14T05:00:00+0000

Right There on His Stage","""Toast of the Town,"" renamed ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" shortly after its debut in 1948, dominated television for almost a quarter of a century. At its peak, it was watched every Sunday by as many as 50 million Americans. ""Never before, and never again,"" writes the critic John Leonard in his text for A REALLY BIG SHOW: A Visual History of the Ed Sullivan Show (Sarah Lazin/Viking Studio, $35), ""would so many gather loyally, for so long, in the thrall of one man's taste."" Although the book's editors, Andrew Solt, a producer and director, and his wife, Claudia Falkenburg, have ""tried to recapture some of that magic,"" they have succeeded only in part. It is fun to browse through the more than 350 photographs of now-familiar celebrities as they looked 20, 30 or 40 years ago. And it is a pleasure to read Mr. Leonard's graceful analysis of how Sullivan, a newspaper columnist who ""couldn't sing, or dance, or spin a plate,"" nevertheless became ""a Ministry of Popular Culture,""""a one-man cable television system, with wrestling and Bravo and comedy channels, Broadway and Hollywood and C-Span, sports and music video."" However, a book of photographs with even the liveliest text can hardly do justice to the vaudeville-cum-circus that logged 1,087 hours of air time during its 23-year run, from 1948 to 1971.

It is very easy for a person in a lot of pain to want and try alternate treatments. That is fine, as long as they have all the facts. Before agreeing to any treatment you should find out what all the costs are and if they will be covered by your insurer. If the treatment is investigational, your insurer may not pay for it.

It would increase other spending on ""stimulus and investment"" by $169 billion. The net reduction in the deficit over those four years would be $325 billion.

A Vanished World","When the Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer fled Tibet on horseback with the young Dalai Lama in 1950, he took with him hundreds of photographs from his years in what was then a stable, isolated and feudal theocracy. LOST LHASA: Heinrich Harrer's Tibet (Abrams, $39.95), a charming book of reminiscences, is organized around 200 of those black-and-white photographs of pre-Communist Lhasa -- a family album from a vanished world. Although Mr. Harrer includes shots of marketplaces, mounted archery contests and masked dancers in aprons of human bones, his most successful pictures are less exotic and far more surprising: members of the Lhasa cabinet inspecting a dike in a yak-hide coracle, holding umbrellas with a Victorian formality; the Dalai Lama's brother on a riverbank in sophisticated dark glasses and what looks like a silk dressing gown. In other images, monks skate on ice and cheat at cards, beefy police-monks brandish great staves, and criminals in ankle shackles beg by the side of the road. Mr. Harrer came to Tibet in 1944, at the age of 32, after escaping from a British internment camp in north India; he and a companion spent two years walking to Lhasa and arrived nearly starved. He was befriended by the Tibetan nobility and worked as a Government employee. Mr. Harrer's Tibetans reflect his matter-of-fact intimacy with them: they are not exotic oddities or posed and noble savages. He photographed not as a professional but as a friend.",1993-02-21T05:00:00+0000

With spit-and-polish gold metal plaques riveted to the back and double-C logos embellishing the toes, the boots help to secure the wearer's fashion status, both coming and going.

Whoever said high fashion was effortless? While a few women wear them with slim below-the-knee suit skirts, most pair them with leggings, stirrup trousers or narrow-legged jumpsuits, all topped with a variety of sporty parkas, Chanel jackets and even a blond sable. The look includes an abundance of Chanel gold-chain accessories -- necklaces, hatbands, belts and straps for black quilted shoulder bags -- not to mention gold buttons, zippers and earrings.

us,Mediums With Messages,"Nino Fidencio was a Mexican folk healer who lived in the northeastern state of Nuevo Leon in the early part of the 20th century. When he died at the age of 40 in 1938 (at the hands of jealous doctors, his followers believed), he was the country's most prominent healer -- it was even said that he had cured the Mexican President of a serious illness. Since his death his cult has spread, particularly among Mexican-Americans in south Texas; tens of thousands make a pilgrimage to his tomb every year. NINO FIDENCIO: A Heart Thrown Open (Museum of New Mexico Press, $34.95) presents a reverential look at the experiences of his contemporary followers through Dore Gardner's documentary photographs of the pilgrims, and through testimonials from the women who are his mediums. Frequently these women go to Nino Fidencio's shrine (often over the objections of their husbands) seeking to cure themselves or their children of debilitating illnesses after traditional medicine has failed. If they or their children are healed, the women often pay their debt by allowing Nino Fidencio's spirit to take over their bodies so that they may cure others, and by making the arduous pilgrimage to the remote village where he lived. Few who knew Nino Fidencio are still alive, and details about his life are vague and subject to constant revision by his devotees. An essay by the folklorist Kay F. Turner offers some historical and psychological insight into the cult, but more information would have been welcome, not only about Nino Fidencio but about his followers as well. For example, biographical sketches of the people giving testimonials might have made clear that many references to Nino Fidencio are actually about a medium who has taken on his spirit in a trance. However, this book offers a fascinating glimpse into a little-known phenomenon as well as a testament to the power of belief.",1993-02-28T05:00:00+0000
