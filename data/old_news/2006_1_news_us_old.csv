Sure enough, Jeremy soon discovers that while the air in Boone Creek may be ""scented with perfume and pine and salted mist,"" there's very little for a transplanted city boy to do -- except fall into a fugue state of paranoid jealousy. Sparks's prose has the amiable, folksy rhythm of a rocking chair on a wraparound porch, but beware: his dialogue can be knuckle-bitingly bad (""Now, dat dere's a purty ring,"" one yokel tells Lexie). He also has an incurable weakness for corny characters (like the meddlesome Mayor Gherkin) and Hallmark-card aphorisms (""Life has a tendency to throw curveballs when you least expect them"").

There aren't a lot of new books here -- traditionally, publishers don't release many titles in December -- but Maya Angelou's pint-size stocking stuffer of a poem, ""Amazing Peace,"" moves up to No. 4 in its second week.

It's an antiwar poem that's most memorable for being completely unmemorable: it's like being Mannheim Steamrolled. (""Into this climate of fear and apprehension, Christmas enters, / Streaming lights of joy, ringing bells of hope."") It didn't hurt sales that Angelou read her poem on ""Oprah,"" where Winfrey called her ""my spiritual mother,"" or that Angelou has her own Hallmark Christmas special on TV this year.

Babel had written the first masterpiece of the Russian Revolution, Red Cavalry, a cycle of stories about Cossack horse soldiers fighting against the Poles in a brutal and bloody campaign; these stories had the ""architecture"" and complexity of a novel, a Cubist novel built on a wild geometry where the missing pieces were an essential part of the puzzle. Babel was idolized and attacked for the same reason: rather than celebrate the Revolution, he galloped across it with a cavalryman's panache. He was the one Soviet writer who was read abroad. That made him an infidel in the Party's eyes. And he had to walk a curious tightrope for the rest of his life-revere the Revolution and write a prickly, personal prose that was like a time bomb to the Revolution's dull, pragmatic songs.

us,Kandy Land,"It is an eccentricity of fashion that just as winter begins to nip at your sling-back heels, and cashmere starts to seem less like a luxury and more like a basic human need, scanty bathing suits, filmy sundresses and the strappiest of sandals suddenly appear in the stores like an act of demented defiance. But fashion knows, often before we do, exactly when we long to be somewhere else, and the sartorial manifestation of this longing is an annual collection known as resort. At Helga's Folly in Sri Lanka, overlooking the ancient city of Kandy, resort clothes make sense both in reality and as concept. Not just because at this time of year the weather is generally fine. But rather because the seat of the de Silva family, a 1930's Art Deco chalet that Helga de Silva Blow Perera not so long ago transformed into a colorful 40-room guest house, is in its own way an act of demented defiance. Monkeys swing on the balconies, fairies guard the pool and at lunchtime the sandwiches are served the old-fashioned way with the crusts removed. The de Silva heritage, which extends to art, antiques, politics (George and Agnes de Silva helped secure Sri Lankan independence in 1948), architecture (Esme de Silva, a member of the Bauhaus, designed the chalet; Minette de Silva, a girlfriend of Le Corbusier, was among Asia's first female architects) and general intrigue, stands in for dcor. And Helga's notorious daughter-in-law, the fashion instigator and editor Isabella Blow, wearer of virtually unwearable Alexander McQueen frocks and Philip Treacy headdresses, does not hold a candle to our host. But you see where she's coming from. Here, among the pine forests, the waterfalls, the ""Mogambo"" jungles, the tea plantations and the drawing rooms, a feather-print gown, a floppy hat and a pair of shoes conjured from a pair of scarves hardly seem eccentric but entirely appropriate.",2006-01-01T05:00:00+0000

For almost thirty years John served brilliantly in varying capacities as the Museum's Treasurer, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman of the Pension Committee, Chairman of the Committee on Photography, and served as a member on many other trustee committees including the Expansion, Executive, Personnel, House, Investment, and Nominating committees. Since 1966 John was a member of the Museum's International Council and served as its Treasurer from 1973 to 1978. From 1970 onward, his generosity enabled the acquisition of scores of important photographs for the collection. John's relationship to the Museum reached back to its creation, as his mother, Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, also a Trustee, was the niece of Lillie P. Bliss, one of the Museum's original founders. The Trustees and staff are profoundly grateful for John's extraordinary contribution to the life of the Museum and will remember him with affection and high regard as a great leader, a true gentleman, and a stalwart defender of the Museum's ideals.

These are not, of course, warrants for the writing of a biography. They simply make pleasurable the task of telling the story of a man whose passing in 1902, at the age of thirty-two, prompted an outpouring by those who knew him of testimonials to a life well lived. The fact that, three decades after Norris's death, Franklin Walker, his first biographer, could easily obtain positive recollections through correspondence and interviews is only further encouragement to complement and, when necessary, correct his portrait. It is now clear that there was much more to the story of this personable individual than Walker was able to discern in 1932, or his successors have discerned in articles, parts of books, M.A. theses, and Ph.D. dissertations. However, our principal reasons for devoting extended attention now to Norris are of another kind. ",2006-01-01T05:00:00+0000

It was the eve of the Christmas holidays and William Wordsworth was waiting for the first sight of the horses that were coming to bring him home from school.

He served on the institute's Board of Directors as well as an adjunct faculty member.

If this eastern ancestry featured in his dreams, it usually took a more Arabian form, as 'processions, strange crowds of people, faAades of oriental looking buildings with hieroglyphics on them - like racial memories', nothing to do with trade. He made anti-Semitic remarks and mocked his family's 'Jewish gold' made 'in the east by dirty trading' to allow a snobbish life in England as cigar-smoking worshippers of 'German royalties and dissolute peers'. Siegfried's cousin Philip Sassoon, the bachelor politician and host, was similarly uneasy about it and hinted that he was of Parsee stock, aware perhaps how quickly the English could turn on Jews, how much they remained essentially outsiders.

Briefly; 'American Idol': America's Most Watched,"In 2005, ""American Idol"" accounted for the two most-watched programs on television as its Tuesday and Wednesday editions delivered an average audience of 27.32 million and 26.07 million, respectively. When measuring the results of Nielsen's estimates for the calendar year, reality shows like Fox's ""Idol"" have an advantage over most scripted programs, because they run for half of a season and do not broadcast repeats that bring down their average ratings. Which is not to sell short the ratings accomplishments of ""Idol"": among 18-to-49-year-olds in 2005, its two weekly installments outdrew everything else on television by approximately 5 million viewers. In the total viewer category, CBS's ""CSI"" (21.98 million) ranked No. 3, behind ""Idol."" Following ""CSI"" was CBS's spring edition of ""Survivor"" (20.91 million), and then the recently completed fall edition, which brought in 18.3 million. The women of Wisteria Lane on ABC's ""Desperate Housewives"" (17.81 million) ascended to No. 6. In the year's Top 10, Fox had the two ""Idols,"" CBS had five shows -- ""Without a Trace"" and ""CSI: Miami"" were Nos. 9 and 10 -- and ABC had three, as the summer edition of ""Dancing With the Stars"" and the last season of ""Monday Night Football"" finished seventh and eighth, respectively.

Nielsen ratings for Ms. Van Susteren, left, rose for the year in both total viewers, with an average of 1.75 million each night, and in adults 25 to 54, the demographic advertisers aim for on television news. On Nov. 7, CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" made its debut in the 10 p.m. hour; between then and Christmas, ""On the Record"" soundly beat it, more than doubling ""360"" in total viewers. But when compared with the same period in 2004, ""360"" has improved CNN's ratings from 10 p.m. to midnight, while Fox's numbers have decreased in the younger demographics. Among viewers 25 to 54, ""On the Record"" was down 36 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, while ""360"" ratings rose 17 percent for the time period. At 11 p.m., rebroadcasts of ""The O'Reilly Factor"" have also easily beaten ""360,"" but have similarly lost 25-to-54-year-olds when compared with the show's 2004 ratings.

The film wonk promptly asked the Bagger who he thought should win Best Supporting Actress, and stumped him, leading to enormous personal humiliation he would prefer not to discuss. Lets just say it wont happen again, because the Bagger has been reading up at And The Oscar Goes To  where he learned Way Too Much about the semiotics and subtext of supporting roles in the distaff hemisphere.

us,Real Actual Movies People Can See,"One of the reasons that the Bagger is glad hes back is that during most of December, he was writing about films that plain old civilians had not seen. Now The New World, Brokeback Mountain, and Munich are rolling out across all sorts of zip codes. And mark the Baggers word, you are going to be hearing a lot more about Match Point. For all the inside industry chatter about Woody Allen, left, being back, it is far more important that audiences seem to be showing up for the bloody romance movie. The crowd-pleasing gimmick embedded in the film, along with a contemporary resonance that brings to mind Closer, makes Mr. Allens conflicted backstory and string of box office also-rans seem far less important. Speaking of which, now that the Baggers horde of readers has actually seen some of these movies, lets hear from you about Best Picture if you dare. Is Syriana toast? Can Match Point sneak in? Will Kong get gonged? Is Brokeback Peaking Too Early or Just Plain Unbeatable? Is Geishas makeup beginning to run? Will History of Violence make a historic comeback?

Narnia is galloping by Kong at the box office, which does not bode well for the monkeys finishing game at the Oscars. Guess thats what happens when you go up against a mythical character who is serving as a stand-in for God? The box office figures matter because Academy members are human, or at least as close as you can get in Los Angeles, and if audiences saw Kong as a celebration of the muscle and sheer magnitude of industry might, it might build steam in the Academy. As it is, audiences, especially kids, seem to be feeling a bit hung over after drinking in all the visual excess. One too many dinosaurs will do that to you. Kong will get its share of Kodak moments on Oscar night  although the movie may be a little too too, there is far too much virtuosity to ignore  but it may not get to thump its chest when Best Picture or Best Director get announced. But dont just listen to the Bagger  look to the Directors Guild nominations this Thursday and see if Peter Jackson elbows his way in.

To the very end, she lived her life to the fullest, with grace, with dignity, with courage, with beauty and, most of all, with love. Toby was born on May 6, 1939. She grew up in Keene, New Hampshire and graduated from Brandeis University in 1960. While in college, she met her future husband Bernie Nussbaum, who was then a law school student. They married in June 1963 and had three children, Emily, Peter and Frank. Peter married Alexis Tannenbaum and they have two children, Wylie and Levi. Emily married Clive Thompson, and a week before Toby died Emily gave birth to her first child, Gabriel Ezra. Toby was aware of Gabriel's birth and was able to meet him, to her great delight. Toby had two brothers, Jay and Bob Sheinfeld, with whom she was very close, as she was with their spouses, Peggy and Susan, and her nieces, Jennifer, Rebecca, Gwen and Daryl. Toby was also a beloved member of Bernie's extended family, including his mother Molly, his brothers, Albert and Martin, their spouses and children, and Bernie's numerous cousins. When Bernie served as Counsel to the President of the United States in 1993 and 1994, Toby was a tower of strength and, in her own right, a respected and popular figure in Washington. All of her adult life Toby was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs. She was a finance chairman for Congresswoman Nita Lowey in her first race for Congress in 1988. She was selected as an elector in 1992 and voted in the Electoral College for President Clinton. She was an officer of the Westchester County Democratic Party. Toby served on the Board of Trustees of Brandeis University and Westchester Community College. She was deeply involved with UJA-Federation of New York, the Metropolitan Council for Jewish Poverty, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. She served as an officer of her synagogue, Temple Israel Center of White Plains. For many years, she sang in Carnegie Hall as a member of the chorus of the New York Oratorio Society. At her homes in New York and Connecticut, she was a warm and engaging hostess. She was a wonderful and devoted friend to so many. Her husband, her children and her precious grandchildren were the joys of her life. And she was the joy of their lives. She will live forever in their memories and in the memories of so many others. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, January 5, 2006 at 12 noon at Temple Israel Center, 280 Old Mamaroneck Road, White Plains, NY (914 948 - 2800)(www.templeisrae lcenter.org).

Under a proposal by the Treasury Department and legislation introduced last year by Ohio Republican Michael Oxley and Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, the Bank Holding Company Act would be amended to allow financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries of national banks to act as agents for buyers and sellers of property and to list property for sale.The NAR vehemently opposes the change and has been successful in blocking it so far. When President Bush signed the Transportation, Treasury and HUD spending bill on November 30, 2005, it contained a one year prohibition against the proposal that would allow banking interests to operate real estate brokerage, leasing and property management businesses. The NAR says that this is the fourth year the organization has been successful in blocking the changes. The battle between two of Washingtons most powerful interest groups promises to continue in 2006. According to campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics, the real estate industry was the fourth largest contributor to members of Congress during the 2005-2006 session.

He was 69 years old. He leaves a legacy of boundless love, devotion and admiration for the arts, which throughout his wonderful life served as the focal point for all his accomplishments, the gathering of friends where stories regaled, and the education of many communities along the way.

As a member of the Board of The Santa Fe Desert Chorale he assisted in bringing the Chorale into an era of heightened stability and artistic success. He is survived by his two children, Andrew Boyd Maloy of Chesapeake, Virginia, and his daughter Clare Corby Maloy (Barry) of New York City, New York.

Stern, co-founder, director and Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern passed away on December 28, 2005 after losing a brave battle with brain cancer. He was 74. Mr. Stern was a pioneer in the field of gastrointestinal imaging. Mr. Stern co-founded EZ-EM in 1962 to develop and market the first unit-dose product to virtually eliminate cross-contamination during the administration of barium sulfate contrast media. Mr. Stern was the holder of several patents. Mr. Stern would dedicate his life to the development of products that improved the diagnosis and treatment of GI disease. During his more than 40 years of leadership with E-Z-EM, he helped introduce a series of important innovations to the field, and in the process established the Company as a recognized name among radiologists around the world. Mr. Stern served as a director of E-Z-EM from the Company's founding until his passing, and also served as the Company's Chairman of the Board from its founding until December 2004, when he was named Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern also served as Chief Executive Officer from the Company's founding until 1990, as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1990 to 1994, and again from 1997 to 2000. At his death, Mr. Stern was also a director of AngioDynamics, Inc., which he cofounded in 1988 as a division of E-Z-EM. He served as the Chairman of the Board of AngioDynamics from that Company's founding until 2004, when it was spun off to E-ZEM shareholders. He was also instrumental in the founding and development of Surgical Dynamics, which was sold to U.S. Surgical in 1996. In 2001, in recognition of his life's work, he was honored with a special award by the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists (SGR) ""in appreciation for his generous support and dedication to the educational mission of the Society."" Mr. Stern was also active in many charitable causes, particularly at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he endowed a fellowship chair at the School of Chemical Engineering Practice, and supported the Center for Cancer Research. He also was the founding donor of the Center for Patient Partnerships at the University of WisconsinMadison, and also served on the board of trustees of the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation. In honor of his father, he established the Isadore N. Stern Scholarship of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) Education and Research Foundation. Mr. Stern received a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1953 and a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1954, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy from 1955-1958. He is survived by his wife Linda, his children Rachel and Seth, his son-inlaw Peter and his daughterin-law Trisha, and his grandchildren William, Madeleine, and Alexander. Mr. Stern will be long remembered as a true visionary and leader in the field of medical imaging. His desire to improve the methods for the screening and diagnosis of colon cancer was relentless, and his passion to encourage everyone to be screened was never ending. He was a guiding light for all who had the privilege to work with him at E-Z-EM. For over 40 years, this Company grew under his stewardship to become an industry leader and play an important role in advancing treatments for cancer and other diseases of the digestive tract. Mr. Stern's passing is a great personal loss to all of us at E-ZEM, who lost a colleague, a friend, and a mentor. We celebrate his life and are committed to continuing his legacy. He left the world a better place due to his numerous contributions. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Stern family.",2006-01-05T05:00:00+0000

To the very end, she lived her life to the fullest, with grace, with dignity, with courage, with beauty and, most of all, with love. Toby was born on May 6, 1939. She grew up in Keene, New Hampshire and graduated from Brandeis University in 1960. While in college, she met her future husband Bernie Nussbaum, who was then a law school student. They married in June 1963 and had three children, Emily, Peter and Frank. Peter married Alexis Tannenbaum and they have two children, Wylie and Levi. Emily married Clive Thompson, and a week before Toby died Emily gave birth to her first child, Gabriel Ezra. Toby was aware of Gabriel's birth and was able to meet him, to her great delight. Toby had two brothers, Jay and Bob Sheinfeld, with whom she was very close, as she was with their spouses, Peggy and Susan, and her nieces, Jennifer, Rebecca, Gwen and Daryl. Toby was also a beloved member of Bernie's extended family, including his mother Molly, his brothers, Albert and Martin, their spouses and children, and Bernie's numerous cousins. When Bernie served as Counsel to the President of the United States in 1993 and 1994, Toby was a tower of strength and, in her own right, a respected and popular figure in Washington. All of her adult life Toby was active in political, community and philanthropic affairs. She was a finance chairman for Congresswoman Nita Lowey in her first race for Congress in 1988. She was selected as an elector in 1992 and voted in the Electoral College for President Clinton. She was an officer of the Westchester County Democratic Party. Toby served on the Board of Trustees of Brandeis University and Westchester Community College. She was deeply involved with UJA-Federation of New York, the Metropolitan Council for Jewish Poverty, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. She served as an officer of her synagogue, Temple Israel Center of White Plains. For many years, she sang in Carnegie Hall as a member of the chorus of the New York Oratorio Society. At her homes in New York and Connecticut, she was a warm and engaging hostess. She was a wonderful and devoted friend to so many. Her husband, her children and her precious grandchildren were the joys of her life. And she was the joy of their lives. She will live forever in their memories and in the memories of so many others. Funeral services will be held on Thursday, January 5, 2006 at 12 noon at Temple Israel Center, 280 Old Mamaroneck Road, White Plains, NY (914 948 - 2800)(www.templeisrae lcenter.org). Contributions may be made in her memory to UJA-Federation of New York, 130 East 59th Street, New York 10022. Goodbye Toby. We will always love you.

Mr. Smith, whose title will be assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, is a former ABC News producer and has been an adviser in both Bush administrations.

us,Book Host. Light Fuse. Get Away.,"Word came yesterday from Steve Pond of the Los Angeles Timess TheEnvelope.com that the Academys diaspora in search of a host for its March festivities had finally ended at the steps of the The Daily Show. The Bagger could smile and wear beige, wanly admiring Mr. Ponds scoop, except he happened to be on the phone yesterday with Sid Ganis, president of the Academy board, and failed to elicit the fact that Jon Stewart was going to host the awards. Mr. Ganis, who seems like the kind of guy the Bagger would love to split a large tub of popcorn with at an afternoon matinee, sandbagged the Bagger. Hang in there, he said. Were getting there. No kidding. Perhaps the Baggers skills as a inquisitor were impaired by that days dental work, or maybe he should have brandished that pliers that Dr. Mengele used so effectively, but it would have been hard over the phone. The choice of Mr. Stewart, which the Bagger all but begged for on Tuesday  reporters always vote the story and Mr. Stewart is a great addition to the narrative  means that there will be suspense far beyond who is going to win Best Picture when March Madness roles around. Mr. Stewart is an enemy of convention, of industrial folkways, of the mannered back-slapping of the entertainment business. Joaquin Phoenix wont be the only one walking the line on Oscar night. It is instructive to recall that the Magazine Publishers of America paid Mr. Stewart large sums to host a Q & A and quickly found themselves on the wrong end of countless savage and wonderful jokes. Among other tidbits: The way news is driven today is not through print. I dont consider print media as relevant, he said as the editors and publishers in attendance shifted uncomfortably in their seats. David Zinczenko, the editor of Mens Health, was on the panel, and Stewart asked, Do the men on the cover always have to bewhats the wordglistening? He added, I enjoy Health, yet when I read it, I dont know whether to go to the doctor or rub my nipples. Depending on his mood, Mr. Stewart could make Chris Rocks rather tangy appearance last year seem positively well- mannered. ",2006-01-05T09:13:28+0000

He makes his most coherent, commercial effort in years, a movie that crackles with contemporary resonance, and the writers stiff him. Woody has been nominated 18 times by the Writers Guild, much of it for self-involved junk that the Bagger would not watch with your eyes. Someone, or a bunch of someones, did not like that movie much at all. Was it the ends cute finish? Who knows? And who knows how much it will matter? The Directors Guild nominations later today will be far more predictive if history is any indication. Teasing apart the rest, Brokeback remains a runaway horse, Kong and Munich continue to founder in those awful middle places, and Capote is for real. The directors nods later today could provide oxygen to Walk the Line and The Constant Gardener. Check back later for more juicy, likely pointless analysis.

The Cliff Notes version: Toothache in Washington, back to Manhattan for some quality time with dentist. Triage suggested a collapsed filling and nerve damage. The Bagger opted for a medieval solution as opposed to spending thousands. Dr. Mengele smiled when he reached that conclusion and got out something that looked an awful lot like a pliers. Much blood and mayhem ensued. The Baggers boss once compared aspects of his job to a kind of metaphorical dentistry. The Bagger feels his pain, but he feels his own more. At this rate, the Bagger will soon look like the denizens of certain rural hollows he visited as a young reporter  a smile that featured three teeth, all green and somewhat sideways.

us,The Listings | Jan. 6-Jan. 12; 'CHANGING HANDS: ART WITHOUT RESERVATION 2',"Art made by American Indians today has come a sophisticated distance in materials, approach and market awareness from the ethnic and crafts-oriented work of their forebears. And yet by choice, much of it incorporates the past, both to affirm and challenge it. A Plains war shield wrought of hubcaps and tractor springs, by Juanita Pahdopony; Lisa Telford's pert bustier woven of bark traditionally used for baskets; and Preston Singletary's blown-glass chest incorporating Northwest Coast motifs are just a few of the evidentiary objects in ""Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation 2,"" a whopping show of more than 300 works by 190 contemporary American Indian artists at the Museum of Arts and Design. The show is the second in a three-part series the museum is staging of contemporary American Indian work, in this case by artists of the Plains, Prairie, Plateau and Pacific cultures in the United States and Canada, along with those of Alaska and Hawaii. The artists' concerns range from cultural and political issues, as in the power-and-real-estate game of Monopoly translated by Gerald Clarke into a race relations engagement called ""Ethnopoly""; to the taking of traditional form beyond function, as in the Alaskan-born Jerry Jacob Laktonen's ""Dream Paddles,"" which reincarnates as objects of sculptural beauty the oars used by generations of American Indians. Ancient techniques like weaving, woodcarving, beading (""Postcard"" above), stitchery and quill and feather work take on new dimensions here, while inventive use is made of newer forms like video, photography, installation art, tattooing, even carving in chocolate. A prime aim of the show is to demonstrate that the American Indian art of today has a distinctive place in the larger art world, a point that it more than makes.

Now, to break in the new year, this award-winning director-choreographer and his Pick Up Performance Company have gone much farther back in time with ""Aristophanes in Birdonia,"" a theater-dance adaptation of the ancient Greek play ""The Birds."" While Mr. Gordon loves his historical sources (his last work at Danspace Project was ""Dancing Henry V""), he also loves splicing them with contemporary events and tendencies, as well as with pointed political commentary. To wit, the new work opens with an audio prologue, a mix of birdcalls and clips from the speeches of current administration members, including President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Athens has been renamed Hysterica (read: America), a celebrity-obsessed land of pre-emptive strikes and faith-based initiatives. Many well-meaning artists are done in by their political inclinations, but Mr. Gordon is too clever a director to go for polemics. Using inventive, movable sets and performers who are comfortable moving and acting (they're rarer than you think), his works slide nimbly between dance and theater, spinning seemingly playful moments into scathing social critiques. Having the wonderful Valda Setterfield (above with members of the troupe in ""Birdonia"") as your guide doesn't hurt, either: Ms. Setterfield, Mr. Gordon's longtime creative partner and wife, will play the Greek playwright Aristophanes.

That was the world in which the nonprofit organization now called the International Association for Jazz Education and universally known as the I.A.J.E., introduced its annual conference. Now in its 33rd year, the I.A.J.E. Conference offers ample proof of the evolution of jazz education into a full-fledged industry. The event will occupy two adjacent Midtown hotels, drawing thousands of attendees (roughly 8,000 in recent years) for a profusion of clinics, showcases and panels; topics range from the pragmatic (""How to Successfully Market and Distribute Your Music Online"") to the pedagogical (""Connecting With Kids in the Classroom"") to the conceptual (""Hip-Hop and Jazz -- an Organic Blend""). In addition to students and teachers, the conference attracts members of the jazz profession at large -- musicians, producers, publicists and journalists -- so that the end results are as much an industry summit as an educational caucus. This year's conference highlights include an opening concert featuring the Ravi Coltrane Quartet and the Maria Schneider Orchestra; experimental composition workshops with the pianist Vijay Iyer and the bassist Drew Gress; and a closing-night concert with the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra from Norway and the pianist Chick Corea (above). A registration fee provides access to all the hoopla, including a 75,000-square-foot product exhibition hall. New York natives seeking a better deal can partake of the overflow at the city's jazz clubs, which are poised to enjoy one of the biggest weeks of the year. (The conference runs Wednesday through Jan. 14 at the New York Hilton and the New York Sheraton; information at (785) 776-8744 or www.iaje.org; registration is $363, including a $68 one-year membership fee, for adults, or $165 for students with an ID.)

The later, a bracing version of ""The Revenger's Tragedy,"" originally booked for three weeks, begins an extended run tonight after being on hiatus for the holidays. Jesse Berger, the group's artistic director, conceded that it might be time to consider longer initial runs, ""now that we've proved to ourselves that we're not a flash in the pan."" There is plenty of flash, though, in Mr. Berger's adaptation of ""The Revenger's Tragedy,"" a play of uncertain authorship from the early 17th century. There is also plenty of blood, and an electric performance by Matthew Rauch as a man bent on avenging the death of his love. Mr. Berger (above), 35, who is also directing the play, said he first became interested in staging it when he was working with the Washington Shakespeare Company, which mounted its own production in its 1999-2000 season. ""I didn't have enough capital or chutzpah to do it as my first project for Red Bull,"" he said -- that was ""Pericles,"" staged in 2003 -- but he knew he would someday. ""The more I worked on it, the more I realized it was sort of a diamond in the rough,"" he said. His adaptation cuts about 20 percent of the original, expands some characters and sets the tale at a fearlessly fast clip. One of Red Bull's missions, Mr. Berger said, is to explore the works of Shakespeare's contemporaries, which are sometimes overlooked, and the response so far gives him hope. ""It's been really wonderful to discover that there is an audience out there for these plays,"" he said.

Born Britt-Marie Lagerljung to Eddy Ljungren and Erik Adam Larsson in Stockhom in 1929, Mrs. Gilder earned prizes in English and German at her Swedish Gymnasium. She emigrated to the United States in 1951, becoming an American citizen in 1955. That year, she married Richard Gilder, raising four children with him. They were divorced in 1970. A woman of unbendable loyalties, Mrs. Gilder adored her adopted country, and showed the same unabating gusto for her family and close friends. After her marriage ended, she returned to education, winning a BA degree in Politcal Science (Cum Laude) from Fordham University in 1988. She advocated feminist causes, traveled the world (often with a grandchild in tow), sewed, quilted and was a seamstress extraordinaire. Possessing a keen eye for true artistic genius, she had a special appreciation of the work of Scandinavian painters, particularly that of the Swedish members of the Matisse school, Isaac Grunewald and Sigrid Hjerten, and of the Norwegian, Christian Krohg. She used her intellect, wiles and wits with us all, wielding them to particularly satisfying effect in her dealings with bureaucracy. Courageous, defiant, outspoken, original, and unendingly generous to those she loved, she left her mark of elan wherever she went. She is survived by her four children, former husband, sister, brother, seven grandchildren, niece and seven nephews.

ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" returned this week and drew 17.33 million viewers to its two-hour premiere, according to Nielsen estimates. (Below, Giselle Fernandez, a journalist, and the dancer Jonathan Roberts.) ABC's Thursdays have had poor ratings this season, so ""Dancing"" was a big improvement over the sinking ""Alias"" and the canceled ""Night Stalker."" The network finished in second place in total viewers. NBC also made a mark with its lineup changes. ""Will & Grace"" (7.98 million) moved to 8 p.m., in place of ""Joey,"" now on hiatus, and performed better than the woeful ""Friends"" spinoff did among 18-to-49-year-olds. ""Four Kings,"" from the creators of ""Will & Grace,"" made its debut at 8:30, and improved on its predecessor's demographic ratings, as well as its total audience (8.84 million). ""My Name Is Earl"" (11.2 million) and ""The Office"" (8.83 million), in their Thursday debuts this season, also did well among adults 18 to 49, with ""Earl"" getting the best ratings in that age group at 9 p.m. since the ""Apprentice"" finale in May. NBC placed second for the night in the same group. But with all these changes, one thing remained the same: ""CSI"" was on CBS's schedule. Twice, in fact, as the network broadcast a repeat (15.1 million) at 8 p.m., followed by a new episode (27.36 million) at 9 p.m. And that meant that CBS won the night in total viewers and adults 18 to 49.

Born Britt-Marie Lagerljung to Eddy Ljungren and Erik Adam Larsson in Stockhom in 1929, Mrs. Gilder earned prizes in English and German at her Swedish Gymnasium. She emigrated to the United States in 1951, becoming an American citizen in 1955. That year, she married Richard Gilder, raising four children with him. They were divorced in 1970. A woman of unbendable loyalties, Mrs. Gilder adored her adopted country, and showed the same unabating gusto for her family and close friends. After her marriage ended, she returned to education, winning a BA degree in Politcal Science (Cum Laude) from Fordham University in 1988. She advocated feminist causes, traveled the world (often with a grandchild in tow), sewed, quilted and was a seamstress extraordinaire. Possessing a keen eye for true artistic genius, she had a special appreciation of the work of Scandinavian painters, particularly that of the Swedish members of the Matisse school, Isaac Grunewald and Sigrid Hjerten, and of the Norwegian, Christian Krohg. She used her intellect, wiles and wits with us all, wielding them to particularly satisfying effect in her dealings with bureaucracy. Courageous, defiant, outspoken, original, and unendingly generous to those she loved, she left her mark of elan wherever she went. She is survived by her four children, former husband, sister, brother, seven grandchildren, niece and seven nephews.

Now ""Brokeback Mountain"" is available in no fewer than three movie tie-in versions. There are slim 55-page editions of the story itself, in both paperback and hardcover; there is also a book called ""Brokeback Mountain: Story to Screenplay,"" which includes not only the original story and the screenplay but also essays from Proulx and the screenwriters, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana. (The paperback edition of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is No. 27 on the extended softcover fiction list.) Proulx, who is 70, writes in ""Story to Screenplay"" that ""Brokeback Mountain"" began to take shape early in 1997, in a Wyoming bar. She noticed, she writes, ""an older ranch hand, maybe in his late 60's, obviously short on the world's luxury goods."" This man wasn't paying attention to the women in the room, but rather to the young cowboys shooting pool. ""Maybe he was following the game,"" Proulx writes, ""maybe he knew the players, maybe one was his son or nephew, but there was something in his expression, a kind of bitter longing, that made me wonder if he was country gay. Then I began to consider what it might have been like for him."" Proulx is a fan of Ang Lee's movie. When she saw it, she continues in her essay, she had to confront ""the point that writers do not like to admit; in our time film can be more powerful than the written word."" When an Associated Press reporter asked her if she'd ever be tempted to bring her two characters, Jack and Ennis, back in another story, she replied: ""They're not coming back. There's no way. They're going to stay where they are. I've got other things to write.""",2006-01-08T05:00:00+0000

The ascendance of abstract painting in the years after World War II had eroded that tradition in the West, elevating originality and authentic feeling over technique and lifelike depictions, and reducing the word ""academic"" to a slur. But the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall were effective windscreens, blocking artistic change from ruffling the German Democratic Republic. Figurative art that was deprecated as hopelessly pass in Paris and Dsseldorf never lost its grip in Leipzig. The city prided itself on being the birthplace of Max Beckmann and (if you looked back a few centuries and across Saxony to Wittenberg) on a painterly lineage begat by Lucas Cranach. ""The disadvantages of the wall are well known,"" says Arno Rink, a 65-year-old recently retired professor of painting who served as director of the academy in Leipzig both before and after the wall came down. ""If you want to talk of an advantage, you can say it allowed us to continue in the tradition of Cranach and Beckmann.

Her unmasking ended the mini-series on a suspenseful cliffhanger, and 13 months later, ""Battlestar"" returned as a weekly series. The second half of its second season began on Friday.Grace Park, who plays Sharon, didn't notice the miniseries' gasp-inducing twist when she first auditioned for the flashier part of Starbuck. Sharon, she said, seemed like ""the best friend you don't put too much weight on, a good person, kind of sad."" After being offered that role, however, and rereading the teleplay, it hit her. Talking to Ronald D. Moore, who developed the remake of the 1970's show, ""I said, 'You changed her to a Cylon!' "" Ms. Park said, recalling her excitement. ""He was like, 'It was always like that.' I totally didn't read it.""",2006-01-08T05:00:00+0000

A graduate of Berkeley Institute in Brooklyn, she earned a B.A. from Vassar College in 1932, as well as an M.A. in sociology in 1944. She worked in Poughkeepsie, Philadelphia and New York in agencies concerned with the welfare of children. For the last 40 years she lived in New Canaan. She was an exceptionally committed volunteer leader there, as well as for Vassar College, working tirelessly for the college itself, the alumnae and alumni association and her class, for which she held almost every office, sometimes more than once. In gratitude for all her efforts for Vassar, including years of service on the Alumnae House committee, Jean's classmates dedicated a special room there to her. However, she turned down other proffered honors and insisted that her many financial gifts to the College be anonymous. Usually quiet and unassuming, she became a warrior when faced with the misuse of the English language. At Jean's request, there will be no memorial service.

Stern, co-founder, director and Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern passed away on December 28, 2005 after losing a brave battle with brain cancer. He was 74. Mr. Stern was a pioneer in the field of gastrointestinal imaging. Mr. Stern co-founded EZ-EM in 1962 to develop and market the first unit-dose product to virtually eliminate cross-contamination during the administration of barium sulfate contrast media. Mr. Stern was the holder of several patents. Mr. Stern would dedicate his life to the development of products that improved the diagnosis and treatment of GI disease. During his more than 40 years of leadership with E-Z-EM, he helped introduce a series of important innovations to the field, and in the process established the Company as a recognized name among radiologists around the world. Mr. Stern served as a director of E-Z-EM from the Company's founding until his passing, and also served as the Company's Chairman of the Board from its founding until December 2004, when he was named Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Stern also served as Chief Executive Officer from the Company's founding until 1990, as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1990 to 1994, and again from 1997 to 2000. At his death, Mr. Stern was also a director of AngioDynamics, Inc., which he cofounded in 1988 as a division of E-Z-EM. He served as the Chairman of the Board of AngioDynamics from that Company's founding until 2004, when it was spun off to E-ZEM shareholders. He was also instrumental in the founding and development of Surgical Dynamics, which was sold to U.S. Surgical in 1996. In 2001, in recognition of his life's work, he was honored with a special award by the Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists (SGR) ""in appreciation for his generous support and dedication to the educational mission of the Society."" Mr. Stern was also active in many charitable causes, particularly at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he endowed a fellowship chair at the School of Chemical Engineering Practice, and supported the Center for Cancer Research. He also was the founding donor of the Center for Patient Partnerships at the University of WisconsinMadison, and also served on the board of trustees of the Parker Jewish Institute for Health Care & Rehabilitation. In honor of his father, he established the Isadore N. Stern Scholarship of the American Society of Radiologic Technologists (ASRT) Education and Research Foundation. Mr. Stern received a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1953 and a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1954, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He also served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy from 1955-1958. He is survived by his wife Linda, his children Rachel and Seth, his son-inlaw Peter and his daughterin-law Trisha, and his grandchildren William, Madeleine, and Alexander. Mr. Stern will be long remembered as a true visionary and leader in the field of medical imaging. His desire to improve the methods for the screening and diagnosis of colon cancer was relentless, and his passion to encourage everyone to be screened was never ending. He was a guiding light for all who had the privilege to work with him at E-Z-EM. For over 40 years, this Company grew under his stewardship to become an industry leader and play an important role in advancing treatments for cancer and other diseases of the digestive tract.

Born Britt-Marie Lagerljung to Eddy Ljungren and Erik Adam Larsson in Stockhom in 1929, Mrs. Gilder earned prizes in English and German at her Swedish Gymnasium. She emigrated to the United States in 1951, becoming an American citizen in 1955. That year, she married Richard Gilder, raising four children with him. They were divorced in 1970. A woman of unbendable loyalties, Mrs. Gilder adored her adopted country, and showed the same unabating gusto for her family and close friends. After her marriage ended, she returned to education, winning a BA degree in Politcal Science (Cum Laude) from Fordham University in 1988. She advocated feminist causes, traveled the world (often with a grandchild in tow), sewed, quilted and was a seamstress extraordinaire. Possessing a keen eye for true artistic genius, she had a special appreciation of the work of Scandinavian painters, particularly that of the Swedish members of the Matisse school, Isaac Grunewald and Sigrid Hjerten, and of the Norwegian, Christian Krohg. She used her intellect, wiles and wits with us all, wielding them to particularly satisfying effect in her dealings with bureaucracy. Courageous, defiant, outspoken, original, and unendingly generous to those she loved, she left her mark of elan wherever she went. She is survived by her four children, former husband, sister, brother, seven grandchildren, niece and seven nephews.

""We couldn't be happier with this hostile takeover of the box office,"" said Steve Rothenberg, president of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, who added that the film had already grossed more than four times its production budget. (It was made for less than $5 million.) ""Hostel"" (starring Jay Fernandez, right) displaced two blockbusters that had been competing at the top of the chart for a month. ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" (Buena Vista) dropped to No. 2 with $15.4 million, bringing its total sales to $247.5 million, and ""King Kong"" (Universal) fell to No. 3 with $12.5 million, for a total of $192.5 million. Two hit comedies also dropped a notch. ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" (Sony), at No. 4, took in $12.2 million, and ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" (Fox), at No. 5, grossed $8.3 million. Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"" (Universal), about the aftermath of the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, expanded to 1,485 theaters this weekend and reached No. 6 with $7.5 million.

The other half of customer bills, the delivery charge, has not changed, said a Con Ed spokesman. The rise is part of a yearlong increase in power prices. For example, the total monthly bill for a typical Con Ed customer using about 300 kilowatt hours, enough for a two-bedroom apartment, rose to about $74 this past December, from $61 in December 2004, a 21 percent increase, a Con Ed spokesman said.",2006-01-09T05:00:00+0000

But CBS benefited from a spillover of the football playoffs into prime time, which lifted the network's household ratings to the top spot for the night. Its ""60 Minutes,"" which featured a segment about the Olympian Bode Miller and the problems of drunken skiing, drew high ratings, as did a ""Cold Case"" episode that used the music of Bruce Springsteen, but the final numbers for both shows were delayed because of the football game's overrun. ABC's ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" (10.27 million), ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" (17.45 million), ""Desperate Housewives"" (23.67 million) and a ""Grey's Anatomy"" clip show (16.41 million) averaged out to squeak by CBS in total viewers, and win more convincingly in the 18-to-49 demographic. The first new ""Housewives"" in more than a month -- in which Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) kissed the husband (Doug Savant) of Lynette (Felicity Huffman), inspiring a jealousy plot -- delivered its lowest ratings for an original episode of the season, despite dominating the 9 p.m. hour.

The approval was the final legislative step needed, and construction could start as early as the spring, although some residents have vowed to sue. The plan includes shifting the fountain 22 feet to the east to place it in line with the Washington Arch and Fifth Avenue, and erecting a fence around the park about four feet high. The fence is intended to limit access by dogs and help maintain the park's midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS (NYT)",2006-01-10T05:00:00+0000

Mineta San Jos International, has reached an agreement with Clear to start the program this spring. By then, competitors to Verified Identity Pass are expected to be in business. Under the Registered Traveler Program, fliers submit basic information that enables them to be cleared for expedited screening by the Transportation Security Administration. Once they pass that test, they must pay an annual fee (currently $79.95 at Orlando) and use an identity card encoded with their fingerprints and iris scans to gain access to designated checkpoints. The security administration is expected to announce details on procedures for expediting the passage of registered travelers within two weeks.

When no one was prosecuted, Ukrainians took to the streets of Kiev in protest. That demonstration was a foreshadowing of the Orange Revolution last year that brought the opposition leader, Viktor A. Yushchenko -- who had vowed to revive the investigation into Mr. Gongadze's death -- to the presidency.

""Wife Swap,"" which led the night, was not the problem, as it drew an audience of 11.05 million and won the hour among 18-to-49-year-olds. Following that, the debut of Ms. Graham's ""Emily's Reasons Why Not"" (6.23 million) did poorly, and the return of Mr. Stamos's ""Jake in Progress"" fared even worse, with 5.58 million viewers. At 10 p.m., ""The Bachelor"" (6.2 million) didn't stand a chance against CBS's ""CSI: Miami"" (19.6 million) and NBC's ""Medium"" (11.31 million).

Because the winners were already determined, it was like a modern day kindergarten, where everyone was a winner and the mean kids were forced to imitate human beings or go to a corner. No frozen smiles from the losers, just crowned victors clutching Lucite plaques. A few awards standards were in high effect: The host, Paul Reiser, began apologizing for the length of the evening five minutes into the program, the talent in the seats secretly thought that everyone went on too long until their turn came, and there was much talk about courage for an activity that generally involves sitting in a trailer until your take comes while dining on catered food (although Felicity Huffman said that on the set of Transamerica they drew lots, after craft services quit, to see who would go to the nearest restaurant to bring back Styrofoam containers of cold scrambled eggs. Now thats Dan Rathers version of courage.) NBR split things every which way: Good Night, and Good Luck for best pic, Brokebacks Ang Lee for director, Syriana for adapted screenplay, Capote for best actor (History of Violence director David Cronenberg was cited for career achievement) and Transamerica for best actress.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   NILSSON, BIRGIT","NILSSON--Birgit. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of Birgit Nilsson, one of the greatest sopranos ever to sing on our stage. As Brnnhilde in Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle, she reigned supreme for many years, and the power and beauty of her voice also made her ideal for many of the leading roles of Wagner, Richard Strauss, Verdi, and Puccini. No one who heard her as Elektra, Turandot, or Isolde is likely to forget the apparent ease with which she surmounted the notorious difficulties of these parts. In the 22 years she sang complete operas at the Met, Nilsson appeared in 16 roles and, in her entire Met career, 223 performances. From her sensational Met debut as Isolde on December 18, 1959 to the last Valkyrie cry that she tossed off as part of a tribute to James Levine at his 25th Anniversary gala in 1996, the public reaction to her phenomenal gifts was tumultuous acclaim. Both in front of the curtain and behind it, she was beloved as much for her sparkling personality and dry sense of humor as for her artistry. Thank you, dear Birgit, for the years of extraordinary performances and joy you brought to so many. We send our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Bertil, and all her family and friends.

us,The Listings: Jan. 13 - Jan. 19; DAVE HOLLAND FESTIVAL,"The sinewy athleticism and deep sonority of Dave Holland's bass playing have figured prominently in jazz since the late 1960's, when Mr. Holland, above, was recruited by a restless Miles Davis. Mr. Holland spent the next several years involved in both the first stirrings of fusion, via Davis, and the burgeoning avant-garde movement later known as the loft scene, with rigorous peers like the saxophonist-composer Anthony Braxton. Mr. Holland's career as a bandleader, which began on record in 1972 with the fine album ""Conference of the Birds"" (ECM), can be seen as a harmonization of those early affiliations: thoughtful experimentalism with a forward thrust. For much of the last decade, the best example of this concept in action has been the Dave Holland Quintet, which currently includes Chris Potter on saxophones, Robin Eubanks on trombone, Steve Nelson on vibraphone and Nate Smith on drums. Characterized by rhythmic assertiveness, terse counterpoint and an unconventional blend of timbres, the ensemble has issued three studio albums and one potent live recording, ""Extended Play: Live at Birdland"" (ECM). It has also served as the nucleus for an estimable big band, which released its second album, ""Overtime,"" on Mr. Holland's new Dare2 Records last year. It makes sense that Mr. Holland begins a weeklong Birdland run with these two signature ensembles. (The big band plays on Wednesday, the quintet on Thursday.) But it's also fitting that he introduces two new projects: a sextet featuring the saxophonist Antonio Hart and the pianist Mulgrew Miller (Jan. 20 to 21) and a duo with Mr. Nelson (Jan. 22). (Wednesday through Jan. 22 at 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum.)",2006-01-13T05:00:00+0000

Perched on the edge of the Gila National Forest in a high-desert wonderland of ponderosas, deep gorges and red-rock mesas, Silver City is a bit rough around the edges, especially compared with places like Santa Fe and Taos -- but that's the way the locals like it. The town was founded after silver ore was discovered in 1870, and soon transplanted Yankees built the large Victorian houses that still loom over newer structures in the historic downtown. The silver industry crashed in 1893, but the town was becoming a haven for tuberculosis patients -- including Billy the Kid's mother -- because of the desert air and healing hot springs. (Billy himself passed some of his youth in Silver City.) By the 1900's, TB patients started going there en masse. After 1910, large-scale copper mining began, and that continues to be the basis of the economy, making Silver City a place where miners, artists, ranchers and extreme sports types mix easily.

us,The Listings: Jan. 13 - Jan. 19; MATISYAHU,"If Matisyahu's Hasidic dancehall act at first seemed like an ill-conceived ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, his love of reggae and his toasting skills have made it something else entirely. Blending the rabbinical and the Rastafarian in ways that illuminate similarities in both traditions, the bearded 27-year-old Matisyahu (born Matthew Miller), above, has gained a following that includes religious Jews and dancehall devotees alike. His 2004 debut album, ""Shake Off the Dust Arise"" (JDub), and last year's ""Live at Stubb's"" (Or) garnered him comparisons to dancehall stars like Elephant Man and Beenie Man, and headlining slots at events like Reggae Carifest. He has just completed an album with the well-known producer Bill Laswell. It's his showmanship and improvisational bent, though, that have gained Matisyahu a following among the jam-band crowd. His onstage energy contrasts with the somberness of his ever-present black suit, brimmed hat, white shirt and prayer shawl. Incorporating beat-boxing and stage-diving into his act, he melds a kind of Deadhead playfulness with the resolute moralism of his devotional lyrics, as he chants -- sometimes in English, sometimes in Yiddish, sometimes in Caribbean patois. At tomorrow night's show, he opens for the college party band O.A.R. But his themes are not those of his showmates, preoccupied as they are with drinking and poker. At heart, he's more spiritually minded than political, but in songs like ""Refuge,"" Matisyahu leaves room for metaphorical interpretation without shying from thornier implications: ""Enemy lines, I find I let myself get tied up too many times/ You can't have my heart, I'm taking back what's mine.""

us,'Marjoe',"For many complicated reasons, fundamentalist Christianity in America doesn't look the same today as it did in 1972, when ""Marjoe,"" a portrait of Marjoe Gortner, a cynical, curly-headed Pentecostal preacher with rock-star ambitions, won the Academy Award for best documentary. The film, which opens today at the IFC Center, is only tangentially concerned with the whys and wherefores of Bible Belt Pentecostalism. Directed by Howard Smith and Sarah Kernochan, it assumes that the kind of charismatic faith healing at which Mr. Gortner excelled as a child prodigy is a moneymaking racket. What makes the movie more than a glib expos of what Mr. Gortner calls ""the Jesus business"" is Mr. Gortner himself (the name Marjoe is a hybrid of Mary and Joseph), a parentally exploited, ruthlessly disciplined child, who, at the age of 4, was billed as ""the world's youngest ordained minister."" The movie's vintage film clips of this wind-up baby preacher (above) in full flail are creepy but oddly compelling; imagine Shirley Temple as an adorable, hot-wired faith healer spouting scripture with flamboyantly choreographed body language: the little kid is irresistible. After renouncing his profession at 14 and taking a seven-year break, Mr. Gortner returned to the pulpit as a nonbeliever who was strictly in it for the money. Or so he says, as he gleefully exposes the tricks of his trade and demonstrates how his grown-up style incorporates moves garnered from rock stars like Mick Jagger. Mr. Gortner, who went on to have a minor career as an actor in mostly B- and C- movies, comes across as an overgrown teenager, at once preening and vulnerable, calculating and silly, pathetically eager to impress the sophisticated East Coast filmmakers with his cool and charisma. More than 30 years later, he looms as an unsavory, if fascinating, cultural product of the Jesus-hippie connection that flourished in the early 1970's. On Jan. 31, the movie is also being released on a DVD that includes Ms. Kernochan's 2002 film, ""Thoth,"" which won an Academy Award for best documentary short subject.

The silver industry crashed in 1893, but the town was becoming a haven for tuberculosis patients - including Billy the Kid's mother - because of the desert air and healing hot springs. (Billy himself passed some of his youth in Silver City.) By the 1900's, TB patients started going there en masse.

The planned addition, designed by Renzo Piano, has aroused considerable opposition among neighborhood residents. Some object to the 178-foot-tall building that would rise behind a row of historic brownstones on Madison Avenue and connect to the museum's original 1966 Marcel Breuer structure with a series of glass buildings. ""I'm disappointed,"" Edward Klimmerman of the Coalition of Concerned Whitney Neighbors said of the approval, which came Wednesday night. ""I see institutions -- be it museums, schools, synagogues, churches, hospitals -- becoming bigger and bigger, and there's going to be very little left for the residents."" The museum has been trying to expand since the 1980's. Two previous architectural plans -- one by Michael Graves and another by Rem Koolhaas -- were abandoned. ""It's been a long road,"" said Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director. ""Four generations of directors and trustees have hoped and dreamed of being able to broaden the building."" Next in the approval process, the Whitney goes before the Board of Standards and Appeals, where the public will have the chance to voice opposition again. ""We're going to try very hard to defeat this,"" Mr. Klimmerman said. ""We're not going to give up.""",2006-01-13T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Jan. 13 - Jan. 19; '5 STREAMS',"At first, ""5 Streams"" seems a bizarre mix of ingredients, incorporating Kathak dance by Parul Shah, performing by the modern dancer Arthur Aviles, an interactive sonic arboretum created by Norscq and DJ Spooky (Paul Miller), and video by Marc Perroud, with space and costumes designed by Xavier Hool. But the theme of the piece, which will be performed on Wednesday, Thursday, and next Friday through Sunday at Asia Society, is both simpler and more complex. In ""5 Streams,"" the Pakistani writer and director Ibrahim Quraishi ruminates on the cultural forces that tear apart and unite the world. Mr. Quraishi's inspiration lies in the physical and cultural geography of South Asia, with its five tributaries of the Indus River, five core nations and the spiritual influence of the five pillars of Islam and five principles of Hinduism. He is probably best known in New York City for his participation in DJ Spooky's ""Transmetropolitan,"" part of the Lincoln Center Festival in 2004. Mr. Quraishi's contribution was a meditation partly on the assassination of the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and the fate of the Middle East, subjects typical of the quietly provocative thoughts he has expressed in everything from letters to the editor to work he has done with the poignantly named Compagnie Faim de Secle, a 10-year-old multinational collective that he helped to found and directs, in New York and Paris. The three sections of the new piece address oppression against women, individual duty in a time of war and the relationship of humans and the sacred, incorporating texts that include ""Anarkali,"" a tragic court romance of Mughal India, and ""Who Knoweth Himself,"" a mystical treatise by the 12th-century Sufi philosopher Ibn al-Arabi. In all, ""5 Streams"" sounds like theater for our troubled times. (Performances are Wednesday and Thursday at 7 p.m., next Friday at 8 p.m., Jan. 21 at 3 and 7 p.m. and Jan. 22 at 3 p.m. at Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742 or www.AsiaSociety.org; $25; $20 for students and 65+.)",2006-01-13T05:00:00+0000

The suit, brought by Consolidated Edison and its insurance companies, claimed that the city had been negligent in installing two diesel tanks in the building to fuel the electrical system of a command center for emergencies on the 23rd floor. The fuel contributed to the fire and eventual collapse, which heavily damaged a Consolidated Edison substation. Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the city had made ""a good faith effort"" in setting up the command center, which complied with statutes governing emergency planning.

The peaks are four 12,000-foot-plus mountains in the high desert near the Grand Canyon. The judge, Paul G.

The order, the latest in a series of extensions in a program that FEMA had originally said would end Dec. 1, comes as some New Orleans hotels have told evacuees that they will have to check out to make way for tourists who long ago booked rooms for the annual Mardi Gras celebration.

In the US, that would mean that there would be one male and one female Senator from each state, and the house districts would be doubled in size and halved in number with a male and a female representative from each congressional district. Many people have dismissed this idea out of hand, but stop to consider the advantages: There are about equal numbers of men and women, yet fewer than one-sixth of elected representatives are women, even fewer in the executive offices. Their underrepresentation is all the more striking when one considers that in the sixty and above group women clearly outnumber men. At the family level, women are avtively, often violently prevented from defending and expressing their interests and civil rights. The equal gender system would be a national statement that their interests and rights are equivalent to those of men, and would guarantee that issues such as so-called honor killings, doweries, child brides, etc were acted upon. That in turn would gradually overcome cultural biases and traditions that preserve such practices.",2006-01-13T11:47:35+0000

One question that the Bagger will pack with him: If this years Oscars are so wide open, why do four of the Best Picture nominations seem like a lock? Keeping in mind that the Bagger is a professional Oscar rookie  all caveats apply  take a walk with him. Brokeback Mountain? Done. Good Night, and Good Luck? Is George Clooney handsome? Crash. L.A.s favorite son. Capote. Cant be killed. The Screen Actors Guild, Directors Guild and Producers Guild all agreed that those four movies are in the running for best. So you have a huge scrum of movies jumping up and down, yelling Pick me! for slot No. 5. A History of Violence has its share of supporters, Walk the Line has faded from memory, perhaps because it was not that memorable of a film, while The Constant Gardener refuses to fade. Munich never overcame a stumble out of the gate and Kong got gonged early, but MatchPoint, in spite of the stiffing it got from the Directors Guild, should not be counted out. Director Woody Allen has a conflicted image, but a reservoir of good will with the Academy. Lets not forget that Bullets Over Broadway, a fairly insignificant relic of his oeuvre, received seven nominations.

Dr. Langerman received numerous professional awards and honors for his research and published many articles on advanced techniques for cataract and refractive surgery. His academic publications and films received first place awards at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.

Yes, CBS was still the top-ranked network in total viewers, even though its shows were in repeats. But NBC ascended to a dominant No. 1 among adults 18 to 49 in Nielsen estimates, and ABC was a hair's breadth out of first place in households. During NBC's 9 p.m. slot, the time period success of the newly relocated ""My Name Is Earl"" (12.52 million) and ""The Office"" (10.29 million), in which Michael (Steve Carell, right) burned his foot on a George Foreman grill, might mean a change for ""The Apprentice"" when it returns. On ABC, a 90-minute ""Dancing With the Stars"" (17.22 million) helped the premiere of ""Crumbs"" (12.04 million), the new Fred Savage sitcom. And WB had something to be happy about, too. Leading out of ""Smallville"" (5.22 million), the season premiere of ""Beauty and the Geek"" (4.85 million) drew the network's best 18-to-34 ratings in its time period in three years. With that addition, WB is sneaking up on Fox for the night in viewers, adults 18 to 34 and 18 to 49. The aging ""O.C."" (5.15 million), now at 9 p.m., barely beat ""Geek.""

His academic publications and films received first place awards at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.

Or how about Garrison Keillor, editor of ""Good Poems"" and ""Good Poems for Hard Times""? More likely, it's Caroline Kennedy. Her book ""The Best-Loved Poems of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis"" was a hardcover best seller for 15 weeks in 2001 and 2002. Now she's back with ""A Family of Poems: My Favorite Poetry for Children,"" and it's No. 2 on this week's children's picture book list. Kennedy's selections, from the Bible to Wordsworth to Seamus Heaney, are terrific, as are the watercolor illustrations by Jon J. Muth. As it happens, Kennedy's book isn't the only children's poetry anthology selling well -- there's also ""Poetry Speaks to Children,"" edited by Elise Paschen, co-founder of Poetry in Motion, the program that puts poetry in subways and buses. ""Poetry Speaks to Children"" comes with a cool bonus: a CD of many of its poems read by their original authors -- including Robert Frost intoning ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" and Carl Sandburg reading ""On a Flimmering Floom You Shall Ride."" There's not a lot of overlap between Kennedy's book and Paschen's, but they do share eight poems, which together make up a kind of meta-anthology. Those poems are: ""Hurt No Living Thing,"" by Christina Rossetti, ""To P.J."" by Sonia Sanchez, ""Epigram Engraved on the Collar of a Dog,"" by Alexander Pope, ""The Reason I Like Chocolate,"" by Nikki Giovanni, ""Daddy Fell Into the Pond,"" by Alfred Noyes, ""The Tyger,"" by William Blake, ""Good Hot Dogs,"" by Sandra Cisneros, and Frost's ""Stopping by Woods.""

An eruv is a boundary within which Orthodox Jews on the Sabbath can push baby strollers and wheelchairs and carry items. In many towns like Tenafly, the boundary is created by placing plastic strips, or lechis, on telephone poles.

us,The Case For Contamination,"Africa's first post-independence leaders might have been oriented toward cosmopolitanism, not tradition, but this may actually have been a disadvantage when it came to development. One reason so many African countries are so poor today is that their early leaders tried to remake Africa in the image of the industrialized world. The failed infrastructure mega-projects of the 1960's and 70's testify to the magnitude of this mistake. Many experts now recognize that these leaders might have done better to steer development along more traditional African lines by, for example, supporting peasant farmers.",2006-01-15T05:00:00+0000
us,Trial and Error,"Many of us consider science the most reliable, accountable way of explaining how the world works. We trust it. Should we? John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist, recently concluded that most articles published by biomedical journals are flat-out wrong. The sources of error, he found, are numerous: the small size of many studies, for instance, often leads to mistakes, as does the fact that emerging disciplines, which lately abound, may employ standards and methods that are still evolving. Finally, there is bias, which Ioannidis says he believes to be ubiquitous. Bias can take the form of a broadly held but dubious assumption, a partisan position in a longstanding debate (e.g., whether depression is mostly biological or environmental) or (especially slippery) a belief in a hypothesis that can blind a scientist to evidence contradicting it. These factors, Ioannidis argues, weigh especially heavily these days and together make it less than likely that any given published finding is true.",2006-01-15T05:00:00+0000

He also asked for five years' worth of records involving any allegations of unlawful conduct by the university or its employees, all no-bid contracts, and contracts with all employees earning more than $100,000, including their salaries, bonuses and expense reimbursements. Late last month, the university trustees agreed to a federal monitor as a way to avoid prosecution on criminal fraud charges. The United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, was prepared to pursue those charges in federal court, involving at least $4.9 million that Mr. Christie said the university overcharged Medicaid.

Mr. Irving made the request in a brief letter recently sent to Mark Gordon, one of the producers, and copied to others on the project, including the director, Lasse Hallstrom. In the letter he gave no reason for his decision, but in a recent telephone interview said: ""My feeling, based on the script, is that there was more concern for the kind of cigarettes I smoked and the type of suitcase I carried than there was for the truth of what happened."" The film's producers responded last week, saying in a statement issued by the studio, Miramax Films: ""Clifford Irving's book, 'The Hoax,' contributed greatly to Bill Wheeler's screenplay. Throughout development and production, we reviewed Mr. Irving's notes and incorporated many of them into the script. We deeply regret that he feels this way in advance of seeing the finished movie."" Mr. Irving, who spent 16 months in prison for his involvement in the fraudulent Hughes memoir, has also taken umbrage with the film's characters, including his own (portrayed by Richard Gere), as being largely unlikable.

According to Nielsen estimates, an audience of 35.5 million watched Fox's two-hour season premiere of the talent contest's fifth installment, during which, from far right, Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson alternately praised and pilloried contestants trying out in Chicago. That total was nearly two million more viewers than last year's debut delivered, and it was Fox's largest audience ever for an entertainment program. In the 18-to-49 demographic, the show drew a 34 share, which means that of the people in that age group watching television between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., 34 percent were glued to ""Idol."" The show's continued success is crucial to Fox, which overcame a terrible fall in 2004 to finish the season first among adults 18 to 49, largely because of the dependably huge ratings of the twice-a-week show. Also, the strength of ""Idol"" turned the previously low-rated ""House"" into a hit when that medical procedural was scheduled after it last spring. Fox has been doing better this year already, but it is tied for third with NBC in the important sales demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds, and it needs ""Idol"" to compensate for the low-rated baseball postseason and the absence of the Super Bowl broadcast, carried this year by ABC.

But the willingness of the Golden Globes  and the Oscars, if conventional wisdom holds  to recognize that gay life is part of the American story should not be mistaken for some fundamental change.

The ban, part of a broader agreement between the countries on protecting Italy's cultural heritage, has come under scrutiny in recent months as Italy pursues an aggressive campaign to retrieve antiquities from several top American museums. Archaeologists and cultural property experts hailed the original accord, which took effect in 2001, as an effective tool against the looting of archaeological sites. In announcing the extension, the State Department commended recent initiatives by Italy to lend more archaeological material to American museums for longer terms. Its also cited Italian police reports indicating that archaeological looting in Italy remains ""a severe problem"" and that much of the looted material is destined for the United States. Art dealers have argued that the ban blocks legitimate trading in artifacts that are already well represented in Italian collections. And some museum officials assert that Italy has not increased its cultural cooperation as called for in the pact, known as a memorandum of understanding.",2006-01-20T05:00:00+0000

The event focuses on artists who blend traditional and modern styles, exploring the ways in which migration and technology augment and reinvent folkways. As D.J. culture makes it more and more common to hear disparate sounds spliced and overlaid, everywhere from clubs to TV commercials, it becomes even more exciting to imagine creating your own live mix. And the acts here offer the opportunity for tantalizingly diverse juxtapositions. For example, you can bop from a set by the art-rock band Auktyon from St. Petersburg, Russia, to one by Daby Tour of Mauritania, then dash off to hear the flamenco guitar of Juan Carmona with the Cajun stomp of Steve Riley's Mamou Playboys still thumping in your head. Then whoosh from the electronic Slavic twister of the Balkan Beat Box or the carnival squeal of Frank London's Klezmer Brass All-Stars to the soothingly evocative cabaret pop of Keren Ann. Other artists include the Senegalese hip-hop group Daara J (above, the rapper Faada Freddy); the Iranian-Indian fusion group Niyaz; and the djellaba band Roxanne Butterfly's Worldbeats. Then, after a night watching the French group Las Ondas Marteles pay homage to Cuba, and the Cape Verdean singer Lura perform gripping West African-influenced batukus and funanas, you can sip a Caipirinha and discuss theories on diasporas, post-colonialism and cross-pollination while grooving to the Brazilian DJ Dolores's mangue splice-'n-dice.

Back then, Ms. Cook, now 78, was the quintessential Broadway ingnue, a demure honey blonde with a high, sweet soprano that gave only a few hints of the artist who would emerge over the next four decades. The fact that Ms. Cook will make her Metropolitan Opera solo concert debut this evening, and that the occasion is the first time in the company's 123-year history that it has presented a female pop singer in solo concert, speaks for itself. Since her ingnue days, Ms. Cook's artistry has steadily deepened, in a process that accelerated after she teamed up with the pianist and musical director Wally Harper, who died in 2004. Together they explored contemporary pop as well as theater songs and even ventured into soft rock and light swing. But in recent years she has refocused her attention on Broadway and become a definitive interpreter of Stephen Sondheim, treating his songs (especially his ballads) as the ultimate flowering of the great American songbook. If the days are long gone when Ms. Cook could toss off the high notes of Leonard Bernstein's coloratura parody, ""Glitter and Be Gay,"" from ""Candide,"" what has taken root in place of those frills is a musicianship and profound understanding of how to live inside and outside a song at the same time. Ms. Cook's blend of acting and piercing romantic lyricism achieves an overview of life, music and theater that is something to behold. Accompanying her is a quintet led by her new musical director, Eric Stern. Expect surprise guests.

us,The Listings: Jan. 20 - Jan. 26; CHARLES MOULTON,"Mr. Moulton got an early start on making dances, when at 6 he collaborated with his sister on a piece about Jesse James in which the performers all fell down in the end. Not surprising, considering that he was later known for postmodernist dances that were just as simple-looking. But that was only one style in three decades of choreography that has been distinctive for its variety. And Mr. Moulton (above, with Erin Hunter Jennings, left, and Meghan McGeary) takes a look at where that career began and where it went in his new ""Land of Dreams: A Vaudeville Requiem,"" set to music by Randy Newman, which will be performed tonight and tomorrow at Montclair State University. Mr. Moulton performed with Merce Cunningham and helped to found Performance Space 122 in 1980. His sleek, tightly structured ""precision ball-passing"" pieces made his name as a choreographer, followed by happy, easygoing virtuoso dances with an almost manic energy, then tap and technology pieces, and, finally, classically oriented dance that included a segment of the Joffrey Ballet's controversial pop ""Billboards,"" in 1993. What linked it all was the underlying sense of Mr. Moulton, long known to the dance world as Charlie, as a down-to-earth, even sunny man -- partly the effect of his cornflake blond looks -- with an abiding sense of humor. Born in Minneapolis, he is from a family with roots in vaudeville. In ""Land of Dreams,"" developed over two and half years, he weaves together a history of that lost art with his own personal dance history, drawing from texts by writers as various as Thornton Wilder and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Now living and working in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Moulton describes ""Land of Dreams"" as taking a long, hard look at the canon of avant-garde performance and finding a direction that ""connects the dots of my past with my hopes for the future."" (""Land of Dreams: A Vaudeville Requiem"" will be performed tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University, College Avenue and Red Hawk Road, Montclair, N.J., (973) 655-5112 or www.montclair.edu/kasser; $25.)",2006-01-20T05:00:00+0000

""Big 2nd Episode (Show/Business),"" its flashy meditation on pop culture's seduction, is totally dubbed and features smiling actors who run through banal scenes loaded with sexual subtext, which stop and start, rewind and are slightly tweaked along the way. After running at the Kitchen last year, this multimedia show, which should be required viewing for fans of the Big Art Group or Lypsinka, returns for a short engagement at the Public Theater as part of the second Under the Radar Festival, produced by Mark Russell, who was the artistic head of Performance Space 122 for many years.

Regardless, the show delivered its largest audience, 31.44 million, for a Wednesday edition since the finale of the second season, when Clay Aiken lost to Ruben Studdard.

(David Poland had the exact same thought  I guess small minds think alike. ) And that is not even counting his glorious turns in Hustle and Flow, and Crash this year. Writing in USA Today, Claudia Puig reminds Academy voters that in addition to the no-brainers in the actors category  Philip Seymour Hoffman and Heath Ledger  they ought to keep Mr. Howard in mind.

That could be changing rapidly, in part because of all the love that Brokeback received at the Globes. As Variety noted: ",2006-01-20T14:18:00+0000
us,Global Impact,"Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times does a nice job explaining how the Globes, which landed with reverse impact last year, could be somewhat determinant this year. This years Oscars timetable bumped back the programs date one week to March 5, and the deadline for nomination ballots with it. Those ballots are due to PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants by 5 P.M. PST on Saturday, five days after the Globes announced its winners, he wrote, and then went on to suggest that, Any academy members claiming the Globes wont influence their choices deserve acting nominations of their own. That of course assumes that voters waited until the very last minute to get down to business in terms of voting. Human nature being what it is  the Bagger has approximately 18 minutes to deliver this batch of shiny diamonds you are reading  its probably a safe bet.",2006-01-20T14:20:29+0000
us,Just-in-Time Inventory Management,"For those of you who failed to keep a comprehensive scorecard of who has won what from whom  the Bagger admits that his own personal hard drive was overwhelmed on that score somewhere between the New York Film Critics Circle and the New York Film Critics Online  there is a comprehensive list telling you much more than you would ever want to know. It is worth noting that King Kong appears nowhere on this list  in the end, its status as an industry hopeful provided no lift  and that Munich, which had Oscar written all over its furrowed brow, gets a best director nod from the Directors Guild and a placement on a few top 10 lists. One industry wag  he actually is not technically a wag, but a person intimately involved in the process who would not call the Bagger if his name were revealed  had a thought about why the two brawny competitors have turned out to be such wimps in the ring. The thinking goes like this: Both Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were endlessly futzing with their movies until the very last second  the final copies were still wet as of Nov. 30  and the process of transforming the print into a finished DVD that could be put in the cold hands of Academy members takes three weeks. That means that many of the potential voters did not even pop in the disc until after Christmas, long after other projects had made an indelible impression on folks. The Bagger has been confused from the start about this whole Oscar timing bit. Release too early  The Constant Gardener  and people think you are small beer, but get to the dance a bit late and the door has already closed. Could it be that the all of the discussion over timing is really just an excuse for movies that couldnt quite compete? The Bagger remains resolutely unsure of whether he is being spun.",2006-01-20T14:23:52+0000
us,Left-Coast Bias,"One of the things that the Bagger learned on his recent trip to L.A.  apart from the fact that the red-eye represents a false economy of time-management  is that Angelenos love, love their Crash. A movie that left the East Coast scratching its collective heads  Whats with all those cars, anyway?  speaks to the soul of people who spend a great deal of quality time on the 405. Yes, the Bagger is a rookie predictor  although he did O.K. at the Globes  and he still gets lost anytime he veers off Sunset, but Crash is a success waiting to happen, at least in terms of nominations. Race, which is lived at close quarters in New York, ends up being a parallel and more divisive experience in Lost Angeles. ",2006-01-20T14:27:15+0000
us,Categorically Denied,"Phone lines were buzzing yesterday about the story in Variety pointing out that while the script for Syriana is not considered an adaptation for Oscar purposes, Warner Brothers is taking out all sorts of ads to support its candidacy as  an adaptation. In fact, the advisory sheet sent out with Oscar ballots listed Syriana in the original category. Not a pretty picture, and one that could lead to a lot of divided votes for a film that will need every vote it can get to end up in the money. So what happened? One interested observer  he has no connection to the project, but did not want to be seen as experiencing Schadenfreude at an untoward competitive moment  suggested that the hand that struck director-writer Stephen Gaghan was his own. In any number of screenings, interviews and trips to the dias, Mr. Gaghan has talked repeatedly about the fundamental originality of the story, thereby confusing the agency of the narrative, which was the Robert Baer book See No Evil. Even now that the confusion has had manifest consequences, Mr. Gaghan does little to tamp it down, telling Variety: I wrote a lot of original stuff that wasnt in the book and Im proud of that. And Im proud that the Academy considers it original. But we optioned a book and I tried to honor Bob Baer. I used his life and I used his book, so I assumed  everyone assumed  it was an adaptation. Then he added: You dont do work for awards; its the gift of being able to make a movie. But its a weird feeling. Nobody called me, nobody alerted me. Im kind of heartbroken. So, to summarize, the script is full of original material, but he is surprised that the Academy did not see it as an adaptation, but thats O.K. because he didnt do it for the awards. But he is heartbroken at the run of events. Got all that?",2006-01-20T14:36:13+0000

The jump came after Mr. bin Laden, right, cited the book in his most recent audio message and told Americans it would be ""useful for you to read."" He then quoted a passage that he said was in the book's introduction. In a telephone interview, however, Mr. Blum said the passage actually appears on the back cover of another of his books, ""Freeing the World to Death: Essays on the American Empire"" (Common Courage Press, 2004). Mr. Blum said that he also frequently used the passage in speeches and that it had been widely circulated on the Internet, where he assumes it was picked up. The book has been translated into roughly a dozen foreign-language editions, Mr. Blum said, including Arabic. The passage quoted by Mr. bin Laden is an ""If I were president "" call to apologize for ""American imperialism"" and end military interventions.

As crown prince, he was constitutionally elevated to the post of emir on Sunday, when Kuwait's longtime ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, died. The request to Parliament followed a front-page editorial in a leading Kuwaiti newspaper, Al Qabas, calling on Sheik Saad, 75, to step down.

During Tuesday's episode of the ABC show, starring Geena Davis as the first female president, the White House tried to resolve an international crisis precipitated when an American military submarine was damaged and stranded off North Korea. President Allen (Ms. Davis) and her husband-adviser (Kyle Secor) consulted with a friend who is an expert on Korea. That character, played by Robert Harper, was named Owen Latimer. In 1950, Owen Lattimore, an Asia expert and professor at Johns Hopkins University, was among the many people accused by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican, of being Soviet spies. In 1952, Lattimore was indicted on perjury charges, which were later dismissed. On the show, the president's husband told Latimer: ""From now on, every conversation you're a part of, every document you read, basically anything that you see or do is classified. Now, I don't know the statutory penalties, but if you reveal anything that you learn here, I expect it's a couple of decades in prison.""

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   BASTIEN, JAMES WILLIAM","BASTIEN--James William. A loving husband and father, and a passionate piano pedagogue and musician, passed away on December 7, 2005, in La Jolla, California. During his long career, Jim became internationally known through his contributions to piano teaching, composing, writing, adjudication, and performing. With more than 300 publications to his credit, the Bastien name has become synonymous with innovative piano pedagogy. Jim was born in Bellingham, Washington, on April 10, 1934. His father, Clarence, was musical and played the violin. His mother, Dorothy, was a writer and a high school Latin and journalism instructor. After living in Seattle and Florida, the family moved to Portland, Oregon, where Jim began his piano studies with Frances Mulkey North. Subsequently, Jim studied with the late Ariel Rubstein, the late Louis Artau, and the late Gyorgy Sandor. Jim received his undergraduate and Master's degrees from Southern Methodist University. He was a former member of the faculties of Notre Dame University, Tulane University, Loyola University (New Orleans), and the summer faculties of Tanglewood and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. Jim met his wife Jane Smisor in New Orleans in 1960. They performed as the duo-piano team, Smisor and Bastien. In addition, Jim was a Columbia Artist accompanist whose collaborative career included appearances with Richard Tucker and John Alexander. During this time Jim and Jane started writing music to address the needs of their students. This was the beginning of the Bastien piano books that have inspired so many piano students and teachers. The Bastien piano books have been published worldwide by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1963 and are now translated into 14 languages. In 1999, The Music Teachers National Association presented Jim and Jane with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the association's highest honor, in recognition of their outstanding career in music and contribution to the music profession. In 1990, Jim was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, for the past fifteen years, he was cared for at home. Jim is survived by his wife, Jane Smisor Bastien; his two daughters, Lisa Bastien Hanss and her husband Basil, and Lori Bastien Vickers and her husband Eric. There are four grandchildren, Katie and Julie Hanss and Abby and Riley Vickers. A Memorial Concert will be held at the La Jolla Presbyterian Church on Saturday, January 28, 2006, at 2 P.M. where Jim's former student, Dr. Robert Roux, chair of the piano department at Rice University, Houston, Texas, will perform. A reception will follow immediately in the church fellowship hall.

Three of his best-known works have already played -- the avant-garde anti-musical ""DANCER IN THE DARK,"" the spooky medical mini-series ""THE KINGDOM"" and the audacious melodrama ""BREAKING THE WAVES"" -- but there's plenty of perversity yet to come. A welcome, very wacky sequel, ""THE KINGDOM II,"" returns to the metaphysical misadventures in a haunted hospital. ""ZENTROPA"" marks the decadent climax of Mr. von Trier's early period, fully accounted for in the series by screenings of ""LIBERATION PICTURES,"" ""THE ELEMENT OF CRIME,"" ""EPIDEMIC"" and n ""MEDEA."" But for the quintessential von Trierexperience, skip the juvenilia and head for a movie ""by idiots about idiots for idiots."" That would be, naturally enough, ""THE IDIOTS,"" a discomfiting comedy about would-be revolutionaries who try to shock the system by ""spazzing"" out in public.

Two of these full-length volumes were indeed titled ""Testimony,"" as was an earlier prose work; it was a word that kept him close company.

(This week's list was compiled two days before that story broke.) It's as if readers felt the rumblings, and wanted to know what the fuss was about. ""My Friend Leonard"" moves from No. 9 to No. 1 on the hardcover nonfiction list; ""A Million Little Pieces"" holds onto the No. 1 spot on the paperback nonfiction list, and moves up to No. 15 on the hardcover list. When it appeared in 2003, ""A Million Little Pieces"" was reviewed in these pages by David Kamp -- who, as it happens, is also the author of this week's cover review. About Frey, Kamp wrote: ""There is an audacity to the way he allows himself to appear so unlikable and seldom leavens the proceedings with humor or intimations that everything will turn out all right."" But Kamp also observed that ""an unwelcome narcissism creeps through, too -- it's evident that the sober Frey still digs the supertough, supersick baddie he was. . . . As the showoffy, Peckinpah-bloody set pieces accumulate -- James tears off one of his own toenails, James removes his own facial stitches, James has a root canal done without anesthesia (painkillers are verboten at the clinic) -- 'A Million Little Pieces' exudes the poseur scuzziness of bad indie films and MTV's 'Jackass.'

United Jewish Communities and its leadership mourn the untimely death of Andrea Bronfman, beloved wife and partner of UJC's first chair of the Board, Charles Bronfman. She was 61. The Bronfmans have made an indelible mark on Jewish life in Canada, the United States, Israel and elsewhere around the world, evoking the most cherished Jewish values of tzedakah (charity) and repairing the world. The innovative birthright israel program, which the Bronfmans, UJC/federations and other major leaders supported, has nurtured the Jewish identities of thousands of young Jews with free first-time trips to Israel. The family's many charitable endeavors reflected Andrea's tireless spirit, determination and generosity and served as a model for the community.

Brazil, the world's largest sugar producer, needs to build 73 new mills to convert sugar cane into ethanol and to plant an additional 2.5 million hectares of cane, an increase of almost 50 percent, the agriculture minister, Roberto Rodrigues, said in Braslia. Brazil produces 5.5 million hectares of sugar cane, about half of which goes to produce ethanol, a motor fuel. Concern that more of the world's sugar cane crop will be used to produce ethanol and less for sugar sent raw sugar prices to a 24-year high in New York. In Brazil, ethanol is cheaper than gasoline.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   RUBIN, WILLIAM S.","RUBIN -- William S. The Trustees and staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the loss of our longtime friend and colleague Bill Rubin, director emeritus of the Museum's Department of Painting and Sculpture. Rubin began his career at MoMA in 1967, after sixteen years as a professor of art history at Sarah Lawrence College and the Graduate School of the City University of New York. One year later, he was named Chief Curator of the painting and sculpture collection, and in 1973, Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture, a position that he held until 1988. The first exhibition that Bill organized after joining MoMA was the influential Dada, Surrealism, and their Heritage (1968). It would be followed by many important and now famous exhibitions of classic modernism, including Cezanne: The Late Work (1977), Pablo Picasso: A Retrospective (1980), De Chirico (1982), ""Primitivism"" in 20th Century Art (1984), Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism (1989), and Picasso and Portraiture (1996). Additionally, he organized retrospectives of the work of contemporary artists Frank Stella, Anthony Caro, and Ad Reinhardt. Equally important were the many additions to the collection that Bill secured. These ranged from the radical sheet-metal Guitar of 1912, which he obtained as a gift of Pablo Picasso, to other icons of the collection, including Joan Miro's The Birth of the World, Henri Matisse's Memory of Oceania, Jackson Pollock's One: Number 31, 1950, and Barnett Newman's Vir Heroicus Sublimus. Additionally, Bill brought to the Museum a number of important private collections, among them, those of Sidney and Harriet Janis, Mary Sisler, and Louise Smith. And he himself generously donated a number of works to the Museum, most notably David Smith's sculpture, Australia. Bill's passion for and commitment to the Museum and its collections were legendary. As the de facto successor to Alfred H. Barr, Jr., in the development and installation of the collection of painting and sculpture, he defined the understanding of modern art at the Museum for over two decades, and was widely understood to be the greatest art historian and curator of modern art of his generation. In recognition of his achievements, he was made Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1978, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1979, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Fine Arts and Sciences in 1985. We extend our sympathies to his wife, Phyllis Hattis, their daughter, Beata, and to his brothers Richard and Larry. Bill will be sorely missed, but the immeasurable impact of his contribution to art history and especially to The Museum of Modern Art will be apparent for generations to come.

Though a prosecutor argued that a mistrial would effectively reward the men for the courtroom attack, Justice Albert Tomei of State Supreme Court said that the jurors, some of whom saw the attack, would not be able to try the case impartially. The men, accused of raping, torturing and killing a Hunter College student in 2003, were arraigned yesterday on additional charges of attempted murder for last week's attack. The court officers' union accused correction officers yesterday of failing to search the men, and said that the two had brought sharpened plastic knives from Rikers Island.

The prize was announced yesterday at the Midwinter Meeting of the American Library Association in San Antonio. ""Criss Cross,"" sprinkled with haiku, bits of poetry and questions and responses, is published by Greenwillow Books/HarperCollins. The association awarded the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book for children to ""The Hello, Goodbye Window,"" illustrated by Chris Raschka and written by Norton Juster. The window of the title is where everything important seems to happen in the house of a little girl's grandparents -- where they watch the sky together, and where they say hello and goodbye. The story is published by Michael di Capua Books/Hyperion. The award-winning books, selected by librarians and children's book experts, are an important marketing tool for publishers.

That audience represents a sharp decrease from the 9.8 million who watched the last pageant broadcast, on ABC in September 2004, according to Nielsen Media Research. But any comparisons should probably carry an asterisk. ABC, like the other major broadcast networks, is available in about 110 million homes, according to Nielsen. CMT is in nearly 79 million. CMT said that in the annals of its highest-rated shows, Miss America had supplanted last year's CMT Music Awards, which drew an estimated 2.9 million viewers.

The episode, ""The Return of the King,"" had its premiere on Jan. 15, the day before the holiday honoring King.

""Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures,"" Mr. Sharpton said in an e-mail news release. ""We are totally offended by the continuous use of the 'N' word in McGruder's show. While I can appreciate Mr. McGruder and his achievements, this particular episode is over the line. If we don't receive an apology, we will picket the corporate headquarters."" In an e-mail statement, a network spokesman said: ""This episode in no way was meant to offend or 'desecrate' the name of Dr. King. We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought-provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action.""

It also had lows. Simon Cowell, below, said to a male contestant, Kenneth (Chase) Bush, ""It's going to sound odd, but I almost imagine you in a dress when you sing."" After Mr. Bush assured the judges he wasn't interested in doing drag, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul outvoted Mr. Cowell and sent Mr. Bush to the next round. The two-hour episode drew 34.75 million viewers for Fox in Nielsen's estimates. The broadcast was the talent show's third-highest-rated ever, and delivered an overwhelming victory for the network. In its second week of the season, ""Idol"" is taking a toll on its network competition between 8 and 10 p.m. ABC's ""According to Jim"" (6.01 million), ""Rodney"" (5.6 million) and ""Commander in Chief"" (10.33 million) all suffered blows to their ratings, as did NBC's ""Fear Factor"" (4.69 million) and two episodes of ""Scrubs"" (5.47 million), then (5.73 million). CBS placed a far-off second for the night. Its new midseason series ""Love Monkey"" fared poorly in Week 2, attracting only 7.65 million viewers. KATE AURTHUR",2006-01-26T05:00:00+0000

Spend a winter weekend in Whitehorse (population: 22,000), and you'll find that the spell is truly contagious. The capital of Canada's Yukon Territory was so named because Gold Rush stampeders found that the since-tamed rapids of the Yukon River reminded them of the flowing manes of stallions. Whitehorse is sub-Arctic, so winter is obviously cold, with temperatures often down around zero degrees Fahrenheit. But dark it is not. You could enjoy more rays on an abbreviated February day than in an entire week down south in the Pacific Northwest. The clear nights are often highlighted by a symphony of color called aurora borealis, the Northern Lights. The people? Friendly -- and hardy indeed. BOB MACKIN",2006-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Certainly the Berlin Philharmonic that appeared at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday night, in the first of four programs through tomorrow night, looks a lot different from the ensemble of even 10 years ago, when the great Claudio Abbado was music director.

us,The Listings: Jan. 27 - Feb. 2; JOHN BRATTIN: 'THE TRIUMPH OF NIGHT',"Mr. Brattin's short film is like a basement-tapes version of ""Wuthering Heights."" Written and directed by Mr. Brattin, its title lifted from a ghost story by Edith Wharton, it delivers a Hollywood-ready Victorian plot in an ingeniously homespun package. In the story, the nave young Grace Fogg, hired companion to the wife of the mysterious Silas Greyfield, arrives at the Greyfield estate on a stormy autumn night. She meets, in succession, a ghost; two weird servants; the strung-out, pill-popping Lady Greyfield; and the seductively predatory Greyfield himself (played by the excellent James Fletcher, above). There follow apparitions of butchered children, hints of unspeakable obsessions and warnings that Grace must never, ever open the doors of certain rooms. And she never does, because the film ends before we get that far, which is fine. What's remarkable here is not the story but the exercise in atmospherics it has inspired and the ingeniously sophisticated way Mr. Brattin has produced it. The film, about 30 minutes, was shot entirely in Participant Inc's small Lower East Side space, with funky sculptural props and painterly sets, all still in place. The script is artful, too: patched-together dialogue from ""The Turn of the Screw,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Bambi."" The result is a drama of cues and clues, not conclusions, the kind of self-spooking vision an imaginative, bookish kid might cook up in the cellar of his parents' house. It's a vision laced with budding adult passions and fears. Like life, ""The Triumph of Night"" is an innocence-and-experience tale, destined to be forever continued. (Participant Inc, 95 Rivington Street, between Ludlow and Orchard Streets, (212) 254-4334, through Feb. 12.)",2006-01-27T05:00:00+0000

Come one, come all to the New York Public Library, where these and other native varieties and foreign novelties are on display in ""Vaudeville Nation."" Full of photographs, film and audio clips, playbills, letters and even the instructive notebook pages of a strongman, this free exhibition offers a delightful escape from dreary winter afternoons. Thriving on touring circuits throughout the country from the 1880's through the 1930's, vaudeville had a broad influence on popular American culture and entertainment. In addition to oddities, circus acts and magicians (including Houdini), the shows featured gender impersonators, comic routines based on immigrant experiences, and skits on topical political issues. Vaudeville, replete with minstrelsy and burlesque, also helped foster America's two great and related art forms, jazz and tap dance, through performers like the hoofer Bill Robinson, known as Bojangles, above, whose legendary feet can be heard on an audio sampler at the exhibition. Tap was just one of the dance forms used by vaudeville performers -- there were also ethnic and character dances, choruses of precision dancers and exhibition ballroom teams (not to mention striptease routines and the Marvelous Ice Ballet, featuring Charlotte, Queen of the Steel Runners). Library visitors inspired by the creative variety are invited to make use of the exhibition's piano and Fireside Treasury of Songs. A series of free talks and screenings will also be held, beginning on Feb. 4 at 3 p.m. with ""Waltzing in the Dark: African-American Vaudeville and Race Politics.""

In a comparison of its first four broadcasts with last year's, the tremendous success of the franchise has actually increased in double-digit percentages in both total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic. The 8 p.m. ""Idol"" was followed by ""Bones,"" which has been moved to Wednesdays to benefit from the huge ratings of ""American Idol,"" as ""House"" did last season. The results were mixed. ""Bones,"" a whimsical mystery series, brought in its best ratings yet and beat CBS's ""Criminal Minds"" among adults 18 to 49. But it lost more than 20 million ""Idol"" viewers, delivering an audience of 11.39 million. The winner during the 9 p.m. hour was ABC's ""Lost"": 19.08 million viewers watched the insufferable Charlie (Dominic Monaghan, above) flip his lid, and, for the night, ABC placed second among 18-to-49-year-olds, and third among total viewers.

The actions were filed in response to a request for restitution from some 15 heirs of the paintings' former owner, Martha Nathan. A study for the museums found that Mrs. Nathan inherited the paintings from her husband, Hugo, in 1922; that she moved her collection to Basel, Switzerland, in 1930; and that a group of dealers purchased the van Gogh and Gauguin in 1938. The paintings were subsequently acquired by the museums. The family heirs say that Mrs. Nathan, who was Jewish and emigrated from Germany in 1937, was forced to sell the paintings to survive and that she sold them for considerably less than the market rate -- the Gauguin for about $7,000, the van Gogh for about $9,000. They were later sold by dealers for $25,000 and $34,000 each, said David J. Rowland, a lawyer for the family. ""Would the sale have taken place in the absence of Nazi persecution?"" Mr. Rowland said.

Fortunately for the Whitest Kids U' Know, a quintet of New York 20-somethings, there are still plenty of taboos to break, and in a series of squirmingly hilarious skits done in videos on the Web (at www.whitestkids.com) and performed live at its Sunday-night residency at Pianos, the group riffs on date rape, domestic violence and racism (Timmy Williams, above front, with Sam Brown). The gangsta-Nazi ""Hitler Rap"" -- an online hit whose music is now available as a ring tone -- finds a fresh angle on even that most heavily exploited forbidden topic; in another skit, ""Race War,"" one member (all five men are, as advertised, white) holds a baseball bat and calls up to a friend's window in an innocent voice, ""Come on, Bill -- race war!"" Even less risqu numbers suggest the slightly berserk sensibility of the Kids in the Hall: last Sunday, a routine about a couple's disagreement on a date took on another meaning when the man revealed that the character of his girlfriend was merely a stand-in to receive the verbal abuse directed at a real woman in the crowd.

What really lies behind the cancellation of the American soprano Rene Fleming's scheduled appearance tonight with the baritone Thomas Hampson in the centerpiece concert with Riccardo Muti and the Vienna Philharmonic? Ms. Fleming, above, asked to withdraw from the Mozart concert aria ""Ch'io mi scordi di te"" because she did not feel she had it properly in her voice, her representative said. Instead of allowing her to sing her other two numbers, as she assumed, the Mozarteum Orchestra, sponsoring the Mozart Week, replaced her with the Italian mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, whose voice may be too low for another work on the program. Why did it take Ms. Fleming until just days before the performance to realize that there might be a problem? She declined to respond. Why did the Mozarteum refuse to substitute another aria or hire someone else to sing it? ""This aria is one of the masterpieces of Mozart and a central part of the concert celebrating his birthday,"" the Mozarteum said in a statement.

The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court on Thursday, asks that the producers of the game surrender ""any and all profits"" earned from its sale. The game, released in 2004, is set in an approximation of Los Angeles and is an unabashedly violent interpretation of urban life. Last year, Internet hackers uncovered hidden scenes in the game that allow the player's digital avatar to engage in simulated sex acts with female characters. After Democratic senators, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, called for an investigation of the game, the industry's rating board changed its designation from Mature to the more restrictive Adults Only, prompting major retailers, including Wal-Mart, to pull it from shelves. The game has since been rereleased without the hidden sex scenes. In the suit, the city attorney, Rockard J. Delgadillo, accused the game's publisher, Take-Two Interactive Software and Rockstar Games, of misleading the public in marketing the original version. A Rockstar spokesman did not respond yesterday to a request for comment. SETH SCHIESEL",2006-01-28T05:00:00+0000

He bravely served his country in World War II entering the U.S. Army as a Private and retiring as a Major. As an infantry man he earned two Purple Hearts, two Bronze Stars, a Silver Star, four Battle Stars, and a Combat Infantry Badge. He then served as a lawyer assisting in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. Together with his late wife Dorothy, he founded and grew a number of finance companies including National Equipment Rental which went public in the sixties. The company successfully pursued a case to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the principles it established became a cornerstone of jurisdictional law. Believing passionately in his responsibility to give back, he founded the Marty and Dorothy Silverman Foundation. He was particularly proud to be able to assist in the establishment of the Jewish Chapel at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a Chair at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and support of bold initiatives at The Hebrew Home for the Aged, The Jewish Braille Institute, Chaim Sheba Medical Center in Israel and numerous non-profit agencies serving the elderly and at risk children. As part of his legacy of giving the 'gift of giving' to others, he conceived of FJC, a Foundation of Donor Advised Funds, which offers a wide range of innovative options to donors, non profit agencies and financial partners. He was officially recognized by New York State for his philanthropic achievements.

The company, which publishes USA Today and 90 other daily newspapers, reported earnings of $343 million, or $1.44 a share, down from $378 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Dec. 25, rose 6 percent, to $2.05 billion. The company said the increase in revenue, along with an increase in operating expenses, reflected the change in Detroit, in which Gannett acquired The Detroit Free Press and sold the smaller Detroit News.

Kassel ruled that two witnesses who testified at a 2004 planning board meeting had never been sworn in. This is the second time the project has been set back in court based on a technicality. Last May, a Superior Court judge threw the case out because the city failed to sufficiently notify homeowners of an upcoming meeting. The project, to be built by Cherokee Investment Partners of Raleigh, N.C., is expected to displace 1,200 residents in the neighborhood, plus dozens of businesses. Representatives from the City of Camden and Cherokee said they would correct the problem and file a motion to take up the case where it left off, rather than losing nearly two years of work, since the city's planning board adopted the original redevelopment plan in May 2004.",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Writers are supposed to learn restraint over time, but Lebert, a 23-year-old German, already has that quality down pat. He does a lot with few words in this follow-up to his 1999 debut novel, ""Crazy."" Just over 100 small pages, ""The Bird Is a Raven"" depicts a single evening's conversation between strangers on a train. The narrator, Paul, tentatively encourages the friendly overtures of his bunkmate, Henry, only to find that his new acquaintance won't stop talking. As Henry spins a long, meandering account of his stormy relationship with two friends, Paul can't make up his mind whether the other man is likably eccentric or just plain crazy. One minute Henry seems like a nice enough chap, and the next he's talking about violent urges, sexual hang-ups and repulsive digestive processes. (""Can you imagine how disgusting it is to have diarrhea, all the time and everywhere?"" he asks.) Lebert explores the limits of trust, blending broad humor and sudden bursts of melodrama while maintaining a sense of delicately balanced tension. Even the novel's apparent weaknesses, like the characters' identical narrative voices, turn out to be part of his master plan.",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

Born in Brooklyn, May 22, 1912, the second of four children, George was the first son of Sigmund and Bessie Vogel. He earned his B.S. Degree from New York University in 1933, followed by his M.D. in 1936 from the University of Hamburg Medical School. While in Hamburg, George met his future wife, Franzi Leopold, at the Artists' Costume Ball. After graduation from the University of Hamburg, George returned to Brooklyn, with Franzi following six months later, leaving Nazi Germany behind. After returning from Germany, the young Dr. Vogel was a medical officer in the U.S. Army and the C.C.C. from 1939 to 1943. He then moved to Croton-on-Hudson, where he developed a thriving practice in family medicine. George became a charter Diplomate of the American Board of Family Practice when Family Medicine became the twentieth medical specialty, and remained a fellow in the Academy of Family Practice until his retirement from active practice in 1979. An integral and dedicated part of the community, he served for more than twenty years as the town's school physician, as both the police and fire department surgeons, and as the doctor, coordinator and trainer for the ambulance corps; he was honored as Croton's Man of the Year in 1976. He was also the physician for New York Central Railroad (NYC to Albany line) and served as medical director of several nursing homes in northern Westchester and as Chief of Medicine at Phelps Memorial Hospital, Tarrytown, NY. In the first twenty-five years of his practice, he delivered over 1000 babies. Upon his retirement from obstetrics, he created a scholarship for Croton-Harmon High School students who wished to pursue studies in a field of medicine. George served as a president of B'nai Brith in Croton. Along with Franzi, he was an instrumental founder of Temple Israel of Northern Westchester, holding the congregation's first services in the living room of their home. Temple Israel is still thriving after more than fifty years. Outside of his passion for medicine, George was an avid and dedicated gardener. But he was proudest of his Orvis degree in trout fishing, which hung on the wall in his office alongside of his medical degrees. Surviving him are his wife Franzi, his daughter Susie Shelsky, son Michael, son-in-law Seymour Shelsky, daughter-in-law Beth, grandson Peter Shelsky, granddaughter - in - law Barbara Shelsky and sister Estelle Gurin. He left us still in love with Franzi, his girlfriend of 71 years and wife of 67. A funeral service was held Friday, January 27, 2006.

Mr. Fisher, 33, started playing Bruce last fall in Los Angeles, where critics approved and audiences followed suit. The show is drawn directly from transcripts of Bruce's routines from 1959 to his death in 1966, a period during which Bruce -- a First Amendment die-hard and savage wit -- fought drug and obscenity charges with furious onstage routines while simultaneously self-destructing.

Thus while Democrats are correct to insist that higher wages are moral, they might also remind Republicans that higher wages promote economic growth that benefits everyone.",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

While the sweet scent and pert packaging are pleasing, the real secret to the Einsteins' success may be their no-brainer price: $6 each at www.liptherapy.com. PULSE",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

He walked through another door and down a hallway to a large upright freezer. Mounted beside the freezer was a retinal scanner. Tumpey, who is 6 feet tall, bent down a little to position his eyes in line with the lens. In a digital voice, the scanner asked him to step forward. Tumpey complied.

With their towers and battlements, these domestic fortresses of Christendom, built as much to intimidate as to inspire, were close cousins and coevals of the Crusader castles in Turkey and the Middle East, like Birecik, Markab, and Crac des Chevaliers, whose lordly ruins I later saw, always from a distance and always with an unwelcome pang of dAjA vu. My boarding school was attached to Worcester Cathedral, a magnificent crenellated pile, from the top of whose two-hundred-foot tower you could, so it was said, see clear across six counties. It was also said that a threepenny bit flipped out from the tower onto the head of an unwary passerby would cause instant death. This maneuver wasn't as easy as it may sound, and the cathedral roof below the tower was spattered with coins that had failed to reach their target, several of them mine. ",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   KAYES, ALAN","KAYES--Alan. Distinguished World War II veteran, business leader in the field of classical recorded music and patron of the arts, died on January 16 at Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead. Mr. Kayes was 93. Mr. Kayes was married to Helen Dunlap who died in 1974. In 1978, he married Cecily Elmes Crawford who was one of the youngest female pilots in the Women's Air Force Service during World War II. Alan and Cecily Kayes were active in community and local affairs both in New York City and the Hamptons, were tireless volunteers for various philanthropies and travelled extensively worldwide. Cecily Kayes died in 2004. Mr. Kayes was born in Brooklyn and was a resident of New York City until his retirement from RCA Records in 1978. He retired to Water Mill, later moved to Southampton and moved two years ago to Peconic Landing in Greenport. He attended Penn State. Shortly after college Mr. Kayes began work in public relations at the Metropolitan Opera. This experience in public relations led to an assignment in 1942 in the Army Press Corp. Mr. Kayes served in India, Burma and in China with the Mars Task Force, the successors to Merrill's Marauders, and ultimately served under General George Stilwell in his Headquarters. After the war, Mr. Kayes covered the Japanese War Crime Trials as Press Officer in Shanghai. At the request of the Chairman of the RCA Corporation, General David Sarnoff, Mr. Kayes was mustered out of the army in 1946 to head A&R for RCA Records' highly esteemed RCA Victor Red Seal label imprint. During the 1950s and 1960s, he brought the label to preeminence based on his close working relations with major artists such as Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, William Kapell, Mario Lanza, Leontyne Price, Arthur Rubinstein, Cesare Valletti and Van Cliburn, and renowned conductors such as Arturo Toscanini, Fritz Reiner and Charles Munch. Many industry observers consider Mr. Kayes to have been one of the last great lions of the recorded music industry from that era. Mr. Kayes completed his professional career at RCA Records in the 1970s with its direct marketing group known as RCA Music Service. This business has evolved to become the present day BMG Columbia House, which is the world's largest direct-to-theconsumer marketer of music and movies. The success of this business is due in large measure to Mr. Kayes' precedent setting deal-making in connnection with intellectual property rights and his leadership in government and legislative affairs, which was instrumental in creating a favorable regulatory environment. During his retirement, Mr. Kayes remained active in community affairs in East Hampton, Water Mill, Southampton and, most recently, in Greenport. He was also a successful syndicated columnist with numerous articles on the art scene, local politics and local events being widely published in East End papers. Mr. Kayes is survived by stepdaughters Lillian Aronow of Miami, FL and Elizabeth Crawford of West Amwell, NJ, stepson James Crawford of Waukesha, WI and former charge, Florienne Ho Benagh of Sparta, NJ. A memorial service will be held in April in Greenport, NY at an exact date, time and location to be announced. In Mr. Kayes' memory, it is requested that donations be made either to The Brecknock Hall Foundation, 1500 Brecknock Road, Greenport, NY 11944 or to The Rogers Memorial Library, 91 Coopers Farm Road, Southampton, NY 11968.",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

A Professor for Radiation Biology in Radiology and Ophthalmology at Columbia University which he joined in 1974, he received his B.S. at University Miami (Biology) and his Ph.D. at University Vermont (Cell Biology). He defined the mechanism of radiation cataract development; discovered the ""Terminal body""--a cellular organelle; described the preferred dynamic reorientation of the mitotic spindle; the cataractotoxic load theory, and the current classification of congenital cataracts. His work on low dose radiation effects led to the adjustment of radiation protection levels. A brilliant thinker and inspiring researcher with the gift to bring about the excitement of science, conveying independent thought and creativity, he was a fascinating lecturer, engaging, entertaining and convincing. Born June 30, 1947, in New York, his favorite city on earth, he was a budding scientist early on, but also a poet, an artist, an astronomer, his interests seemed unlimited. Basil loved language and was an avid reader of fiction, non-fiction and his beloved New York Times. If his sense for fair conduct was violated, he spoke up regardless of personal consequences. Basil was our ever loving and caring son, husband, companion father, grandfather, and brother. He was our best friend and the first to turn to--he always took the time to listen and help. We know him for his thoughtfulness and concern, and his never resting intend to make us smile, to comfort us when we were hurt, to advise if we were lost, and to embrace and protect us with his love.

There are three likely reasons for its resurgence: 1) The long-awaited paperback edition of ""The Da Vinci Code"" is due on March 28, and many retailers are offering steep discounts on their remaining hardcover copies, hoping to clear them out; 2) Ron Howard's film version, starring Audrey Tautou and a shellacked-looking Tom Hanks, will be released in May, and it's getting its share of advance publicity; 3) ""Da Vinci"" fanatics have been busily speculating about the subject of Brown's new novel, ""The Solomon Key,"" reportedly scheduled to be published late this year or early next year. Some cryptographers with too much time on their hands have supposedly figured out the new book's subject (the Freemasons?) by cracking clues planted on the cover of ""The Da Vinci Code.""

us,TENAFLY APPROVES SABBATH BOUNDARY,"After five years of legal battles, the leaders of Tenafly approved an agreement last Tuesday night that enables an eruv, a symbolic boundary for Orthodox Jews that allows them to do some work on the Sabbath, to remain in place. The agreement, which the Borough Council approved by a vote of 5-0, with one abstention, reimburses the Tenafly Eruv Association for $325,000 in court costs. The association set up the eruv in 2000 by placing plastic strips on utility poles, incorporating most of the borough's 4.4 square miles, but ran into opposition. The Borough Council voted to ban the eruv, citing an ordinance against putting posters or other objects on utility poles, and made plans to dismantle it. Council members feared that by allowing the association to put up the eruv, they would be seen as giving preferential treatment to a religious group, said William McClure, the borough attorney. Moreover, although the eruv association had the permission of the county and the utilities, the borough had not given its approval. And Mayor Peter S. Rustin said residents were concerned that the eruv would cause an influx of Orthodox Jews into the community, which has a population of 13,806. Some residents have expressed concerns that Orthodox Jews would change the character of the borough.",2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000

There was a sharp drop to No. 2, as ""Nanny McPhee"" (Universal), with Ms. Thompson, opened with $14.1 million in the United States; the film, which opened in Britain 15 weeks ago, has already taken in $35.8 million internationally. ""Underworld: Evolution"" (Sony), starring Kate Beckinsale as a vampire warrior, dropped to No. 3 in its second week, with $11.1 million in ticket sales bringing its total gross to $44.3 million.

Investors had anticipated Gazprom would join the index in February as the most heavily weighted stock, ahead of Samsung of South Korea. Investors sold shares based on news that the re-indexing would be delayed until May, said Leonid Mirzoan, an equity analyst at the Moscow office of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment banking firm. Morgan Stanley delayed the re-indexing because Gazprom was slow to increase the free float of its London-traded stock after a restriction on foreign ownership was lifted this year. Mr. Mirzoan blamed a regulatory glitch. Meanwhile, Gazprom, based in Moscow, reported a 67 percent jump in net profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30, largely because of rising natural gas prices. The company's net profit for the first nine months was $8 billion. ANDREW KRAMER (NYT)",2006-01-31T05:00:00+0000

""I'll try not to let you down,"" said Mr. Berlusconi, 69, who has been married for 16 years to a former film actress, Veronica Lario, 48, ""I promise you two and a half months of complete sexual abstinence until April 9."" The Italian press has been having a field day with the vow. Mr. Berlusconi is trailing his main challenger, Romano Prodi, in opinion polls. PETER KIEFER (NYT)",2006-01-31T05:00:00+0000

But CBS managed to win among households in Nielsen's estimates. In some parts of the country, CBS's broadcast of Tiger Woods's playoff victory in the Buick Invitational spilled into primetime and helped ""60 Minutes,"" but the ratings for the live event and the network's subsequent lineup were approximate. On ABC, ""Grey's Anatomy"" was the night's most-watched program despite its following a ""Housewives"" rerun. The comedic hospital soap opera, which will get a huge viewing platform next Sunday, when it is shown after the Super Bowl, drew an audience of 18.49 million. Earlier in the night on ABC, ""America's Funniest Home Videos,"" in its 16th season, delivered its best 18-to-49 ratings of the season and proved that 10.95 million viewers still know the show exists.

The company plans to use eight-passenger Sikorsky S-76 helicopters. Introductory fares are $139 each way and will eventually rise to $159. Flights will operate daily on the hour from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and land at the new American Airlines Terminal 9, Gate C43. Donal McSullivan, chief marketing officer for the company, said a major selling point was the eight-minute ride, as opposed to 90 minutes or more by taxi or car service. Initially, only American Airlines passengers will benefit from the one-stop heliport screening, but Mr. McSullivan said the company expected eventually to use secure vans to transfer passengers to other terminals. The company expects to expand service in April with flights between Kennedy and the East 34th Street Heliport, and to add service to and from La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports later this year.",2006-01-31T05:00:00+0000

In one scheme, prosecutors said, pornographic Internet sites were used to illegally bill people's credit cards. The judge, Carol Bagley Amon, could have sentenced the man, Richard Martino, 46, of Harrison, N.Y., to 10 years in prison, but after listening to one of his lawyers detail his charitable works, she pronounced the lesser sentence. The sentence will run concurrently with a 57-month term from a related case in Missouri. Mr. Martino has paid $8.1 million of a total of $15 million in forfeitures in the cases. In February, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion. Visitors to the Internet sites were asked to provide their credit card numbers as proof of age, but each card was then illegally billed a small amount, roughly $30. WILLIAM K.
