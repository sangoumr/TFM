He was awarded a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering by the University of Michigan in 1937 and an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1938. He was an executive engineer at Budd Wheel Company, 1938-1950, where he helped design the first automotive disc brakes and the first anti-lock brake skid control systems. More than 70 patents were granted in his name. From 1950-1964 he served at General Electric as Vice President and General Manager of Industrial Electronics. At GE, the businesses for which he was responsible created the first solid state electronic computer, the first automated bank check processing system-including magnetic character imprinting and high speed reading and sorting, and the first heart pacemakers. The mass flowmeter was invented for highperformance aircraft, managing fuel consumption on the supersonic Concorde where more than half the fuel is consumed on takeoff. In addition, computer-controlled electric generator stations were produced as well as numerical control systems for machine control and computer-aided design. From 1964-1980 he was President of General Signal Corporation.

No. 5 FLORIDA STATE  0-0  No. 23 at SOUTHERN CAL 0-0    Flordia State has too much experience and Southern California too far to come. As Coach John Robinson of the Trojans said, ''Our weapons could be pretty sharp by midseason.'' But not yet.   TV: ABC, 8:00 P.M.    No. 24 COLORADO STATE  1-0  No. 8  at COLORADO  0-0    Their first meeting when both are ranked. Colorado's veteran offense replaces Koy Detmer, a 3,000-yard passer last year, with John Hessler, a 2,000-yard passer in 1995.    No. 3  TENNESSEE  1-0      at U.C.L.A. 0-1    A passing battle between Peyton Manning of Tennessee (310 yards and three touchdowns against Washington State).  TV: ABC, 3:30 P.M.    OTHER GAMES    EAST    East Carolina (0-0)  at West Virginia (1-0)  Two strong running games. Amos Zereoue of West Virginia rushed for 174 yards last week, Scott Harley of East Carolina for 1,745 yards last season.  TV: ESPN, 12:30 P.M.    Marshall (0-1)  at Army (0-0)  Army returns only four starters on offense and one on defense. Marshall has an explosive receiver in 6-5 Randy Moss.    Boston College (0-0)  at Temple (0-1)  While other teams ease into the season against nonconference foes, Boston College starts with three Big East games.  TV: ABC, Noon    SOUTH    Indiana (0-0)  at No. 7 North Carolina (0-0)  North Carolina's sound offense and top defense should breeze over a team picked for last in the Big Ten.   TV: ESPN2, Noon    No. 21 Northwestern (1-0)  at Wake Forest (0-0)  Northwestern should be comfortable despite losing its best receiver, D'Wayne Bates, with a broken leg.    North Carolina State (1-0)  at Duke (0-0)  In upsetting Syracuse in overtime, State's Jamie Barnette passed for 279 yards plus the deciding 2-point conversion.    Southern Methodist (0-0)  at Mississippi (1-0)  Ole Miss fell a yard short of losing to Central Florida last week.    Kentucky (1-0)  at Mississippi State (1-0)  State must stop Tim Couch, who passed for 398 yards and four touchdowns against Louisville.    MIDWEST    Georgia Tech (0-0)  at No. 11 Notre Dame (0-0)  Bob Davie, Notre Dame's new coach, fears that his defensive front seven is too green. Not to worry.  TV: NBC, 2:30 P.M.    No. 21 Kansas State (0-0)  at Northern Illinois (0-1)  Kansas State should roll behind quarterback Michael Bishop, a junior-college transfer.    Wester Michigan (1-0)  at No. 25 Michigan State (0-0)  State has a good running game and a good defensive line, but little depth up front on offense or defense.    Texas Christian (0-0)  at Kansas (1-0)  The Kansas defense had two interceptions for touchdowns against Alabama-Birmingham.    SOUTHWEST    Syracuse (1-1)  at Oklahoma (0-1)  Coach Paul Pasqualoni is unsure how Syracuse will respond after that dreary loss to North Carolina State. As he said, ''Football, like life, is about 10 percent what happens and 90 percent how you react to it.''    Air Force (1-0)  at Rice (0-0)  Air Force beat Idaho on a late stop. Rice will be tougher.    MISMATCHES    Pittsburgh (1-0)  at No. 1 Penn State (1-0)  Pittsburgh won't share tapes of last week's victory against Southwestern Louisiana. It will make no difference.  TV: PPV, 3:30 P.M.    Central Michigan (1-0)  at No. 2 Florida (1-0)  Coach Steve Spurrier calls his Flordia team ''just a common, average, bottom-of-the-league bunch of guys right now.'' Not really.    Texas, El Paso (0-0)  at No. 10 Louisiana St. (0-0)  In last year's opener, Louisana State beat underdog Houston by a point. This time, the Tigers are five-touchdown favorites.    Rutgers (0-1)  at No. 12 Texas (0-0)  After a 59-19 beating by Virginia last week, linebacker Aaron Brady of Rutgers said, ''It's very discouraging. I felt a little bit of shame.''

us,Covered With Fur in the Naked City,"Canine New Yorkers are a lot like their human counterparts, as can be seen in NEW YORK DOGS (Chronicle, $14.95), a collection of photographs by Andrea Mohin, a staff photographer at The New York Times. For some, city life is all about career: the airport luggage inspectors, professional models, police detectives, arson investigators, guides, guards and trackers. For some, there is time for charity work: making an appearance at the A.S.P.C.A. walkathon in Central Park, for instance, or visiting the elderly at a Bronx nursing home. And of course there are layabouts, like Kiko, the soulful-eyed American Staffordshire terrier who spends his days on a stool at a Greenwich Village bar. The 55 black-and-white photographs reveal a preference for relatively large dogs (Rottweilers, German shepherds, Labrador mixes). This may leave cuteness addicts hungry for just one more Pomeranian in a backpack or the equivalent. They will like Dancer, a Chinese crested powder puff, relaxing on a chaise longue on a penthouse terrace. If Mohin's view has a flaw, it is that she sometimes makes a New York dog's life look a little better than it really is. Never mind what taste treat the English bulldog is desperately trying to reach in that silver chafing dish. How did he get into the buffet line at Tavern on the Green?

us,It's a God's Life,"He enters through the ear, then picks your brain. Hermes, that is -- the ancient Greek god of thieves and the hero of the German novelist Sten Nadolny's comic fable THE GOD OF IMPERTINENCE (Viking, $23.95). Hermes has spent over 2,000 years chained to a volcano, put there by his half-sibling super-rival Hephaestus, god of the forge. Freed, he must learn the ways of a world in which Zeus has retired to play golf, ''Thou shalt not'' has become the prevailing Western ethic and Hephaestus -- now the daemon of industry and technology -- rules by default. Hermes ''borrows'' a few psyches. He soon detects a dearth of fun in the new regime and tries to loosen things up. But Hephaestus co-opts him. So Hermes challenges him to a poker game, winner take the world. As translated by Breon Mitchell, Nadolny's spoof of modern civilization doesn't take itself too seriously, and we shouldn't either. (Otherwise we might be irked by the disposable characters and a plot that suggests the random movements of protozoa.) Think of it as post-modernist beach reading: Apollo channel surfing, Hermes discovering french fries and the trickster god taming the dogs of war: ''He lifted his staff again, and the stubble-faced androids sank to their knees.''

Arnold was a true friend of the Ryan Center, giving generously of his unparalleled wisdom and guidance as a member and officer of the Board of Directors for more than 25 years. With Arnold at the helm, the Ryan Center gained stature as a model community health center recognized by local, state and federal officials. In 1988, under Arnold's leadership, the Ryan Center successfully moved to its new, state of the art facility thus dramatically increasing the center's ability to serve the poor and uninsured. Throughout the struggling years of the community health center movement, Arnold was an inspiration to many by remaining faithful to his principles and never compromising his values. His dedication and lifelong commitment in improving the lives of impoverished minority populations has made an indelible contribution to community health centers across the country, and his warmth, enthusiasm, and kindness will be greatly missed by friends, colleagues, and the community. Our thoughts and love are with his wife, Hope; his son, Ryan; and his grandchildren, Tatiana, Tiye, and Jahi.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Conditions of Immortality,"Taking his lead from the historian Fernand Braudel, the scholar George Holmes portrays the Renaissance as an expression of urban life and the opportunities created by commercial imperialism: ''Brutality and exploitation make possible wealth and the prosperity of the city, where refinement encourages an original creativity.'' Holmes shows how the veneration of classical architecture and sculpture led to a new realism in painting and literature; how even an attempt to copy classical handwriting could contribute to the individualism we associate with the Renaissance; and how separate innovations in Florence, Venice, Bruges and Ghent touched and eventually joined to change the perceptions of the European mind, ''like a dye coming from one source being diffused through a lake.'' Holmes's fine selection of color reproductions in Renaissance (St. Martin's, $35) makes plain why so many of the period's finest works of art -- bold and often startling even today -- could not have been possible except ''where thinkers and artists were protected from the tyranny of ecclesiastical intolerance and princely despotism.'' He is especially good at conveying what is mysterious and cannot be explained in many Renaissance paintings and sculptures, and he makes somehow coherent, if not fully definable, the greatness of painters like Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael. His story concludes with Cervantes, Shakespeare and Rembrandt, who marked the fulfillment of Renaissance achievement just as the influence of the cities that fostered it was being lost to the growing power of monarchies that resulted from population growth and shifts in the trade routes. ''Through a long struggle of historical recovery and artistic inspiration,'' Holmes writes, ''the European mind has been reborn.'' David Walton",1997-09-14T05:00:00+0000

Saxony -- the state of which Dresden was, and is, the capital -- was among the largest and most powerful in the Holy Roman Empire, and its rulers, the Electors, took full advantage of that. Augustus II, the Strong, who reigned from 1694 to 1733, made the right alliances, fought at the right times in the right places and was elected King of Poland with Russian backing.

For those who do, it's true that the price of a salad has indeed remained constant over the course of the past 10 years. But here is where hidden inflation comes into play: For those of us who have left iceberg behind, the price of a salad has increased exponentially. There was a time when we subscribed to lettuces like Boston and bibb, but before long they were supplanted by other breeds of greens, each more exotic than the one before, and more expensive. First there was arugula, then radicchio, followed by mache and, more recently, mesclun -- each of which made its debut as a delicacy at the top of the charts and has since sunk to the level of ubiquity. It was frisee that ousted mesclun, precipitating its decline, and now mizuna, an upstart salad green from Asia, with darling pointy leaves and a bitter peppery taste, has gone frisee one better. Anyone whose appetite has followed this trajectory from iceberg (stable at an average of $1.19 a pound at D'Agostino) to mizuna (currently $9 a pound at Balducci's) has in effect experienced a 656 percent increase in the cost of a salad.",1997-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,On Language; Play's the Thing,"Inventing palindromes -- words or phrases that read the same coming or going -- has been a worthwhile way to waste an afternoon since at least the third century b.c., when Sotades created his first palindromic sonnet. It takes patience, but the results are often surprisingly rewarding. While the Internet has taken the fun out of some kinds of wordplay -- I recently discovered an instant anagram program; what a killjoy for Jumble aficionados! -- it has yet to encroach upon the creative side of palindrome making. Sometimes the best palindromes just appear out of thin air: Logophiles everywhere were as elated about the victory of ANUTA CATUNA in the New York City Marathon as they were saddened by the death of Mr. Shakur (TUPAC'S CAPUT). Before sharpening your pencil, study ''I Love Me, Vol. I'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill), by Michael Donner, a scintillating new encyclopedia of palindromic phrases. Donner takes a surprisingly scholarly approach to his subject, but the results are anything but serious. In it are such compelling examples of the art as slob MYSTIC ATE TACIT SYMBOLS and AH!

Mr. Surbeck was born October 8, 1902, in Jasper, Minnesota. He graduated first in his class from Yale Law School in 1927 and was selected to be Supreme Court Chief Justice William Howard Taft's law clerk. Two years later he became an associate of Hughes, Schurman & Dwight, where he researched law for future Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes. Surbeck became a partner in the firm in 1934 and, in 1937, a founding partner in the firm that would become Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP. Mr. Surbeck established a reputation as a master of developing legal theories. Among his highprofile clients were Alcoa, Ford Motor Company and Merck & Company. ''Homer was always a lawyer's lawyer,'' commented Robert J. Sisk, Hughes Hubbard's Chairman. ''Whenever a partner needed a workable legal theory to sustain a client's position, he or she would usually turn to Homer. All of us who had the privilege of working with Homer will miss him greatly.'' Dedicated to motivating students to better their lives, Mr. Surbeck gave close to 1,000 scholarships to those seeking higher education in many schools. His ''Success on the Job'' address was read into the Congressional Record in 1957. He was also the author of ''The Success Formula That Really Works'' (1986), now in its seventh printing. In 1963 South Dakota School of Mines, Homer's alma mater, named its new student center the ''Surbeck Center.'' In recent years Mr. Surbeck wrote and lectured on the topic of how to apply religious principles to daily living and was active in Dr. Norman Vincent Peale's Foundation for Christian Living.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction and Poetry; Phrasemaker in the City,"A mother's big hands are like ''careful shovels.'' A sprig of freesia is ''cake-smelling.'' A confused little girl feels her head ''is slivering on the inside.'' You're tempted to cull a glossary of phrases from DON'T ERASE ME (Houghton Mifflin, $20), Carolyn Ferrell's first collection of stories, but her book is much more than poetic plums. In fact, it's intimate in the way you used to hope a good book could be, until you were disappointed once too often by shock tactics masquerading as literature. Ferrell, formerly the director of a family literacy program in the South Bronx, deftly drops her readers into another world -- allowing us to eavesdrop on the inner life of the inner-city child. In ''Proper Library,'' for example, we meet Lorrie, short for Lawrence, a gay black teen-ager who has to ''keep on moving'' and ''trust my smart'' to get past the cruelty of others. ''Country of the Spread Out God'' offers great Jamaican patois (''I doan recinnize yu brash debbils,'' Auntie angrily tells the children she raised in America). It's also a he-said, she-said story of love unrequited and rechannelled. (''I want him to care enough to want to kill me,'' as the 16-year-old narrator puts it.) In ''Tiger-Frame Glasses,'' a girl named Glory weaves wish-it-were-so stories about her elementary school classmates, who are heart-twistingly mean to her in real life. (In Glory's fantasies, they ''was all big strong girl students'' who are ''Boy Smart'' and are ''always going round not hurting old people . . . but helping them.'') And then there's the title story, a diary working backward in time that traces one woman's road to becoming H.I.V. positive. As Glory observes elsewhere, ''Look for the genuine-ality of the thing.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; James Joyce Meets the Brothers Grimm,"The ''I'' of AN IRISH EYE (Viking, $22.95) is a 13-year-old orphan named Dervla O'Shannon, whose vaguely incredulous narrative voice is John Hawkes's sharpest success in this, his 16th novel. Readers, too, will be left somewhat incredulous that Hawkes is able to sustain the unique tilt of Dervla's speech for over 150 pages without veering into preciousness -- or, for that matter, taking a breath. Dervla's story rushes out in a headlong stream that, even accounting for her impetuous age, occasionally feels like James Joyce doing the brothers Grimm. The result is an engaging blend of genres and literary traditions -- from fairy tale to farce to the epistolary novel -- that ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque. Dervla's adventures begin when her delegation from St. Martha's Home for Foundling Girls troops over to the neighboring St. Clement's Home for Old Soldiers. There she meets the proud Corporal Stack, aging horseman and World War I veteran, and begins an improbable romance. Stack is somehow able to spring them both from captivity, but after ominously promising that ''I'll not lay a hand on you until you reach 16 years of age,'' he is promptly trampled when they are overtaken by a fox hunt. He disappears into convalescence at a decrepit manor house, where the mistress in charge (who is 16) dotes on him and enslaves Dervla. Yet her voice loses none of its resolve, deftly ushering readers through Hawkes's bizarre world -- and proving, in the process, that his ear is as good as his eye.

Transcending the photographer's role as professional voyeur, he became both an expert and an initiate in cults and religions of West Africa and the New World. PIERRE VERGER: The Go-Between, Photographs 1932-1962 (D.A.P., $65), a collaboration of Jean Loup Pivin and Pascal Martin Saint Leon with Verger, presents, for the first time, Verger's photos as a body of work, with images from West Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Asia. His photographs are neither the dusty field notes of an academic anthropologist nor the cool tableaux other photographers have used to picture the third world. Verger used his camera like an amorous hand -- exploring broad mouths and muscled torsos, fingering textiles and brushing the surfaces of bamboo walls and peeling stucco.

us,PROTO ORSON,"''Bright Lucifer,'' a lost play written by Orson Welles in his youth, gets a world premiere next weekend in Madison, Wis. ''Lost'' may be a stretch -- scholars have known about the drama for years, but ignored it. Welles planned to produce the play but abandoned that idea when Hollywood beckoned after his 1938 radio broadcast of ''The War of the Worlds.'' Set in northern Wisconsin, the play features a newspaperman and an actor debating big questions, a la: ''Thicker and quicker flows the force and tide of evil . . . wickedness whelms over good.'' It's hardly great art, but Jay Rath -- the play's producer and a local writer and part-time butcher -- figures true fans will give it some slack. ''Welles was working on this when he was 23, 11 years younger than I am now,'' he says. ''When you think about it, it's a bit frightening.''",1997-09-21T05:00:00+0000

He or she has merely handed you a $2 muffin and perhaps a ruinous cup of coffee and then rung them up on the register. Yet the plastic cup waits impatiently for an expression of your gratitude. A dollar bill or two juts suggestively over the rim -- no doubt placed there by the person behind the counter. Who would tip someone a dollar or more for pouring them a cup of coffee?

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Mother's Little Helper,"Justine Levy's first novel, THE RENDEZVOUS (Scribner, $22), is a story of obsessive love, longing and loss. While there is nothing special about the shape of the obsession, there is something special about its object: the lover is a child; the object of her obsession is her mother. The unnamed daughter, 18 years old, waits for her consistently inconsistent (and also nameless) mother for almost an entire day while sitting in a Paris cafe. As she waits, aware of the futility of her patience, she remembers. Her recollections are almost exclusively of her once-beautiful mother, a former model who had been on the cover of Vogue. Beguiling, seductive and dangerous, the mother promises and disappoints. Yet the daughter longs and hopes, even though her memories cover a range of neglect and abuse. She remembers her mother abandoning her, going to jail, using her to fetch drugs. The daughter reports these and other activities calmly: ''It's crazy how a little girl ends up finding the most scandalous situations normal.'' Despite her cry, ''I grow to hate you from loving you so much,'' the child remains faithful. Waiting and dreaming are her only ways of approaching her mother. She will never relinquish them, and the reader understands why. This slender book by the daughter of the noted philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, deftly translated by Lydia Davis, provides a devastating description of the fierce and firm grip of a young woman's love, a reminder that while it is painful to hope and be disappointed, it is more painful still to give up hoping.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Dear Mom and Dad: I Love Paris,"''My unbiased opinion is that my material is the best and that reviews will deal with my work in great detail.'' So the Hungarian-born, Paris-based photographer Brassai (1899-1984) wrote to his parents on Dec. 4, 1931. It had been barely a month since the best art-publishing house in Paris had agreed to publish ''Paris de Nuit,'' his collection of photographs of the city by night, and it would be another year until the book, which established his reputation as (in Henry Miller's words) ''the eye of Paris,'' would be published. But Brassai, at 32, was exultant with characteristic self-confidence. It was this indomitable faith in his abilities and his unconquerable optimism that carried him through the period covered in Brassai: Letters to my Parents (University of Chicago, $29.95), a delightful volume (published in Hungarian in 1980 and translated by Peter Laki and Barna Kantor) that collects the letters Brassai sent from his arrival in Berlin to study art at the age of 21 to when he fled Paris during the German invasion in 1940. The book provides a fascinating insight into how a bright individual slowly found his calling (he took his first photograph in March 1930). Although rich in anecdotes about endless struggles with money, food and lodging and in descriptions of the ''enormous and radiant magnetism'' of Paris and of the chic Parisian circles to which Brassai was invited, ''Letters to My Parents'' hardly mentions the artists and intellectuals -- from Picasso and Andre Breton to Man Ray and Jacques Prevert -- he befriended during those years. This omission makes perfect sense: what mattered most to his parents, Brassai knew, was that he could support himself and find himself as an artist. ''Oh, I await and fear the moment in which I will find my own voice, but also the place that will multiply it,'' Brassai wrote in December 1924, 10 months after arriving in the French capital.
