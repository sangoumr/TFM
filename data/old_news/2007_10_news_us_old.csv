Also down on ABC compared with last year were Brothers and Sisters at 10 (13.3 million) and the two-hour premiere of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition at 7 (11.7 million). Some of the year-to-year drop-off on these and other shows is attributed to increased DVR use, which Nielsen calculated has more than doubled since premiere week in 2006. Among adults 18 to 49, NBC finished a strong second with live Sunday Night Football coverage, followed by CBS and Fox, which tied for third. All of CBSs programming on the night, a 90-minute edition of 60 Minutes (12.8 million), featuring an interview with Justice Clarence Thomas, followed by Cold Case at 9 (13.6 million) and Shark at 10 (11.4 million), saw slight improvements over their season debut ratings a week ago.",2007-10-02T04:00:00+0000

The office of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is charged with failing to ensure that the public, and ultimately Mr. de Menezes, were not put at risk during the surveillance and pursuit of a suspected suicide bomber. After a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, prosecutors decided that no individual officers would be charged in connection with the killing. The prosecutor for the trial, Clare Montgomery, described a noisy and chaotic operations room on the morning of July 22, a day after five men tried to detonate backpacks filled with explosives on the London transit system.

us,East Coast Friars Win Legal Battle,"A long-running East Coast-West Coast Friars Club war has been won by the East Coast. Judge Otis D. Wright of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles ordered the Friars of Beverly Hills on Sept. 14 to stop using the Friars name by Oct. 15. The decision was a victory for the original Friars Club, a fraternal organization of entertainers founded in 1904 and situated in a six-story town house on East 55th Street in Manhattan. The New York Friars, a nonprofit organization, spent $300,000 in legal fees arguing that in 2004 after the pharmaceutical heir Darren Schaeffer bought the financially strapped West Coast outpost of the Friars Club, he transformed it from a nonprofit to a commercial operation and sought to exploit the Friars name. The Beverly Hills club, in a largely windowless building on Santa Monica Boulevard, was founded in 1947 by entertainers who had moved from New York. Its heyday was in the 1960s and 70s when hosts like Dean Martin and Milton Berle presided over roasts attended by Frank Sinatra, Don Rickles, Fred Astaire, Bob Newhart and others. Membership dwindled through the 1980s and 90s as the club fell into disrepair before Mr. Schaeffers efforts to rejuvenate its restaurant and attract private events. Contacted by phone yesterday, Mr. Schaeffer said he wasnt aware that the club, where he invested around $10 million and was listed as chief executive, had permanently lost its right to the Friars name. Freddie Roman, dean of the Friars Club in New York, said the victory allowed the club to protect its name. I feel very vindicated, he said, adding that he was now focused on endeavors like the Oct. 19 roast of the comedian Pat Cooper at the New York Hilton, with Lisa Lampanelli as toastmistress.",2007-10-03T04:00:00+0000

Today will also bring the release of Lisas Story: The Other Shoe, a collection of the strips comprising this years story line and that of 1999. The royalties from sales of the book will benefit the Lisas Legacy Fund for Cancer Research and Education, established by Mr. Batiuk and the University Hospitals Ireland Cancer Center in Cleveland.

Mr. Nowak was a 28-year veteran of the orchestra and had never been criticized for his playing, the commission said. An unnamed conductor who helped to have Mr. Nowak dismissed, the complaint said, had asked another orchestra member for advice on how to persuade older players to retire and said of them, Its time to go. The commission brought only 50 age discrimination lawsuits nationwide from October 2005 to September 2006 out of 16,548 complaints, a commission lawyer, Judy A. Keenan, said. We believe that this was an egregious violation of the statute, she said. Ms. Keenan said the commission had evidence of other cases in the Ballet Theater orchestra.

The victory will redefine the standard for an upset in college football in terms of the Vegas point spread, as Stanford entered the game as a 41-point underdog, according to The Associated Press.  The upset is indicative of the unpredictable tenor of this wild college football season, as this marks the second time in three weeks that that upset standard has been re-set, as Syracuse was a 36.5-point underdog at Louisville when it won there two weeks ago. And don't forget Appalachian State's shocking victory at Michigan to open the season.  One of the biggest story lines heading into the game was if U.S.C. Coach Pete Carroll would run up the score on Stanford as payback for a series of comments Stanford Coach Jim Harbaugh made this year to tweak Carroll.   Instead, Harbuagh's managed to get even further under Carroll's skin.   Coming into the game, the lone victory for Stanford (2-3) came against San Jose State, It was also playing without its starting quarterback, T.C. Ostrander. But the Cardinal backup Tavita Pritchard threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Mark Bradford on fourth-and-goal with 49 seconds remaining.   This will only increase the tension between Carroll and Harbaugh. The tiff started when Harbaugh openly speculated in The Los Angeles Times this spring that Carroll would be leaving U.S.C. after this season. (That caused Carroll to go on the defensive, as statements like that can damage recruiting.) Then, at Pac-10 media day, Harbaugh said that this U.S.C. team had was one of the best in the history of college football. Nothing ticks off a coach more than daunting praise.

us,The Talk: Dream Weavers," Modernism has not been kind to curtains. Le Corbusier damned them, along with cushions and other props of bourgeois prosperity. Mies, on the other hand, was a tyrannical curtainmeister: in some of his Lake Shore Drive apartments, in Chicago, residents are still obliged to use a gray, white or silver material to shade their floor-to-ceiling windows. By the time minimalism rolled around, fabric was at its nadir. For the textile industry, it must have felt like peddling fountain pens in the dawn of the computer age. Of course, there have been talented fabric designers all along, but the net effect of modernism has been to reduce our idea of textiles to a sea of nubby beige tweed. Now that decoration is no longer Satan in satin, the challenge is how to reinvent the possibilities  and ultimately the perception  of fabric in a modern setting. ",2007-10-07T04:00:00+0000

As Schlesinger told Al Gore during one of their mystical chats, when the historian was baffled at what Al was getting at, the lessons of history are ambiguous. ",2007-10-07T04:00:00+0000

The Mobile Art container, which is to roam the world from 2008 to 2010 bearing installations by 18 international artists. But the real showstopper is bound to be the container itself: a Zaha Hadid-designed U.F.O. made of gleaming-white fiberglass with a ring of interactive exhibition space inside. Lagerfeld dreamed up the project after a chance encounter with Hadid in the lobby of the Mercer Hotel in New York; impressed by the starchitects ability to detach herself from the totalitarianism of the Bauhaus, he hoped that together they could reinvent the notion of a gallery while creating a spectacle that would align Chanel with contemporary art and design. The projects curator, Fabrice Bousteau, calls it a research investment. Lagerfeld has already deemed it money well spent: We could have inundated the world with ads, he said. But it is a more noble project. ",2007-10-07T04:00:00+0000

Making Lindbergh's triumph all the more newsworthy was that he flew without a copilot, a radio, or even a front window for thirty-three and a half hours in a single-engine airplane made from wood, canvas, and piano wire. The New York Times showed its awe by devoting its first five pages to the dimple-chinned American's landing at Le Bourget, the dusty airfield where 100,000 Frenchmen-nearly all of them chanting ""Lan-Bairgh!

Writing with Paul Childs great-nephew, Julia recalls how she ate the most exciting meal of my life at a restaurant in Rouen on her first day in France in 1948, and where the road from Rouen led. Illustrated with 79 black-and-white photographs, many taken by Paul, the book is really a love story, Alan Riding said in the Book Review. Julia, who died at 91 in 2004, loved Paul Child ... she loved France; she loved French cooking; and she loved life. M. F. K. Fisher, who discovered French cooking 20 years before Julia, became one of Americas most stylish and sensual food writers before her death in 1992.

Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, a crucial participant in the anti-Hitler plot. Ms. Bitzer denied reports that the film had been sabotaged. It is a technical problem, as one often sees in the film world, she said. The authorities initially forbade the makers to film at the Bendler Block, now part of the German Defense Ministry and a memorial for anti-Nazi resistance fighters.

If you missed it, highlights of the Cowboys comeback can be seen here on NFL.com. The comparisons between Tony Romo and Brett Favre are already rampant, and Romo solidified the bond last night, according to Buck Harvey of the San Antonio News-Express. In full gunslinger mode, Romo was dreadful for all but the last four minutes, but he still managed to lead a game-winning drive when it mattered. The real star was kicker Nick Folk, who had to make a 53-yard field goal (his longest ever) twice to win the game because Bills Coach Dick Jauron called timeout right before the snap. The folks at AOL Fan House are calling for an end to that strategy, which has been used at the end of at least two other games this season. For the Bills, though, it was another demoralizing moment in a demoralizing season. ",2007-10-09T13:46:42+0000

(Photo by Koji Yamaguchi/Japanese Classic Car Show Association) More PhotosRecently I wrote about Brian Baker, an authority on the Honda S600 and S800 models, though his Honda expertise extends far beyond those little roadsters. Last weekend, Mr. Baker flew to California to attend the third Japanese Classic Car Show in Long Beach as a guest of Jay Leno.  As I wrote in the article, Mr. Leno had bought a Honda S600 a few months ago and hired Mr. Baker to help him obtain parts for the restoration, as well as to offer some technical advice. Mr. Leno was hoping to have the car finished in time for the car show.  That didn't happen. Instead, Mr. Leno drove his Mazda Cosmo Sport 110 to the event, which was held at the Queen Mary Event Park in Long Beach. According to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Leno acquired the Cosmo, which was produced from 1967 to 1972 and never imported to the United States, two years ago.  All of the cars at the Japanese Classic Car Show were pre-1985. Many of them, like Jay Leno's Cosmo and the Nissan Skyline, were never sold in America. Organizers told me that more than 350 cars were registered. I can believe it.  A 1969 Toyota Corolla was among hundreds on display in Long Beach. (Photo by Koji Yamaguchi/Japanese Classic Car Show Association) More Photos  The popularity of vintage Japanese cars has been growing over the past few years. I first noticed it around 2000, while I was the editor of an import tuning magazine in Los Angeles. During that time, I met a few middle-age shop owners who had their own stashes of older Japanese cars, mostly Datsun 240Zs, Datsun 510s, and Toyota Corollas. Since then, interest has spread beyond people who grew up with the cars to every age group.  There are Web sites, like Japanese Nostalgic Car, dedicated to vintage Japanese cars. Benjamin Hsu, who founded the site with his brother Dan, is 31. Dan is 25.   Mr. Hsu said that the trend is growing.   ""There are people who you would not expect to be into vintage Japanese cars,"" he said.  ""We were driving back from the Motoring J-Style show in the Bay Area to where we were staying in San Jose, and we drove past a 1977 Toyota Corona station wagon, slammed on Hayashi wheels,"" he said, referring to classic Japanese racing wheels produced in the 1970s.  ""We followed him for a while, until he stopped to meet up with another car, an '82 Corolla,"" Mr. Hsu said. ""We stopped to talk to them -- and they were 16-year-old kids. They had no idea there was a car show for classic Japanese cars 40 minutes away.""  This was the first year for Motoring J-Style, a Japanese car show organized by Martin Swig and his son, David. Martin Swig is known for his collection of vintage Alfa Romeos and for organizing vintage car rallies like the California Mille. And as a sign of the increasing value of Japanese vintage cars, the Motoring J-Style Web site offers regular market reports on prices of vintage Japanese car sales.  According to the Wall Street Journal article, Mazda USA recently purchased a Cosmo 110 for about $40,000, which Mr. Leno said was money well spent. ""The one thing the Europeans always had was heritage,"" he said. ""Now, for the first time, the Japanese have heritage.""  Need more proof?

VideoIt's like an epic ballet with a cast of thousands -- most of them oblivious to the grandeur of the event, focused on navigating their way to somewhere else.   My commute happily coincided with the morning sun streaming into the station through the east window. Each week, I shot a two-minute roll of film before rushing off to catch my train. Most of the film was shot with a 75-year-old 16 mm Bell and Howell Filmo, which was one of the first home movie cameras ever mass-marketed. There is a lot of this beautiful old camera's personality in this film. I used black-and-white because Grand Central is always black-and-white in my mind. This particular film has a very low sensitivity to light (A.S.A. 6) and is very contrast-y. The only way to make an exposure was to literally shoot the pools of window light. As people move through the light, it's almost as if they are sculpting it with their passing silhouettes.   The wonderfully dramatic music is by Shay Lynch. ",2007-10-10T13:19:38+0000

It could be argued that Schumacher was just so much better than most of his teammates that the team felt obliged to help him on a down day, knowing he would deliver in the end.) My point is that it is simply clear that Ferrari supported Schumacher over his teammates and did not worry about the concept of equality, whereas McLaren  which is being accused here and there of not treating both teammates equally  DOES value equality.",2007-10-10T20:30:41+0000

The professor, Robert E. Ferrell, had faced felony charges of mail and wire fraud in the case, which began in 2004 when the artist, Steven J. Kurtz, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, called 911 to report that his wife was not breathing. When the police arrived at their home, they found Mrs. Kurtz dead and discovered materials for a biologically based art exhibition. Medical examiners later determined that her death was not suspicious; she died of heart failure. But the federal government, arguing that public safety issues were involved, indicted Mr. Kurtz and Mr. Ferrell. The case has drawn widespread criticism from the art community and civil libertarians and is the subject of a recently released movie, Strange Culture. Mr. Ferrell has been ill with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and has suffered two strokes. In a statement, his daughter, Gentry Chandler Ferrell, said he had agreed to the plea in part because of health concerns.

One of the most pointed criticisms of Ms. Lessing came from Harold Bloom, the Yale professor and literary critic, who told The Associated Press, Although Ms. Lessing at the beginning of her writing career had a few admirable qualities, I find her work for the past 15 years quite unreadable. He went on to add that the prize is pure political correctness. Interestingly, Ms. Lessing had some strong thoughts about political correctness, thoughts she expressed in this adapted article, which appeared on the Op-Ed page on June 26, 1992.

Deng told Eggers (pictured below) his story of wandering from his ruined village through the war zone to resettlement camps and finally to the United States, where he found opportunity but not safety. With generous spirit and seemingly inexhaustible energy, Francine Prose wrote in the Book Review, Eggers transforms Dengs story into a novel with the imaginative sweep, the scope and, above all, the emotional power of an epic.

us,Ambition and Heroism,"Novel? Epic poem? Historical chronicle? War and Peace is all of that and, as they say, more. This is the third time Ive read it. The first was incollege for one of those loony world-lit survey courses: two weeks for Don Quixote, another two for Bleak House, etc. I missed so much of the novel; I remember skimming the war parts to get to the peace parts. The second time was right after 9/11, and the book just seemed like reportage: the generalized anxiety, the fragility, the terrifying ease with which the world can change. This time, (maybe its my post-Reading-Like-a-Writer phase) Ive been trying to figure out how Tolstoy does what he does, and what I cant get over is the almost reckless wildness of his ambition, the sheer nervy bravado of his technical competence. Anyone whos ever tried to write fiction knows how hard it is to introduce characters, one or two at a time. Even Dickens makes sure you get a character fixed in your mind before he moves on to the next one. But Tolstoy essentially starts the book, or at least the second chapter, by plunking you down in a room crowded with major and minor characters, all talking at once, then the action moves to another room filled with completely different characters, then another household, then the home of a dying man, a house in the country, then a battle. Deal with it. And the amazing thing is that the reader can keep it all sorted out  the identities, the familial relations, the histories and hopes and fears of a huge cast. Reading it feels a little like looking at a Velsquez and trying to figure out how he puts a few dots of white paint at the end of his brush, and bingo! a string of pearls just wills itself into being.",2007-10-14T13:38:58+0000

The Russian language I studied to work in Moscow was more functional than literary, and while my tutors dosed me with just enough Pushkin to nod appreciatively when Evgeny Onegin came up in conversation  more often than youd think  the master of Yasnaya Polyana was scarcely mentioned. (Although I was duly warned that Tolstoy, pronounced as we pronounce him in the West, means thick or fat, and could be appropriately used to describe War and Peace, but in Russian the writers name is pronounced with the emphasis at the back.) While Im owning up to my lack of qualifications, I should add that I have not written a literature term paper in 40 years, and that I have never participated in a book club.

So my thoughts on Sams question  How does Tolstoy do it?  are at this point derived from the first volume: a mere 295 pages. But it strikes me that one way Tolstoy humanizes and universalizes his characters is by refusing to treat them with reverence. He allows his major figures to speak and act foolishly, to be caught in moments of pettiness, cowardice, navet, humiliation. Examples abound, but one of my favorites in the first volume is the way Tolstoy treats Nikolai Rostovs puppy-love adoration of the tsar. Tolstoy himself was not immune to emperor-rapture, and it may well have been true, as he writes, that nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love with their tsar. But Count Nikolais devotion is portrayed as a paralyzing schoolboy crush  his bashful ecstasy before the beautiful visage of the young emperor, his detailed daydreams of dying in the rulers presence, and ultimately his juvenile terror and abject flight when the opportunity arises to approach his beloved. Tolstoy has made Rostov real by subjecting him to ridicule. I expect that in the pages to come Tolstoy, having whittled Rostov down to size in this way, will let him grow.",2007-10-18T11:12:02+0000

Experts have found that ink on a label identifying a portrait said to be of Shakespeare dates back to his time, The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported. The painting, right, was made by John Sanders, a Shakespearean-era actor born in 1576, and has been in the possession of Lloyd Sullivan, a retired Ottawa engineer, since his mother gave it to him in 1972. He has spent 15 years and an estimated $750,000 on tests to buttress his belief that the painting is the only true portrait of Shakespeare. On Wednesday Joseph Barabe, a forensic analyst for McCrone Associates of Chicago, said that the formula of the ink on a small handwritten label on the back of the Sanders painting certainly fits with manufacturing methods and materials from the first 50 or so years of 17th-century England. He said, I see all of the evidence kind of falling in the realm of authenticity  and I dont see any evidence coming forth that brings it into question. When the painting, dated 1603, was shown last year with five other Shakespeares in London, it was said that the sitter appeared far younger than the 39-year-old Shakespeare would have been.",2007-10-19T04:00:00+0000

The finding contradicts an earlier autopsy by a New Jersey pathologist, who had found the death directly related to ground zero dust, and revived the emotional debate over the care and treatment of 9/11 first responders.

us,Stray Questions for: Kay Ryan,"Kay Ryan (Photo: Jane Hirshfield)  Kay Ryan's most recent books of poems are ""The Niagara River"" and ""Say Uncle.""  What are you working on?   This is such a difficult question. Im not working on anything. Im almost never working on anything. Its an indefensible life. What I answer when people ask is that Im working on my next book."" They seem completely satisfied and never have any follow-up questions. It was just something they had to get out of the way.   Novelists have it good. I always think writing a novel must be like having this large knitting project youre working on. You have so much to do! Its going to take ages! You can pick it up, add a little and put it down. The comforting workbasket is always with you. Even if its something you do in little squares, you have the larger plan of hooking the squares together. Its going to be magnificent.  All this is naturally denied the writer of poems who is constantly drowning. Im sorry to have to change the metaphor away from yarn products but there simply isnt that cozy feeling about poem writing. Even if the poet has managed to build up a little island of words in the middle of the sea, stand up and take a couple breaths, the island immediately sinks and she is left treading open water again. Oh and plus, you can never build an island the way you built it last time. Thats a particularly cruel rule.  So, Im working on my next book.   How much time - if any - do you spend on the Web? Is it a distraction or a blessing?   I really dont spend much time on the Web, but occasionally I do look into something. For example, a few days ago a friend asked me if I would write a new mnemonic for the number of days in the months, so I looked up the Thirty days hath September rhyme. I found the whole history of its evolution from the middle ages. Who knew it was that old? At such times the Web feels like a blessing. But in general something in me protests that its too easy, and vastly too much. There were already too many connections among things.   Whose books are generally shelved next to yours in bookstores? How does it feel to be sitting between them?  I like the assumption of this question, that I am sitting between other poets on a shelf. That I am my book  or if its a really good bookstore  books. Because this is pitifully true. Sometimes I go to look for myself in inferior bookstores  at airports, say  and I find I dont exist. Sometimes my entire people does not exist. From the condition of not existing, I have no way of mustering the self importance necessary to bring myself into some future being by asking to speak with the book buyer. I am unpersoned. I can barely buy gum.  ",2007-10-19T14:37:45+0000

us,CMJ Music Marathon: A Few Reasons to Like We Are Wolves,"One reason to like We Are Wolves, a Canadian band that had its CMJ slot at the Annex on Thursday night, was that when the time came for the band to introduce itself, the bassist, Alex Ortiz, gamely and non-redundantly announced, We are We Are Wolves. Another is that the music isnt as one-trick retro as it might seem at first. The songs ride, invariably, on the nonstop eighth-note pulse that We Are Wolves learned from Kraftwerk and 1980s electropop; above it are Vincent Levesques analog synthesizer sounds. The bass-drum beat is programmed (as is some other percussion) since Antonin Marquis plays his drum and cymbals standing up. But Mr. Ortizs fuzzy, insistent bass lines stray across genre lines toward punk, while his hopped-up vocal interjections owe something to John Lydon of Public Image Limited and to the primal synth-pop provocateurs, Suicide. And songs like Teenage, Bats and Anthropology  a fondly remembered list of teenage activities  have lyrics that are more than rhythmic placeholders. While a certain archness is built into any new analog electrpop, We Are Wolves makes it not just a joke, but a good sweaty joke. ",2007-10-19T16:47:51+0000

Lawyers for the Friends of the Barnes Foundation, a community group, and for the government of Montgomery County, Pa., where the Barnes has been since its founding in the late 1920s, appeared before Judge Stanley R. Ott of the Montgomery County Orphans Court in Norristown, Pa., to request that he reopen the case. Judge Otts ruling permitted the foundation, which has struggled financially, to bypass the charter and bylaws of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, below in a portrait by Giorgio de Chirico, who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or moved from the walls of the galleries that he built for it in Merion, Pa. The judge said he considered the move the only viable alternative to save the Barnes from bankruptcy. But the opponents contend that there are now other alternatives. The county has offered to buy the foundations buildings and land for $50 million or more to keep the collection in place. Mark D. Schwartz, a lawyer for the Friends group, told the judge that very simply our position is that you were misled by the Barnes about its financial options before the 2004 decision, and he implored the judge to overturn his earlier decision immediately. Judge Ott declined and accused Mr. Schwartz of trying to play to the crowd that had packed the small courtroom.

Judge John F. Walker  of Federal District Court in Los Angeles acted on Thursday, four days before a scheduled hearing. The Norton Simon Foundation and Marie von Saher of Greenwich, Conn., each claimed ownership of the works, which the museums founder, Norton Simon, bought from an heir to the Stroganoff family in the mid-1970s. The Bolsheviks seized the panels from the Stroganoffs during the Russian Revolution, according to the museum. But Ms. von Saher, who last year won the return to her family of some 200 artworks from the Dutch government, claimed that the paintings had hung in a Ukrainian church and that the Soviets had merely lumped them in with the Stroganoff collection for sale at auction.

The space was originally underwritten by a $7 million gift from the Hermitage Development Trust, headed by the British financier Jacob Rothschild and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Yukos Oil Company. Mr. Khodorkovsky, once Russias richest man and a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin, is in a Siberian penal colony for tax evasion and fraud, charges that he has repeatedly denied. The closing follows strained relations between Britain and Russia over the radiation-poisoning murder in London in 2006 of Alexander Litvinenko, another critic of Mr. Putin and a former K.G.B. agent.

When I met with Chu last summer in Berkeley, the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which provides most of the water for Northern California, was at its lowest level in 20 years.

But as a work of art it feels unfocused, never quite drawing together its various threads but, in the end, simply relinquishing them.",2007-10-21T04:00:00+0000

Packed with fruit enzymes, beta carotene, antioxidants and minerals, its the kinder, gentler alternative to glycolic acid. The fruit sloughs off dead skin cells while treating the baby-fresh skin underneath to help prolong the glow. For a homemade treatment, Ciminelli suggests steaming the pumpkin, then peeling it and pulsing in a food processor. (Add yogurt and steamed prunes into the mix for a deeper exfoliation.)

I once fell in love with a man because he had no ambition, which I found refreshing. I am no better with things than with people. Ive purchased worthless exercise equipment advertised on late-night infomercials that take up more closet space than my clothes. I once bought a pair of silver sneakers that would look good only in space. I purchased a Marc Jacobs shirt with no buttons just because I got it for a really good price. I have yet to replace the buttons. I own a pair of Kelly-green corduroys. Need I say more? Although I am aware of my disability, I cant help but gravitate toward these Christian Dior shoes (above). They call to the Carmen Miranda in me. They are candy-apple red. They match nothing in my wardrobe. With that precarious heel, a tumble in these spine wranglers could lead to a life confined to a wheelchair. And what of the damage they can do to others? I will probably fall while walking down Fifth Avenue and, feet in the air, manage to gouge out the eye of a small child with the knifelike stiletto heel. It is one of Madonnas kids. Great.

When the St. Louis Cardinals wanted to trade Curt Flood to Philadelphia in 1969, the center fielder refused, even though the reserve clause allowed owners to buy and sell players as they liked. Flood sued, and while the Supreme Court upheld the reserve clause in 1972, public opinion turned against the owners, and other players took advantage of the opening Flood had created. Snyder situates Flood among the second generation of black ballplayers, who faced abuse away from the spotlight that had focused on Jackie Robinson. When Howard Cosell remarked that Floods salary was hardly slave wages, Flood retorted, A well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave. Snyder (pictured at right) is a sure-handed and meticulous guide who knows baseball and writes about the law engagingly and clearly, David Margolick said in the Book Review. Ira Berkow, a sports columnist for The New York Times, also writes about baseball in his memoir, FULL SWING: Hits, Runs and Errors in a Writers Life (Ivan R. Dee, $16.95).

So when Ruth Ramsey, the divorced 41-year-old mother who is the protagonist of Tom Perrottas new novel, The Abstinence Teacher, learns that her teenage daughter, Eliza (who could be a grumpy, pimply poster child for The Awkward Years), has concealed a book from her, shes not surprised. She must have kept it hidden in a drawer or under a mattress, she reflects  just as she herself once hid books like The Godfather and The Happy Hooker. But the book Eliza has been keeping under wraps is not a pulp fiction fable of vice and libertinage: its the Bible. And Eliza has yet another secret to spring on her mother: she and her little sister, Maggie, want to start going to church. To Ruth, a tolerant, progressive sex-ed teacher, her daughters embrace of Goody Two-Shoes Christianity comes as a slap in the face. I dont think youre a born-again, fundamentalist, evangelical, nut-job Christian, she tells Eliza, not imagining she would disagree. I believe in God, Eliza stubbornly replies.

Both writers sensed what made their subjects unique and managed to convey their enthusiasm, their privileged understanding, with vivacious brevity. Gerhardie arrived at the peak of his literary renown in the 1920s. His early novels were a dramatic and happily acknowledged influence on his young contemporaries: Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene and Anthony Powell. It was Gerhardie, known as the English Chekhov, who introduced the influence of the great Russian into 20th-century British literature, where it still potently lingers. The Chekhovian worldview and, most particularly, the Chekhovian sense of humor have been silently and hugely assimilated.

It was an autumn evening, the whole sky red above the sodden fields of turned earth. The fiery sunset promised a strong wind the next day; the crows were cawing. This large, icy house is full of draughts. They blew in from everywhere with the sharp, rich tang of autumn. My cousin Hlne and her daughter, Colette, were shivering beneath the shawls I'd lent them, cashmere shawls that had belonged to my mother. They asked how I could live in such a rat hole, just as they did every time they came to see me, and Colette, who is shortly to be married, spoke proudly of the charms of the Moulin-Neuf where she would soon be living, and ""where I hope to see you often, Cousin Silvio,"" she said. She looked at me with pity. I am old, poor and unmarried, holed up in a farmer's hovel in the middle of the woods. Everyone knows I've travelled, that I've worked my way through my inheritance. A prodigal son. By the time I got back to the place where I was born, even the fatted calf had waited for me for so long it had died of old age. Comparing their lot with mine, the Erards no doubt forgave me for borrowing money I had never returned and repeated, after their daughter, ""You live like an animal here, you poor dear.

The roster of writers and directorsthere are six of eachincludes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Pulitzer finalists, a Tony winner and all sorts of other award winners. Proceeds, I should add, go to Working Playground, a non-profit organization that brings arts programs to under-served schools.Heres a guide to what the next day will bring: at this point, the participants are arriving at the American Airlines Theater on 42nd Street to meet and will have their pictures taken. At 11 pm the writers will head over to the W Hotel, and write, in relative seclusion, until 6 am tomorrow. The directors will then show up and start reading scripts and choosing the ones they want to direct. At 8:30 the casts will show up at the theater and start rehearsals, which will go on all day.** If all goes well, the plays will be put on tomorrow night at 8 pm and then everyone will go to a big party.

Seeing it, he thought, Let others, the young ones, succumb afresh to this deception, but we know life  our life is over! Andrei had given up his hopes of joy in life until they were rekindled when he met Natasha.

us,Transcending Period and Place,"Well, its precisely that combination  the familiarity and the exoticism, the immersion in a particular historical period and the almost eerie modernity  that makes the novel so extraordinary and so engrossing. So many events and characters have contemporary, or near contemporary, counterparts. Pierres attraction to Masonry evokes, for me, all the longing and discontent that drove so many people in the 1960s and 70s to follow some goofy guru or other; every era (including ours) has its spiritual charlatans. Tolstoys characterization of Napoleon  the pettiness of his vanity, his shortsighted refusal to consider any views that dont mirror his own  is distressingly reminiscent of the absolute worst, and most dangerous, qualities of todays world leaders. The beautiful scene in which Andreis interest in the war and (by extension) his career is dwarfed by the pressures and terrors of caring for a sick child  variant versions of that are playing themselves out, at this moment, in homes and families everywhere. And yet, as we read the novel, we are constantly being reminded of how much has changed: everyday manners and mores, notions of female virtue and dishonor, the givens of class, status, family obligation. The duel has been replaced by the drive-by, and happily, its no longer taken for granted that sensible parents can, and actually should, auction off their marriageable daughter (or son, for that matter) to the wealthiest bidder.",2007-10-23T16:03:04+0000

us,Karma Rewards Ferrari Champion,"Kimi Raikkonen celebrating after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix. (Photo by Kerim Okten/European Pressphoto Association) More photos.When Kimi Raikkonen, racing for Ferrari, won the 2007 Formula One world championship on Sunday, it definitely had the feeling of karma finally coming back around for him -- although it took a while to develop. After qualifying on Saturday, Raikkonen sat third, behind Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton, who qualified first and second. Fernando Alonso was fourth. At that point, it wouldve been tough to believe in a Raikkonen title.  Then Hamilton made a big mistake. Fighting Alonso for position through the fourth corner, he braked late and ran wide, falling behind and tracking over the cross-grained curb. The two Ferraris pulled away with the lead.  I wasnt rooting against Hamilton. And I would have been thrilled with a Hamilton win. But deep down I was pulling for Raikkonen (even though I said it was unlikely that he'd take the title). Here's why:  Formula One is filled with conflicts of social guilt, which could be best illustrated by the fact that the championship came down to two teams that spend a combined $700 million each year  much of that going toward parts used in a single grand prix before being scrapped. By and large, Formula One drivers are coddled like precious show ponies. They spend more time thinking about the scruff of their facial growth and mutton chops than their fans, who shell out hundreds to watch them from afar. They lack emotion, speak only in clichs, and only a few sign autographs (and dont enjoy it). The ugliness spilled out this season reached a new peak, with the Ferrari-McLaren spy story and courtroom proceedings, backstabbing e-mails and ego wars.  Rooting for one multimillionaire cover-boy zombie over another makes me very self-aware of the indefensible nature of my support. Raikkonen has never been an easy guy to root for. He doesn't seem care for the history of Formula One. He's reclusive. And he speaks like a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica. But he's also one of the most naturally gifted drivers in the history of the sport. And one of the unluckiest. And deep down in the layers of chance and probability that factor into each sporting event and season, there lurked the slimmest of opportunities for karma to return some of what it took from Raikkonen over the past five years. How could you root against that?  *  Though Raikkonen was just two points from the title in 2003, everyone talks about 2004, his third season with McLaren, as the one that best symbolizes the rotten luck that would plague his racing career. Known for producing tremendously reliable racecars, McLaren lost its touch that year, and Raikkonen's engines kept going kablooey. In the first seven races, he only completed two. At Hockenheim he lost his rear wing while lapping at 180 m.p.h. The wing just detached from the car, a completely freak occurrence, a one-in-a-million malfunction from a team that never leaves its Tag Heuers unsynchronized. But still, it was Michael Schumachers year, as he won 15 out of 18 races and clinched the championship with four races remaining.   The following year, on the other hand, was definitely in Raikkonens reach.   Slide Show: Highlights of Kimi Raikkonen's Career  In 2005, Raikkonen had overcome some early misfortunes (bad tire valve, and bad tires in general) to contend for the championship. But while leading the European Grand Prix, he flat-spotted a tire while lapping Jacques Villeneuve. The tires irregular shape caused his suspension to vibrate excessively. These were the days of the single-tire rule, and Raikkonen wasnt allowed to stop for a tire change without suffering a penalty that would put him out of the points. The team decided to take a chance and left him out on the track. It almost worked. But on the final lap, the suspension failed, and he smashed into a tire wall. He lost the championship that year to Alonso by 21 points.   It looked like Raikkonen was on track for a similar outcome this season. His only DNFs were from mechanical problems. Heading into Brazil, he had more career wins than several world champions. Next year, he would have passed Stirling Moss as the driver with the most wins without a title. In other words, he was due for some good luck, but even with a strong start and a fast car, so many other things had to go right:  - First of all, he needed to win -- not necessarily a given in Brazil, where he had yet to win a grand prix.  - He needed Hamilton to finish sixth or worse. Hamilton ended the suspense early when he took the long way around turn four, after battling Alonso through the Senna Ss and the back straight. But by the second lap, Hamilton had already reclaimed several lost positions. He was definitely on the charge when his gearbox went on the blink, suddenly shifting to neutral and staying there for several seconds. There are reports that Hamilton says he accidentally thumbed the button for the start sequence (of course, McLaren has denied this), but whatever happened, Hamilton was 18th by the time his car recovered.  - In order for Hamilton to finish with less than four points, Raikkonen needed the BMW Saubers and Nico Rosbergs Williams-Toyota to stay between Hamilton and the three leaders. This meant that two young second-year drivers (Rosberg and Robert Kubica) needed to drive cleanly while fighting for position throughout the final stint of the race. It also meant that Rosbergs car had to stay together through an entire race, which didnt happen much this season.   - Massa had to finish second behind Raikkonen. In the post-race interview, Raikkonen said that the Ferraris were much faster than the rest of the field (and had more speed than they revealed in the race), so it probably wasnt that difficult for Massa to stay far ahead of Alonso. Even so, he nearly went off a few laps before the final pitstop but managed to recover after losing only several seconds.  (By the way, how upset did Felipe Massa look on the podium and in the post-race interview? If fact, he looked more upset than Raikkonen looked happy. Massa seemed to go out of his way to not congratulate Raikkonen, saying he was happy for the team instead. His lack of tact was made more striking when Fernando Alonso began his first statement by offering his congratulations. I can understand being disappointed, but not enough not to congratulate his teammate.)  - McLaren needs to lose its appeal against the stewards, which should be heard by the F.I.A. in a couple of weeks. At the end of the grand prix in Brazil, the stewards confiscated the two Sauber BMWs and Nico Rosbergs Williams to check for a fuel temperature violation. The results were inconclusive and no penalties were handed down. But McLaren has filed an appeal against the ruling. Should they win, it still isn't immediately evident that the F.I.A. would disqualify the three cars in question, which would take the championship away from Raikkonen and award it to Hamilton. Several drivers have spoken out against this result, including Hamilton, Alonso, and former driver Stirling Moss. But still, its Raikkonen were talking about, so anything can happen...

Berlins clever template for the discussion of great thinkers was, as the hyperliterates who have been participating in this discussion know better than I, The Hedgehog and the Fox. The hedgehog, in Berlins formulation, views the world through one great defining idea, a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate. To this category Berlin assigns Dante, Plato, Hegel, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Proust and others. The more intellectually promiscuous fox, in contrast, pursues many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, not joined by an overarching moral or aesthetic principle.

Tess Gallagher, Carvers widow, is spearheading an effort to have all 17 of the stories in that book published, unedited, in a new volume that she plans to call Beginners. The stories were radically edited and cut by Gordon Lish, then Carvers editor at Alfred A. Knopf. At the time, Carver tried to halt publication of the book, which cemented his literary reputation. Gary Fisketjon, Carvers editor at Knopf later in his career, is opposed to her plans, partly because Carver had the chance to restore some of the stories to their unedited form in later collections. Andrew Wylie, the agent representing Ms. Gallagher and Carvers literary estate in the effort to publish Beginners, said he and William L.

I mentioned in an earlier post that I read the novel right after 9/11, and I remember thinking that the scene in which Pierre sees the French cook being flogged as a spy reminded me of the ways in which innocent Muslims were being targeted. Once more, the book seems relevant to the current moment. I only wish that the battles Tolstoy describes sounded less like the war in Iraq. Obviously, the weaponry and technology are very different. Satellite communications have replaced those poor messengers galloping in with the bad news; missiles and tanks have taken the place of muskets and stallions. And the military strategists no longer (literally) stand on the hilltops watching all hell break loose on the plains below. But nearly everything else  the inequities, the dispositions of power, the costly mistakes and the inadequate responses to those mistakes, the bloodshed and chaos and misery  all that seems painfully familiar. Old Kotuzov dies in his bed, and Napoleon and the Tsar arent the ones being blown to bits at Borodino; young men were, and are still, taking the hit  so to speak  for the leaders who send them off to battle. Ive always thought that Tolstoys mini-essay, in Volume IV, on the difficulty of waging war against small, mobile, highly motivated bands of guerilla fighters should have been, and should be, required reading for everyone in the military, from rank and file soldiers to Pentagon planners, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense.

I think Tolstoy wrote like a hedgehog, but acted like a fox. My father, a Russian literature professor, has been corresponding with me during this panel (as have many of my friends, notably one who recently translated Zamyatins We, a book that should be more often read  at least as often as 1984, which seems to have won the totalitarian futuristic fable competition). My father reminded me that Tolstoy did not bring his Olympian understanding of human nature to his own family life  at least, according to his wife Sofia Andreevna. In her letters (now on display at American University, along with photos of Yasnaya Polyana, the Tolstoy estate), she complains about his need to be treated like a god, and not to be bothered by daily concerns.

us,Letters: Iraq Numbers,"Re The Reality in Iraq? Depends on Whos Counting (Oct. 7):I worked out of The New York Times Baghdad bureau from November 2003 to May 2007. One of the main points you addressed, how the military defines sectarian killings, has long been a major point of contention in Iraq.Reporters there have never had a clear picture of the military definition of the term. A question at the heart of the debate is whether the military counts bombing victims, including ones from the ubiquitous car bombs, when tallying deaths from sectarian violence. You cite a military manual that says the victims of such bombings should be counted.But while in Iraq, I found that in practice, the top commanders generally did not count deaths from bombings as sectarian killings, even though it is clear to even the most casual observer of the war that the bombings are motivated by sectarian and ethnic hatreds. Rocket and mortar attacks also were not counted.Instead, at least during my time in Iraq, American commanders usually counted only people shot dead as victims of sectarian violence. The reasons are obscure. Some critics of the military say the commanders might have done this because it would be easier at some point to prove a downward trend in violence if one looked only at victims killed in shootings, rather than victims killed in shootings and bombings. The American military and Shiite-led Iraqi government have yet to find a way of ending the horrific bombings carried out by Sunni Arab insurgents.Only once did a military officer articulate the militarys point of view on this issue to me. A top general in Baghdad told me the military had chosen to limit its definition of sectarian killings because it wanted to track specifically the type of violence that occurred by shooting, because some officers apparently believed that this type of killing, rather than bombings and projectile attacks, was a more accurate indicator of the level of Shiite-Sunni sectarian hatred out in the streets.Some critics have said that another reason for leaving bombings outside the definition of sectarian violence is directly related to the Bush administrations pronouncements on Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The military usually attributes large bombings to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and its spokesmen still claim that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is trying to ignite or inflame sectarian civil war in Iraq rather than acknowledging that the largely Sunni Arab group is a crucial player in one side of an already raging Iraqi civil war.As you noted in an earlier column, American officials have long sought to depict Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as an outside organization with close ties to Osama bin Laden that seeks to destroy the Sunni-Shiite relationship in Iraq. Actually, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a component of the Sunni-Shiite civil war, not an outside element. As you know, the reality is that a vast majority of members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia are Iraqi Sunnis who are trying to overthrow the Shiite-run Iraqi government.So critics of the military have asserted that the military has in practice sought to remove bombing victims from the definition of sectarian killings so that bomb attacks, and their victims, would not be seen as part of an Iraqi civil war. Rather, they would be counted as part of the terrorist actions done by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which military spokesmen and Bush administration officials have for years tried to portray as an outside force, not one that is part of the internal Iraqi dynamic.In other words, whether to count bombings when measuring sectarian violence has become embroiled in the politics of defining the main narrative of the Iraq war. Critics say the less the war looks like an internal civil war and the more it looks like a front in the global jihad movement or in the Western war against Islamo-fascism, the more the Bush administration can justify its policies and the continuing American military presence in Iraq.The bottom line is that car bombs and other types of bombings, as well as rocket and mortar attacks, are major tactics in the ethno-sectarian civil war that has been unfolding in Iraq for years, and should by anyones definition be counted as sectarian violence.Edward WongTaipei, Taiwan, Oct. 7, 2007Be it 1,654, 1,280 or 827, the number of Iraqi civilians being killed every month is a horrific tragedy. These numbers are actually human beings  mothers, fathers, sons and daughters  and this is not acceptable.Nor is the tragedy in this country acceptable  30,000 civilian deaths every year from gunshot wounds. Why isnt this number reported on a regular basis, along with the 65,000 wounded?The cost in dollars for medical care is about $15 billion annually and, the cost in human suffering is incalculable. If these figures were coming out of Iraq  2,500 Americans dead and more than 5,000 wounded a month  the war would be over. Why do we accept this casualty rate on our local streets with no discussion and little dismay while we (quite rightly) give at least some attention to civilian deaths in Iraq?Andrea CukorBerkeley, Calif., Oct. 8, 2007",2007-10-27T19:56:01+0000
us,"Letters:Questions and Answers, in No Particular Order","Re Questions and Answers, in No Particular Order (Oct. 14):As a writing instructor at a public university, Im always on the lookout for good interviews to use as models for my students to follow. While I use interviews from The Timess business and science sections, I do not use Deborah Solomons work. Her interviews routinely belabor her cleverness at the expense of her subjects.Her questionable methods come as no surprise. Such hostile questions and quips could hardly have elicited all the responses she claims. More disquieting to me as a Times reader, however, was the reaction of Gerald Marzorati, the editor of the magazine. I agree with your assessment that just because Ms. Solomons interviews are an entertainment doesnt mean she can disregard The Timess standards. Im left wondering if everything in the magazine is an entertainment.Nicole ArchambeauSanta Barbara, Calif., Oct. 16, 2007I had always believed that Questions For was a verbatim transcription of a brief interview. To find that it is Deborah Solomons willy-nilly editing of an hour-long conversation is something different. In the future, I will skip reading it. I dont consider it New York Times-quality reporting.Chris AltweggSeattle, Oct. 14, 2007What stuck me like a lightning bolt was your statement that the Questions For column is viewed by its writer and editors as entertainment.While I understand and appreciate the pressure that cable stations and Internet blogs impose on traditional news, the fact is that The New York Times has been the gold standard of newspapers because of the journalist standards that the paper has imposed on itself. If those standards are being abandoned, fine. But please, let us know that this is the case, that The Times is no better that the countless competitors online and in print.Richard DashefskyPhiladelphia, Pa., Oct. 15, 2007Deborah Solomons misquotation and self-promotion are exactly what reporters should never do.Her manipulations cast an extremely negative light on The Times, and make readers wonder: If the paper refuses to discipline a reporter who exaggerates and distorts trivial matters, how does it handle what is really important?Simon DeDeoChicago, Oct. 15, 2007You paint a dismaying portrait of the care with which the Times Magazines Questions For column is produced.Add to the criticisms the failure of the questioner Deborah Solomon or the Magazines editors to disclose, in a June 26, 2005, interview with Bruce Ratner, the Atlantic Yards developer and New Jersey Nets principal owner, that Mr. Ratners company was a development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters.Byron Calame, the public editor at the time, chastised The Times in his Web journal for the failure to disclose such ties, but no letter or disclosure was ever printed.Norman OderBrooklyn, Oct. 15, 2007The writer writes the Atlantic Yards Report, a blog devoted to the Atlantic Yards project.Thanks for raising some of the troubling issues surrounding quotations in The Times Magazine. This deals with one of the most important  but rarely discussed  challenges facing reporters and interviewers: how to capture the spoken word and put it in type.As a former newspaper journalist and longtime teacher of news writing, I know that we even have a tough time quoting material thats easy to look up and verify. (Consider the alterations to the iconic Vietnam-era utterance: It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.)You covered the issue of whether or not theres a protocol or manual for the handling of quotations. You mentioned The Timess Manual of Style and Usage, which is very clear on the topic. The Associated Presss style book has gone through changes over the past few decades and reads similarly. Frank HerronWinchester, Mass., Oct. 16, 2007The writer is an adjunct instructor of political science at UMass Boston.I have been appalled to see the inclusion of these bogus interviews. Deborah Solomons sole intent seems to be to skewer, disrespect, and hurt her subjects. Her columns are devoid of genuine content, at most reflecting the interviewees ability to respond gracefully to hostile sniping.It is no surprise that Ms. Solomon has been playing fast and loose with her questions and editing. Here is one loud plea for the magazine to drop Questions For entirely, with an apology to readers for having published it for so long.Lyn OppenheimFelton, Calif., Oct. 17, 2007For years, I have been uncomfortable reading the Questions For column. Now I know why.Usually the challenging questions read more like an attempt to trap the famous person. This may entertain some, but it doesnt work for me. In fact  even beyond not living up to The Timess standards  it is blatantly rude.Sharon AucoinNorth Andover, Mass., Oct. 15, 2007I agree with your view that the Deborah Solomon Questions For columns need a disclaimer noting that they are the result, frequently, of several different interviews or contacts, and that the order has been altered or new questions inserted for readability.I find many of her columns snarky and mean-spirited, and to realize that they are largely stitched together on her whim is even more disturbing. The magazines editors really have given way too much free rein here.Many of us were taught that quotes were sacrosanct, and use ellipses or brackets when we truncate or otherwise edit quoted material. I think its unfair to readers to pass off a crazy quilt of questions and answers as an interview, though what an accurate label should be isnt clear.

For them, its all about the period called the Hot Stove, and baseballs rumor-mad off-season really starts boiling at the annual winter meetings, in which league muckety-mucks congregate in a hotel to sit through slide shows, bounce around trade ideas and try to avoid late-night peccadilloes at the bar. From Dec. 3-6, the eyes of every obsessive baseball fan will be focused on the sprawling Gaylord Opryland in Nashville, where this years meeting will be held. Its the one time of year when everyone  the G.M. and his assistants, the agents and their lackeys, the scouts and their scotch  assembles in one place. The marquee event is the Rule 5 draft (in which teams select among players who have more than three years experience and are not on a teams 40-man roster), held on the final day and broadcast on MLB.com, though the more festive attendees are probably partial to the annual banquet, a formal affair that closes the meetings.

I cannot recall any of your reviewers being so angry at a public figure as to confess homicidal wishes. Now comes Midge Decter, whose review of Myra Friedmans book, Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin, has just reached me. It finds the behavior of a contemporary artist (the subject of the Friedman biography) so profoundly infuriating that one [i.e., Decter] would have been driven to throttle her on the spot. Your middle-aged, middle-class readership will love Midge Decters comments. She tells them what they wish to hear: the bad girl takes dope and comes to a bad end. ... To know who Janis Joplin was, says Midge Decter, is to know a good deal, if not indeed everything that matters about the epidemic of antic despair that carried off so many of our children in the late 1960s. What pretentious rot! ... I hope that Janis would like this letter better than The Timess review.

us,Conductor of the People,"In 2004, Gustavo Dudamel, who was then virtually unknown outside his native Venezuela, entered the first Gustav Mahler International Conducting Competition, for conductors under 35. One of the jurors in Bamberg, Germany, was Esa-Pekka Salonen, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. I arrived a bit later than the rest of the jury, and by the semifinals, there was already a lot of buzz about him, Salonen said. At 23, Dudamel was not only an unusually young contestant; this session with the Bamberg Symphony marked his first time conducting a professional orchestra. He seemed unfazed. You are young and inexperienced, but you should somehow create an aura of confidence and authority, Salonen explained to me recently. Gustavo is not concerned about authority. He is concerned about music, which is exactly the right approach. The orchestra gets seduced into playing well for him, rather than forced. After the prize was awarded to Dudamel, Salonen telephoned Deborah Borda, president of the L.A. Philharmonic. He says, Deborah, you wont believe this kid from Venezuela who won the competition,  Borda recounted to me. I said, Whats he like? He said: Hes a conducting animal.

He hit cleanup for his high school and I was guessing that he hadnt totally lost his stroke.So while I was at lunch with my Times colleagues Tyler Kepner and Ben Shpigel, and Mike Vaccaro and Joel Sherman of The New York Post, I predicted that Dice-K would get a hit. My prediction didnt cause a stir. No one stopped chewing. The waitress didnt write it down. But I wanted to have my thoughts on the record.Sure enough, when Matsuzaka batted in the third inning against Josh Fogg, he rapped a single into left field to drive in two runs.

us,Motorcycle Fantasyland in Tokyo,"Honda EVO6 (Photo by Jerry Garrett) More Photos  TOKYO -- Although most of the media focus at the 40th Tokyo Motor Show is on the three convention halls stuffed with the latest four-wheel dream machines, Tokyo is the only major auto show that also showcases motorcycles. They're over in a pulsating big top tent officially called the North Hall, but for bikers, it should be called Fantasyland -- something on the order of ""Blade Runner"" meets the mechanical bull scene in ""Urban Cowboy.""  Besides the eyeball-assaulting light show, music loud enough to make your ears bleed and models in go-go boots and vinyl minidresses, there is a full spectrum of new rides, from futuristic to retro.  Let's start at the Honda booth, where on one side, it's back to the future, and on the other, Jimmy Carter is president again: the CB1100F, to me, evokes great old Hondas like the CBX, albeit with fewer exhaust pipes. Others will see what they want to see, but either way, it's a beaut. The CB1100R (R for race) is about as '70s as shag carpet, monaural LPs and polyester pants. Great retro themes overall though, and certainly buildable.   Muscle Bike Party: the Honda EVO6 has some really outer-galaxy styling and it's coupled with a smart use of Honda's underutilized six-cylinder engine from the Gold Wing. Output in this format would be more than the Gold Wing's 118 horsepower. It looks like the styling department, however, ran out of time before they got to the rear of the bike.   The Suzukis are wild. Silent runner: the Crosscage is a fuel cell bike that really works; no gas engine at all. The powerplant is made by Intelligent Energy of the U.K., the same group that made the ENV fuel cell bike I tested -- and thought was viable even if it sounded like a U.F.O., not a bike. The Biplane supposedly has a V-4, but the show bike is most likely a make-believe mockup. Looks to be straight out of a video game. When will either Suzuki be produced? Right after the 12th of Never.  Suzuki Biplane concept (Photo by Robert Gilhooly/European Pressphoto Association) More Photos  Yamaha's Tesseract looks like it wound up on the cutting room floor from the ""Transformers"" movie. It has another one of those dreamweaver hybrid powerplants; the jury is out whether it would even be classified as a motorcycle. Would it look quite as cool with air bags, seatbelts and impact-resistant bumpers? I don't think so. It's kind of a grown-up version of one of those scooters for the ""help-I've-fallen-and-can't-get-up crowd."" Perfect for cruising supermarket aisles. A lot of showgoers cooed over the retro-classic Yamaha Sakura. A standard-style bike with an 1,100cc V-twin would generate a lot of showroom traffic, methinks.  Finally, at the Kawasaki stand, the Z1000 gets a new suspension layout that helps improve engine and exhaust placement; that, in turn, permitted some low- and mid-range performance gains. KZ also says this screamer has better suspension components and brakes. But the leaner, meaner ZX10R is the more significant new intro, now with 170-175 horsepower, thanks to dual fuel injectors on each cylinder. Compression ratio is up to -- yikes -- 12.7:1. Stand back when you fire that puppy up.   The Ninja ZX-14 had to be massaged to meet tighter emissions standards, especially in Europe, so Kawasaki engineers thought, ""Why not ratchet up that engine output while we're at it?"" Horsepower was already an unpublished number, but now, figure it has been bumped north of 180 at the rear wheel, 200 or more at the crankshaft. Last but far from least: A new 2-into-1 exhaust on the Ninja 250R perks up the engine; a new full fairing perks up its looks.  Important Note: Kawasaki was showing bikes they will produce; the competitors were showing daydreams they (and we) wish they could.  Google these bikes, or check out our slide show.

Now two City Council members, concerned about the number of plastic bags entering the New York City waste stream, say supermarkets should be required to take an active role in recycling them.City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn and Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. are proposing legislation today that would require grocery stores to collect, transport and recycle the bags.

Ms. Taylors father, an art dealer, bought the painting for her at auction in 1963. The painting, Vue de lAsile et de la Chapelle de Saint-Rmy, painted in 1889, had been sold by the estate of Alfred Wolf, a Jewish businessman who fled Germany in the 1930s. An earlier owner was Margarete Mauthner, another Jewish refugee; in 2003, four of Ms. Mauthners great-grandchildren wrote Ms. Taylor asserting that while the painting had not been confiscated by the Nazis, Ms. Mauthner had disposed of it under duress and they were entitled to its return under laws to deal with Holocaust-era restitution claims. Ms. Taylor refused, and the heirs sued the next year in Federal District Court in Los Angeles. The district court, noting that Ms. Taylors ownership of the painting had been publicized for decades, dismissed the suit as untimely. In addition, the court said, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act did not authorize private lawsuits. The ruling was upheld on appeal in May.",2007-10-30T04:00:00+0000

No, the Federal Reserve also worries about the price of tickets for Hannah Montana concerts, starring the 14-year-old Miley Cyrus, right. Writing on the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmonds Web site (richmondfed.org), Doug Campbell, an economist, addressed the furor over tickets with a face value of $26 and $56 that sell for hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars, prompting complaints from fans and their parents. To economists, this complaint misses the point, Mr. Campbell wrote of one of them. The ticket company didnt inflate the price; the forces of supply and demand did. He added, The more fundamental issue is that the promoters of the Hannah Montana series apparently havent priced tickets commensurate with the demand, opening the door to a secondary market with much higher prices. Mr. Campbell suggested that one solution would be a system in which a certain number of seats are auctioned off to the highest bidders, with the remaining ones sold for a flat price. This aids the promoter in not over- or underpricing tickets beforehand and more closely mimics a true market for high-valued seats.",2007-10-31T04:00:00+0000

us,Translation and Journalism,"The discussion this week of the translators art has made for a fascinating round, and has brought out some perceptive comments from readers. For a former foreign correspondent  and an editor with reporters dispersed around the globe  this is a discussion with decidedly extra-literary implications. While we try to assign correspondents overseas who are fluent in the relevant language, there is no way that a paper as serious about international news as The Times can operate without interpreters. Many, many interpreters. As a reporter, Ive worked with native interpreters of languages from Armenian to Zulu, and have come to believe that the craft of working with an interpreter is at least as important in our line of work as the mastery of languages. The obvious imperative in working with a translator is to get the facts right. (Witness the recent dispute over what Ahmadinejad actually said about gays during his speech at Columbia University.) But beyond that, its about getting the voice right. The quality of a translation goes not just to accuracy of detail or intent, not just to felicity of language, but to clarity, nuance and credibility. An intellectual who makes a powerful point in Polish or Pashto can sound less convincing in a clumsy translation. A good translation can convey the charisma of a rabble-rouser, the egotism of a tyrant, the wit of a poet, the heartbreak of a victim; a bad translation can deny us the sense of character.",2007-10-31T22:32:50+0000
