Therefore, American steel companies have been reducing their steelmaking capacity and investing elsewhere.

You ride down a twisting, rubble-strewn street, past the ruins of the once-luxurious Normandy Hotel. Soon, the hulks of crumblng buildings rise on either side of you, turning the road into a slender corridor. You sense, but usually do not see, the gunmen hiding within those ghostly buildings. You stop at a Syrian checkpoint, where, if luck is with you, a nod and a wave will signal you to continue on your way. You pass a dock; in the water nearby, rusted freighters lie on their sides. Driving on, you stay close to a line of cargo containers and away from the water's edge, where the snipers would have a better shot at you. Then, horn blaring to warn oncoming traffic, you drive through a dark and narrow abandoned cargo shed. When you re-emerge, you take a 90-degree turn that puts you, for the moment at least, in the clear.",1981-12-06T05:00:00+0000

Meyerhold himself appeared in a few ballets staged by Michel Fokine and other ballet choreographers and he collaborated with Fokine on a surprisingly wide range of productions. When he established his own experimental theater, the training system for his acting students included ballet and modern dance courses as well as his system of movement exercises known as Biomechanics. Like Konstantin Stanislavsky, his original mentor and against whom he rebelled, he was originally taken with Isadora Duncan in 1905. By the 1920's, his view that movement should reflect total control of the actor's body led him into a different opinion; ''The loose condition of a physically uncontrolled person (Duncanism) is inadmissable.''",1981-12-06T05:00:00+0000

us,STALKING THE ELUSIVE BARGAIN AIRFARE,"If air travelis involved in your last-minute holiday plans, you may be able to find a bargain fare, but don't count on it. To have any chance, act immediately. Many reduced-rate tickets must be purchased and reservations must be confirmed at least seven days before departure and often 14 days on domestic routes. On many flights, reduced-rate offerings are what the trade calls ''capacity controlled.'' This means that only a certain number of seats are available at that rate, and the airline keeps secret what that number is. There must be some, if the airline is advertising them, but that can be as few as five if the carrier feels it stands a good chance of selling the remaining seats at higher fares, or it can be 50 or more if the sales outlook is grim. It stands to reason, therefore, that at a time of peak travel, such as from Dec. 20 to 24 and Jan. 1 to 4, availability is likely to be at its lowest. Check all the airlines that fly the route you plan to use, or have a a travel agent do it for you. On some routes, fares and restrictions differ substantially among carriers. If you are lucky enough to find last-minute accommodations in a popular Caribbean or Mexican resort but are told by the airlines that all flights are full, ask your travel agent about packages. Some bare-bones packages obligate you to pay for nothing more than round-trip air transportation, transfers from and to the airport at your destination and a specified number of nights at a specified hotel, but they have the distinct holiday advantage of guaranteeing you an airline seat because the packager has reserved a block of them for his customers.",1981-12-06T05:00:00+0000

N.R.C. officials in the capital reject the argument as ''without merit.'' Some people closest to the abnormal events, such as Kay Pickering, staff coordinator with T.M.I. Alert, a volunteer community group near Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, contend in grim amusement that the lawsuit lays bare the rationale of the nuclear industry. ''They're saying 'It's up to you to catch us, and if you don't, you pay.' '' The General Public Utilities Corporation, however, argues that the commission, not the utility, was initially lax and could have prevented the accident. The T.M.I.

Six other former and current officials of the agency, including John G. deRoos, once its senior executive officer, were charged by the state with taking less generous gifts. The undercarriages of the new cars, prone to potentially hazardous cracks, require constant maintenance, one reason given by Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the T.A.'s parent), for what he concedes is ''lousy'' service. Meanwhile, Mayor Koch, an increasingly vocal critic of Mr. Ravitch's agency, has demanded more of a say in transit decisions, sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Ravitch.

Six years later the nonprofit arts organization is sponsoring a revival of the fanciful walkthrough show at Burlington House, Avenue of the Americas at 54th Street. Join Mayor Koch and artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg and Jules Feiffer at a gala benefit preview from 5:30 P.M. to 8:30 P.M. There'll be champagne and nibbles in addition to Mr. Grooms's comic-strip renderings of familiar sights. A Statue of Liberty sporting red platform shoes, for example. Two new works have been added: an oversize taxi and a tableau of the sale of Manhattan to the Dutch. Tickets for preview, $35. Sponsor tickets, $50, and patron tickets, $200, include dancing afterward at the Peppermint Lounge and a chance on an original Red Grooms drawing.

us,Pro Basketball Notebook Knick Reserves Providing Limited Help,"The Knicks are getting fewer points from the bottom half of their 12-man roster than most National Basketball Association teams. Mike Newlin, Marvin Webster, Reggie Carter, Larry Demic, Hollis Copeland and Alex Bradley are averaging a combined 25.6 points a game, compared with the 36.8 points that the Atlanta Hawks, the Knicks' opponent tonight, receive from their reserves. The figures are even worse over the last five games, a period in which the reserves combined for an average of only 14 points. Newlin shot 7 for 30 and scored only 14 points in that span. Webster has not played well, and Demic, Copeland and Bradley are getting little playing time. Carter, although he has played well as the reserve playmaker, is not a scorer. General Manager Eddie Donovan, concerned with the problem, has been talking with several teams about acquiring help. ''We have nothing imminent,'' Donovan said yesterday. ''It's very quiet in the marketplace. Nothing seems to be happening. I think that once one team makes a move, it might open things up a bit.'' Actually, the Knicks have little to offer, with Newlin in the worst slump of his 11-season career, and Webster off to a poor start. A possible bright spot could be Toby Knight if he meets his targeted return to the roster by Christmas Day. Knight averaged 16.6 points in 1978-79 and 19.1 the following season before he injured his knee in an exhibition game in September 1980. He has been sidelined since. Richie Adubato, the former Detroit Piston coach who is now scouting for the Atlanta Hawks, wrote in a recent report on Buck Williams, the Nets' 6-foot-8-inch rookie power forward: ''He gets great stats without anyone realizing it. He's all over the boards. Normally, when someone goes from college to the pros, it could be expected his shooting percentage would drop off some, but Buck's shooting continues around his college level. Although his shot is not a pretty one, he almost never takes a shot out of his range. He's much like Cedric Maxwell of the Celtics in that he knows his limitations and stays within them. He scores on a power layup or an offensive rebound, or shoots that 8-10-foot jumper. He takes only good percentage shots.'' Williams, who left the University of Maryland after his junior year, is averaging 15.6 points and 12.3 rebounds, and his shooting average is .565. The Los Angeles Lakers are the only team in the league that has started the same lineup in every game this season - Jamaal Wilkes and Mitch Kupchak, forwards; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, center, and a backcourt of Norm Nixon and Earvin (Magic) Johnson. The Lakers are 10-2, including five straight victories since Pat Riley replaced Paul Westhead as the coach. Westhead was 8-4. ... In the 959 games Abdul-Jabbar has played since he was the Milwaukee Bucks' top 1969 draft choice, he has has been limited to 10 points or less only four times. The first time he scored under 10 points was in his 508th game, on Jan. 9, 1976, when he got 8 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. He scored 8 points in two other games. The only time he was scoreless was on Oct. 17, 1977, when he ejected from the game in a punching incident with Kent Benson, then playing for the Bucks. Although the Dallas Mavericks are off to a 4-17 start, their plan of building through the college draft offers some encouragement. Mark Aguirre (23.6), Jay Vincent (12.2) and Rolando Blackman (11.9), all 1981 choices, have accounted for 46 percent of the 103.2 points Dallas has averaged. ... Red Auerbach, president and general manager of the Boston Celtics, said of Larry Bird: ''He does things to amaze me in every game, and I don't amaze easily''. ... Kyle Macy, filling in for Walt Davis in the Phoenix Suns' backcourt, is averaging 16.2 points. He is also second in the league in field-goal percentage (.923), third in 3-point baskets (12 for 27) and ninth in steals (2.2 a game).

us,HOME IMPROVEMENT,"Most wallcoverings can only be hung on relatively smooth walls that have few, if any, irregularities because even small bumps, cracks, and rough spots that are not smoothed out or filled in will show through on the finished job after the material is up. Now, however, there is a cushion-backed vinyl wallcovering available that can be put up over rough or irregular interior ''problem'' walls without having the irregularities in that wall show through on the finished surface. The cushion backing not only enables this vinyl material to bridge defects and cover rough spots, it also helps to absorb noise and even adds a certain amount of thermal insulation to that wall. Called Paris Wall, and distributed in this country (it is made in France) by Forbo North America, Inc., 218 W. Orange Street, Lancaster, Pa. 17603, it is sold through home centers and building supply outlets and has an embossed three-dimensional surface finish with a clear coating that makes it highly resistant to staining and exceptionally easy to clean. Suitable for use over such previously impossible-to-cover wall surfaces as cinder block, ceramic tile, grooved wood paneling and cracked plaster or drywall, Paris Wall is waterproof and fire resistant (it has a Class A fire rating), so it is particularly useful for renovating kitchen, bathroom and laundry room walls - as well as hallways, playrooms and similar areas which get hard wear. It can even be used inside bathroom tub/shower enclosures since water won't harm it (as long as seams are properly cemented down so water can't run behind it). In the kitchen you can use it on the backsplash area behind the stove or around the sink to create a soilresistant, easily cleaned surface that will withstand the hard wear these work areas are subject to. In addition, both Paris Wall and the special adhesive used to put it up are highly resistant to mildew, so there is no need to worry about installing it in places where frequent dampness can often cause problems with other wallcoverings. The material comes in rolls that measure 31-1/2 inches wide and 9-1/2 feet long - enough to cover about 20 square feet of wall area when you allow for the normal amount of waste. It sells for between $20 and $23 per roll (the easiest way to determine the number of rolls needed is to measure the area to be covered, then divide by 20). The special adhesive required will cover about 40 to 50 square feet per quart, so you will need about one quart of adhesive for every two rolls of material being hung. Seven patterns are available, in a total of 18 different colors or shades: there is a brick pattern that comes in four different colors, a floral design that looks like hand-painted tiles that also comes in four colors, three colors of a small hexagonal-shaped tile design, three pastel shades of a leaf pattern on random size rectangles, two shades of a semi-solid texture design, a tan colored cork design, and a tan-and-white design that looks like cane. The edges of each roll are factory trimmed, so strips can be neatly butted together as they are installed - the only trimming required is along the top and bottom of the wall. With normal care in installation, the seams will be almost invisible when the job is done, and since the adhesive is applied to the wall, rather than to the back of the wallcovering, putting the material up is in many ways even easier than putting up regular wallcoverings. You don't have fold or handle paste-covered long strips that tend to stick to everything they touch. Before hanging any wallcovering - including Paris Wall - all wax, dirt, dust and grease must be removed in order to insure good bond. Also, make certain that surface over which you are applying it is sound. Remove all loose or flaking paint, and remove all old wallpaper or other wallcoverings before you start to hang this new material. Otherwise when these materials let go, they may take the new material off with them. For the same reason, when putting the material up over a ceramic tile wall, make sure all tiles are solidly bonded to the wall and fill in any places where tiles are actually missing (Paris Wall will bridge minor imperfections, but very large cracksa and holes should be filled in or repaired before you start). Before hanging the first strip - usually in a corner - you have to establish a plumb (vertical) line as a guide by using a weighted string or plumb line. Drive a small nail into the wall up near the ceiling and 30 inches out from the corner, then coat the string with chalk by rubbing it with some chalk held in one hand. Tie the string to the nail, then tie a small weight to the bottom end. Let this hang till it stops swinging, then hold the bottom end of the string tight against the wall with one hand while you snap the stretched line against the wall with the other hand. This will leave a chalked line on the wall that will serve as a guide for the first strip. The wallcovering is 31-1/2 inches wide, so there will be 1-1/2 inches left to fold around the corner. Now cut the first roll of material to length, allowing an extra inch or so at the top to be trimmed off after the strip is hung. Then start applying the adhesive to the wall, using a short-nap paint roller and a roller pan. The adhesive must be allowed to dry until tacky before actually putting the material up. This takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes on most surfaces, but on glazed ceramic tile it may take up to 30 minutes for the adhesive to become tacky. The vinyl is then pressed into place so that its edge lines up with the chalked line on the wall. Smooth it into place so that the excess folds around the corner, but to insure a neat fold in the corner, you will have to score the back with a sharp knife (the kind that uses disposable razor-like blades is best for this). When scoring for this corner fold, do NOT cut all the way through to the face side, just score the back side. Fold the material back on itself so you can use a yardstick or similar straightedge to guide the knife when you do this. Smooth the material onto the wall with a regular wallpaper smoothing brush, working from the middle of the strip out to the edges with a series of up and down strokes that move diagonally out to the edges. Make sure there are no air bubbles left underneath, and bear in mind that if the strip is not accurately aligned you can pull it off and re-hang it. Excess adhesive that oozes out around the edges should be wiped off promptly with a wet sponge, after which the excess at the top can be trimmed off by using a straightedge and a knife along the ceiling line. Hang the second and subsequent rolls in the same manner, butting each one against the one previously installed.",1981-12-17T05:00:00+0000

Despite its popularity, and that includes five of Sigmund Romberg's best-loved melodies, ''The New Moon'' is rarely performed nowadays.

us,DEBATE: CAN 1940'S SHIPS PLAY A USEFUL PART IN THE 1980'S NAVY?,"CONGRESS voted an installment on President Reagan's program to ''rearm America'' last week. Like the program itself, it was hefty. Even before the inevitable supplemental bills that will provide for military pay raises and cost overruns (provision for both was omitted in last week's legislation, mostly for cosmetic reasons), the Pentagon's appropriation for 1982 weighs in at $199.7 billion, or $28 billion more than the fiscal 1981 year's level. That is the largest peacetime increase ever. And despite questions raised in the House and Senate all fall about the appropriateness of such a rise in a time of domestic stringency, it is less than a billion short of the President's revised request. Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who managed the bill, put it with restraint when he called the vote - 334 to 84 in the House, 93 to 4 in the Senate - a ''solid endorsement of the President's initiatives.''",1981-12-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Human Switchboard Offers 'Punk Classicism',"Since it first appeared in New York two and a half years ago, the Cleveland-based punk-rock group Human Switchboard has gained some fervent critical admirers. And at the Peppermint Lounge, where it played Thursday, it was easy to see why. Human Switchboard embodies what might be called ''punk classicism.'' The lineup of guitar, farfisa organ, bass and drums represents basic no-frills punk, with the cheesy-sounding farfisa the key textural element. The two-and three-chord tunes are brief, emotionally direct little slices of life. And vocally, Robert Pfeifer, the chief writer, lead singer and lead guitarist, echoes the sour intensity of punk godfather, Lou Reed. It was Human Switchboard's very orthodoxy and its slavish conformity to a minimal set of rules Thursday that made its music seem almost academically predictable. Human Switchboard's best tunes are its ballads, especially the extended set piece ''Refrigerator Door,'' in which Mr. Pfeifer's vocal resemblance to Mr. Reed becomes almost uncanny, and his sinuous, creeping guitar lines copy the style of Tom Verlaine. But there is a point, however, when being esthetically correct becomes less a matter of self-assertion than of artistic selfeffacement. Human Switchboard's performance seemed much too correct.",1981-12-21T05:00:00+0000

At the same time, bolstered by the spirit of feminism and by a better bargaining position that has been fostered by greater technical responsibilities and greater need for their services, nurses are making their demands with greater force. And, partly because they must, doctors and hospital administrators are beginning to pay attention. In an era when health care eats up nearly $1 of every $10 in the G.N.P., many nurses are receiving long overdue recognition in the form of higher wages and better work status.",1981-12-27T05:00:00+0000

If you were a musical chronicler in 1881, for instance, could you have known that one of the important events of that year was the birth on March 25 of a male infant in Nagyszentmiklos, Hungary? Hardly. But that's the way it was. And as a result, one of the highlights of 1981 turned out to be the celebration of Bela Bartok's centenary. Some of the celebrating, predictably, was perfunctory enough - we were awash for awhile in performances of the Concerto for Orchestra and we had not one but two mediocre concert versions of the opera ''Bluebeard's Castle.''

They are best known for their rock-and-roll ballads ''Stay in My Corner'' and ''Oh What a Night.'' This quintet's modified gospel harmonic style is synonomous with the somewhat mournful Chicago doowop sound that they, along with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions, helped pioneer in the mid-1950's. Doowop isn't easily updated, however, and the live versions of the Dells' biggest hits couldn't touch the originals in plaintiveness. Still, the quintet's harmonies were at least precise, with John Carter's very dry falsetto cutting keenly against Marvin Junior's husky baritone. The material, however, was not well served by the horn-heavy pop-funk arrangements of the group's band. The beauty of doowop has always been in the rapturous ethereality of its vocal sound. Orchestrated with any but the lightest touch, it becomes lounge music. This is what the Dells offered - a pleasant, genial, but hardly memorable retrospective.",1981-12-27T05:00:00+0000

A major concern among Polish officials was that the American action would further reduce Poland's living standard, leading to extensive unemployment and social unrest and prolongation of martial law.

us,Briefing,"A T a time when David A. Stockman, the Budget Director, is one of the most visible figures in Government, it is not surprising that there should be a newsletter devoted entirely to chronicling the thrusts, parries, maneuvers and feints of the Office of Management and Budget. And on Friday an outfit called Inside Washington Publishers, which already produces two newsletters from the capital, will be publishing the first edition of ''Inside O.M.B.'' The birth of the publication is, in part, a measure of how Mr. Stockman has placed his agency at the center of the controversies that have swirled around the Reagan Administration. ''The implications of what the O.M.B. does touches every aspect of society,'' says Alan Sosenko, chief editor of the publication, which, like most newsletters asserting that they provide an insider's look at Government, carries a steep price tag - $295 a year. Meanwhile, Mr. Sosenko promises that his newsletter will not be devoted exclusively to the doings of Mr. Stockman, whose musings about Reaganomics caused such a sensation when they appeared in The Atlantic Monthly late this autumn. ''I don't know how long David Stockman will be at O.M.B.,'' he says of the man on the bucking Trojan Horse, ''but we expect to be in business for a long, long time.''",1981-12-31T05:00:00+0000
