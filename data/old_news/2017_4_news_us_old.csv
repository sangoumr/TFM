us,One Photographer Spent 25 Years Documenting Wealth,"Lauren Greenfield (who may be most well known for her 2012 documentary The Queen of Versailles) has been documenting American wealth since 1992, when she began taking pictures of students at her old high school in Santa Monica. Despite the dramatic divisions in the city revealed by the L.A. riots ... rich kids and poor kids had found common ground that their parents had not, and it was a shared love for Versace, she writes in Generation Wealth, her new book. With a golden cover and 650-odd images inside, the volume is a sociological record of the extreme measures taken to acquire and spend money, what Greenfield calls the influence of affluence. One shot shows Tupac at the craps table in Vegas, another, a Chinese billionaires replica of the White House. Some of the photographs will go on view this weekend in a show of Greenfields work at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, and are set to land in New York this fall, around the release of her next documentary. All of this output suggests a longstanding clarity of purpose, but Greenfield says it wasnt until the financial crisis of 2008 (which she calls a morality tale) that she realized the underlying theme uniting her work. Its not about Birkin bags or the Kardashians, she says. Its about the culture that gave rise to them.",2017-04-07T18:44:56+0000

Is That the Best Way to Understand Everything Else, Too?","In 1990, when computers were still merely in the process of taking over the world, John Daugman, a computer scientist and researcher at Harvard University, published an article titled Brain Metaphor and Brain Theory, noting a habit he had observed among his peers. Invariably, he wrote, the explanatory metaphors of a given era incorporate the devices and the spectacles of the day. In other words: We describe everything as if it were technology. The metaphors we use to talk about brains and minds struck Daugman as especially susceptible. The technology that Greeks and Romans developed for pumping water, for instance, underpinned their theories of the four humors and the pneumatic soul. Later, during the Enlightenment, clockwork mechanisms left their imprint on materialist arguments that man was only a sophisticated machine. And as of 1990, it was concepts from computing that explained us to ourselves: Todays embrace of the computational metaphor in the cognitive and neural sciences is so widespread and automatic that it begins to appear less like an innovative leap than like a bandwagon phenomenon, he wrote. There is a tendency to rephrase every assertion about mind or brains in computational terms.",2017-04-11T09:00:05+0000

Viewed alongside each other, the works reveal a striking coherence of form. Take Bourgeoiss Echo I, a sweatshirt turned inside out, stretched vertically from sleeve to sleeve and cast in bronze, next to a drapey Kawakubo knit wool dress with elongated sleeves bundled at the wrists. The works also share a preoccupation with psychology and the passing of time. For Bourgeois, clothes were tokens of the past, a place she often returned to; accompanying the installation will be a recording of Bourgeois, in her 90s, singing songs from her girlhood. Meanwhile, Dennis Freedman, the former Barneys creative director who conceived of the project, talks of the profundity of watching the Comme des Garons fall 2015 show: They narrowed the runway so the models had to turn and face each other before going their separate ways, he says.

The map imagined the city in the year 2072, after 60 years of rapid sea-level rise totaling 200 feet. At present, San Francisco is a roughly square-shaped, peninsular city. But on the map, it is severed clean from the mainland and shaved into a long, fat smudge. The shape of the land resembles a sea bird diving underwater for prey, with odd bays chewing into the coastlines and, farther out, a sprawl of bulging and wispy islands that used to be hills. If you lived in San Francisco, it was a map of where you already were and, simultaneously, where you worried you might be heading.

us,How a Warming Planet Drives Human Migration,"Climate change is not equally felt across the globe, and neither are its longer term consequences. This map overlays human turmoil  represented here by United Nations data on nearly 64 million persons of concern, whose numbers have tripled since 2005  with climate turmoil, represented by data from NASAs Common Sense Climate Index. The correlation is striking. Climate change is a threat multiplier: It contributes to economic and political instability and also worsens the effects. It propels sudden-onset disasters like floods and storms and slow-onset disasters like drought and desertification; those disasters contribute to failed crops, famine and overcrowded urban centers; those crises inflame political unrest and worsen the impacts of war, which leads to even more displacement. There is no internationally recognized legal definition for environmental migrants or climate refugees, so there is no formal reckoning of how many have left their homes because climate change has made their lives or livelihoods untenable. In a 2010 Gallup World Poll, though, about 12 percent of respondents  representing a total of 500 million adults  said severe environmental problems would require them to move within the next five years.",2017-04-19T09:00:04+0000

At first glance, they would appear to hail from distant planets. Yet once they met in Paris in 1928, they enjoyed an unusually close and mutually beneficial friendship that lasted until Calders death in 1976. With other artistic pairs, like Pissarro and Czanne or Picasso and Braque, competitiveness ignited and acrimony at times soured the creative ferment. But Mir and Calder unfailingly championed and nourished each others work. A principle that Calder applied to his art could also describe their relationship: Disparity in form, color, size, weight, motion, is what makes a composition.",2017-04-20T09:00:42+0000

A quarter the size of Nantucket, it is thoroughly given over to the petrochemical industry, so crowded with spindly cracking towers and squat oil-storage tanks that the landscape is a blur of brand names  BASF, AkzoNobel, Exxon Mobil, Vopak. One of the islands most distinctive features, though, remains hidden: the Jurong Rock Caverns, which hold 126 million gallons of crude oil. To get there, you ride an industrial elevator more than 325 feet into the earth, and that brings you to the operations tunnel, a curving space as lofty as a cathedral. It is so long that workers get around on bicycles. Safety goggles mist up with the heat and the humidity; the rock walls, wet from dripping water, look so soft they might have been scooped out of chocolate ice cream. This is as far as anyone  even the workers  can go. The caverns themselves are an additional 100 feet beneath the ocean: two sealed cylindrical vaults, extending away from Jurong. They opened for business in 2014. Next year, three new vaults will be ready. Then, if all goes according to plan, there will be six more.",2017-04-20T09:00:55+0000

A confused Bradley heard cheers in the crowd, and when someone told him why  the opponent had just lost by fewer points and beat the spread predicted by oddsmakers  his eyes were opened to the sordid callousness of the gambling world.

Boorstin wrote in his landmark 1961 book THE IMAGE: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America, fame, which had once been based largely on achievement or on high birth, was becoming more a matter of a person who is known for his well-knownness. And the Stork Club was the temple of the high priest of this new cult of fame for fames sake, the columnist and broadcaster Walter Winchell, who presided over a mlange of stars, athletes, politicians and the merely notable from the clubs Table 50. In Winchells reporting, The death of ten thousand people in Ethiopia was followed immediately by a Hollywood divorce or romance, Neal Gabler wrote in his brilliant 1994 biography WINCHELL: Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity. Dozens of these items raced past listeners each program, not only abutting one another but most given the same urgency and drama. Nothing was differentiated. Winchells reach was enormous.

Lincoln was living in Harlem in 1962 when she helped to establish the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage. Her 1966 essay Who Will Revere the Black Woman? has been reprinted in various collections over the years. But her music lives the fullest afterlife. Lincolns tart drawl earned comparisons to Billie Holiday, but she matched it with a deep, bridling intensity that refused to be displaced.

us,Why Pictures Now: Louise Lawlers Examination of the Art World Comes to MoMA,"Why Pictures Now, a career survey of the New York artist Louise Lawler, has been a long time coming to the Museum of Modern Art. Ms. Lawler was a part of the so-called Pictures Generation of the late 1970s, a group of artists who appropriated images from popular culture to consider the mechanisms of value production. She was in some ways the least noticed of the group because she addressed the emperors-clothes aspect of art through the least showy filter: She simply took photographs of objects in museums, auction houses and private collections, and revealed them to be the pricey bric-a-brac that they are. Built into her work was a view of arts fragility  and a sense of our own, which keeps us attached to it. But what does the market care? Its never been less fragile, and with this MoMA survey, which opens on Sunday, April 30, one of its most astute critics becomes one of the seasons brightest stars.

When Comme des Garons made its Paris Fashion Week debut in 1981, the clothes drew attention in their absolute absence of color  an impression that was underlined by interviews with Kawakubo, herself invariably dressed in blacks. Note the plural: Kawakubo used so much, it was possible to see shades and nuances of black in her collections. She wasnt the first to design in black, of course  Chanel transformed it from a color of mourning into a color of fashion in the 1920s, with her little black dresses, and designers had used it ever since. But by the 1980s, it had fallen out of favor with the rising preference for flashier colors  the brilliant pinks and greens of Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler  and the greiges and navies of Giorgio Armani. Black had never been used with Kawakubos severity and insistence  shes used the word strength to describe the color. But in 1988, Kawakubo seemed to abruptly change course: She showed a fall collection dominated by rich scarlet. The thought process behind the decision? Red is black, she said at the time. Kawakubos challenge to color  and perhaps, as the French theorist Jean Baudrillard reasoned, to the idea of women sporting loud hues being transformed into objects  is one of the most important fashion statements of the late 20th century.
