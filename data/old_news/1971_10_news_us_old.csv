us,The Screen: Matthau Portrays 'Kotch' in Lemmon's Debut as Director:A Garrulous Old Man Aids Unwed Mother Young Woman Played by Deborah Winters,"The best, or, at least, the most interesting comedy usually has to do with a person in a situation of such fearful desperation that he can only recognize it at the risk of his sanity. It can be physical comedy (Harold Lloyd, hanging onto the hands of a clock, 50 floors above the street in ""Safety Last""), or poetic comedy (Antoine Doinel, coping, rather badly, with a bourgeoise marriage in ""Bed and Board""), or satiric comedy (George Segal accepting with good grace the fact that he can't scare his mother to death in ""Where's Poppa?"").In extreme situations, these films seem to say, gallantry is the only recourse, as well as the only solution.There is, however, another kind of comedy, which, because it is less rigorous, is more reassuring and much more popular, epecially on television. This is the comedy that places a person in a situation that really isn't desperate at all, although the person reacts to it in desperate ways. At its most ridiculous, it's Lucille Ball disguising herself as her own maid to fool a bill collector who really wants to return some money. These are comedies for which there are always solutions.""Kotch,"" the first film to be directed by Jack Lemmon, takes what is essentially a desperate situationwhat to do with a lonely, garrulous old man who is a nuisance to his son and daughter-in-lawand transform it into a nice, sentimental Life-Can-Be-Beautiful comedy of the second order. It's theme song is called ""Life Is What You Make It,"" which is about as equivocal as the movie ever gets.It's apparent, quite early in the film, that Kotch (Walter Matthau) is not fit material for one of those euphemistically designated retirement homes his son and daughter-in-law try to dump him into.Although he is supposed to be in his 70's, he is athletic in his movements and his hair is so fakely white that I never believed for a moment that he was more than 50. He has $15,000 or $20,000 in the bank. Children love him. He has a writer's enthusiasm for words (a babysitter is a ""teenage mercenary""), and he is more than a match for all of the plastic people who come up against him (his daughter-in-law, a park police officer, a humorless psychologist).How the old man finds new happinessmostly by seeing a sweet, unwed mother through her pregnancy (right through her delivery, in fact, in the ladies room of a filling station)is the awfully lovable substance of a movie that mistakes sentimentality for gallantry.Matthau, who is a fine, un-tricky actor, plays old Kotch with as few affectations as can be allowed by a film that pretends to an innocence it never has. I also liked Deborah Winters as the pregnant teenager he befriends, but Felicia Farr, Charles Aidman and all the other cast members never have an opportunity to be more than the situation-comedy stereotypes they were obviously meant to be.Lemmon's ability as a director must be judged, I think, as much by the material with which he chose to make his debut, as by the end product. Both are so unadventurous as to be downright depressing.""Kotch"" opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, which, for the duration of this run, becomes the world's most gigantic television set.",1971-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,White and Black Play the 'Skin Game' in Film,"Despite a theme that is expressed usually in terms of ponderous imponderables, Paul Bogart's ""Skin Game,"" which opened yesterday at Loew's State 1 and Loew's Cine, is a race-relations comedy that really means to be about how people relate to one another.It isn't a very consistant movie, and its comedy misses much more often than it hits. But it is at least willing to kid the weightiest of its issues, and sometimes it' is pretty funny, and it is never so dully dishonest as to pretend to any pieties it hasn't earned.Its heroes are a white man (James Garner) and a black man (Lou Gossett) who at a time not long before the Civil War wander around the South playing master and slave in a fairly profitable game in which Garner auctions off Gossett, pockets the cash, and then secretly frees his pal so he can sell him all over again at the next town they come across.The two men are equals, buddies, who enjoy a kind of personal freedom that it is difficult to credit given the times, and given the country, and that is always in dangeras much from love or extracurricular loyalties as from the crusading zeal of a John Brown or the greed of a slave trader who really means his business.It is the serious slave trader, somehow abetted by John Brownthe plot has a good many lacunae, and I suspect extensive and rather sloppy cutting  who unbalances things by selling Lou Gossett into real bondage and thus opening up the movie to a range of intellectual complications that are largely to its credit but mostly beyond its control.In a curious way, ""Skin Game"" tries to apply a set of traditional emotional responses to a set of new, sophisticated, highly ironic observations, and so there is never enough contact between what the movie knows and what it seems able to feel.When Gossett finds himself herded together with a crew of silent, naked black slaves from Africa (he's from New Jersey), whose special skill is to tame, and thus, I guess, enslave, wild horses, we find ourselves in the presence of attitudes that the film can locate well enough but cannot develop without violating its own ground rules, without becoming a much more bitter and universal comedy than it wants to be.Through the beginning of their adventures, moving from towns like ""Fair Shake"" to towns like ""Dirty Shame"" and conning the local worthies, Garner and Gossett seem like originals out of American humor, and in a better movie they might have continued that way. But ""Skin Game"" is neither written nor directed with enough toughness, or enough compassion, to realize its potential.And so it falls into a series of teasing and unsatisfying propositions about a pair of scoundrels not quite clever enough for their life's work and too easily redeemed for their own souls' sake.Odd things happen to performances in a situation in which almost everybody is consciously playing a part. Susan Clark and Brenda Sykes, the heroes' love interests, have insufficient stake in the game really to matter. Garner, who plays broadly, is appealing at first and finally tiresome. But Lou Gossett, whose various roles entail genuine risk and who is always parodying reality, comes at times to a multilevel characterization that is very agile, very antic, and very right for a man who lives by turning his own peril into profit.",1971-10-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: 'Debut':Russian Comedy Bows at Lincoln Center,"The Ninth New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, which almost didn't happen because of financial difficulties, opened last night with the first Russian film to be shown by the festival in four years.""The Debut,"" a comedy that manages to make gentle fun of both the Russian movie industry and Russian provincial life, is, comparatively speaking, a lot less stimulating than the controversy that surrounds the theater in which it was shown. That is the Vivian Beaumont Theater, most of the time the home of the Lincoln Center Repertory Company.The Beaumont, a legitimate theater whose sight lines aren't the best for movies, is the centerpiece of a building that soon will be partially converted to the purposes of film, specifically, the New York City Center-Henri Langlois Cinemathequea decision that has prompted almost as much mail as would the discovery of a bald eagle nesting at Gracie Mansion.The film buffs, of course, are pleased, and the lovers of theater are having fits, some less literate than others. It continues to shock many people that movies can be taken so seriously as the theatera reflection of the double standard that persists in the fact that people who are a little nutty about movies are called buffs, while their theater equivalents are described as lovers, as much in snobbery as in reverence.Because the New York Film Festival opening nights tend to be social occasions, largely attended by the Lincoln Center Film Society's patrons and friendspeople who do not necessarily have to love movies as much as they love their association with them, ""The Debut"" was probably a wise choice to lead off with. It could neither offend nor bore the sort of moviegoers who, in the past, were offended and bored by Bul's ""The Exterminating Angel"" and Godard's ""Alphaville,"" which were, in their artistic orneriness, perfect festival films.""The Debut"" isn't. It's a nice, fairly conventional narrative film, about a spirited but hardly beautiful factory girl who suddenly finds herself playing the lead in a film biography of Joan of Arc. ""The Debut"" is black-and-white, which is still the mark of a ""serious"" film in some circles; it is Russian, which certifies it as being educational since we don't see that many Russian films (for good reason, I might add); and at its best, it recalls the humor and humanism that all of us were so surprised to find in the Czechoslovak films of Jiri Menzel, Milos Forman and Ivan Passer in the late 1960's.I must say that I like the movie, although with something less than a grand passion. At its center is an absolutely lovely performance by Inna Churikova as Pasha, a girl who is a good deal of the witch she is playing in a factory theatrical when she is discovered by the Moscow film director.Miss Churikova seems truly unbeautiful at first. Her peasant figure has the unyielding grace of a hay mattress, and no matter how she tries to control it, when she smiles, her upper lip is always rising to expose a lot more tooth and gum than one ordinarily wants to see. Very quickly, however, the magic of a complex personality begins to work to transform the actress into a most appealing heroine, awkward and terribly self-conscious, yet as ambitious and determined about her love life as about her career.One of the basic ironies of the film is the manner in which the director, Gleb Panfilov, cuts between the ""Joan of Arc"" that Pasha is making (which looks like a very ordinary, post-Eisenstein production) and her hilariously muddled love affair with a married zoologist (L. Kuravlev); a handsome, rather dumb fellow who is clearly not worthy of her. When pressed to examine himself, about all that he can find to recommend is the fact that he doesn't drink.Panfilov shares with Milos Forman die ability to build straight comedy, very delicately, into farce, and then to bring it back to reality again, without destroying the continuity of mood. He also possesses a point of view that never condescends to his characters, although he obviously finds their situations simultaneously sad and ridiculous. The scope of the film is small, but its emotions are true.""The Debut,"" which starts its regular commercial run today at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, is a quiet film, made special by its star performance.",1971-10-02T05:00:00+0000

In short order he found himself tempted by one Sophy Hokey, 18yearold niece of a local magistrate and already tentatively engaged to a blade serving time for counterfeiting. The two spent many an hour together discussing salvation, but John could not bring himself to blurt out what would have been a welcome proposal. Finally Sophy eloped with still another man, causing John to deny her communion and cast doubt on the legitimacy of her marriage. He returned to England soon after. Religionists regard the outcome as happy because it left him free to pursue his extraordinary career as missionary and founder of Methodism. Wesley kept a diary (not decoded till this century), which, together with the standard biographies and histories, provides the material for Mrs. Ethridge's book. Her account falls between two stools: no news to scholars and not much entertainment for amateurs of romance. Also, it is padded and awkwardly organized.",1971-10-03T05:00:00+0000

The pit can be planted directly in soil, but the more fun way is to watch it start growing. 1. Poke three or four toothpicks in the sides of the pit and suspend it over a glass of water. Just the bottom should be kept wet. 2. Keep the glass in a bright, not necessarily sunny place, and in two to three weeks a thick root will push downward and as the pit splits, a sprout will push upward. 3. Cut the sprout short and then plant the pit in a large clay pot. Nothing smaller than 6 inches; a 7  or 8inch may be better. Use packaged house plant soil. 4. Once established in soil, the avocado will grow with abandon. Prune the top again to avoid a palmtree look, and encourage branching. 5. If the avocado is off to a good start, it may be necessary to transplant it to an even larger pot.

us,Pasolini's 'Decameron' at the Film Festival,"Pier Paolo Pasolini, the Italian director, has always been something of a puzzle for American critics, not simply because we have to reconcile his announced Marxism with what appears to be a kind of reformed Christianity (as reflected by the neo-realistic ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew,"" as well as by the austerely allegorical ""Teorema""), but because he forces us to keep shifting critical gears. No three Pasolinis are ever quite alike. At best, they come in pairs, like ""Oedipus Rex"" and ""Medea,"" neither of which have yet been released here.There is, however, a peculiar kind of romanticism throughout all of his films. It is a middle-class romanticism that idealizes the spiritual and emotional freedom that Pasolini sees in what we used to call The Common Man, who, in slightly more straightforward, class-conscious Europe, is still The Peasant. As if he were some medieval maiden locked in a tower, Pasolini seems to long for the freedom to do what the simple folk do, which, to Pasolini, evokes sexual liberation as much as anything else.In none of his films has this been more apparent than in his marvelous new work, ""The Decameron,"" which is as close to being uninhibited and joyful as anything he's ever done.Taking 10 tales out of the 100 in Boccaccio's ""Decameron,"" Pasolini has created one of the most beautiful, turbulent and uproarious panoramas of early Renaissance life ever put on film. It is also one of the most obscene, if obscene defines something that is offensive to ordinary concepts of chastity, delicacy and decency, although I'd hardly call the film offensive to morals.Pasolini's ""Decameron"" is faithful to the original texts, but it is not Boccaccio's. This is not because Pasolini has dispensed with Boccaccio's frame, which has seven women and three men, refugees from the plague that settled on Florence in 1348, each tell one story a day for the 10 days they are marooned in country villa. Pasolini uses no frame except a single setting, Naples, where the stories grow one out of the other as do the scenes in a frieze.Rather, the difference between the two works has to do with the difference between the two works has to the delicate euphemisms of Boccaccio's storytellers become the blunt unequivocal images of filmed reality. The difference also has to do with Pasolini's conscious recreation of a world that is as strange and bizarre as that of the pre-Christian ""Fellini Satyricon,"" which Pasolini's film recalls by its pagan beauty, and by its concern with life as art, if not by its comic temperament.In his ""Satyricon,"" Fellini contented himself by playing God, the artist, off screen. Pasolini is not quite so modest. About halfway through ""The Decameron"" he himself shows up as Giotto, one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance. Thereafter we see him periodically, surrounded by his students, at work on a giant fresco, the holy faces of which are those of the thieves, whores, merchants, nuns, friars, rubes, deceived husband and not-so-virginal lovers, whose stories we've been watching.When his work is finally completed, Giotto is spent, drained, empty of feeling. ""Why produce a work of art,"" he says to himself, ""when it's so nice to dream about it?""Pasolini's dream is composed of the tales he tells us, takes as its theme a frenzied Giotto nightmare, in which the artist's religious visions are overwhelmed by the more attractive visions of a pagan orgy.With the exception of Franco Citti, Ninetto Davoli and Silvana Mangano (who appears in an unbilled cameo), the cast is mostly composed of amateurs, for Pasolini, like Giotto, is fascinated by the truth of unprepared faces. They are all either extraordinarily beautiful or extraordinarily ugly, as if they were different classes of beings. There is, however, something about their awkwardness and self-consciousness that gives a special dimension of truth to the film itself.I must say that, at the beginning of the movie, I feared we were in for another one of Franco Zefferelli's rather fruitily lush, medieval window displays. However, because Pasolini is a sterner poet than Zefferelli, ""The Decameron"" becomes an epic, instead of just another unruly and inverted fashion show.The film, which was shown last night at the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, will be released commercially later in the year.",1971-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Murder of Fred Hampton',"History is, or should be, recorded after exhaustive contemplation, but ""The Murder of Fred Hampton,"" the documentary about the slain Chicago Black Panther leader that was shown yesterday and is being screened again today at the Museum of Modern Art, makes immediacy an attribute of history. Although it is unabashedly biased and it is flawed in technical execution, it emerges as a disturbingly somber illustration of some of the ills that beset us and our social system.MGA, Inc., the producers, turned out a number of TV and other commercial subjects, including ""American Revolution II,"" a documentary about the teaming of the Chicago Black Panthers and the white Young Patriots, before starting on ""Fred Hampton"" in 1968 as a documentary study of the work of Hampton and his Panthers. With word of the shooting of Hampton and Fred Clark in a police raid on Panther headquarters on Dec. 4, 1969, Mr. Gray and his camera crew rushed to the scene. This footage, plus extensive TV documentation of the slayings and subsequent coverage, as well as the previous documentation of Hampton's career, constitute a remarkable, if uneven, case history.It is, in sum, an unleavened indictment of Edward V. Hanrahan, the Illinois State's Attorney, the policemen in the raid and the Chicago political Establishment. It opens with the aftermath of the slaying and quickly switches back to Hampton, then 21 years old, and to Bobby Rush, Doc Satchel and other Panther leaders. Hampton, constantly haranguing his enthusiastic followers with, for example, ""I believe I will he able to die as a revolutionary,"" makes a startlingly prescient impression, even in the grainy, disjoined footage.The subsequent events are made all too lucid in the second half of the film, as Mr. Hanrahan's often angry testimony, as well as the police officers' reports, are rebutted, sometimes heatedly but often calmly, by Panther witnesses and their legal representatives. The evidence, both verbal and at the scene of the slayings, forces an impartial viewer to question the official version.Whether ""murder"" is the official word for the case seems a moot point. A Federal grand jury has criticized the police and its investigation of the shooting. And, Mr. Hanrahan, one of his assistants and 12 policemen were indicted in August by a special grand jury for allegedly having conspired to prevent prosecution of the policemen participating in the raid. But Mr. Gray: Howard Alk, his editor, and the rest of their company, who are declining formal credits on the film, which thus far has been seen only at the Cannes festival and in Chicago, Washington, and Stratford, Ontario, deserve credit for presenting their impassioned case, which certainly rates a wider audience.",1971-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Olmi's 'In the Summertime',"Ermanno Olmi's critical reputation has rested mostly on two early films of social alienation, ""Il Posto"" (called here ""The Sound of Trumpets,"" 1961) and ""The Fiancs"" (1962). I'm not sure that his new film, ""In the Summertime,"" which played Sunday night in the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, is likely to please too many of Olmi's former admirers. It is not so much that ""In the Summertime"" is vastly less good than his previous work. It is merely every bit as bad, but in new and somewhat different ways.The film is about a man (Renato Paracchi), slight, polite, a bit shy, middle-aged, a Milanese who carries his schoolboy nickname of Professor, who survives by coloring maps for an encyclopedia publisher, but really lives for his avocationwhich is drawing up coats of arms and conferring phony patents of nobility on guileless citizens to whom he writeswith ball-point goose quilland whom, of course he charges for his researches.The Professor honors only those strangers in whose faces he detects innate nobility, and so his coats of arms are intended as outward signs of an inward state. So also, when he finds a girl (Rosanna Callegari), a door-to-door saleswoman of bath powder, he can assure her with much eloquent protestation that she is, in every sense that matters, a bonafide princess.In am not exactly sure just when I lost my last shred of patience with this mild, genuinely well-intentioned fable, but I think it was during the 20 minutes or so given over to the Professor's sprained ankle. He had taken the Princess on an outing and got caught in somebody else's rose garden (where, by grace of their poetic souls, only he and she really belonged), and twisted his foot while running away in what must be one of the least resourceful comic-chase sequences ever filmed. The ankle sprain, boring in itself, gave time to contemplate all that was not done during ""In the Summertime,"" or was done wrong, or had better been left undone.So much of what is wrong with ""In the Summertime"" seems to result from sheer ineptitude in shaping a scene or from the weak contrivances of the screenplay that one is tempted to chalk up its failures to faulty mechanics and let them go at that. But Olmi is really striving for a higher pathos, as in the Chaplin tragicomedies  and there is something about this amibition that positively magifies his lack of achievement. Like the telephone calls the Professor makes throughout the film without ever finding his party in. According to Olmi, these are his hero's attempt to make contact with a society with which he can't make contact. But in fact they are no more than the the idea for an imageand it is the audience with whom contact is not made.Neither of the film's leading players can sustain the sentimental fervor for which it strivesthough Renato Renato Paracchi, a nonprofessional, possesses a good sensitive face and at least the manner of the gentility that he calls noble. Miss Callegari is very beautiful, and in better circumstances might very well embody that tough fragility of flesh and spirit that is her role.One night, the Professor takes his Princess to visit a ""Count"" who keeps old music machines, including a palyer piano on which he, with fervent intensity, controls pedal and volume. ""He isn't playing,"" the Princess observes. ""The provides the expression,"" answers the Professorand I think we are meant to understand that the feeling makes the art. But the art is an amalgam of many things, including skill and discipline and thought and imagination, and it is these that earn ""the expression,"" as in the great Chaplin films. Without them, fine feeling is mere inexpressive indulgence, and that is how I should characterize ""In the Summertime.""",1971-10-05T05:00:00+0000

us,John Ford:Bogdanovich Measures Director's Achievement,"In any reasonable list of the world's greatest filmmakers, John Ford will place in the top dozen. Among Americans, he belongs with Griffith and Hawks. Some attempt to measure Ford's achievement has now been made in ""Directed by John Ford,"" a movie by Peter Bogdanovich, which played last night in the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.Bogdanovich has also done a very useful interview book on Ford  along with books on Fritz Lang and Allan Dwan: and many magazine articles; and a couple of feature films, including ""The Last Picture Show,"" and several superb retrospective programs on American directors, which he began at such an early age that one assumes he transferred directly from kindergarten to the Museum of Modern Art. He is especially qualified to handle Ford on film, and in certain respects he has succeeded very well.""Directed by John Ford"" begins with a film quotation, one of the loveliest moments in ""The Searchers"" (1956), and then goes on to an initial segment of interviewswith James Stewart, John Wayne, Henry Fonda and a marvelously uncooperative John Ford himself.There are illustrative passages out of Ford movies from ""Straight Shooting"" (1917) to ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962), along with a modest and genuinely intelligent narration read by Orson Welles. Through all this, the film is workmanlike, amusing, instructive and put together with the kind of tact and freedom that illustrates the value of having a real movie-maker make the movie.But then the film proceeds to tie Ford's work to the chronicle of this country, so much of which it does indeed record, and ""Directed by John Ford"" begins to take on a certain piety and to lose a bit of its purpose. I can understand the temptation to read Ford's history in terms of American history, but I think it is a temptation worth resisting. Ford's development cuts across American history at several angles and over several decades, and if he is often able to use that history as dramatic material, he is also often able not to.Its almost exclusive concern with one aspect of Ford's themes may be the reason that the film ignores some of Ford's most recent and most beautiful work, such as ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963) and ""7 Women"" (1966), and ignores the significant fact that with such films this major living American director has lately been pretty much relegated to neighborhood theater openings, to obscure double bills and to the kind of critical indifference that the intellectual media commonly reserve for our greatest movie artists at their greatest.It is a point worth considering, and I wish it had been considered somehow, just as I wish that less of Ford's epic sweep and more of his intimate grace had been included in the film clips. But I cannot quibble too much with any selection from this director. And at times, as when the Southern military school boys march out to do battle in ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959), I am moved literally to tears by ""Directed by John Ford.""",1971-10-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: A Moving 'Sacco and Vanzetti':Lawyers' Statements Have Current Validity,"On May 5, 1920, two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco, a shoemaker, and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, a fish peddler, were arrested by the police of Brockton, Mass., and subsequently charged with responsibility for a South Braintree payroll robbery, three weeks before, that had resulted in two deaths.Seven years later, Sacco and Vanzetti, their convictions upheld, were executed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts not, according to their defenders, because they had been proved guilty, but because they were admitted anarchists and because they had been transformed into awesome symbols.To middle class, Anglo-Saxon America, they were the Red Menace that Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had been ranting against. To Communists, socialists and liberals, as well as to a good many New England church ladies, jurists, newspapermen and students of the democratic processes, their convictions represented what could go wrong with a system that, depending on the point of view, was everything from criminally oppressive to sorrowfully imperfect.If you believe, as I do, that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent, then you will probably be movedin spite of your better cinematic judgmentby ""Sacco and Vanzetti,"" an Italian film that elects to play on our best prejudices rather than make a reasonable or eloquent plea for truth.It's a measure of just what Giuliano Montaldo, the director, is up to that he frames his movie with an absolutely dreadful soundtrack song, ""The Ballad of Sacco and Vanzetti"" (one lyric of which goes: ""Here's to you, Sacco and Bart/Something something forever in my heart""), sung by Joan Baez, Miss Protest of 1968. Her voice is thus used to certify the movie's noble intentions, but through the cheapest of means.Any film that attempts to cover seven years of complex legal proceedings and social history must, inevitably, condense events and foreshorten perspectives, but Montaldo's simplication takes the form of not particularly stylish political cartooning. This is especially true of the supporting performances he has gotten from Cyril Cusack as Katzman, the prosecuting attorney, and Geoffrey Keen, as Judge Thayer, the judge who presided at the trial and, under Massachusetts law, had the unfortunate right to rule on a second trial when new evidence was presented to him.They are blandly evil, cutout figures, as are all of the intimidated witnesses, bigoted observers and political opportunists who swarm across the film.Milo O'Shea, the Irish actor (""Ulysses""), plays Fred H. Moore, the original defense attorney (who, it's generally agreed, mishandled the case with fatal results), as if he were playing good old Clarence Darrow, with such a large amount of impressive eye-ball rolling that it comes as a complete surprise, late in the film, to learn that he has botched things. But this, I suspect, is just another confusion of the script.Curiously enough, Sacco and Vanzetti themselves, who always remain the most mysterious players in most of the written accounts of their drama, emerge in the film as something like flesh-and-blood characters. This is not because Montaldo and his co-author on the screenplay, Fabrizio Onofri, have taken legitimately bold steps to give them idiosyncratic identities. It is, rather, the result of the screen presence of the two intelligent actors who play them  Gian Maria Volonte (who was so fine in ""Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion""), as Vanzetti, and Ricardo Cucciolla, as Sacco.Then, too, each man has an opportunity to speak (at least portions of) those speeches that were originally spoken in the Dedham court, final statements that are so simple and beautiful that it seems as if the English language were still in the process of being discovered, which, of course, it was for the two defendants.Considering the fact that this is an Italian film, it is amazingly free of anachronisms of time and place. Nor was I bothered by the apparently postsynchronized soundtrack; all of the Americans (even when played by non-English-speaking Italian actors) speak English, as do Sacco and Vanzetti, who speak Italian (translated by subtitles) only when talking to each other.Although ""Sacco and Vanzetti,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet, is not a good movie, I refuse to be put off from it, as have some friends of mine, on the grounds that it's just another left-wing, European blast at the United States. This is beside the point. If only because it calls to our attention a terrible chapter in American history, it can't be easily dismissed.

This time the storied, giant, silver, cigar-shaped dirigible is carrying a flimsy, lighter-than-air spy tale that wouldn't burden a carrier pigeon.Under the commonplace guidance of Etienne Perier, a Belgian director, Michael York portrays a square-jawed Scots lieutenant with strong family ties in Germany. He is surreptitiously recruited in 1915 to check on those dastardly Zeppelin guys in Friedrichshafen. Marius Goring, as a professor who wouldn't hurt a fly, has developed the LR-36, which can soar above British aircraft and ack-ack and is, therefore, a decided threat.As a man supposedly torn between allegiances to country and family, York is merely tense, even though the climactic shoot-out ends with the Zeppelin down in flames and the Magna Carta and British morale intact.Elke Sommer as the professor's wife and unlikely assistant is pretty but dowdy in vintage get-ups and a brown wig. The rest of the cast is simply athletic.""For a spy, you're getting your money's worth,"" Miss Sommer tells York. An extravagant claim.

His film simply uses the Sahara as the background for his own vision of man's compulsion to corrupt and debase himself, as well as the world in which he lives.The vision is a doggerel nightmare that tries, too late, to deny the failed poetic aspirations of its earlier sections by employing the methods of the Cinema of the Ridiculous. In Parts I and II of the film (modestly titled ""The Creation"" and ""Paradise""), we are treated to sometimes lovely images of an unspoiled world  sand dunes, oases, lakes  that eventually become littered wih the debris of civilization  abandoned automobiles, skeletons of ancient war planes, animal carcasses, belching oil refineries, slum villages and whatnot.On the soundtrack there are things like Mozart masses, and a spoken commentary, in German, of something that Herzog identifies as ""a 16th Century holy text from Guatemala,"" which, when translated into English, sounds a good deal like ""Hiawatha"" as it might be remembered by Andy Griffith.In Part III, ""The Golden Age,"" Herzog goes ridiculous, but with a consistently heavy touch. On the soundtrack there are soft-rock ballads by Leonard Cohen, interspersed with spoken lines such as ""Unforgettable is the jump from the lighthouse,"" or ""While you are sleeping, an apple falls from the tree into your bra.""At a news conference following the preview screening of his film, Herzog refused to explain the movie on the perfectly legitimate grounds that it should speak for itself, which it certainly doesbut with a slightly forked tongue.The opening shots of the film say everything: we watch, through a zoom lens, what threatens to be an endless sequence as one jet airliner after another comes in for a landing, trailing its polluting exhaust. One, two, three planes land. By the time the sixth or seventh landsthe limits of boredom being what they arewe secretly hope that one will crash. Thus, I'm not sure that Herzog is as interested in sounding alarms as in exploiting our fascination with misery, which is less of an alarm than simply alarming.""Fata Morgana,"" which was shown at the Vivian Beaumont Theater last night, is Herzog's third film to be screened by the New York Film Festival. His ""Signs of Life"" was at the 1968 festival, and ""Even Dwarfs Started Small,"" a vivid but ponderous allegory about man out of scale with the world he inhabits, was seen last year.

The program of six short subjects produced by members of four different families, which opened yesterday, will continue through Wednesday.As might be surmised, the selections illustrate, if only obliquely, that blood and talent do mix occasionally with rarely boring effects. This concept is sharply evoked by ""Permutations,"" a fascinating computer-programed animation of dot formations and electronic score by John Whitney Sr., a veteran in this highly unusual field, whose work was represented in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Matrix,"" a short previously at the museum, among other films.And in ""Terminal Self,"" his 25-year-old son, John Whitney Jr., proves that the computer also can be used to create poetic, cloudy shapes and forms that belie their mechanical origin.On the nontechnical side, Robert Frank, the photographer-director lauded for his fine beat generation short, ""Pull My Daisy,"" and his feature documentation of a schizophrenic, ""Me and My Brother,"" moves a viewer with ""Conversations in Vermont."" As an understated search for communication with his teen-aged son and daughter in a rural, commune-like school, it evokes their past and present with genuine subdued emotion. The youngsters, like their father, emerge as adults groping for love and understanding in a complex world.As counterpoint, Barry Shapiro, a young filmmaker, is less professional, perhaps, than Mr. Frank, but just as tender and realistic in seeking a closer liaison with his father and, incidentally, mother and other relatives in ""I Shapiro and Son."" One may be left with the idea that you really can't go home againConnecticut, in this case  but Shapiro's documentary inquiry is honest and gives an observer a sharp insight into the not-so-simple people caught by the camera.Unlike these offerings, 29-year-old George Kuchar's ""Portrait of Ramona"" is an intermittently funny put-on of sex films and soap opera that generates some laughs but seems unfinished despite its nudes and frantic action. Kuchar's twin brother, Mike, who alone or with George previously turned out such locally made satires as ""Sins of the Fleshapoids"" and ""Color Me Shameless,"" is represented by ""Fragments,"" a collage of fleeting shots of male nudes and sylvan locales that are merely photographically interesting. As a group show, however, ""In the Family,"" makes togetherness edifyingly informative and entertaining.",1971-10-08T05:00:00+0000

us,It Only Happens to Others' Bows,"The theory that life imitates art is ironically reversed by Nadine Trintignant, the writer-director of ""It Only Happens to Others,"" the French drama that had its premiere yesterday at the Paris Theater. In exposing a young couple's sudden tragedy and their ensuing, numbing grief, Mrs. Trintignant may not have entirely avoided the sudsiness of soap opera but she has largely succeeded in artistically dissecting a frightening subject with genuine understanding.This is not coincidental. A child of Mrs. Trintignant and her actor-husband, Jean-Louis, actually died suddenly when he was filming ""Z"" several years ago. The drama of ""It Only Happens to Others"" was, therefore, generated by horrible truth and it is as real as macabre fact, even if its emotional effects are only occasionally powerful.Mrs. Trintignant's often oblique approachvignettes of a remembered past inter-cut with the stark presentdiffuses matters. Despite the English subtitles, one wonders at the introductory scene, which shows an unshaven Marcello Mastroianni and a vaguely distraught but beautiful Catherine Deneuve distractedly making small talk and love in a strange, plush apartment. Only in disjointed subsequent scenes is it revealed that this is something of an anticlimax; that they aren't weird lovers; that they had been a happy, well-to-do husband and wife whose infant daughter's quick, unexpected passing has left them listless toward life, family and friends.But Mrs. Trintignant does capture precise, perceptive moments of mood and nuance. Sudden death in a hospital emergency room is made truly incomprehensible and shocking as they inarticulately grope for reasons and comfort. And vignettes of their child, alive and playful intrude with poignant effect to enhance their despair, despite the solicitude of family and friends.In their abrupt escape from urban self-imprisonment to recapture the life they once had, the director also has fashioned several sequences of quiet, sylvan beauty. Flocks of sheep, a provincial wedding and country children are striking in the film's pastel colors and also seem to indicate poetically a final release from the couple's grief.Since Mr. Mastroianni and Miss Deneuve are almost constantly before the camera, they may leave the impression of being involved in a marathon Actors Studio exercise. But they are thorough professionals who project obvious sincerity and feeling into really demanding roles. They're abetted by natural, if brief performances by a small supporting cast.As a distaff director and therefore a rare type, Mrs. Trintignant proves to be the film's top professional and an excellent vote-getter for Women's Lib. Like Proust, who insisted that ""It is grief that develops the powers of the mind,"" she has produced a bittersweet drama out of grief that may be imperfect but is intellectually adult and sometimes, like life itself, touching.",1971-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Festival: Romantic:'4 Nights of Dreamer' Bows at Beaumont,"In the two years since ""Une Femme Douce"" played at the Seventh New York Film Festival, there have been three commercial openings of films by Robert Bresson, accompanied perhaps by a growing public appreciation of the very special cinematic vocabulary of this great and austere French master.In ""Four Nights of a Dreamer,"" which played last night in the Vivian Beaumont Theater as part of the present film festival, the Bresson vocabulary remains intact, but in the service of a different and more worldly subject matter.Consider a scene at the beginning of ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"" in which the young hero, Jacques (Guillaume des Forets), takes an outing in the country. All we see in Jacques thumbing a ride out from Paris, doing two straight-faced somersaults in a field of flowers, and, at night, stepping out of the car that has returned him to the city. The point is not that Jacques doesn't have a good time, but that the strict economy of gesture that conditions the Bresson universe requires no larger notation for this moment.When a greater expansiveness is required, it will be supplied, but in recent Bresson films it has been carefully reserved for those fleeting indications of spiritual transcendence that have seemed his special interest in the cinema.In ""Four Nights of a Dreamer,"" it is more openly supplied, but it is no less special. The story, adapted from Dostoyevsky's ""White Nights,"" concerns a solitary man, a romantic dreamer, who one night befriends a distraught young girl and for the next three nights meets her to tell about himself and listen to her story of what may be unrequited love.On the last night the girl encounters her lost lover, and goes off with him  leaving the dreamer, who has fallen hopelessly in love, with only a memory for another dream.Bresson has moved the story from Petersburg to Paris, from the 1840's to the 1970's. He has enlarged its scope, andby making his hero an artist for whom dreams beget realities  he has provided something of a happy ending.But although the dreams translate to art, their theme is love, and ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"" is very much a movie about the condition of being in love. The intense covert eroticism of the earlier Bresson (in all the films except ""A Man Escaped"", 1956, and ""The Trial of Joan of Arc,"" 1961) is here overt and even lyrically sustained.The effect on the film's quality is inescapable  not only in a superb purple passage in which the girl (Isabel Weingarten, another of Bresson's hauntingly beautiful heroines) examines her naked body, but in every private embrace and public encounter, in the sights and sounds that fill the city seemingly made for love.Jacques becomes a slave to his passion. He carries next to his heart a tape recorder that in his own voice repeats the girl's name, Marthe, as if that were his heart's beating. But he has always been a slave to love, and even before Marthe, he has walked entranced through a Paris that is defined by its young girls' glances.Jacques among the girls of Paris is a sequence that in its balletic purity directly recalls the great theft sequences of ""Pickpocket,"" (1959), also set in Paris and also, in a sense, a study of an artist transformed by a woman's love.But the new sequence is also very funny  not an achievement one usually associates with Bressonand, in general, the theme of love has released not only the director's graciousness but also his wit, so that whole scenes together have an emotional complexity to match their deep, refreshing cinematic purity.I doubt that ""Four Nights of a Dreamer"" is Bresson's greatest movie, but it may well be his loveliest. Time and again, it is shockingly beautiful, and I can think of nothing in recent films so ravishing as his strange romantic vision of the city, the river, the softly lighted tourist boats in the night.",1971-10-09T05:00:00+0000

In these poems, written between 1960 and late 1961 and antedating Ariel, the poet plays Pygmalion to her own Galatea, willing herself into shape, struggling against the inherited outlines of her predecessors. There are very grotesque stages along the way, as in some larval metamorphosis: the roaringram disguise of Dylan Thomas; babbling exclamatory whispersinthepottingshed after the manner of Theodore Roethke; duets between heaven and earth in Stevensian orchestration; and many plaintive familial brutalities learned from Lowell. What exhausting costumes these were, and how heavy, and how distasteful to Sylvia Plath's soul we can only judge from her persistent attempts to shed these skins, and finally, in Ariel and some later poems, to transcend them.

Of figures of comparable achievement, only Pablo Picasso, soon to be a nonagenarian, still walks the earth. Although Edward Morgan Forster's genius was not so pronouncedly obvious as that of any of these men, it is likely that his death, in June of last year, stirred feelings of a more personal, and hence more profound, kind. Which is as it should be, for no other writer so stressed the overriding importance of personal relationsstressed them so seductively, in fact, that in reading him one felt one had entered into a personal relationship of sorts with Forster himself. Perhaps this has to do, too, with the fact that Forster was the last novelist to tell one, godlike and with enormous artistic success, what to think of his characters; and so in reading his novels one felt the presence of an author who spoke directly to oneself.",1971-10-10T05:00:00+0000

In a voice as appealing as it was limited, he sang a song that seemed to use an uncommon number of B's (Bnatural seven chords and Bflat seven chords, if you want to be technical about it) which has been identified with him ever since. The song was called Night and Day. It had critics. But who cares now; who remembers that E. Montillion Woolley (Monty Woolley to you) thought it was awful. When Hollywood got around to Gay Divorce in 1934 and called it The Gay Divorcee, Night and Day was in it and Mr. Astaire sang it to Ginger Rogers. So was another song destined to become a standard, The Continental, by Herb Magidson and Con Conrad.

As a veteran of these events I have found that one of the best parts of going to a local college game  there are more than a dozen colleges playing something clearly recognizable as football within an hour and a half's drive of New York City  is that you don't have to be an old grad to enjoy one. I have never spent a minute inside a Princeton classroom, nor many more in my own college for that matter, yet I feel I have been to more games and logged more twostep time at Nassau parties than F. Scott Fitzgerald. In fact, there are definite benefits in not being a graduate. You have all the enjoyment of a pleasant fall afternoon in the outdoors watching that old school try without getting those letters from the alumni office trying to knock you over for a donation for the new gymnasium.",1971-10-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Born to Win':Czech Film on Addict Shown in Festival,"It had been called ""Scraping Bottom."" But a few months ago the title was changed to ""Born to Win,"" and that was the name under which Ivan Passer's new movie played Saturday night in the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Except for the pleasure it must bring to connoisseurs of the movie business, the title change doesn't much matter; as a slice from the life of a middle-aged New York junkie, ""Born to Win"" is, of course, a study in losing.Ivan Passer is a Czechoslovak director, friend and collaboration of Milos Forman, whose first feature, ""Intimate Lighting,"" seemed to some of us the happiest, though least well known, product of the Czechoslovak film renaissance in the nineteen-sixties. ""Born to Win"" is only Passer's second movie, and it is a dreadful disappointment  but not without its reasons, and not, I think, without some honor.The reasons stem from Passer's trying to make a New York movie, when New York isn't his subject, and from his trying, against all odds and all wisdom, to make what means to be in part a madcap comedy about heroin addiction. The honor really has the same sources: the understanding of a need for a sense of place and a sense of style, which keep the film from being a total waste, even when it is going totally wrong.George Segal plays the junkie. Paula Prentiss plays his wife, also a junkie and currently a prostitute, who enters the picture only a couple of times and only long enough to say she's sorry. And Karen Black plays, the girl who picks Segal up one night while he is stealing her car. Friendly, unattached, with a terrific duplex apartment and no visible means of support, she seems the most gratuitous aspect in a movie that is in no way strong on logic.I think that Segal himself is meant to hold things together  by a degree of personal charisma that in this instance he lacks and by his story, which is supposed to be at once a compound of tragic destiny and comic misadventure. But the destiny is both too theatrically phony and too predictably conventional, and the comedy  though in a few cases genuinely funny  is too mechanical for its function. And the view of the addict's life style as desperate but somehow admirable in its canny desperation  which I believe is the movie's intention  falls in a maze of stock devices and hazy motivations.It didn't seem possible, in the scene where Segal's pal, Billy Dynamite (Jay Fletcher), takes the film's obligatory shot of bad stuff and dies, and the audience can guess everything about the sequence at least five minutes in advance because it is by now the oldest clich of the junkie movie, that a sensibility as fine as Passer's could be involved in it. But Passer's sensibility is involved, and effectively deadened, and I hope just for a time, because he has done and can do beautiful work.",1971-10-11T05:00:00+0000

Their film was completed last year with the help of Swiss and German Government television and it since has been seen in several Parisian theaters (but not on French TV) and bought for showing on Swiss, German, Dutch, Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish TV screens.The producers also use 1939-through-1945 French and German newsreel footage of, among others, Hitler and of Vichy's Pierre Laval and Marshal Henri-Philippe Ptain, as well as fairly recent interviews with such involved V.I.P.'s as Lord Avon (Anthony Eden), Pierre Mendes-France and Jacques Duclos, leader of the Communist party.These serve as counterpoint to their discusion with members of the Resistance, victims of both Nazis and the French Liberation groups, Rightists and middle-of-the-roaders to spotlight glaringly a somber chapter of history dimmed by the passage of a quarter of a century.They have, in short, concentrated their investigations on the industrial city of Clermont-Ferrand as exemplary (it is implied) of what most Frenchmen and invaders did then and how they feel about it now. And, with the aid of English voice-overs, which literally translate the French and German dialogue, its points, implied and otherwise, are made naturally and convincingly.This viewer was especially impressed by the honesty of Marcel Verdier, the local pharmacist (who wasn't quite certain he was a bourgeois); Louis and Alexis Grave, two ex-Maquis farmers who good-naturedly continue to hate the Nazis who sent them to a concentration camp; with Mendes-France's low-keyed memories of escape from a Nazi jail in his youth to fight with the Free French and with Capt. Helmuth Tausend's bland evaluation of his role as a garrison commander.Some of the important personages do stick in memory, too, such as the witty, cynical, late commander of the Resistance, Emanuel de la Vigier; Anthony Eden, and Count Ren de Chambrun, who, in legal style, defends his father-in-law, Pierre Laval. But they suffer by comparison with the straightforward accounts of the likes of Emile Caubaudon, Clermont-Ferrand's Resistance chief; the Rightist Christian de la Maziere, who fought with an S.S. regiment of Frenchmen, and even with the aging, unbilled hairdresser who was jailed as a collaborator.One must agree with Anthony Eden, who notes that it is not right for the English, who were not invaded, to judge people who were. But this lengthy, complex but entirely lucid insight into the minds of the occupied and the occupiers does give one the ability to judge from the participants' own views. ""Le Chagrin et la Piti"" filled the more than 1,000 seats of the Vivian Beaumont last night, which indicates, if obliquely, that this special ""nonentertainment"" film might have a wider audience than this special one.",1971-10-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Film Fete: 'In the Name of the Father':Scene Is Italian Boys' School Run by Priests Another Individualistic Movie by Bellochio,"There is a sequence about halfway through Marco Bellocchio's ""In the Name of the Father"" during which a group of upper-form Italian prep school boys prepare for their nightly recreation hour. Dressed in dark uniforms, they solemnly climb a long, dim staircase. And while the priests who are their masters gaze sadly down at them from windows and niches, like paintings framed in centuries of patient grief, each boy approaches a carved portrait bust of the school's honored founder and spits at it as hard as he canuntil spittle drips from its noble aquiline nose.To catch all the spirit of Bellocchio's film one needs to see it all. But this sequence, with its intricate interweaving of beauty and disgust, its deeply elegiac sense of satire, its gorgeously ceremonial invocation of what it most despises, will do for starts. There is a sense in which the entire movie is an elaborate put-on; its most private moments, theatrically staged demonstrations; and that sense typifies the kind of movie that this director, with three highly individualistic films now to his credit, seems committed to making.Like his ""Fists in the Pocket"" (1966) and the popular ""China Is Near"" (1967), Bellocchio's present film deals with the younger members of a relatively closed society from which the crying need and the ultimate impossibilityis escape. In this case the social unit is a miserable boys' school for rich unteachables run by priests, like a medieval fortress in the midst of a modern city. The movie follows the academic year from the school's opening (a vicious son being deposited by his vile dad) through Christmas recess to the end of the spring term. But its structure is not so much temporal as spatial, or perhaps, spiritualand ""In the Name of the Father"" maligns several kinds of father at various removes and at many levels of authority.One student (Yves Beneyton) leads a revolt, ostensibly in the name of science and progress, and he uses the school playin a brilliant and terrifying and most improbable conceitas a means of mass persuasion. But he is himself a demagogue, a rational madman, a Frankenstein recruiting monsters  and he is no less evil, though somewhat more potent, than the school's vice rector (Renato Scarpa), who is his only serious adversary.The film thus represents a closed system, in which the lines and the actors may change but the horror remains. ""In the Name of the Father"" is a work of extraordinary boldness and fantastic invention. But its dramatic limitations are such that the boldness declines into bravado and the invention mostly extends variations on a monotonous theme.However, I can think of a dozen sequences together where the film takes magnificent life, and if any movie could be no more than the sum of its beauties, ""In the Name of the Father"" would take the prize simply on quantity. With its students locked in their cells each night, its priests in helpless disarray, its kitchen hands in sullen discontent, a mad dog roaming its corridors and a meek assistant master scrawling obscene graffiti on the dining hall wallsBellocchio's prep school is not quite the perfect image of the prison of our lives. But it is at times an impressive distorting mirror; and at times, a most intensely lyrical freak show.""In the Name of the Father"" played last night in the New York Film Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.",1971-10-13T05:00:00+0000

Actually, Miss Lyn is not yet quite up to shaping such a movie, though she tries hard enough, and even succeeds in bringing some life to her role as Gregory Peck's illegitimate daughtera part that could well prove the ultimate trial of the Stanislavsky method.The film was directed by Henry Hathaway, who has provided pleasures enough in the past and from whom, given the appearance of Miss Lyn in her little smock and broad-brimmed hat, we might have expected a certain present ambition  along the lines, say, of a ""Daughter of 'True Grit.'"" But ""Shoot Out"" is no more than another variation of the eternal tale of the Westerner (Gregory Peck) released from prison who seeks revenge on the pal who betrayed him but is himself pursued by a hired gang of maniacal killers until a showdown in which everybody gets his except Mr. Peck, who unaccountably gets marriage and a family. Pat Quinn (Alice's Restaurant,"" etc.) plays marriage, and she is no match for Miss Lyn, who plays family.Since this is the kind of movie that everybody walks through, so to speak, it seems reasonable to consider styles of walking; especially Gregory Peck's style, which is by deficiency the best testimonial of the mature art of John Wayne that I have seen in recent movies. I had not thought it possible with such economy to say so much about so little. But if you want an image for the Decline of the West, you might do worse than the past president of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts, and Sciences on his solitary way up the main street of Weed City, between the bank and the local saloon.",1971-10-14T05:00:00+0000

But ""Night of Dark Shadows,"" which fell on neighborhood theaters yesterday, is illustration that the pseudosinister can be a bore, even without vampires.Miss Bennett and Mr. Frid aren't around this time, even if Miss Hall is, to attempt to chill the customers. And a good thing, too, since the script devised by Sam Hall depends a good deal on visual effects that aren't particularly effective to spin a yarn about a young couple's enslavement to the tortured but lively ghosts that haunt a country mansion they've inherited.Dan Curtis, the producer-director, who's shepherded his harried flock from TV to ""House of Dark Shadows"" and to the present, moody adventure, hasn't given his cast much to work with that is either fascinating or believable.David Selby and Kate Jackson, as the young, abstract artist and his bride who's acquired Collinwood, seem much too hip to become the victims of Lara Parker, the sexy blonde in diaphanous shifts who'd been deep enough in hanky panky to be hanged as a witch in 1810 and is dedicated to keeping this bad work up.Mr. Selby's sudden affliction of nightmares reviving his ancestors' morbid past generated by this amorous wraith are as unconvincing as Miss Hall's weird activities. As the estate's gaunt, glacial housekeeper, she's certain that she is an early resident who's been reborn to rid Collinwood of its new owners and keep its ghosts and traditions intact.And John Karlen and Nancy Barrett, as the couple's married friends, try to be helpful but aren't.The attraction of this dour adventure is Lyndhurst, the Gothic revival mansion and estate, once Jay Gould's, at Tarrytown where the film was shot. Its many period rooms, paintings and objects d'art are richly eye-filling. The somber story shot there, however, is strictly for the low-rent district.",1971-10-14T05:00:00+0000

But good deeds and intentions aside, Mr. Stember, who is a fashion photographer, gives us a good deal less than meets the eye or the ear in this ill-defined and disconnected saga of a modern young man's angst in a world rent by wars and other dissensions.Mr. Stember, who produced and directed from his story and for his own company, SHA Productions, apparently was uncertain about just how he would project the problems endured by his vaguely limned but highly distraught hero.What we're exposed to is a series of vignettes photographed in color against mostly local backgrounds that give the impression of having been tossed in merely to indicate progressive anxieties.The anxieties appear to have basis in awesome facts. We see televised scenes indicating Hitler's holocausts, and others, up to and including Vietnam. Vietnam is what appears to have set off our troubled pettish hero, Alan Midgette. In disjointed scenes, he is oddly unresponsive to the pleas of his nude, beautiful but callow wife (Phoebe McAdams) to come to bed; to his loquacious, divorced mother (Ruth Ford) and her saccharine adoration, and to a vague, older friend (Paul Gallan), who, at one point, chases him desperately as he rows down a sylvan stream.Unfortunately, Mr. Midgette, a lank-haired, slightly delicate blond type sporting a flowing white scarf, is given to long, moody silences and few words that convey coherency or depth. In a reflective sequence shot for no real reason on a windswept beach through waving weeds, his Vietnam observations include, ""Those are real babies crying, this war is a crime against nature.""The dialogue, done in an ad lib, Andy Warhol technique, is not a crime against nature but it does little to put the principals in sharp focus. Nor does it do much for the meaning of the climax, which has our tortured Alan fleeing inexplicably from everyone at an airport.The title, ""7254,"" a program note says, is the ""Kodak designation for color negative film."" Well, it wasn't used especially positively this time.",1971-10-15T05:00:00+0000

Barrie.Susan, as a child, used to fly, which, she tells us, always amused her brother. As an adult in today's New York City, she finds it impossible to cope, but not, you realize, just because she has to get around on buses and subways. Susan is simply too fine and pure and vulnerable for the world that encircles her. When she isn't escaping into fantasies inhabited by a kindly old park bench magician (played by Orson Welles with an uncertain Myron Cohen accent), she may worry over the telephone company's substitution of numbers for exchanges with such names as Gramercy, Plaza and Algonquin.Like Susan, Henry Jaglom's first feature film is a beautiful drag.""A Safe Place,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last night, is the time-fractured story of Susan's journey to that undiscovered country from whose bourn no tourist returns, at least, not without a very special visa. Because Jaglom has chosen to use time, in his word, emotionallythrough constant cutting between present and past and futurethe narrative pretends to be a lot more complex than the rather superficial case history of a suicide it really is.Jaglom, who also wrote the original screenplay, looks like a young director attempting to walk without ever having learned to crawl, which is too bad because there are indications that he might crawl with a good deal of style. In fits and starts, ""A Safe Place"" is almost as moving as it wants to be, as when Jack Nicholson, an old lover out of Susan's past (who may or may not be her brother), (drops in at 4 A.M. to chat and make love, much to the comic impatience of a present lover.Jaglom, however, never lets a scene go by without splicing ing in fragments of memories of the past and fantasies of the future. The effect is not to construct a higher emotional reality, but to upstage any reality by attention-grabbing tricks. The director is, nevertheless, consistent, since this is the structural equivalent to his habit of photographing characters around and through foreground objects that tend to obscure ordinary sightlines.If ""A Safe Place"" reveals anything, it reveals the director's apparent adoration of his star, whom he studies in every possible light and color combination, and in every possible camera setup, often orchestrated with fine, corny songs out of the 1940's and 1950's on the order of Charles Trenet's ""La Mer"" and ""Vous Qui Passe Sans Me Voir."" Tuesday Weld in a tight close-up, accompanied by Trenet on the soundtrack, is not exactly a higher cinematic truth, but I can think of less stimulating combinations.Orson Welles has some terrible moments reading his fortune-cookies lines, but it's nice to see him alive and well, even if it's in Central Park trying, unsuccessfully, to make a bored llama disappear. All of the major performances are, in fact, attractive, limited only by the material. These include Nicholson, as well as two newcomers, Gwen Welles, who has a long odd, funny monologue about New York City mashers (which has no place in the movie except that it is odd and funny) and Philip Proctor, who plays Susan's square suitor with the sort of puzzled eyes and half smile that I associate with Nicholson, who may be setting the acting style for the 1970's.The film wil have its commercial opening here Oct. 29 at the new Columbia II Theater.",1971-10-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Abel Gance's Movie on Napoleon,"Abel Gance's ""Bonaparte and the Revolution,"" which, to the credit of the New York Film Festival, played Thursday night in the Vivian Beaumont Theater, is a new movie that goes back more than 40 years. It began as one part of a six-part study of Napoleon, had its premier at the Paris Opera in 1927, but was scarcely seen after that except in mutilated and much diminished versions. Gance himself has accused Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer of buying the film and then virtually suppressing it, so that its expensive wide-screen, three-camera technique (a precursor to Cinerama) should not endanger the profits of an industry that already felt itself threatened by the coming of sound.The other five parts of ""Napoleon"" were never made, but in the nineteen-thirties, Gance prepared a sound version, valuable at the very least for preserving the voice of Antonin Artaud, who played Marat. The current film draws upon both versions, though it uses a screen of conventional size, rearranges material, adds some new footage, including a fine introduction by Gance at 82, adds music (Beethoven's 5th Symphony; the original score was by Arthur Honegger) and provides the silent action with some voice-over narration and much dialogue. The post-synchronizing of the dialogue, credited to Claude Pessis, is spectacularly successful, and it may rank with Polyvision and the triptych screen (and color and, on a lost reel, 3-D) among the technical marvels of this all but legendary movie.Gance himself is now part of the legend. He is as old as the art he serves, a master unknown to most audiences, and his romantic study of a personal history has become his own history, wonderfully vindicated in a work that, like the man, could scarcely ever have seemed much younger. For all its four and one-half hours, its multitude of effects, its elaborate visual rhetoric, its willingness to make every point more than once, ""Bonaparte and the Revolution"" moves with a vitality that any film made yesterday might envy and that almost none can equal.The movie deals with Napoleon through his young manhood, roughly from the beginnings of his military career through his marriage to Josephine de Beauharnais (Gina Manes) and the Italian campaign of 1796. But considerable attention is given to the Revolution, to the meetings of the Convention and to the Reign of Terror, and the film's most remarkable portraits surely are those of Marat (Artaud), Danton (Alexandre Koubitsky), Saint-Just (Gance himself) and above all an almost expressionless and coldly terrifying Robespierre (Van Daele).The actual relation of Bonaparte to the Revolution is often tenuous, though in making that relation Gance achieves some of his most startling effects. Napoleon is seen on the one hand as destined to spread the spirit of the Revolution over the lands he is to conquer, and on the other, as embodying a principle of disciplined will that seems exactly counter to the actual spirit of the Revolution as the film unflatteringly presents it.But for all his magnificent scope, Gance is more interesting with personal stories than with national destiny, and his Napoleon (Albert Dieudonne) is a figure of subtle and, in context, rather surprising complexity. Thus the great purple passages in ""Bonaparte and the Revolution""  for example, the famous intercutting between Napoleon in an open boat, the tricolor for his sail, tempest-tossed in his 1792 escape from Corsica; and the tempestuous Convention, photographed as if by a wave-borne camera  seem grand, but not as grand as the rich and sophisticated interplay of light and shadow, dream and reality, character and event, in the technically less imposing courtship and marriage of Napoleon and Josephine.However, there is no point at which ""Bonaparte and the Revolution"" is less than a wonderful old movie and a marvelous new one. And in this excellently titled version I hope it remains permanently available for American audiences.",1971-10-16T05:00:00+0000

For the answer to the first ques tion you'll have to read William Steig's picture book, AMOS AND BORIS (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $4.50). I'll give you a little of Steig's story about the meeting between these two dis paratesized mammals. Years before Amos had answered the sea's call: studied navigation at night, built a snug craft, stocked it with provisions and set sail full of love for life. Unfortunately one night, pondering the enormity of the universe and the starstudded sky, Amos rolls over the side and has other things to think about: What would it be like to drown, would it feel just awful, would his soul go to heaven, would there be other mice there? That's when he meets Boris and gets a week's ride by whaleback. He comes to admire the bulk, the grandeur, the power, the purpose, the rich voice, and the abounding friendliness of the whale and Boris admires the delicacy, the quivering daintiness, the light touch, the small voice, the gemlike radiance of the mouse.

us,The Screen: Incest Is Theme of Malle's 'Le Souffle':Lea Massari Portrays Non-French Mother Benoit Ferreux Plays 15-Year-Old Boy,"The directorial career of Louis Malle has followed a general though by no means spectacular decline from the time 10 years ago, when he was widely regarded as a major hope of the French New Wave, to the present, when he is scarcely regarded at all. After an initial outburst of such highly individual and charmingly perverse conceits as ""The Lovers"" (1958) and ""Zazie dans le Mtro"" (1960), he has descended, through bouts of quality and commerce, to his latest film, ""Le Souffle au Coeur,"" in which the major purpose of perversity is to charm.The point is not that ""Le Souffle au Coeur"" is a terrible moviethough it isn't very goodbut that it could probably have been made with as much distinction by any of those directors, all equally anonymous, who specialize in urban romantic comedy (or tragedy) of a sophistication that is supposed to be peculiarly French. ""Le Souffle au Coeur"" is comedy, and I guess its sophistication is a bit peculiar.Its hero is the 15-year-old son (Benoit Ferreux) of upper-middle-class parents, who is passing onto maturity and who discovers that for sexual initiation as for everything else, a mother is a boy's best friend. It is, I should say, a happy incest movie, with the addition of a somewhat nervous morality requiring a) that the boy no sooner have his mother than he must rush out to take the nearest unrelated teenage girl, thereby proving his normality, and b) that his mother's joyful experience cancel out a previous extramarital affair, so that she returns to hearth and home. A family that plays together stays together.Lea Massari is the mother, and it is important that she is beautiful, vivacious, generally affectionate, fantastically youthful  and not French. Indeed, so much is made of her warm Italian temperament that I suspect the working of a kind of national-character protectionism. Although Benoit Ferreux receives from Malle's camera the greater glamour treatment (he has sensitive good looks, but seems reserved to the point of placidity), Miss Massari is more properly the film's star. In a different kind of movie out of a different tradition I think she might have managed the major performance that ever since I first saw her (as the lost girl in ""L'Avventura"") she seems to have promised.Nothing in ""Le Souffle au Coeur"" seems very necessary but perhaps the most pleasantly gratuitous element is the time, the early 1950's. Except for references to Indochina, styles of dress and styles of jazz, Malle has kept period authenticity to a gratifying minimum. But he has indulged himself in two minor characters, the boy's older brothers (Marc Winocourt and Fabien Ferreux). Lying, cheating, stealing, drinking, wenching and insulting their elders, they are the very incarnation of 1950's juvenile delinquency. Of course they seem terribly classic and lovable. But in their genuinely outrageous vitality they are also the best reminder of the imaginitive world Louis Malle used to inhabit  and can still, when the inspiration strikes.""Le Souffle au Coeur"" played Saturday night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, the last selection in the New York Film Festival. Under the title ""Murmur of the Heart,"" it opened yesterday at the Little Carnegie.",1971-10-18T05:00:00+0000

A friendship develops, then a marriage. But since Rose is an intellectual and liberated, and since Al is unambitious and compliant, their marriage is the kind we've all been trying to imagine lately: she goes out to work and comes back with money; he keeps house and gossips over the backyard fence.

Everything else is an improvement.As Bunny O'Hare, the sort of little old lady who wears blue sneakers and what looks to be a man's rain hat, Miss Davis plays a member of the Silent Majority who takes to robbing banks, disguised as a hippie, with the collaboration of a real bank robber played by Ernest Borgnine. As I said, the gimmick is dreadful. Miss Davis, however, gives a performance that may be one of the funniest and most legitimate of her career, which has been spectacular for mannerisms that overwhelmed every character she's ever played, with the notable exceptions of Leslie Crosbie, Regina Giddens and Margo Channing.""Bunny O'Hare"" is nonsense of a quite acceptable order, filled with absurd chases and stock characters who have been conceived and played with affection, especially by Jack Cassidy as a right-wing detective who believes the bank robbers to be ""radical bird lovers"" (their ploy is to release canaries in the banks they rob).I also liked Reva Rose and John Astin, as Miss Davis's terrible children, for whom she turns to a life of crime; Joan Delaney, as a pretty, completely sane criminal psychologist, and, of course, Borgnine, who, like Miss Davis, refuses to notice that the comedy he's in is as broad, and full of potholes as the state of New Mexico, where the movie was shot. Class will out.Also on the bill with ""Bunny O'Hare,"" currently at neighborhood theaters, is ""The Velvet Vampire,"" which is almost as funny as ""Bunny O'Hare,"" though I doubt that it means to be. It has to do with a beautiful, 125-year-old woman, the mistress of a remote ranch in the southwest who stocks her own blood bank with tourists dumb enough to spend the night. It is to be recommended only if you can see it at the New Amsterdam on 42d Street, where audiences loudly, freely and obscenely associate with the action on the screen.",1971-10-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Catlow' Pits Crenna Against Brynner,"An elaborate and somewhat too aggressively agreeable Western, Sam Wanamaker's ""Catlow,"" opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters. Though not without its share of death and violence, it sees the frontier as somehow producing more smiles than tears, and it is the kind of western for which I imagine them as using stock shots not of heroes falling, but of the principal characters laughing.The principal characters are Catlow (Yul Brynner) and Cowan (Richard Crenna), who sound like a comedy team but are actually a big time outlaw  Caltow  and the marshal, his best buddy, who pursues him. With everybody pretty much a protagonist, major antagonisms are pushed to one side, reserved for occasional Indians, who do most of the film's dying, and for a hired killer (Leonard Nimoy), who also dies, but whose main function is to reveal the cruel scars of an action that would otherwise be no more than happy highjinks with deadly weapons.Catlow's plan to steal a Mexican shipment of contraband gold provides the plot, and lots of local color, and a pair of Mexican-spitfire type girl friends (Jo Ann Pflug and Daliah Lavi) for Crenna and Brynner. No one of these elements really failsthough the plot and Miss Lavi get lowest gradesbut all of them together don't add to a coherent or even mildly pleasing movie.Often, for whole sequences at a time, ""Catlow"" looks as if it is going to be about somethingfriendship, or the meaning of property, or the discovery of happiness that seems to be the issue of so many of its more suspenseful moments. But it ends up being about nothing at all, as if it were unaware of its own ideas or the potency of its images. And so tension becomes tedium and laughter grows tired, and the screen recedes not quite out of sight, but surely out of mind.",1971-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Candice Bergen Cast as 'T. R. Baskin',"""T. R. Baskin"" is a comedy for people with a high tolerance for whimsey, about an amiable, wise-cracking, small-town girl who seeks a full-filling life in Chicago. Apparently she's been living in a coal mine since she's surprised to discover a culture that wires its elevators with music, makes its office buildings airtight for air-conditioning, eats TV dinners and warps its men, who are either Playboy-philosophy creeps or, in one case, a soft-spoken, R. D. Lang-reading, male chauvinist pig. (After a thoroughly satisfying night of love, he slips a $20 bill into her pocket.)Things go so badly, so arbitrarily, for T. R. Baskin that, toward the end of the film, she is driven to the brink of serious introspection. ""The city is pretty from a distance,"" she says, ""like someone with bad skin.""T. R. Baskin is never at a loss for words, most of which sound as if they had come straight from the notebook of a writer who spent most of time jotting down funny lines without ever worrying much about character.It thus falls to Candice Bergen, a beautiful actress who projects intelligence, humor, vulnerability and self-relianceall more or less simultaneouslyto make something credible of the mouthpiece character written for her by Peter Hyams. She is constantly on the point of succeeding when the screenplay suddenly requires her to say something like: ""A fly came into my office last week, and nobody knew what it was.""Such poetic conceits are enough to make me want to defend everything from air-conditioning and TV dinners to air pollution.The film, which was shot entirely on location, features some nice performances in addition to Miss Bergen's. Peter Boyle (""Joe""), has been upgraded to playing a middle-class salesman from Utica (whose sensibilities are still lower middle-class). James Caan is the man who, for reasons I never quite believed, treats T.R. as if she were a whore; and Marcia Rodd, who was so fine in ""Little Murders,"" is funny as T.R.'s best friend at the otherwise depersonalized insurance company where she works.Somewhere deep inside ""T.R. Baskin,"" there is, I suspect, a real, touching film crying to get out with something more than a wise-crack, but neither Hyams, nor Herbert Ross, the director, have been able to find it.

us,Robert F. Lyons Stars in 'Todd Killings',"The astonishing thing about ""The Todd Killings"" is that it holds you fast, while exasperatingly missing out on three levels. As a character study of a charming, 23-year-old psychopath, the king rooster of the teeny-bopper set, the film, which opened in neighborhood theaters yesterday, has a fine performance by young Robert F. Lyons. But he is no more indicative of a dangerous void in today's contemporary youth, as the movie insists, than Jack the Ripper was of Old London.Secondly, as a suspense melodrama, the picture is absurd. As it opens, ""Skipper"" has murdered a girl. Two awed teen-agers help him hide the body. Weeks later he kills two more. And in between, in a small Nevada community, the police casually question him, they sit around on their haunches.Thirdly, although the color camera shrewdly sketches the small-town Americana background and a cynically seasoned group of young people, nothing really accounts for the hero or his heinous behavior.Even so, the sure brilliance of producer Barry Shear's direction and Harold E. Stine's photography, and the subtle meshing of the incidents make for an engrossing, often gripping eyeful. The picture has a dazzling potentialsimply to look at and hearthat is sustained close to the surface.Young Lyons gets firm flanking by Richard Thomas, in a slight flavoring of the Leopold-Loeb case, by Belinda Montgomery, and by two veterans, Barbara Bel Geddes and Gloria Grahame, in brief but professional stints.Finally, horror and sex are actually soft-pedaled. Failure though it may be, ""The Todd Killings"" is anything but dull.",1971-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Four Features Begin Their Runs Here:Poitier Is Virgil Tibbs in 'The Organization',"Our reigning black superstar, Sidney Poitier, who, as detective Virgil Tibbs, has been majestically impervious to criminals and the white Establishment in ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and ""They Call Me Mr. Tibbs,"" retains his imperious cool in ""The Organization,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria, 86th Street East and other theaters. But despite his smooth restraint, this dizzying complex of a king-sized heroin heist, shootings and chases set against authentic, picturesque San Francisco backgrounds evolves largely as surface action and reaction so dear to TV's cops and robbers.Don Medford, a video veteran, naturally has directed with an eye on speed and gunplay, and his color cameras have recorded it all with eye-catching effects. James R. Webb's script, which economically and colloquially matches the pace of the action, does not, however, do much beyond indicating the nature of the characters involved.The opening sequence, in which a highly efficient gang using sophisticated equipment stealthily snatches a $4-million heroin cache from a furniture factory, is tension-packed stuff full of promise. More fireworks do go off, but these are far less imaginative and convincing as we proceed to an explosive climax in the unfinished San Francisco subway.The gang, it turns out, are not thieves exactly, but a variety of types who've been personally hurt by drugs and are out to get the internationally placed bigwigs controlling the traffic. But a murder has been committed and they expose themselves to Tibbs in order to clear themselves and to aid him in his investigation. It's all complicated, perhaps unnecessarily so, what with our hero's loyalty being divided between cops and his informers and red herrings by the dozen being tossed into the proceedings.The script, in short, is short on fuller explanations. The members of the gang are unusuala Japanese girl, a waterfront preacher, a dope pusher and the likebut they merely appear in quickly passing but hardly memorable vignettes.As noted, Sidney Poitier is unflappable and tough but he does occasionally show signs of weariness and a desire to spend more time with Barbara McNair and George and Wanda Spell, who appear briefly as his wife and children, as they did in ""They Call Me Mr. Tibbs."" He can't be blamed, since ""The Organization"" can be rough on super-city sleuths as well as movie-goers who've been through much the same melodramatics before.",1971-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,' Gladiators' Is Shown at Olympia Theater,"Peter Watkins's ""The Gladiators,"" which opened yesterday at the Olympia Theater, concerns a contest known as the Peace Games, played regularly in the foreseeable future, directed by the world's powers, sponsored by an Italian spaghetti company and televised internationally with the purpose of syphoning off man's aggressive urges and thus preserving the peace. In a derelict Swedish factory, two groups of fighters, a Chinese team and a Western team, perform maneuvers with real arms to their own deaths  while, at a safe distance, their generals urge them on and neutral officers push the buttons on a giant machine that is supposed to program the soldiers' reactions and to determine their fates.The machine, the officers, the generals, the soldiers  all belong to something that the film identifies as ""the system,"" something that it clearly regards as a monstrous indignity but about which it offers very little information. Somewhere along the line, a narrator points out that the games, of course, have absolutely nothing to do with keeping the peace  although he never mentions just what they do have to do with.Like most futurist fiction, ""The Gladiators"" is a form of satire. But unlike good futurist fiction, or good satire, it fails to distinguish between friends and enemies, or even to suggest a narrative order in which some distinction might be possible.Thus, the East does evil and the West does evil, the great powers do evil and the emerging nations do evil with them. Officers and men, the establishment and its critics, patriots and protesters, technicians and ideologues  all serve the same rotten ends, and all are dutifully paraded before the camera as if for example's sake. Only one young couple, a British soldier (Richard Friday) and a Chinese militiawoman (Pik-Sen Lin) endanger the system  by instantaneously falling in love, I think, and by running awayuntil a student radical (Jean Pierre Delamour), who doesn't know he's been programed to do it, presses the right button, and the police catch the couple and beat them to death.Although it pretends to deal in political matters, ""The Gladiators"" really has no politicsbut only a universal paranoia masquerading as a sense of urgency. It therefore offers no insights, and only the most commonplace ideas, and unless you are very highly suggestive it is less likely to engender anger than ennui.Minds as muddled as Peter Watkins's may have made good movies, but I doubt that they have tempted fate quite so consistently and tiresomely as Watkins has by repeatedly working in the area of his least competence. After several features (""The Gladiators,"" made in 1969, precedes the recent ""Punishment Park""), his outrage seems by now a commodity  perhaps unsalable, but up for use in whatever anxiety pattern is conveniently at hand.",1971-10-22T05:00:00+0000

Though Torres was holding back, of course, Mailer was impressive. For a middleaged writer, he's a pretty good boxer. He explained that he and Torres had exchanged lessons: He helped Torres by editing his book on Muhammad All and Torres taught him to box. On the evidence of Sting Like a Bee, I'd say Mailer got the better of the bargain. As a beginning writer, Torres reminds me of a mistake some young fighters make: They pick up the mannerisms of their ring idols, but without knowing how to use them. Carrying their hands low like Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali, they get hit, because they can't slip punches like the masters. Mailer is obviously Torres's literary hero, and he has adopted Mailer's vocabulary of machismo, magic and mystification when talking about fighters. His psychologizing is rather like the clinching for which Ernie Terrell was famous: It slows up the action. Sonny Liston said of Terrell: He hug a man more than I hug my wife.

us,Books of The Times,"Putting a book together from morning reviews and weekend pieces is a hazardous business. It's not hard to do, in fact there's nothing easier, but the finished product differs, sometimes startlingly, from the ingredients that went into it. The item that was bright and newsworthy in the daily review appears denatured and flat in book form. Some topics sound so trivial that the space seems wasted; others are so weighty that the space. is inadequate. Names and occasions fade, and they don't loom as sharply in the consciousness of the book buyer as they did in the mind of the man who bought the morning paper. And no matter how they are organized, the books too often suffer from a scrappiness that was absent when the pieces occupied their natural places in the column. Paul Henry Lang, who was music critic of The New York Herald Tribune from 1954 to 1963, believes he has gotten around these objections in Critic at the Opera. By eliminating the critiques of the performances from the reviews, he writes, and omitting topical references, I was left with a sizable body of writings about opera as a work of art. These deletions have certainly altered the complexion of his original articles, but they have also eliminated what many would consider the only valid reason for compiling such a volume in the first place: to reflect with an immediacy hard to duplicate the musical life of the time. By removing all references to performers, performances, untoward occurrences, musical tidbits, memorable personalities, in short by removing all references to the peaks and shallows of musical history, he has in effect destroyed the record and with it all that was quick and alive in those years. What is left is a series of disquisitions on the character and importance of a number of wellknown (and tired) operas. In spite of its title, the book is not a report of the critic at the opera, but of the scholar in his study.",1971-10-22T05:00:00+0000

The theory has been that the Exchange's members could some how pursue their private interests while regulating themselves in the public interest.",1971-10-24T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 'Is There Sex After Death?':Film Documents Quest for the Answer Movie Called Funniest Since 'Bananas',"There are special kinds of people, friends of mine mostly, who go to sex-lecture movies mainly for the lecture. For those, and perhaps a few more, there is now a special kind of movie. It was made by Jeanne and Alan Abel, and it opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous. It is called ""Is There Sex After Death?"" and it is the only really funny movie since Woody Allen's Bananas."" I might have pressed further and said it was the only really funny movie since ""Suburbia Confidential"" (1967)but nobody would have known what I meant.A documentary of sorts, the film begins at Grant's Tomb, home office of the Bureau of Sexological Investigation, from which its leader, Dr. Harrison Rogers (Alan Abel) sets out on a fact-finding tour that takes him across the breadth of America, from a Florida nudist camp to a California cemetery, always investigating and, from people of every station and any profession, always seeking answerse.g.: ""Mr. Nixon, is it possible to have sex in the White House?""Sometimes the film pauses to observe natural phenomena, such as the First Topless String Quartet, or to talk with those for whom natural phenomena have created a way of life, such as the proprietor of a family-style erotic art gallery (""Parents bring their kids""). From time to time Dr. Rogers yields to other professors: the earnest and energetic Dr. Manos (Buck Henry), or the bearded, wise and gently seasoned old Dr. Elevenike (Jim Moran), who is currently ""working on a course in sensuality, for young people.""On one occasion the film falls prey to the temptation of a celebrity interviewHolly Woodlawn, and no match for the talent that surrounds herbut mostly it sticks with serious laborers in their fields, like Robert Downey, the director, or Richard Nixon (Jim Dixon), the President. Some of its happiest moments are spent with Vince Domino (Marshall Efron), a universal man, a filmmaker who has succeeded in exciting everyone's prurient interests and is proud to have made the first X-rated animal picture. Just hearing Vince Domino describe his work recalls us to the simple pleasure of listening to movie plots.I may have given the impression that the film is all talk and no action, and that is not true. There are many demonstrations, an extensive course in breast development (with the superb Iris Brooks as student), and the climactic contest of the International Sex Bowl. But I prefer the talk because it is of such maniacally sustained good humor that nothing that merely happens can match it.Above all, ""Is There Sex After Death?"" is a film that asks a questionand for its perseverance it receives two answers. One, given during a sance by the spirit of a departed garment center worker (Larry Wolf), is a satisfied ""Nothing but . . ."" The other answer comes during an ambulatory graveyard chat between Dr. Rogers and Rubin Carson, my favorite sequence in the movie, in which after hearing much sage sexual advice, Dr. Rogers asks, and Mr. Carson replies, ""No, only affection.""",1971-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: About 'Joe Hill,' Immigrant:Bo Widerberg Movie Opens at 2 Theaters Career of Unionist and His Execution Traced","Bo Widerberg's ""Joe Hill"" is intendedone must assumeas a, poetic appreciation of the song-writing Wobbly, a Swedish immigrant who was tried and convicted for the murder of a Salt Lake City grocer in 1914 and executed the following year by a firing squad in the yard of the Utah State Penitentiary.However, the movie is so irresolute in making assumption about its hero, about his drives and his dreams, and especially about his guilt, that it is scarcely an appreciation of even the mythical Joe Hill, who was resurrected in 1925 in the mighty organizer's ballad written by Alfred Hayes and Earl Robinson. Without meaning to be, I'm sure, Widerberg's ""Joe Hill"" is a mildly reproachful view of the manner in which a nice young man, who likes children and fresh air and music, and who has the political passions of a sincere shop steward, can be turned into a martyr by time and circumstance, with the cold collusion of some of his associates.Very little is known about the real Joe Hill, except that he was born Joel Emmanuel Haaglund, that he came to the United States about 1901 or 1902 at the age of 19, and that by 1910 he had become a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and had been active in a number of strikes and free-speech movements on the West Coast.At the time of his arrest in Salt Lake City, he was recovering from a gunshot wound, which was emphasized by the prosecution as the major point in the circumstantial case brought against him. There continues to be debate on whether or not Joe Hill was guiltyhe always declined to explain his wound on the grounds that it involved a woman's honor, which, in the film anyway, is so suddenly courtly as to be ludicrous.There seems to be, however, very little doubt that the evidence was too flimsy to justify a guilty verdict, and that his execution was a political act, on the part of both the state and Joe Hill himself who, until the end, was cheerfully helping to shape his defeat into a victory. On the night before his execution, he wired William D. Haywood, the labor leader: ""Don't waste time in mourning. Organize.""Widerberg, who acknowledges that very few real facts are known about Joe Hill, has chosen to organize his film as a sappily pastoral ode to a man who, as played by Thommy Berggren, has the clean-cut, utterly nonidiosyncratic character of all great menfrom Julius Caesar and Charlemagne to Stephen Foster and Alexander Graham Bellas they are profiled in juvenile literature of an inspirational nature.With the exception of the early sequences, set in a New York ghetto that is suspiciously picturesque, most of the film takes place in idyllic, fertile landscapes. Joe rides freight trains across the great abundant country, meets colorful, well-fed hoboes, and slips, more or less dreamily, into league with the Wobblies who, according to Widerberg, spend a good deal of their time trying to organize industrial workers in pretty little farming communities.Indeed, ""Joe Hill,"" whose screenplay has all of the substance (and all of the lurching continuity) of a bad musical-comedy libretto, describes so little of the depressed life of the working community, so little of the real vitality (and violence) of the pre-World War I American Labor movement, that the movie becomes a kind of lyrical slander.In his forword to the film, Widerberg quotesfor unfortunate thematic accuracythe slogan carried by women pickets during the bitter, 10-week, 1912 textile strike in Lawrence Mass.: ""We want bread and roses too."" In one way or another, all of the Swedish director's movies have attempted to have their bread and roses too, most successfully in the early ""Ravens End,"" a movie whose lovely surface solemnity is the visual equivalent to the psyche of the young working class artist within.In the subsequent ""Elvira Madigan"" and ""Adalen '31,"" Widerberg's social concerns are still apparent, as they are in ""Joe Hill,"" but now they have become the all but invisible undercarriage for a sadly frivolous movie that has teen dolled up and decorated like a Rose Bowl parade float  and with something of the same artistic impact.I suspect that Widerberg would like us to find analogies between Joe Hill's trial and some contemporary prosecutions, especially of Black Panthers, but that, it seems to me, is a presumption his movie simply is not qualified to make.""Joe Hill,"" which opened yesterday at the Paramount and Sutton Theaters, was photographed principally in Sweden, with some locations shot in this country. Most of the dialogue is in English.",1971-10-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Arrabal's 'Viva la Muerte',"Having seen and disliked Alexandro Jodorowsky's screen adaptation of an early Arrabal play, ""Fando and Lis,"" and having duly noted the symbols of horror, the rituals of disgust, the obligatory and unfelt eroticism, and the pervasive allegory, I was in no way prepared for Fornando Arrabal's own first film, ""Viva la Muerte,"" in which those elements reappearbut charged now with an intensity and a complex vitality that I have not seen equalled in recent cinema, especially not in any recent cinema of the absurd. ""Viva la Muerte"" (""Long Live Death"") has begun a series of midnight screenings at the St. Marks Cinema and, though no perfect movie, it seems to me inescapably a major work.Its hero (Mahdi Chauch), a young boy, is also named Fando, and its story closely parallels the early life history of Fernando Arrabal, whose mother betrayed her leftist husband to the Fascists during the Spanish civil warand who taught her son that his father was dead, whereas in fact he was miserably imprisoned. Fando searches for his father and never finds him, as Arrabal never found his, but he remembers him and imagines his fateand in a series of harsh monochrome fantasy passages, memory and imagination largely define the unique life of the film.The imagery of ""Viva la Muerte""the defecation, self-mortification, strange and unusual punishmentreads like an illustrative footnote to some Surrealist manifesto. It is as if the famous razor across the eyeball that opens Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" had never lost its cutting edge, its sharp capacity to peel back fair surfaces and reveal the soft sources of corruption underneath. As an esthetic program this has its limits, but within those limits it allows for insights not only of hard brilliance but also of a sometimes shockingly compassionate humanity.The enemy in ""Viva la Muerte"" seems not so much the Fascist state or its police, as the women who fear it and collaborate with it: the mother, an aunt, a grandmother, all in black, like ministers of death, and yet in mourning for the suffering caused by their own ministry. The mourning is genuine, as is the crueltyand it is Arrabal's great distinction not to undercut the one by the other, but rather to hold each in balance so that no contradictory impulse is lost on us. He is fortunate in having as the mother Nuria Espert, an actress of striking beauty, strong and graceful gestures and an emotional range that takes her from near frenzy to a languid sensuality without ever losing contact with a role that might seem to comprise half a dozen different characters.Near the end of ""Viva la Muerte"" it is discovered that Fando has tuberculosis (as Arrabal bad), and he is taken to a hospital ship and eventually operated on. From his recovery room he is abducted by a mysterious little girl, also in black, who keeps a pet turkey and whom he has known and casually tormented all through the film. A captive now of his own sweet bitter fate he is wheeled off into a part of the gorgeous arid landscape that is the film's locale. And by, and girl, and great improbable bird enter a configuration that outlasts the generations and is not explained but is somehow understood as an emblem of unending torture and delight.",1971-10-26T05:00:00+0000

Thundering, clanging, spilling blood like catsup, they run for exactly 189 minutes. Neither amounts to a hil of beans. One of them, the least painful, doesn't even try.This is ""Captain Apache,"" whose mean, funny opening line, not suitable to a family newspaper, pegs the entire jape. Anyway, this slapdash slaughterfest has Lee Van Cleef, as an iron-jawed Indian captain in the Union Army, trying to solve an officer's murder. Peering in, under the broiling sun, are such artists as Carroll Baker and Stuart Whitman, who must have been hankering for Hollywood greenery.Generally, under Alexander Singer's direction, the film simply lets fly, as the chips and bodies fall. In the last reel the story rather snugly works in a surprise or two aboard one of those old-time trains, carring the principals. You can't criticize a choo-choo.""A Town Called Hell"" could have used one. Simulating Old Mexico, it looks even more sun-baked than the other picture, with some revolutionaries, soldiers, civilians and a priest murderously bunched up inside a fortress. With Robert Parrish's direction trying to add tone and dignity, the film lumbers uneasily between allegorical drama and bang-bang adventure.How a fine actor like Robert Shaw got trapped into this stumps us.

us,Screen: One Night in a Gay Bar,"""Some of My Best Friends Are . . ."" is a very sad gay movie about one night  Christmas Eve in a homosexual New York bar called the Blue Jay, a long, narrow firetrap with a bar in front and a large room in back for dancing, Christmas carols, frottage, hysterics and the exchanging of tearful confidences.In almost every way, including its ad campaign, it's a second-rate spin-off from ""The Boys in the Band."" Yet, because of this second-rateness, which includes hammy performances and a sentimental screenplay that sounds as if it had just been let out after 30 years in a closet, ""Some of My Best Friends Are . . ."" may well be more accurate than the slicker, wittier ""Boys in the Band.""When most of the characters in a movie are as full of dopey sentiments, as well as of self-hatred and of self-exploitation, as the movie that contains them, it's almost impossible to differentiate between an intentional second-rateness and serious moviemaking of no great quality.It's impossible, that is, until it becomes obvious that Mervyn Nelson, who both write the screenplay and directed the film, shares with his characters not only a large amount of boozy self-pity, but also the sort of romanticism that permits characters to define themselves-without ironyin the clichs of old-fashioned Hollywood soap opera.There are echoes of ancient Bette Davis laments when one young man wonders, aloud, if he's been living a lie, and when another fellow, a handsome Swiss ski instructor, tells his married male lover. ""Facing death does not take courage. Two men facing a life together does.""Better performances might possibly have given some life to such lines and situations, but under Mr. Nelson's solemn direction, they sound like parodies of real emotions.At one point or another in the film, Mr. Nelson manages to discover and exploit every stereotype of homosexual literature. In addition to the confused married man, there are the kid who is new to the game (""I'm from Nebraska and this is my first Christmas away from home""); the hustler who hates himself; the wise-cracking swish; the defrocked choirmaster; the straight guy who comes into the Blue Jay by mistake, and the angry mother who tells her homosexual son that from now on she considers him dead.Not all of the performances are bad, but I find it curious that the only decent performances are given by women  Sylvia Syms, as the Blue Jay's tough-talking sentimental hostess; by Rue McClanahan, as a rich, aging beauty who seeks out gay company, and by Candy Darling, the Andy Warhol superstar-transvestite who, in drag, looks like a pretty Barbra Streisand.Carleton Carpenter appears in what seems to be a cameo role as a prissy, eyeball-rolling old queen. As with the performances of the rest of the actors, I couldn't really tell whether his was purposely grotesque or just bad. Within the context of the rest of the movie, I suspect the latter.""Some of My Best Friends Are . . ."" opened yesterday at the 59th Street Twin Theaters.",1971-10-28T05:00:00+0000

us,'Bless the Beasts & Children' Bows,"In his latest movie, ""Bless the Beasts & Children,"" which opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and Trans-Lux West, Stanley Kramer directs his attention to the American buffalo. Actually, he divides his attention between buffalo, who are going to be shot, and a group of six right-minded misfit rich kids who set out to save them. The kids, you see, are really like buffaloa trapped and endangered speciesand if they save the beasts they save themselves. I don't think I am being too subtle in making this point. The film makes it perhaps three dozen times, and the film is never too subtle.The kids all attend a Western riding camp (""Send Us a Boy; We'll Send You a Cowboy"") where they share the misfits' bunk with an incredibly Yahoo counselor (Ken Swofford) who one day takes them to watch him help destroy a corral-full of superfluous buffalo. The kids are horrified. More buffalo will be killed in the future, and so the kids set out by horse, on foot, by stolen truckto perform their defiant act of mercy. Throughout their mission of mercy they experience many crises, and for each crisis somebody has a flashback that explains him.One kid isn't loved by his mother; another is loved too much; a pair of brothers suffer from sibling rivalry; one boy's father pays him no attention, while another boy's father pays him so much attention that he gets flustered and messes up his bar mitzvah. Everybody's character is thus an open book, a text book, and this raises a problem that the film doesn't faceas opposed to all the Problems it is so eager to face.What would have happened if the kids weren't disturbed? Would they still have freed buffalo if their parents had loved them  and/or kept their proper distance? Or would they have adopted the monstrous callousness that the film sees as ""normal""without, however, doubting its normality? It seems reasonable to question the thesis of a thesis movie as feeble as this one. And although there is nothing else in Stanley Kramer's work to admire, I think it is worth pointing out that this time he also fails to deliver his standard humanitarian message.""Bless the Beasts & Children"" misuses a number at Western settings, several stock items of adventure and suspense, and all of its actors. It is difficult to discuss performance in a film such as this, in which most resources remain basically untapped. But before the movie ended I came to dislike Barry Robins who played his role as the maniacal master sergeant of the group with more hoked-up emotion than seemed necessary. And I came to admire Bill Mumy, the long-haired laconic leader, who managed to suggest a certain subversive independence and a depth of personality the movie could never begin to fathom.",1971-10-29T05:00:00+0000

us,Callas Stars in Pasolini 'Medea',"Pier Paolo Pasolini's very free, very barbaric ""Medea,"" which is less an adaptation of the Euripides play than an interpretation of it, is not completely successful, but it is so full of eccentric imagination and real passion that I'd rather sit through the 10 worst minutes of it than the five best minutes of Michael Cacoyannis's reverential adaptation of ""The Trojan Women.""If your priorities are such, Pasolini's ""Medea"" can be an excellent argument for the kind of literal movie made by Cacoyannis, in which the audience is treated to an articulate recitation of a text that has survived 2,400 years with its power intact. This sort of film provides a valuable service if you can't read, or if you never have access to decent stage productions.""Medea"" is something else entirely. Pasolini has the monumental and marvelous presumption to put himself ahead of Euripides (who was not, after all, a moviemaker), in an attempt to translate into film terms the sense of a prehistoric time, place and intelligence in which all myths and rituals were real experiences.This is Pasolini's interest, and in casting Maria Callas in the title role he has visualized his theme with extraordinary success, I was never much taken by Callas's acting at the Metropolitanit tended to be a bit broad for even that broad stage. Under Pasolini's direction, she becomes a fascinating cinematic presence, possessed with a power that has, I suspect, less to do with an ability to act, in conventional terms, anyway, than with her grace of movement (which is a part of acting, I admit), and with her magnificent face.The profile, which Pasolini obviously adores, looks like the model for something on an ancient coin. Full face, you see a bone structure that defies all enemies, including age. The huge, dark eyes seem so heavily lashed that the effort taken just to shift a glance becomes the physical equivalent of the emotional upheavals within the mind.Almost half of the film, which has practically no dialogue, concerns itself with the events that precede the Euripides playwith Jason's early education at the feet (four) of a philosophical centaur, and with the subsequent voyage of the Argonauts to Colchis, where, with Medea's help, Jason successfully steals the Golden Fleece.These sequences are brilliant and brutal, and run the very close risk of seeming ludicrous. Pasolini evokes Medea's heritage in terms that I'm sure Euripides would find unspeakableincluding a human sacrifice shown in respectful detailin order to establish the basis for her later, terrifying bloodbath in Corinth when Jason decides to take a new wife.Pasolini's Medea is no longer a rather ill-tempered woman spurned, an early Women's Liberationist, a mother guilty of the sort of murders that were as appalling to the ancient Greeks as it was to a Queens jury earlier this year.In Pasolini's conception, Medea is a primeval soul who erupts almost spontaneously when transplanted into a civilization ruled by order. And this, I think, is where the film goes awry.There is no real conflict between Pasolini's conception and Euripides's Pasolini's supplements the other's, but because nothing in Pasolini's imagery in the scenes in Corinth is equal to the passion of the original text, or to Pasolini's own scenes early in the film, the movie seems to go thin and absurdly melodramatic.Some of this has to do with the performers with which Pasolini has surrounded CallasJason, for example, looks like the rather nice, blank-faced Olympic athlete that Guiseppi Gentile, who plays him, is. One also begins to become aware of the dcor and the costumes, which are beautiful, but would not look out of place in a Broadway musical, and I, for one, was brought up short when Jasonfriend to Hercules, future son-in-law of Creonis shown blowing kisses to Medea, daughter of the Sun.""Medea"" is uneven, but I admire the reckless courage of its conception, even when it goes wrong. When it is right, as in the poetic and funny prologue, delivered by the centaur (Laurent Terzief), and in its eerie evocation of Medea's world, which (according to Pasolini) is our subconscious world, it is superb.""Medea"" opened yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Cinema.",1971-10-29T05:00:00+0000

Early that evening, I drove to Attica to relieve some doctors who had been standing by outside the prison walls. Upon arriving, I learned that no one knew anything definite about the physical condition of the hostages still held by the inmates, although there were rumors that many were dead or seriously injured. Indeed, at that time no one even knew how many there were. I wanted to find out more if I could. After persuading a State Health Department official to take me through the main gate, I encountered Superintendent Vincent R. Mancusi in the administration building. Once convinced that I was a doctor, he asked me to go upstairs with him, and there I was introduced to State Correction Commissioner Russell G. Oswald, Deputy Commissioner Walter Dunbar and others. While they had naturally been extremely concerned about the hostages seized that morning, they had apparently only recently been considering the feasibility of getting a doctor into the rebelheld sector of the prison. After some discussion, it was decided that if the prisoners guaranteed my safeconduct I would go in with the threeman negotiating team scheduled to meet with the rebels later that evening. It was shortly after 7, then, when I set out on my first visit to the hostage compound in D yard.",1971-10-31T05:00:00+0000

At least they are not quite so automatically hostile. Even the big university art departments where realism of some sort was never entirely out of favor, now seem to accord it a new respect.
