If I knew Only the herbs and simples of the wood, Rue, cinquefoil, gill, vervain and agrimony, Bluevetch and trillium, hawkweed, sassafras, Milkweeds and murky brakes, quaint pipes and sundew, And rare and virtuous roots, which in these woods Draw untold juices from the common earth, Untold, unknown, and I could surely spell Their fragrance, and their chemistry apply By sweet affinities to human flesh, Driving the foe and stablishing the friend,0, that were much, and I could be a part Of the round day, related to the sun And planted world, and full executor Of their imperfect functions. But these young scholars, who invade our hills, Bold as the engineer who fells the wood, And travelling often in the cut he makes, Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not, And all their botany is Latin names. The old men studied magic in the flowers, And human fortunis in astronomy, And an omnipotence in chemistry, Preferring things to names, for these were men, Were unitarians of the united world, And, wheresoever their clear eyebeams fell, They caught the footsteps of the SAME. Our eyes Are armed, but we are strangers to the stars, And strangers to the mystic beast and bird, And strangers to the plant and to the mine. The injured elements say, Not in us; And night and day, ocean and continent, Fire, plant and mineral say, Not in us, And haughtily return us stare for stare. For we invade, them impiously for gain; We devastate them unreligiously, And coldly ask their pottage, not their love. Therefore they shove us from them, yield to us Only what to our griping toil is due; But the sweet affluence of love and song, The rich results of the divine consents Of man and earth, of world beloved and lover, The nectar and ambrosia, are withheld; And in the midst of spoils and slaves, we thieves And pirates of the universe, shut out Daily to a more thin and outward rind, Turn pale and starve. Therefore, to our sick eyes, The stunted trees look sick, the summer short, Clouds shade the sun, which will not tan our hay, And nothing thrives to reach its natural term; And life, shorn of its venerable length, Even at its greatest space is a defeat, And dies in anger that it was a dupe; And, in its highest noon and wantonness, Is early frugal, like a beggar's child; Even in the hot pursuit of the best aims And prizes of ambition, checks its hand, Like Alpine cataracts frozen as they leaped, Chilled with a miserly comparison Of the toy's purchase with the length of life.",1974-07-04T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:' Charge of Machete' Shows Cuban Strife,"""First Charge of the Machete"" is an overly fancy Cuban variation on American television's old ""You Are There"" series, those re-creations of great moments in history as they might have been recorded by reporters equipped with hand-held cameras and 20-20 foresight.The time is October, 1868, when Cuban nationalists in Oriente province rebelled against the Spanish colonial regime, captured the city of Bayamo and, later, decimated the Spanish troops sent in to put down the rebellion. The principal instrument of the Cubans was the machete, the lowly farm tool that was elevated to the status of lethal weapon in a time of crisis.The film, which was made in 1969, was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room Sunday and will be repeated there at noon and midnight today and tomorrow.No matter how cleverly planned and ingeniously executed, there is always something bogus about these attempts to pretend that history happened yesterday, when sound cameras were on hand to record the events. The more clever and ingenious, in fact, the more bogus.It is the conceit of Manuel Octavio Gomez, who directed this film, that motion-picture photography of 1868 would look like very crude Mathew Brady, even though the sound-recording equipment is on a par with today's. ""First Charge of the Machete"" is almost impossible to look atthe images being all black or white with no intermediate shades. It not only is a terrible strain on the eyes, but it also makes the white subtitles invisible at least half the time.Mr. Octavio Gomez's attempt to give contemporary purpose and passion to events first obscures and then ultimately overwhelms them: we're too busy noticing the elaborately designed cinema to give much heed to the vrit behind it.He also apparently thinks that 19th-century newsreel cameramen would have been absolutely committed to close-ups and to movement. If the subject of an interview is not moving around, then the camera moves around him. Nothing is allowed to be static. At one point this incessant movement gave me the impression that the director somehow resented buildings and trees for not being able to walk.",1974-07-05T05:00:00+0000

The Maine coastline, when measured as the gull flies from Kittery in the south to West Quoddy Head in the north, is 230 miles long, but if one follows the wild shoreline of bays, peninsulas, inlets and headlands, the distance is 3,500 miles. Maine has fewer than a million yearround residents, but last year its mountains, lakes and seaside resorts attracted more than 4 million visitors who spent more than $400million.

He belongs, without question, to the great line of avantgarde masters who made of French painting in the 19th century the principal fulcrum of modernism, He thus prepared the way for all those rejections and suspensions of convention that, in the 20th century, reduced the very concept of tradition to a term of opprobrium. Yet Valery was not exaggerating when he spoke of Degas as an artist nourished on Racine and the old music. No other artist of his time, either in the Academy or the avantgarde, was more conscious of the glories of the past, or more reverent of its standards and distinctions. Everything about the modern worldits politics, its morals and its irestelseems to have offended him deeply, yet he never allowed his piety for the past to modify or falsify his vision. There was something unmistakeably heroic in his fidelity to the truth of his own emotions, and it was upon this truth that the great achievements of his art were based.",1974-07-07T05:00:00+0000

And there is one vast and important difference. The marvelous, oldfashioned clambake demands 600 pounds of seaweed. With the washboiler type you can settle for a child's portion24 pounds. Bonackersthe natives who were born on the Eastern tip of Long Island (and specifically in the vicinity of Acabonack)have their own method testing the doneness of a washboiler clambake. They put a raw potato in the center of the top layer of seaweed. When the potato is tender without being mushy, it is time to feast.

But The Captive Mind is far more than a work of political invective; it is an elegy for destroyed values and, indirectly, an autobiography. In it, Milosz argues that Marxism had not been a belief for Polish intellectuals so much as a form of escape from the anguish of personal identity. Twenty years later, the book remains one of the finest ever written about the lure and the inner cost of totalitarian ideology. It is also a key to Milosz's conviction that poetry must be a moral as well as an esthetic discipline, that poetry must translate the anguish of personal experience into a framework of values which defend against skepticism and sterile anger and thereby defend against the lure of ideology.",1974-07-07T05:00:00+0000

They are accompanied on the ride by Larry's girl, a parolee named Mary (Susan George), who has a good figure, a pretty face and even fewer brains than Larry or Deke.Although it's one long chase (from where to where is never known), ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" is as aimless as its dimly seen characters, who talk a lot of dreadful, cute-tough dialogue but are never recognizable except as the actors who play them.Even that factor isn't much help in enjoying the film. At least half of it is devoted to semi-spectacular examples of trick driving and multi-vehicle smash-ups, at which point you are perfectly aware that the actors have been replaced by stuntmen.

us,Screen: 'The Tamarind Seed' Arrives:The Cast,"Blake Edwards, a very talented director of comedy (""The Pink Panther."" ""What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?"" and others), has disappeared. Absorbed, perhaps, into the first image we see in his new film, ""The Tamarind Seed,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall.That image is an eyeball but it's no ordinary eyeball. It's an eyeball so huge, so clear, so pure, so all-seeing and so fiercely knowing that it could be the mind of God. When the camera pulls back we see the eyeball to be one of a pair belonging to Julie Andrews (Mrs. Edwards), who has been the star and, I assume, the inspiration of two of Mr. Edwards's more recent films. The first was ""Darling Lili,"" a charming comedy with music in which Miss Andrews played a World War I spy working stanchly if wrong-headedly for the Kaiser's victory. The second is ""The Tamarind Seed,"" a film of the sort of staggering sober-sided romantic foolishness one seldom encounters outside the pages of first-person-narrated gothic fiction written by Victoria Holt and her sisters of the virgin quill.""The Tamarind Seed"" is not gothic fiction, technically speaking. It has the form of a contemporary love story set against a background of cold war intrigue stretching from London and Paris to Barbados and Canada. But don't be fooled by the time and places. The game is given away by the film's total absorption in the chastity of its heroine, a woman who considers a goodnight kiss as the first, irrevocable step toward total degradation.Mr. Edwards's screenplay, though it changes some geographical details, is an unfortunately faithful adaptation of the book by Evelyn Anthony, a novelist who attempts to avoid bad writing by more or less standing on its back: ""Looking up, Judith found every clich speeding through her mind. The moon was like a pearl, the stars were like diamonds, the palm trees waved and the crickets sang. It was all so corny and impossible until one saw the reality.""""The Tamarind Seed"" is about Judith Farrow (Miss Andrews), a plucky widow and the veteran of a recently ended six-month affair with a married man, a fellow who is shown by the film to be of such clottishness that it does permanent damage to any sympathy we might have for poor Judith. On a holiday in Barbados, where she has gone to find herself, Judith meets Feodor Sverdlov (Omar Sharif), a tall, dark, handsome man to whom Judith feelshow should I say it?strangely drawn.There is, however, a problem. Judith is the assistant to a Very Important Person in the British Home Office in London and Feodor is the Soviet air attach in Paris. Did they meet just by chance? Is he trying to recruit her for spy work by seducing her? The British Intelligence officer (Anthony Quayle) attached to the Paris embassy thinks so. And this is what Feodor tells his boss, craggy old General Golitsyn (Oscar Homolka).What in heaven's name is a plucky girl to think? Or, as Judith says: ""This whole thing has gotten out of proportion.""The movie hops back and forth between embassies in London and Paris. Thoroughly mixed into the love story are subsidiary plots about a Russian spy highly placed in Allied diplomatic circles and the attempts to defect of a Soviet agent.The supporting performances are not at all bad, especially those of Mr. Homolka, Mr. Quayle, Dan O'Herlihy (as the British minister in Paris) and Sylvia Sims (as his unhappy wife). Mr. Sharif is animated and gallant as he gives Miss Andrews her line cues, which is his principal function.Miss Andrews, who can be a marvelous comedienne, is allowed to be funny here. However, instead of appearing vulnerable, she seems totally removed and above everything, as if she were a ballroom chandelier. There's no time for a performance when the camera insists on examining her with such love and admiration.",1974-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Sontag's 'Promised Lands':Treatment of Israel Is at Screening Room,"Susan Sontag's film about Israel, ""Promised Lands,"" which was made in October and November of 1973, isn't intended to be a documentary. However, that country's situation is just too factually complex to be treated as a tone poem. In an effort to eschew talking heads, there's a lot of voice-over narration, as people walk through the streets, but sometimes we don't know who's talking. There's some handsome photography  especially of figures in landscapes  although what's seen and what is said often don't go together, and many shots seem irrelevant. The movie opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room.One's ready to be moved by the subject. But the viewer almost has to function as an editor, since the selection of the footage is so haphazard. Hence the emotions of or about Israel don't come through, even though glimpses of graveyards and corpses and the consciousness of Auschwitz, the lingering shock of the October attack and the awareness that the struggle between Arabs and Jews may be insoluble  as one man says, ""There's no solution to a tragedy""  run through the marrow of the picture. Throughout, the ideas and the people and the machines of war are examined from a distance, as though everything had been observed through some kind of mental gauze.The Israelis  particularly those in robes  are filmed as if they were extremely foreign or exotic. Also, Israel seems like a nearly all-male country, since few women appear and none have been interviewed. There are a few sympathetic words for the Arabs, but their existence seems shadowy and abstract  almost as bloodless as the statues in a wax museum devoted to Israeli history.Two scenes are particularly disturbing. At a mass burial, the camera rushes in on a weeping profile in a way that's intrusive  because we've been given so little sense of the dead or even of the war. Later, in a hospital, a shell-shocked soldier relives his battlefield experiences under drugs, while a psychiatrist and the hospital staff recreate the noises of shooting and bombing. (This is said to be therapeutic for the patient. The staff looks as though it rather enjoys the task.) It should be devastating to watch this man burrow into the pillow, shudder, dive beneath the bed. But these moments have been filmed with such confusion that we can't respond to his suffering  indeed, suffering's hardly conveyed in ""Promised Lands."" Because the movie is dull and badly organized, the war is made to seem unreal.Unlike Claude Lanzmann's very fine documentary, ""Israel Why,"" which was shown at the 1973 New York Film Festival, the Sontag film won't increase your understanding of Israel. Perhaps the latter should have been a book instead of a film.",1974-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Norma Jean',"You know that you're in for a festival of innocencewhich will almost certainly be betrayedin almost any movie that opens with a shot of sunlight dropping through leafy trees while music soars and a young couple scampers through the woods. (Well before ""Jules and Jim,"" people running outdoors meant happiness on the screen, as long as the weather was good.) It helps if the couple is blond, if they have an affinity for a pure white rabbit and if the landscape contains crickets to provide some blameless sounds. Then all that's needed are some forces of corruption  which will be sure to stone the rabbit.Juleen Compton's ""The Plastic Dome of Norma Jean,"" which is playing at the First Avenue Screening Room today and tomorrow, is an infantile ripoff of the Marilyn Monroe legend. In case the title fails to zap your reflexes, there are some early shots inside a truck that refer directly to Clark Gable and Monroe in ""The Misfits.""This Norma Jean is a clairvoyant whose talents are exploited by cruel materialists until she nearly goes bats and is finally wiped out. Sharon Henesy has been directed to speak in a quavery little voice laced with aspirates, to heave with distress and clutch her stomach while others grin or chortle wickedly, and to use regression to suggest suffering. She seems about 16 when the movie begins, but soon appears to be 12 and then rapidly retreats to 6.The film was made in 1967, but it seems more antique than that, because of the elderly rock music as well as the insistence on the purity of youth. (Several New York actors  Robert Gentry, Marco St. John, and Skip Hinnantare on hand, along with Sam Waterston, who seems to be avoiding the camera.) Throughout, the strained and artificial vision of doomed innocence serves as a reminder that it's fatal to fool with a myth if you can't deliver the comedy that enhanced it. For all the whimsy, ""Norma Jean"" is a harmless picture. And yet it's discomforting to be embarrassed in the name of a dead person  whose death has been worked over so often.",1974-07-12T05:00:00+0000

It was the work of a literary apprentice who showed himself to have greater range in subsequent novels, Morning in Antibes and Indian Summer. My own favorite is Morning in Antibes (a choice the present novel, with the same setting, does nothing to alter). It is a strange mixture of a foundering marriage and the central character's friendship with an Algerian refugee, saying little about the marriage but telling volumes about the way sympathy of a political and personal kind is generated. In that book, the Riviera was a hothouse of steamy air and unexpected blossoms. In Spreading Fires Mr. Knowles's Riviera is again exotic, but here it's hard to keep from thinking that it's really only expensive, and that if you had enough money you could go to pieces there, too.",1974-07-14T05:00:00+0000

At age 11, the boy is shipped to a rich aunt on his father's side, who introduces him to snobbery. At a succession of prep schools, Archer learns that brutality is ecumenical.

It was she, for example, who established that Field Marshal General Cinque was Donald DeFreeze, an escaped convict. Mrs. Baker's reporting bit so close to home that she was subjected to several death threats. In the realm of fantasy, Grove Press, in conjunction with Dell, has a novel out that was actually written several years before the kidnapping but foretold many of its aspects. The novel was called Black Abductor, was written by James Rusk Jr. under the pseudonym Harrison James and published by an obscure porno publisher in 1972. The GroveDell version, however, is called Abduction: Fiction Before Fact and includes a preface by New York Post editor Al Ellenberg detailing the parallels between the novel and the reallife story.",1974-07-14T05:00:00+0000

But there's something about an island. The owners of this one had enough romance in their souls (and money in the bank) to consider it worthwhile to snake a power cable 20 miles across the bottom of the bay from the mainland, to set off 2,000 miniblasts of dynamite in order to lay the foundation properly, to ship all the raw materials in on barges and to maintain a 30man building crew who camped out on the island during the construction. A modular system devised by the architect, C. Blakeway Millar, allowed whole sections of the house to be assembled in a Toronto workshop, then shipped to the island. This permitted some saving in onsite labor costs. But such Herculean efforts come high and the owners, members of a prominent Toronto family, did not worry about cutting corners.

That opinion, as connoisseurs of historical recordings may already have suspected, was based wholly on a MignonWelte piano roll performance that appeared about a decade ago transferred onto a longplay disk. Fortunately, I gave my opinion of Debussy's pianism in the presence of a pianist who did not need records, historical or otherwise, to know how the French composer played. The pianist, Rudolph Ganz, was born 15 years after Debussy and died in Chicago only two years ago at age 95.

They appeal, in other words, to such fanciful concepts as mind, feeling, consciousness, and so on.

us,Screen: Dreams Rampant in 'Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz':The Cast,"Duddy Kravitz (Richard Dreyfuss) is an 18-year-old Canadian Jewish boy with the face of an angelic WASP. Bute he has his problems. He's not only Jewish, he's very poor. Also, the time is the mid-nineteen-forties, when the other comers who came before Duddy had already invented the light bulb, the radio, the Toni Home Permanent and Kleenex.""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,"" which opened yesterday at the Baronet and Forum Theaters, is the funny, fantastic and often moving story of Duddy's adventures as he desperately tries to establish himself as a comer. By hook and by crook and by studying books like Willard Funk's ""It Pays to Increase Your Word Power.""Duddy waits on tables, drives a taxi, smuggles dope, becomes a film producer (for his own Dudley Kane Enterprises), rents out pinball machines and dabbles in odds and ends of other occupations, including forgery.""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" is a Canadian production that was filmed mostly in and around Montreal. It was written by Mordecai Richler, the Canadian author who wrote the original novel, and directed by Ted Kotcheff, the Canadian film director, none of whose earlier films (""Outback,"" ""Life at the Top"") are anywhere near as good as this.Perhaps because of the close collaboration between Mr. Richler and Mr. Kotcheff, and because of the obviously high regard the director has for the author and his work, the film looks very much like a novelist's movie. Such an abundance of visual and narrative detail is essentially literary.This could mean disaster for a movie but not this time. It's true that the frantic pace and the cramming of so many incidents into the film results in certain problems; the continuity is often sketchy and some characters seem less like people than vivid apparitions.Yet the manic, fragmented structure of the film is an almost perfect reflection of Duddy's state of mind as he goes barging from one get-rich-quick scheme to the next, never quite sure where he's headed nor how he's gotten as far as he has without being arrested.When Duddy latches on to Mr. Friar (Denholm Elliott), a perpetually sloshed, blacklisted film director of dubious achievements, and sets up a company to film weddings and bar-mitzvahs, the movie takes on the air of a slightly lunatic fairy tale. Their first production, ""Happy Bar-Mitzvah, Bernie!"", which we are allowed to see, is a riotously abrasive home-movie that cross-cuts between shots of Bernie's nice, middle-class bar-mitzvah and shots of Zulu rites, Hitler, a circumcision ceremony, storm troops marching, the bar-mitzvah feast and a man eating razor blades.It is superbly loony, a bit frightening and riveting, which is, I suspect, how we're supposed to feel about Duddy who, as played by Mr. Dreyfuss (the intellectual schoolboy in ""American Graffiti""), is part cblean-cut conman, part corrupted prophet.""It's little money-grubbers like Kravitz that cause anti-Semitism,"" says a Jewish friend. His rich Uncle Benjy (Joseph Wiseman), who has a portrait of Trotsky on the wall, describes himself as a socialist and owns a blouse factory, calls Duddy ""a pushy Jew boy"" and says, ""People like you make me sick."" But then a wealthy Jewish scrap-metal dealer who has befriended Duddy reminds him: ""It's war. It's war and the white man has all the guns.""The film's attempt to cover so much ground reinforces the feeling that we're watching a kind of urban fable. I have no idea how much time passes in the course of the picture. Duddy's successes and disasters follow upon each other as quickly as those of Dick Whittington. They seem almost magical.This is responsible, I think, for the special appeal of ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" and differentiates it from the usual literature about unscrupulous ambition, most of which is pious and dull and goes without saying.There's not a bad performance in the film. In addition to the actors already mentioned, one should also cite Jack Warden who, as Duddy's father, has an especially funny Richlerian monologue at the beginning of the film, Micheline Lanctt, as the French-Canadian girl whom Duddy uses so meanly, and Randy Quaid (the prisoner in ""The last Detail"") as Virgil, an American gentile and epileptic who becomes one of Duddy's most willing victims.It's Virgil's fondest dream to unite the world's epileptics into an organization that would be rather like the B'nai Brith, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Mattachine Society.""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" is an alternately sad and hilarious movie of dreams rampant.",1974-07-15T05:00:00+0000

He looks a little bit like Leon Errol, but he acts a lot more like a souped-up version of Edgar Kennedy.In the time the late Mr. Kennedy would have used to go through one slow burn, Mr. De Funes can experience three completely disconnected rages, register a couple of alarmed double takes and survive one or two near-fatal prat falls. He's a two-reel comedian for the jet age, when, of course, no one is making two-reel comedies any more.This means that a feature film like ""The Mad Adventures of 'Rabbi' Jacob"" uses up an awful lot of Mr. De Funes very quickly. It's a credit to Gerard Oury, the director and co-author of the screenplay, and to the rollicking bad temper and bigotry of the star that so much of ""The Mad Adventures of 'Rabbi' Jacob"" is so funny so much of the time.The movie, in French with English subtitles, opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and Beacon Theaters.In ""The Mad Adventure of 'Rabbi' Jacob,"" Mr. De Funes plays a furiously prejudiced bourgeois businessman for whom life is almost insupportable because the world isn't inhabited exclusively by white French Catholics. As a result of a series of terrible coincidences he finds himself (1) sought by the police as a political assassin, (2) up to his chin in a vat of green bubble gum, (3) chased by a group of Arab terrorists, (4) the hostage of an Arab nationalist hero and (5) disguised as an American rabbi making his first visit in 50 years to his Parisian birthplace.Supporting the star who works tirelesslyand mostly with successfor laughs, are a number of fine sight gags and some very good supporting actors, including Suzy Delair, who plays Mr. De Funes's wife, a bossy woman with a passion for dentistry.",1974-07-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"' My Name Is Nobody,' Puts Fabled West on Film:The Cast","Sergio Leone's ""My Name Is Nobody"" is the kind of Western that only an immensely appreciative and witty Italian film maker could make. It stars Henry Fonda, one of Hollywood's most noble performers, as the greatest of the old West's gunslingers, and Terence Hill, one of Italy's newest young actors with an anglicized name, as the blond, intensely blue-eyed Nobody who goads, pushes and finally shepherds the older man safely into history.The film, an Italian-French-German co-production that was photographed in New Mexico, Colorado and Spain, opened yesterday at the Loew's State 2, Orpheum and Murray Hill Theaters.Mr. Leone did not actually direct the movie, a job that was handled by Tonino Valerii, a former assistant to Mr. Leone (""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" etc.), the man who gave the so-called spaghetti Westerns class.Yet it very much looks like a Leone film and, I suspect, it is. It's called ""a Sergio Leone presentation,"" and it's based on his idea. In addition, it's filled with Leone observations about a West he originally encountered in old Hollywood movies.The time is 1899, midnight for the 19th century, when Jack Beauregard (Fonda), the fastest gun still alive, is making his way toward New Orleans and a one-way passage to Europe, where, he assumes, no one will try to pick a fight with him in bars along the Via Veneto. En route to New Orleans, he meets a mysterious young man who says he is Nobody (Hill) whose skills with a gun match his own and who doesn't want to see the great Jack Beauregard fade quietly into anonymity.At times Nobody seems to be a malignant clown who wants nothing more than to ridicule the older man. At still other times he talks half-seriously to Beauregard about ways in which the older man can realize his potential as a legend. Nobody thinks it would be nice if Beauregard single-handedly took on the 150 members of the fabled Wild Bunch (not yet gone to seed as shown in the Sam Peckinpah film), and so arranges this spectacular battle.The plot of ""My Name Is Nobody"" makes less sense as narrative than as a device on which to hang a series of incidents that are variations on the theme. In this fabled West, life is a continuing series of contests, in bar-rooms, on main streets and on vast plains where two opposing forces miles apart, come together so inevitably and so perfectly it seems they must be equipped with bat-radar.Though it may be too schematic for the taste of many Americans, ""My Name Is Nobody"" is filled with tumuluous beautifully choreographed action sequences that are so bloodless (a change from the early Leone films) they seem to be slapstick. The style of exaggeration is evident even in the extraordinary clarity of the images and of the sound, so that when we hear the rasping of a straight razor going over a week-old beard, it's as if we were being made aware of each whisker's fate.Mr. Hill is surprisingly effective and sometimes very funny, in a role that is an impossible mixture of Puck, the stage manager in ""Our Town,"" Shane and conventional Ryan O'Neal. Mr. Fonda, as always, is firmly down-to-earth, creating a specific character of the sort that has little truck with the Leonelike introspection. He's a man of action at the end of his career.""My Name Is Nobody"" is terribly knowing. It has the manner of a buff who knows absolutely everything about a subject most other people haven't time for, but it's also very entertaining.",1974-07-18T05:00:00+0000

(And, by the bye, an expanded edition of Henry the K's American Foreign Policy is also due in August.). Paul Erdman, who served time in a Swiss jail for financial peculation then wrote a best seller called The Billion Dollar Sure Thing, has another financial mystery out called The Silver Bears. It involves silver manipulation and the Mafia. Evan Connell, who wrote Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge, is represented by a new novel, The Connoisseur. And there looks to be substantial legacy of John O'Hara stories; collection of some of them, Good Samaritan and Other Stories, will appear. Only two have been previously published. William Hjortsberg offers a comic fantasy about bullfighting with one of the funnier titles of the year, Toro! Toro! Toro! Then there is a collection of short fables and an allegory by Brigid Brophy, The Adventures of God in His Search for the Black Girl....

At the same time, with the richest collection of modern art in the world, the Modern has been well fixed to maintain a regular program of interesting shows while weathering the crisis.This situation has given prominence to a type of show that might be called the curatorial tour de force, meaning an exhibition based on some common characteristic of an otherwise heterogeneous group of works. A choice example of the type was the Modern's recent Printed in Germany, 1923, a selection of graphics defined by the title; more vividly than any arthistorical essay, it gave one a glimpse of an epoch.

It may not be the best Pygmalion we'll ever see, said someone, but it's certainly the best production of the subtext. Now, if you had used the word subtext here fifteen years ago, when Marowitz arrived on the London scene from New York, people would have assumed you meant the second of two verses of Scripture used by a minister as texts for his sermon. At best, someone might have said warily, Stanislavsky and all that, d'you mpan? In Marowitz's years here, and to a considerable extent because of his efforts a..q a director and critic, we have learned a little moreenough, at least, for conversation about such matters. After Marowitz's first London productions in the 1960's, the theater hummed with actors stories of his unorthodox methods  improvisalions, making up scenes between the lines of the play, sensitivity exercises and the like. Today all these are standard practice in much of the British theater, and the concept of subtext  the unspoken moods and motives at work behind a playwright's written words  is so respectable that The Royal Shakespeare Company has invited Marowitz's The Shrew, an hourandahalf tour between the lines of Shakespeare's Taming, to be the first guest production ever in its studio theater at Strat fordonAvon in the fall.

With the inclusion of Vita's autobiographical narrative, written in 1920 at the end of her affair with Violet, Nicolson's book dramatically lifted her out of the relative obscurity in which she was resting as a poet, biographer and novelist. The distinction she never quite achieved in these capacities is certain now to be hers as the wife in a marriage that endured 49 professedly happy years despite the overt, sustained homosexuality of both partners.

In addition, it was reported from Paris yesterday that the Common Market has begun dumping its beef surplus on the Soviet Union.Some meat producers in Communist countries might have expected the Russians to have helped support the beef market. Instead, it seems that the Soviet Union has been buying up Western Europe's beef surplus at $830 a ton  a bargain in vew of the world price of $1,000 a ton,Makes the Mouth Water1 can't wait for some of that good meat to reach the Moscow stores, if it ever does, one Russian said. The thought makes the mouth water.Hungary, one of Europe's most important suppliers of beef, takes a different view. Charging that Western Europe had banged the door on Hungarian meat, the newspaper Magyar Hirlap of Budapest commented:The Common Market authorities and the governments behind them want the Hungarian national economy, among others, to finance their own economic and political blunders.The Hungarians have not commented on Moscow's eager readihess to buy up the beef surplus at cutrate prices, but Hungary's profitminded collective farm managers are not likely to be pleased.Italy a Big CustomerYugoslavia, one of Europe's biggest beef exporters, is furious at the turn of events, Yugoslavia sells beef to the United States Seventh Army in West Germany, which presumably will go on eating steak, come what may. But a vastly more important customer is neighboring Italy.Not only have Italians come to insist on beef in creasingly with the passing years, but Italian hotels and restaurants have an insatiable need for beef to feed tourists  especially Germans. Traditionally, Yugoslav beef is excellent and cheap.But the Italian national economy has suffered more than most others in Western Europe recently, and the hard fact everywhere these days is that beef is just too expensive for most people most of the time.Consequently, Italy decided last spring to halt imports of Yugoslav beef for a while, and, from that moment, Ital. ianYugoslav relations have gone from bad to worse, At one point a few months ago, the two countries were talking as if they were on the verge of war over the longcontested Trieste border area.The Soviet army weighed in on Yugoslavia's side in an article in the Red Army newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, declaring with President Tito that the borders of European countries are inviolable,Warm Reception ReceivedBut now, as Moscow buys up cheap surplus beef in West Europe (mostly from France and Ireland thus far), relations between Moscow and Rome have never seemed so warm. Foreign Minister Aldo Moro of Italy is enjoying an extremely warm reception in the Soviet Union at the moment and has just signed a farreaching 10year economic cooperation pact with the Russians.",1974-07-30T05:00:00+0000
