Following the Crash of 1929, a stockbroker named Thomas R. Cox volunteered to pay for his college education. After three years at William and Mary, he transferred to Washington & Lee, graduating in 1934. Wynn played semi-professional basketball and softball before he got a job writing songs and singing for a live radio show. He sang with Dinah Shore and played gigs with the well-known Palmer Brothers as Larry Wynn and the Wynners. But it was a session with Billie Holiday (she recorded one of his songs, ''I'm All For You'') that inspired his biggest hit. In 1940, saxophonist Louis Jordan recorded ''Five Guys Named Moe,'' and the song was popular for a number of years, fading until producer Cameron Mackintosh borrowed the title for a musical. Five Guys Named Moe bowed on Broadway in April 1992 and was nominated for two Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The show continues to play to audiences worldwide. Wynn also enjoyed a sucessful career as a salesman in radio and television. He married Evelyn Dawson in 1959. They remainedtogether until her death in 1990. Wynn wrote a weekly well-known column for the New Jersey Bergen Times, until his death.

He died from complications associated with cancer. He continued to be active in the business while living with Parkinson's disease for the last 25 years. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Ernst Einstein fled Nazi Germany in 1933. With the help of his future wife, Charline, he escaped the Nazis by hiding in France under a false identity. He was a kind man who survived the war without bitterness. After the war, he lived in France until moving to New Jersey in 1955. That year, he formed a partnership with his identical twin brother, Ted Einstein, and Albert and Walter Moomjy, which created the carpet business now known as EinsteinMoomjy, Inc. The chain today consists of five locations, four in New Jersey and one in Manhattan. Einstein was known for his exquisite taste and vision and for his expertise and fine eye for oriental rugs. As one example, in 1971, when Nixon first lifted the embargo on trade with China, he flew to London so that Einstein-Moomjy would be the first to import oriental rugs from China. He was gracious and charming and equally loved by customers and employees. Above all, he was an affectionate husband, father and grandfather. In addition to his wife, the former Charline Ollier, he is survived by two daughters, Rita Davis of Bryn Mawr, Penn., and Jessica Kaufman of Easton, Conn., and two sons, Jean Einstein of Westwood, N.J., and Gilles Einstein of Greenville, S.C., and 10 grandchildren.

Mother of Laura, Gloria and Celeste Coruzzi. Grandmother of Aidan Coruzzi Daly, Eva Coruzzi Schneider and Giovanna Coruzzi Kupiec. Lucy Coruzzi grew up on East 48 St., where from a young age she worked at her family's newsstand and luncheonette on 2nd Avenue, which was a favorite neighborhood gathering spot. After attending Julia Richmond High School, she had to decline a scholarship to Hunter College because her three brothers Joseph, Armando and (twin) Rudolph were drafted to fight in World War II. After the war, she married Hugo Coruzzi and enjoyed a deeply devoted and loving relationship blessed by the birth of three daughters. After Hugo died suddenly at age 43, Lucy raised her three young daughters alone with the support of the close-knit Sarro family. She went to work at the state rent office where she rose to Chief of Control before retiring. Meanwhile, the values instilled and effort expended in the education of her three daughters resulted in three Ph.D.s, plus a law degree for the eldest. Most recently, the role of grandmother was a new vocation on which Lucy embarked with all her considerable energy. Lucy Coruzzi lived with simplicity, generosity, optimism, and faith. Her greatest pleasure was to sit down for a family meal, and the day her life was complete was the day she first held all her three grandchildren in her lap. She enriched the lives of those around her, regardless of status or station. On 6 October 1995, Lucy hugged the Pope, and each was blessed.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Material Girl,"Hooking up with a winner is the only maneuver that Rita Zapata, the protagonist of Yxta Maya Murray's second novel, WHAT IT TAKES TO GET TO VEGAS (Grove, $24), can envision to gain her some respect within her East Los Angeles community. As Rita acknowledges in Murray's streetwise narrative, when at 16 you've already been written off as scandalous by the community's all-powerful and viper-tongued Latina League, your only recourse is to snag a good man. And in the impoverished Mexican-American culture in which Rita comes of age, this means a boxer who's got what it takes to land a pay-per-view prizefight in Vegas. After sleeping with and being ditched by most of the neighborhood's going-nowhere-fast street fighters, Rita sets her sights on Billy Navarro, a charming but brutal boxer from Mexico, and the plot traces the pair's heavy-breathing but precarious relationship. Despite the selfishness behind Rita's repeated missteps, we're touched by how ignorantly she desires the consumer goods that she associates with respectability -- from custom-interior Cadillacs to the complimentary bottles of fancy shampoo you in get in your room at Caesars Palace. After a while, however, Rita's upbeat though fated-for-deflation epiphanies become taxing, as does the incongruity of street language spiked with more ''literary'' metaphors. And the story's resolution, after episodes of violence that unfold like a television movie, has a recovery element that is at odds with the rest of the novel. Still, Rita's narrative maintains a fast clip, and the novel's strength lies in Murray's candid though poignant description of the ''Eastelayer'' world -- of the bustling consumerismo of Cesar Chvez Avenue, of boxing champions whose personal mythologies are memorized by every schoolchild, of the sad-sack lives of wannabe boxers who wind up working at Denny's.

Cartan Tours, the official United States agency, said that Olympic committee rules gave priority to those who applied by April 30, then to those applying between May 1 and Sept. 15 and then to those who apply now through next Jan. 31. In all cases, Cartan said, ticket distribution for particular events is determined by a random selection by computer. If you do not have room reservations or family or friends in Australia, do not be surprised if you wind up in anything from a college dorm to a campground. But even that will be expensive, and probably a long commute to the event. Although 11,000 new hotel rooms are expected to be ready by September, there will be only 35,000 rooms for the expected 250,000-plus visitors. And 80 percent of those are reserved for Olympic officials and visitors on packages that usually include games tickets, air fare and lodging. The cheapest such package from Cartan, at $4,900, includes six nights at a private home. Visitors who go on their own will be lucky to find a room in a private house, and they can expect to pay $1,800 to $2,500 a week.",1999-10-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; That Metropolitan Woman,"''This young woman ought to be ashamed of herself,'' was the usual observation of early 20th-century moralists about Audrey Munson, arguably the most popular nude female model of the Beaux-Arts school. In AMERICAN VENUS: The Extraordinary Life of Audrey Munson, Model and Muse (Balcony, $27.95), Diane Rozas, a photographer, and Anita Bourne Gottehrer, in her first book, have made an extraordinary effort to reclaim long-forgotten facts, newspaper clippings and vintage photographs of this once celebrated life. Indeed, so popular was Munson that at one time the Metropolitan Museum of Art housed 30 pieces of art based on her poses. Born in 1891 into the conservative world of upstate New York, she was still a teen-ager when she and her mother arrived in New York City. In fewer than 10 years, she was said to have posed for more civic art commissions than any other model. By 1915 Munson's image increasingly turned up in private collections as well. As a magazine cover girl, she gained a national reputation and was invited to appear (naked, of course) in films.

What's in that bin ranges from the most blatantly commercial music produced by a country, like Hindi film music (the singer Asha Bhosle being the best well known example), to the ultra-sophisticated, super-cosmopolitan art-pop of Brazil (Caetano Veloso, Tom Ze, Carlinhos Brown); from the somewhat bizarre and surreal concept of a former Bulgarian state-run folkloric choir being arranged by classically trained, Soviet-era composers (Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares) to Norteno songs from Texas and northern Mexico glorifying the exploits of drug dealers (Los Tigres del Norte).

It is the third time in the last three months that a Korean company has delayed the sale of its shares overseas or set a price that was lower than expected.

The chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, Peter Burt, above, said his bank could squeeze more out of a takeover than any of the possible counterbidders. Sir David Rowland, chairman of Natwest, said that most of the savings would have been achieved by the bank's own cost-cutting plan and that the Bank of Scotland's bid offered ''high risk for scant reward.''",1999-10-08T05:00:00+0000

It seemed certain, after all, that debates about the Philharmonic's relationship with American music were of fairly recent vintage, if only because the American symphonic repertory we know today began flourishing in the 1930's. And what could be more current than the back-and-forth in which critics assert that the Philharmonic does barely enough American music and the orchestra responds that given the ticket buyers' clear preference for Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, it does plenty?",1999-10-10T05:00:00+0000

The first is that the 50-year-old Philip Johnson-designed dwelling still seems startlingly alive nearly two years after Dominique's death. (Her husband died in 1973, and the house is currently maintained by the Menil Foundation.) A long, low antique Italian sofa still welcomes visitors in the spacious foyer, along with a huge Yves Klein canvas. In the living room, a sinuous chaise longue by the great couturier Charles James, who decorated the house, beckons near the tall sliding window. Books on philosophy, religion and poetry are still piled around the modest master bedroom; a small painting by de Chirico is hung above the dressing room's felt-covered door, to which are tacked snapshots, business cards and lists of things to do.

It is called ''Four Downs to Anger Control,'' and the author is Tom Letson, a counselor in Howell Township middle schools and a football coach at Allentown High School. He found football analogies useful in anger-control sessions -- ''most men understand four downs and punting when you get to fourth down'' -- and decided to write a book using them. For example, readers are encouraged to view themselves as ''head coach'' of their anger, to ''officiate'' arguments and ''throw the flag'' at such penalities as profanity or name-calling. Mr. Letson is planning a version for children and a book using basketball analogies.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; A Hallucination in Every House,"Maxfield Parrish was once the best-known artist in the country; in 1925 about one in four American households, by one estimate, had a reproduction of his painting ''Daybreak,'' a subtly erotic vision of youth set in an Arcadian landscape. From the outset of his career, Parrish hitched his fortunes to the technologically expanding publishing industry, doing his first magazine cover for Harper's Bazaar in 1895 and thereafter earning mass-market popularity with his winsome book illustrations, art posters, calendars, theater sets, murals and paintings -- some, like ''Daybreak,'' specifically commissioned to be reproduced and sold as prints. This unabashed embrace of commercialism, not considered unseemly for a fine artist early in the century, was later reviled by art world arbiters like Clement Greenberg, who wrote severely of Parrish's ''hallucinatory high-octane realism.'' The rise and fall of critical assessment of the artist is the crux of Sylvia Yount's ambitious MAXFIELD PARRISH: 1870-1966 (Abrams/Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, $39.95); if the case she builds for returning him to an honored place in art history is not airtight, it is certainly meaty. That Parrish had incredible facility as a draftsman and colorist, particularly in some of his wickedly original illustrations for children's books, is evident throughout the vivid reproductions in the book (these images, after all, were largely designed for printing). And Yount discusses how the curator Lawrence Alloway was the first to revive Parrish in a 1964 exhibition as a progenitor of Pop Art, with its playful conflation of art and commerce (Andy Warhol was an avid Parrish collector). Yet Parrish, who by the age of 60 had immersed himself in landscape painting, did his own disparaging at that time: ''There are countless artists whose shoes I am not worthy to polish whose prints would not pay the printer.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Not a Happy Country,"Though a steady stream of memoirs, travel books, investigative reporting and fiction flows toward Western readers from China and Japan, it's hard to name even a handful of titles that provide a cultural window on contemporary Korea. Pak Wanso published her first novel in 1970 at the age of 38 and has since become one of South Korea's most prominent writers of realist fiction. The 10 stories collected in MY VERY LAST POSSESSION: And Other Stories (M. E. Sharpe, cloth, $45; paper, $22.95), written between 1974 and 1995, offer glimpses of a society at once anchored in and imprisoned by strict Confucian mores and buffeted by war, political unrest and massive emigration. In ''Thus Ended My Days of Watching Over the House,'' the arrest of a professor by the secret police tears the careful wrappings of his family's propriety. Allowing his meticulously trained bonsai trees to wither, the professor's wife enjoys a new intimacy with her son and daughter and talks back to her mother-in-law for the first time. Pak seems comfortable with both parable and satire. ''Granny Flowers in Those Heartless Days'' is a two-part moral lesson on the wartime subversion of traditional roles, while the sharp humor of ''A Certain Barbarity'' skewers a family that panders to a rich relative visiting from Japan, pointing up a national relationship marked equally by envy and hatred. In a darker mode, ''Three Days in That Autumn'' is told by a doctor who avenges her own rape every day in her work as an abortionist. Pak's voice may be diffused by the combined efforts of five different translators, but her messages in these stories are vividly focused. Janice P. Nimura",1999-10-10T05:00:00+0000

She also analyzes the drug's effect on the general population of China, India, Britain, France and the United States. In fact, the economies of both Britain and France were so dependent on the opium trade that when China tried to stop it, the European powers made war in 1839 and again in 1856. Hodgson, the author and designer of two illustrated novels, ''The Sensualist'' and ''The Tattooed Map,'' intersperses photographs and woodcuts of addicts in opium dens throughout the book. She also includes movie stills and reproductions of the covers from magazines and books to highlight the strange fascination opium has exerted on our culture. Of special note is the cover of a 1958 edition of Claude Farr re's 1904 novel ''Black Opium''; it features a naked, voluptuous blonde rising out of the smoke of an opium pipe. The image is both absurd and sad, for opium use decreases the sex drive. But then again, as Hodgson notes in her insightful book, the pull of the drug is anything but logical. Carolyn T.

In 1923, again covering the Irish and the Cadets, he began, ''Brazil can cheer about its coffee . . .'' Definitely not. On Oct. 18, 1924 -- almost exactly 75 years ago -- he finally found the right rhythm and imagery and struck hard and clean as a Knute Rockne-coached linebacker: ''Outlined against a blue, gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again. In dramatic lore, they were known as Famine, Pestilence, Destruction, and Death. These are only aliases. Their real names are Stuhldreher, Miller, Crowley, and Layden.

But Weight/trimmers in Mine Hill is trying to erode the stereotypes of nutritious dining by offer such normally forbidden meals. The menu features turkey meatball subs ($3.75) and chicken Parmigiana ($5.95) rather replace bean sprouts and wheat germ. The owner, Lynn A. Fehr, said the meals were made with low-fat ingredients and carefully weighed to control portion size. Air-fried french fries ($1.95) are a popular snack; instead of using oil and a deep frier, Mrs. Fehr opts for a machine that forces hot air around the fries. The result is a healthier fresh-tasting dish. Air-fried broccoli, zucchini and battered cauliflower are also available ($1.80 each). The real treat at Weight/trimmers isn't the lunch specials or the sandwich wraps. It's the low-fat ice cream, which comprises 40 percent of the restaurant's business. ''It's just the best ice cream around,'' boasted Mrs. Fehr. And she's right. Just try to resist the German chocolate cake-flavor soft ice cream topped with fat-free hot caramel all adding up to only 143 calories ($2.35 for a small). (By contract a McDonald's caramel sundae has 360 calories.) Even Weight/trimmers' hot apple cobbler coupled with vanilla ice cream (203 calories, $3.05) can fit into a dieter's regime. Other low-fat toppings include pineapple blueberry, strawberry and peach (60 cents each extra topping). The main worry for a would-be patron of Weight/trimmers is finding the restaurant. Tucked in the corner of an inconspicuous building, Weight/trimmers is marked only by a fading sign that is visible from the highway.

He proved that it is mechanically and therefore logically impossible for anyone ever to know at any given moment the velocity and position of an electron -- two fundamental properties of any particle -- because, roughly speaking, if you shine enough light on an electron to see it, the light itself will alter the electron's velocity.

The challenge, rather, is to tone things down sufficiently so that generous readers outside the academy will find the events credible. Many of my fondest academic experiences, some ludicrous, others poignant, ended up getting blue-penciled, like the true story of an eccentric old college professor who was nearing retirement just as I was beginning my career. A gentleman who appeared to have no strong views on any subject, he faithfully attended faculty meetings but never spoke at them until the end. After matters of curriculum and policy and procedure had been debated and resolved (or, more often, tabled), after both old and new business had been attended to, after the agenda for next month's meeting had been set and there was nothing left to do but adjourn, only then would this professor raise his hand and ask, ''What about me?''",1999-10-17T05:00:00+0000

At times, though, the stereotype has failed to ring true; in truth, individualism has run in pronounced cycles. Just in the last 50 years, it was precisely the lack of individualism that prompted William H. Whyte's ''Organization Man'' and David Riesman's ''Lonely Crowd,'' best sellers articulating public concern about the dangers of conformity. Americans, it was feared, had become too worried about fitting in, too afraid to be independent. ''Do not fold, spindle or mutilate,'' the instruction on computer punch cards, became a slogan against docile regimentation. ",1999-10-17T05:00:00+0000

''The wretch, concentered all in self,'' wrote Sir Walter Scott in 1805, might get ''power and pelf'' but would wind up ''unwept, unhonored and unsung.'' Not so, said Walt Whitman a half century later. ''I celebrate myself,'' he sang in his ''Song of Myself.'' Since then, however, the notion of self as something to be celebrated has been taking a beating; Scott's sneer at self reverberates through the language. It is bad to be selfish, good to be selfless. People who are smug are self-satisfied, narcissists are self-absorbed and often self-indulgent and braggarts are self-serving. You can find a few uses that reflect well on self -- like self-reliant and self-possessed - but most praise is lavished on the rejection of self, as in self-sacrifice. And selflessness is next to godliness.",1999-10-17T05:00:00+0000

''Of events her life was singularly barren,'' her nephew claimed, and her letters, or those that her family didn't burn, reveal almost nothing of the person who wrote them. Yet the evidence suggests that Austen's life was full of inner drama. She experienced maternal rejection and sibling rivalry; she was unhappy in love and had trouble with relationships; she suffered from writer's block and bouts of depression. And her novels powerfully suggest both a world and a personality that now seems remarkably familiar.

Surrealism is such a natural and omnipresent element of children's fiction that it is hard to imagine any bizarre spectacle raising the eyebrows of today's youngsters. Which is exactly why Tom Pohrt's HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16; ages 4 and up) is so refreshing. Somehow, his cat who writes postcards and sketches portraits is strange and surreal anew. Pohrt's exquisite illustrations are at once true to life and engagingly jarring. That water buffalo sitting at a table at the Crocodile Cafe looks quite real and yet completely out of place. The tale is simple enough. A girl, Eva, and her cat, Sam, take a zeppelin airship to a country that looks much like a North African French colony a decade or two before the end of overt imperialism. In this land of deserts and oases, Eva and Sam encounter annoying bugs, friendly camels and fiendishly plotting crocodiles before settling into a nice hotel room overlooking the sea. En route they pass by many palm trees and a monumental cat statue. (Ancient Egyptian? Abyssinian? Hard to say.) ''Better than a postcard'' is Sam's opinion. Readers can be excused for picking up ''Having a Wonderful Time'' and assuming that they've found a glossy new reprint of some long-forgotten classic. Pohrt's illustrations and smooth, unassuming, utterly unironic prose look and sound as if they date back to some innocent pre-World War II era. One wouldn't be surprised at all if Babar or Tintin made an appearance just around the next page. Without seeming to try at all hard, ''Having a Wonderful Time'' evokes another time and another place, full of magical possibilities right around the corner but far, far away. A very nice trick, if you can pull it off. Andrew Leonard",1999-10-17T05:00:00+0000

Dillen's first novel, ''Hero'' (1994), FOOL (Algonquin, $23.95) is about masculinity -- about the likelihood of failing to achieve it and the possibility of redeeming it. At 46, Barnaby Griswold is a successful and happily amoral investment speculator who worries about becoming, in his father's disapproving term, a ''fluffmeister.'' Barnaby's success is built on intuition, aided by a limitless tolerance for liquor and the kind of salesman's bonhomie that involves funny hats, food fights and conspicuous consumption. A chance meeting with two Midwestern car salesmen turned oil speculators lures Barnaby from his Manhattan playground to Oklahoma City, where he hears the voice of his dead father advising him to sell short. The triumph of this scheme depends on Barnaby's betrayal of his Oklahoma partners, one of whom takes revenge by talking to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forced to accept a trading suspension in order to avoid jail, Barnaby loses not only his wealth and connections, but also his wife and daughters and his family's summer home. Barnaby believes that ''in circumstances like these, men resurrected their lives by winning something physical,'' and the more familiar part of his resurrection involves winning a tennis tournament and charming the inevitable pretty girl. But he also stays in Oklahoma City to care for his formidable mother-in-law, Ada, after she suffers a series of debilitating strokes. The moving but unsentimental narrative of their developing relationship, and Dillen's happily offbeat prose, add a moving and surprising twist to Barnaby's redemption.

In the course of his Hall of Fame career with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Robinson was a catalyst for the cultural changes that doomed segregation in America. Before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., before Nelson Mandela's triumph, a black man forced white people to look at blacks in a new way. His death at the age of 52, in 1972, could have sent his wife into permanent mourning, all the more so because their child, Jackie Jr., died just a year earlier.

''Saturday Night Fever,'' the movie released in 1977, marked the apogee of disco, a lucrative moment in pop that quickly generated a backlash, a record-business crash and a widespread repudiation. Twenty years is the usual nostalgia gap, the time it takes for fond memory to replace the embarrassment of succumbing to a long-gone trend; hence the Broadway-bound ''Saturday Night Fever,'' despite negative reviews of its London production.

The winner of the large-company award is Public Service Electric and Gas, singled out for preparing workers for the coming demands of electricity deregulation. The mid-size company winner is Organon, the pharmaceutical company in West Orange. An honorable mention goes to Hunter Douglas, the maker of window blinds, in Saddle River.

He devoutly believed in the highest potential of his students and was rarely disappointed. In the early 70's, Lou introduced a professor from the University of Toronto by the name of Marshall McLuhan to media cogniscenti in NYC. McLuhan's observation that electronic communications were creating a ''global village'' reinforced Lou's own theories including the understanding that the visual impact of mass media far exceeded the importance of the text.

Afterward, Stirling bought the students a pitcher of beer at the pub, and we strained to act intelligently and comfortably while drinking with an elder. (''Stevens an insurance agent!

us,University Presses Books in Brief: Nonfiction; An Artist for Life,"In 1936, when Morris Wyszogrod turned 16, his parents pawned belongings to send him to Warsaw's Marshal Josef Pilsudski School of Graphics, an exclusive art school which accepted only a few Jewish students. Their sacrifice saved his life. During World War II, Wyszogrod told a young German officer he was an artist. He was given pen, ink and paper to write nameplates of soldiers, then asked to paint the officer's portrait in charcoal. He was rewarded with a special identification card that read ''The Jew shown in this photograph . . . is permitted to walk unescorted between the airfield and the Jewish district.'' The Kunstmahler, as he became known, painted more portraits of officers and their girlfriends and made a sign that said ''Fr Juden und Hunde Zutritt Verboten!'' (''Entry forbidden to Jews and dogs''), while secretly producing fake ID's for members of the Jewish resistance. Wyszogrod's talent was also his salvation at the Budzyn, Plaszow and Theresienstadt concentration camps, where he redecorated SS living quarters, produced pornographic drawings and painted coffins for German soldiers. A Brush With Death: An Artist in the Death Camps (State University of New York, cloth, $44.50; paper, $14.95) is a heartbreaking, succinctly told memoir, as well as a fascinating parable of the way society treats artists. Wyszogrod includes drawings he made in the camps, photographs and loving descriptions of his father, a professional musician from Lublin who fixed instruments, and his Warsaw-born mother, a theatrical costume designer. After the liberation of Theresienstadt in 1945, he learned they had perished in the camps, along with his three siblings. He was reunited with his Uncle Mendel in New York in 1947. In 1952 he married Helen Rosenberg, who survived the war in Poland. They have two children and six grandchildren. His daughter Diane, who married the son of Auschwitz survivors, edited her father's poignant story. Susan Shapiro",1999-10-24T05:00:00+0000

The next challenge, experts say, is to find a drug that will block that enzyme.

us,Footnotes; Black Studies,"1. One of the most stylish black rooms of the 20th century -- the hall at Folly Farm, in Berkshire, England -- was done not by a decorator but by an architect. Sir Edwin Lutyens (1869-1944) is widely admired for his bold reinterpretation of Renaissance classicism, and this 1912 room is no exception. Glossy black walls are framed by white enamel-painted woodwork, while the balcony is painted red to match the lacquered cabinet below it. Lutyens is probably best known for his romantic country houses, some of which have gardens by the legendary Gertrude Jekyll. But he also designed the British Embassy in Washington and the Viceroy's House in New Delhi. Lutyens's smallest although certainly not least important project was a gift he designed for Queen Mary in the early 1920's -- a doll house, with flush toilets, electricity and working elevators.",1999-10-24T05:00:00+0000

us,Art Club,"When Timothy Greenfield-Sanders was a film student in the 70's, he got advice from some people whose pictures he snapped. ''Are you crazy, photographing me from below?'' was Bette Davis's contribution to his education. A quarter-century later, he is the photographer of choice for celebrities like Monica Lewinsky -- and the celebritizer of the New York art world. Starting Oct. 29, Mary Boone's gallery in Manhattan will be covered floor to ceiling with 700 of Greenfield-Sanders's portraits: every picture he has taken, over 20 years, of an artist, dealer, curator, museum director or art critic (excluding this one but including the Mayor of New York). ''Timothy Greenfield-Sanders: Art World,'' will also appear in book form next month. A shifting barometer of downtown taste, the photographs include Andy Warhol on one hand and, on the other, many people who fulfilled Warhol's prediction about fame. Superstar or shooting star, everyone through Greenfield-Sanders's lens somehow ends up looking like a Marxist revolutionary, improbably suave and preposterously serious. He has photographed dozens of artists almost at the instant they splashed on the scene (see the Starn twins and Elizabeth Peyton) -- and sometimes earlier. The pictures of David Hammons (1980) and David Wojnarowicz (1983) are virtually clairvoyant. Two decades ago he started out with portraits of artists who came of age in the 50's, and they may still be his catchiest pictures. These include Joan Mitchell, who refused to take off her glasses, and an equally brassy Elaine de Kooning, doing her best Dorothy Parker. Portraiture, like all art, is in the eye of the beholder; de Kooning told Greenfield-Sanders that the portrait looked just like her, ''aloof and demur.'' Michael Kimmelman",1999-10-24T05:00:00+0000

He designed many churches, chapels, convents, mausoleums and other quality monumental designs for the Catholic Archdiocese of New York and many religious buildings for New York Protestant and Jewish congregations. Mr. Bono was born in Jersey City, New Jersey; spent his early years in Pittsburgh, and his childhood and early youth in Biella, Italy, where he received a degree from the Biella Polytechnic Institute in 1927. He returned to the United States in 1928, working in the respected office of McKim, Meade, & White, assisting in the design of significant public buildings in Washington, D.C. In 1945, he opened his own office in the Bronx, New York, completing many small and large projects. He was the architect for the Stella D'Oro Biscuit Company designing their main headquarters in the Bronx, and many factories, restaurants, high quality residences in Riverdale, N.Y., and other projects in New York City and throughout the country. His specialty church and mausoleum projects were considered the very highest examples of this architectural genre at the time. Mr. Bono was granted honorary knighthood in the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre by the Catholic Church. He was preceded in death by his wife, Lea, and is survived by two sons: his son Richard, an architect in York, Pennsylvania; and his son, Robert of Staten Island, New York, and by a granddaughter, Lea.

Nina Bryant, an unmarried English professor and novelist, is the protagonist of seven of these tales; the six others explore the personal trials -- divorce, remarriage, applying for tenure -- of Nina's neighbors on a cozy urban road named Joss Court. Cherry sets the tone with ''The Prowler: A Prologue,'' in which the Joss Court residents are spooked by an unseen interloper who overturns garbage cans, pounds on doors and sends mysterious letters. Each story then elaborates on this theme of invisible threat: Nina worries that her young adopted daughter will never have a father; sees her dead father's ghost in her dying mother's kitchen; and falls wildly in love with a history professor. The emotional complexity and perceptive humor of ''Not the Phil Donahue Show'' is characteristic: Shelley, a nurse, feels confused and abandoned when her college-age daughter announces that she's fallen in love with a woman. Only Cherry's fondness for distracting, punny one-liners feels off key (as when someone comments to a performance artist named Jazz Piano, ''You have so many ironies in the fire''). But Cherry traces the shifts in her characters' emotional lives with an observant, elegiac precision, as if she were detailing the visceral effects of the changing seasons.

''We're reintroducing the perfect ellipse,'' he said. This new coliseum is owned by the Miami Heat basketball team. The arena will officially open on New Year's Eve with a concert by Gloria Estefan. She is also a tenant in the complex, where she plans to open a branch of her restaurant, Bongos. The artist Frank Stella designed a sculpture that will double as an abstract band shell. Ms. Spear's colorful fabrics, furniture, lighting and laminates are used throughout the compound. Panels of the arena wall appear to open, revealing vast gridded glass walls underneath, illuminated with colored light. The arena can be seen from anywhere in Miami, but possibly the best view is from the cruise ships that sit in the harbor like ducks in a row.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Hot Seat in the Senate,"BIG UGLY (Simon & Schuster, $23) is a sequel to ''Mackerel by Moonlight,'' the first novel of William Weld, the former Governor of Massachusetts. It follows a raffish erstwhile Federal prosecutor, Terry Mullally, from Boston to Washington, where he has just taken his seat as junior Senator from Massachusetts. He immediately finds himself in political and legal hot water, caught between the competing Presidential candidacies of two powerful Senate colleagues, compromised by questionable fund-raising tactics, tempted by investment schemes of breathtaking illegality and haunted by a past with enough dirty secrets to end his career and perhaps send him to prison for life. Mastery of narrative strategy is not among Weld's strengths. ''Big Ugly'' takes up and abandons so many plot lines and characters that it relinquishes any claim to suspense or narrative drive. And those story strands Weld does sustain tend not so much to develop as merely persist. Moreover, their ultimate resolution is far too facile to provide much satisfaction. What Weld possesses -- most unexpectedly in a moonlighting politician -- is voice. Mullally's account of his experiences is witty, personable and cynically knowing. The specificity of his mordant observations about politics, the law and assorted colleagues shows a real writer's eye and ear at work. It's finally less surprising to find a politician writing well than to discover that someone with this level of skeptical insight succeeded in enduring the twaddle that inevitably accompanies a political career.

IN THE GROOVE: Vintage Record Graphics, 1940-1960 (Chronicle, paper, $18.95), Eric Kohler's lovingly produced collection of 250 album covers, traces the beginning of this graphic design to 1947, when a young designer named Alex Steinweiss folded a thin cardboard sheet in half to create what would become the standard LP jacket for the next four decades. Early jackets by artists like Jim Flora relied heavily on graphics and hand-lettered typefaces rather than photography; the mild-mannered, bow-tied Flora's polymorphous caricatures of Bix Beiderbecke and Gene Krupa are as nutty as any underground cartoonist's work today. Some high points are Neil Fujita's cover of a pensive, red-lighted Miles Davis for ''Round About Midnight'' and David Stone Martin's iconic freehand logo of the Blue Note trumpet player, still in use half a century later. Delightful rarities include a Picassoesque line drawing for a 1958 Kenny Burrell album by a young Andy Warhol. The text is studded with tasty tidbits: younger vinylphiles may be surprised that the first ''concept'' album to structure songs around a theme was Frank Sinatra's ''Songs for Swingin' Lovers.'' Although rock 'n' roll revitalized record sales in the 1950's, it had little impact on album cover design until the Beatles era, because songs were released as singles. Eric P.

Abandoned by her Navy officer husband, she moved her two small sons and a crate of violins to East Harlem and talked her way into a job at New York City's Central Park East school. Threatened by budget cuts, Ms. Guaspari conducted her best violin students in a triumphal concert at Carnegie Hall. In real life, Central Park East is one of the most acclaimed public schools in the country, a harmonious blend of races and classes in a rough neighborhood; even middle-class parents beg to be admitted. In the movie, it becomes a stereotypical ghetto school with lazy tenured teachers, racial discord and routine violence, where one stern but courageous teacher saves the day. While lauding Ms. Guaspari, Deborah Meier, the founder of Central Park East, complains that the movie turned a chance to tell a complex story of a good school nurturing a fellow risk-taker into a simple tale of good guys versus bad guys.

On the surface, there seems little room to cut spending and little alternative to raising taxes yet again. But a quick look at Suffolk County shows a completely different picture. Suffolk County has 100,000 more people than Nassau County but a payroll slightly more than two-thirds the size of the one in Nassau. Suffolk County enjoys the same amount and quality of services enjoyed by the people of Nassau County. Then why do they spend less than 53 cents of every tax dollar on non-discretionary programs and services? Efficiency and concern for the taxpayer, that's why. Using Suffolk County as a gauge, the bloated patronage mill in Nassau County costs taxpayers more than $400 million more than it should, more than enough to cover our recent deficits. Nassau County uses the excuse of these mandated programs to justify employing hundreds more people than is actually necessary.

Their main targets are the senators who voted to kill the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but lately their ire has expanded to include almost anyone who has opposed military intervention in Kosovo, full financing of foreign aid and the repayment of America's $1 billion debt to the United Nations. For their part, Republicans have accused the White House of caricaturing honest differences of opinion on complicated issues.",1999-10-31T05:00:00+0000

us,The Thrill of Discovering an Unheard Sound,"THE search for new music can take you on some long trips.

I had been told that it was the place where you could still make discoveries. Even then, the festival was booking international headliners: the Allman Brothers, Wynton Marsalis, Little Richard, Buddy Guy. But I had been writing about music -- jazz and pop -- for nearly 10 years, and I was looking for something new, something that hadn't yet been picked up by a major label or sucked into the electronic media whirlwind. The year before, a friend had raved about a relatively unknown northern Mississippi bluesman named R. L.

In the spring of 1980, when Iowa beat Georgetown to qualify for the Final Four, Philip and I jumped up and down and cried and hugged each other in a way we wouldn't have dreamed of doing otherwise.",1999-10-31T05:00:00+0000
