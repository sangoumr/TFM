us,Seeing the Light,"For those of you who have considered hoarding incandescent light bulbs before theyre phased out for good in 2014, you might want to hold off on renting that storage space. General Electrics Energy Smart LED bulb goes on sale on Wednesday on the companys Web site. The nine-watt bulb is not only energy-efficient  it produces the same amount of light as a 40-watt incandescent bulb (higher-wattage models are in the works) with 77 percent less power  but is also omnidirectional, unlike earlier generations of LED bulbs, which shed light in one direction only. Its 22,500-hour life span is twice that of a compact fluorescent bulb, and it contains no mercury. GE claims that one bulb will last 22.8 years, and GEs Energy Smart microsite, designed by the New York firm Doyle Partners, makes the point by following a girl from infancy to her wedding day, with the same light illuminating each scene. The bulbs $50 price tag may give sticker shock to all but early adopters. But considering its long life and its incandescent-quality white light  not to mention GEs assertion that if every American household bought just one, wed save almost $400 million in energy costs and prevent five billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions in one year  the bulb could turn out to be a good investment in more ways than one.

And sure enough, he was different.Instead of reviewing brief summaries of the banks operations, as his predecessor had, Dimon demanded to see the raw data  hundreds of pages detailing J. P. Morgans businesses every month. Instead of simply trusting his traders, Dimon put himself through a tutorial, so that he would understand the complex trades the bank was exposed to.

Despite the name, the concept behind their latest venture is anything but primitive, including references to the revolutionary 17th-century mathematician Johannes Kepler and a special app the duo devised to generate different formations. But the end results are beautiful sculptural pieces that fulfill both a function (in this case, mostly seating) and offer the possibility of being developed into a full-fledged architectural system.

She stood for a moment, unsure of her legs. Then all her strength seemed to evaporate; her legs felt like Jell-O, and despite her husbands arm around her, she sank to the ground. Can you stand if I help you? he asked. She shook her head  tears of frustration filled her eyes.

us,Scanners Gone Wild," Over the past three and a half years, the advancing army of Google Street View cars has pressed forward, its units opening fire on city after city from roof-mounted, omnidirectional cameras that seize, in an unyielding digital grip, panoramic images  of Rome! of Peoria! of Antarctica!  that Googles commanders stockpile and post online. Protests have followed dependably, and often literally, in their path. In spring of 2009, residents of Broughton, a hamlet in southeast England, took to the streets and surrounded a lone, unmarked Google car with its conspicuous periscope camera, the crowd swiftly herding the intruder out of their neighborhood. Later that year, in Bergen, Norway, two people dressed in full-body scuba suits  in goggles, snorkels and flippers  ran up a road after a Google car, each of the anonymous amphibians brandishing a pitchfork. And this past May, shortly after Google admitted that its cars werent just taking pictures  they had inadvertently gathered information, including e-mail passwords, from unprotected WiFi networks (We screwed up, Sergey Brin, one of Googles founders, said)  30 European countries banded together to combat Googles infringements on the privacy of citizens. The nations demanded improvements in Googles blurring techniques (designed to obscure faces, license plates, naked people) and sought a reduction, from 12 to 6, in the number of months Google could hold onto the millions of unblurred original images backed up on its servers. Individual European countries began investigations as well, securing exemptions to protect their citizens, with more than 240,000 Germans opting out of Street View in advance of it going live last month  an option that Google agreed to only in Germany (where, among other things, Stasi surveillance isnt yet a hazy memory). And last year Greece went so far as to ban Googles Street View vehicles from operating within their borders, pending further investigation. ",2010-12-03T14:05:07+0000
us,Letters: The Rogue Room,"I have noticed the magazines attempts to cover conservatives more frequently, and generally support them, but I felt that Robert Drapers article on Sarah Palin was yet more favorable propaganda for the former governor. He didnt reconcile the opinion of Palins inner circle with the general publics perception of her. For example, her biographer characterizes her as a brilliant writer with a nimble mind. How can you resolve this with the person who, for example, was unable in an interview to name a single newspaper or magazine she read, either because she doesnt read them or simply couldnt think of the right answer when the camera was on? Draper also suggests that the prevailing narrative of Palin is of a social-media visionary. Using Facebook and Twitter doesnt set her apart  what does is that the media follow her with rapt attention and present it as the other side of a never-ending argument between right and left, regardless of her importance to the political process.",2010-12-03T14:05:12+0000

Armand Fernandez, known as Arman since the day a printer left the D off his name in a catalog, was a founding member of the midcentury French New Realists and one of the giants of 20th-century art. His medium was objects and his process a focused attack that he called the pinnacle of a catharsis. His friend, the painter Yves Klein, told him when they were young, Ill take whats organic, you take whats manufactured. Klein invented his iconic International Klein Blue and died young; Arman squared off in violent yet precise acts against violins and guitars, shower hoses, sofas, paint tubes, bicycles, motorcycles, cars and statues, which he smashed, flattened, burned, sawed in half, cast in bronze and sliced, or sank into Perspex or concrete. His 1961 manifesto was titled The Realism of Accumulations, and when he wasnt destroying to create, he made harmonic sequences, set on wooden panels, of musical instruments (whole or chopped), watch faces, trumpets, ladles, gas masks, typewriters, saws and paintbrushes. An Arman retrospective, at the Pompidou Center in Paris through Jan. 10, gives some idea of his range, output and influence on artists as diverse as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, but it cannot, for practical reasons, include his 106-foot-high Hope for Peace, a concrete tower in Beirut, Lebanon, in which he buried 78 tanks, jeeps and various pieces of artillery.

The beehive she sported on the stand at the United Nations war-crimes trial of Charles Taylor at The Hague last summer garnered a lot of buzz, but the buzz was tinged with ridicule  a clear indication that while the style possessed a lot of pins, it didnt have real legs. The staid, sculptured bumps of hair looked painfully anachronistic, and just like that, a trend that seemed fresh on Pradas fall runway came tumbling down. For all the talk of the beehive this fall, no ones really wearing it, says Orlando Pita, who created the edgy style on the previous page. The big editorial up-do doesnt translate into real life. Accordingly, at the spring shows, hair started to come undone. There were long, partial plaits at Givenchy, sex-kitten tousles at Isabel Marant and half-up-half-down dos at Miu Miu and Christopher Kane, while the rocker chicks at Balmain looked like they had just rolled out of bed. For Pita, the new down-do is all about texture. Weve seen perfectly blown out, silicone-sleek hair for so long, he says. The new texture doesnt look so worked on. Its all in the brushing and the products you use. Pita sprays Elevate, a texturizer from his own line, into wet hair and dries it using his fingers to encourage the natural wave. (Everyone has one.) Next, he sprays dry shampoo (his version is called Refresh) onto the roots (avoiding the top of the head) in one-inch sections. Finally, he gently brushes it out with a Mason Pearson brush, fluffing the hair so it feels soft, not tacky with product. I call it the anti-blow dry.",2010-12-04T22:00:57+0000

A victim of female genital mutilation, the 13-year-old Dirie escaped an arranged marriage in Somalia and made it to London in the 1980s, where she worked at McDonalds before being discovered by Terence Donovan. Kebede, 32, grew up in Ethiopia and was discovered by a filmmaker at the French lyce in Addis Ababa. In a recent interview, she was quick to draw a distinction between her own life story and Diries. On the surface we have parallels, she said, before explaining how different life seemed in Djibouti, a neighboring country to Somalia, where parts of the film were shot. This is where she came from. Theres nothing there, theres no water, theres nothing. And being in that environment was a new thing for me, and then trying to understand how you go from that to become this incredible woman  [Dirie] was never really a victim of her circumstances.",2010-12-06T22:43:30+0000

She is the first artist to win for a sound work: she recorded herself singing a 16th-century Scottish lament under three bridges in Glasgow. The prize, established in 1984 by the Tate in London, goes to a British artist under age 50 and comes with about $39,000. Ms. Philipsz beat out Dexter Dalwood, known for his contemporary take on traditional history paintings; Angela de la Cruz, a painter and sculptor nominated for her installation After, at the Camden Arts Center in London; and the Otolith Group, consisting of the London artists Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun, who make documentary films for a series of exhibitions called A Long Time Between Suns. (Finalists each receive about $7,800.) Ms. Philipsz is only the fourth woman to win the award, after Rachel Whiteread, Gillian Wearing and Tomma Abts. In a statement the judges said they admired the way in which her work provokes both intellectual and instinctive responses and reflects a series of decisions about the relationship between sound and sight and that she draws on the immersive properties of sound and uses her own voice to create powerful sculptural experiences.",2010-12-06T23:11:41+0000

The Retreat from Marriage report suggests that this frame held up more strongly in the 1970s than it does today. On some questions (the morality of premarital sex, whether a divorce should become harder to obtain) well-educated and less-educated Americans seem to have converged over the last few decades, or else the less-educated have become more permissive than college graduates. At the same time, rates of churchgoing have fallen much faster among less-educated Americans than they have among college graduates, to the point where theres now a strongly positive correlation between education and church attendance one that didnt exist in the 70s.

Last week, the Brooklyn-based jeweler opened a shop on Abbot Kinney in Venice, Calif., another on West Third Street in Los Angeles, and next week hell open on Filmore Street in Pacific Heights in San Francisco. Expanding at a time when many other designers are just staying above water may be a bold move. But Bittar believes its a great time to come into new cities with a force. He chose Los Angeles, in particular, because he feels the city, along with New York, shapes the country in terms of trends. San Francisco, on the other hand, is a revenue leader for the company; the new shop will cater to a woman Bittar describes as being more artistic, with a personality more like New York City women. The boutiques dcor incorporates 1930s wallpaper thats been sprayed with graffiti, along with a smattering of the taxidermy groupings that have become a Bittar design statement. Were creating animal hybrids with these, like putting swan wings on a gazelle, he says. On a theatric level, having a store is great. And I think it makes shopping fun.",2010-12-08T14:00:02+0000

His glass and mirror pavilions, which are often plunked down into incongruous environments (say, a forest or the roof of the former DIA building in Chelsea), play tricks on the eye, integrating the spectator into the structures reflected surfaces. Hes my dream artist, Hardy said earlier this week, acknowledging the homage. His shop, at 30 Jane Street, which was designed by David Mann of MR. Architecture + Decor is a little jewel box  all smokey brown glass and mirrors; its situation, ensconced within the rough and crudely patched walls of a historic carriage house, feels both serene and strangely precarious. Its exactly the opposite of Paris, Hardy explained. There you have historical places you cant touch and you have to work with it. Here we had to destroy and rebuild everything because what was here was unusable. We tried to do something more precious in the middle of something more raw. A particularly Grahamesque touch comes in the form of two large plates of interlocking glass that section off the 1,400-square-foot space into semi-private cubbies so you can catch furtive glimpses of the woman trying on Hardys special New York Skyline shoes next to you (Um, excuse me, do those come in my size?), and still maintain the illusion that you have the place all to yourself.",2010-12-08T16:30:42+0000

us,Class and the Culture War (II),"One final point on the National Marriage Project report. Ive been emphasizing the bad news, but I do think its genuinely good news that well-educated opinion as opposed to just well-educated behavior has been moving in a more conservative direction on divorce. (48 percent of college-educated Americans now agree that divorce should be more difficult to obtain, up from just 36 percent in the 1970s.) When social conservatives try to envision public policy responses to the crisis of the American family, theyre almost inevitably stymied by the fact that our upper class (which is, by extension, our policymaking class), while increasingly conservative in the way its members arrange their own private lives, remains intensely allergic to the kind of legal and cultural paternalism that certain earlier elites practiced as a matter of course. Ive suggested before that America would benefit if its upper class showed a willingness to translate some of the more conservative habits theyve embraced (or partially embraced) in their personal lives into law and public policy, but Ive never seen much reason for optimism that our elite might actually move in this direction. So the fact that theres been an uptick in college-educated support for reforming divorce laws is better news than I expected  and a sign, perhaps, that the educated classs present mix of private conservatism and public permissiveness isnt set in stone.",2010-12-09T16:38:19+0000

When he was at his peak, in the early 1900s, his best sport, football, was in its infancy, a rough game undergoing basic rule changes and largely devoid of statistics. What made him exceptional in any case was the unquantifiable combination of power and speed, only hinted at in yardage totals or points. Florid descriptions by the sportswriters of the day and recollections by those who played with him and against him make up a majority of the record. One reporter described his broken-field running as demonstrating amazing intelligence, as he evaded tacklers by an easy lope that carries him over the ground at remarkable speed without betraying any undue haste. His famed coach at Carlisle, Pop Warner, taught his player the technique of unexpected contact, which Thorpe mastered, where you sometimes fake the defensive player to make him stop moving, then, wham, you hit him with the hip or stiff arm, in the words of a teammate.

It was the first movie from her production company, Blossom Films, and, as a producer, Ms. Kidman made an unorthodox choice for director in John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch), who had never before directed a movie he didnt write. Rabbit Hole was made for about $4 million, and eventually bought for distribution by Lionsgate. It opens Dec. 17 in limited release.

After reading Susan Cheevers biography of Louisa May Alcott, even fewer would want to change places with the novels author. Like her heroine, Alcott was a bookish tomboy with three sisters, a writer who churned out pseudonymous melodramas before finding fame as a domestic novelist. Unlike Jo, Alcott never married, concluding that liberty is a better husband than love. Where Jo romps with her own children as well as a houseful of her husbands students, Alcott declared that she never liked girls and stayed clear of children until adopting a niece at 48. A third difference is that Little Women portrays a matriarchal household made up of a mother, her daughters and their cook. Adding a servant spared her characters some of the domestic work that ate up Alcotts own time. An even greater wish-fulfillment, however, lay in subtracting the man of the house. The March girls spend much of the novel waiting for their father to return from the Civil War, but in real life Alcott was the one who left Concord, Mass., in 1861 to nurse wounded soldiers.",2010-12-10T17:28:16+0000

But what made it the scandal of its time  1933  and onward were bucolic nude scenes of the star swimming and chasing a runaway horse, and rapturous close-ups of her sexual awakening. Seeing it now, one imagines generations of adolescents approaching it expecting soft-core titillation and being disappointed by the wholesomeness of a girl who is less sex goddess than pudgy teenager with small breasts (about which more to come).

Dawn Treader, a $140 million 3-D fantasy from 20th Century Fox and Walden Media, sold about $24.5 million in its first weekend, enough for No. 1 but on the low end of expectations. Dawn Treader sold a solid $67 million overseas, but unless it performs very well domestically  something Fox says is possible given strong exit polls  the Narnia franchise, based on the books of C. S. Lewis, could end here. The weekend was much worse for two stars considered among Hollywoods most bankable: Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie saw their new film, The Tourist, fizzle in second place with about $17 million. That result may not sound terrible, but The Tourist cost GK Films about $100 million to make and Sony Pictures Entertainment tens of millions to market. Sony acknowledged that sales were soft but said the studio expected the overseas reception to be substantially stronger. Tangled (Walt Disney Studios) was third with about $14.6 million for a three-week total of $115.6 million. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (Warner Brothers) was fourth with $8.5 million in its fourth weekend for a total of $257.7 million, while Unstoppable (Fox) was fifth with $3.8 million for a five-week total of $74.3 million.",2010-12-12T23:18:30+0000

The mural, on a wall of the museums Geffen Contemporary wing, was planned as a kind of advertisement for an ambitious exhibition focusing on street art that the museum will open in April. But as Blu neared completion of the mural  which conveyed a strident antiwar message, showing rows of caskets draped with one-dollar bills instead of flags  the museum changed its mind and began painting it over on Thursday.

The trial, a second attempt to convict Mr. Ditullio after a mistrial last year, drew national attention because the court paid to have a cosmetologist cover Mr. Ditullios prominent tattoos, including a swastika on his neck. His lawyer, Bjorn E. Brunvand, argued that another man in the neo-Nazi group that Mr. Ditullio hoped to join had actually committed the crimes.

The prancing was greatly helped by the fact that Ms. Steinfeld had changed out of the purple stilettos she wore on the red carpet and into silver glitter hi-tops. Toward the end of the night, another of the movies stars, Jeff Bridges, dressed down too, getting all Dude-like in his wrinkled white shirt and posing for photos with a glass  of what appeared to be water  in his hand. As usual, Joel and Ethan Coen, who wrote and directed the film, declined to talk. But the Bagger was glad to find Carter Burwell, the films composer. Mr. Burwell has always written music for the Coens, as well as for Spike Jonzes films, like Where the Wild Things Are. This awards season he is also represented by The Kids Are All Right. He lives and records in New York; the score for True Grit was composed at the Manhattan Center with a 70-piece orchestra. And it was being fine-tuned until the very last moment  the last recording session was held Nov. 8.

While this is not a definitive analysis of the economy, it does show if things are moving in the right direction. All of the statistical information that follows is from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or B.E.A., and is inflation-adjusted.According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession ended in June 2009, or the end of the second quarter of 2009. Since then, the U.S. economy has grown for 5 consecutive quarters at the following quarter to quarter rates: 1.6 percent, 5.0 percent, 3.7 percent, 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent. This is a median growth rate of 2.5 percent. The median growth rate for the first five quarters of the early 1990s and early 2000s expansions were 2.7 percent and 2 percent respectively, placing the growth rate of the current recovery right in the middle of the pack.

Underlying these simplifications is a deeply American faith in our own capacity  for doing good, for getting things done  a faith that Hollywood has always been happy to indulge. I wish that Prendergast would focus more on the capacity of local people, many of whom are working at extraordinary personal risk to bring peace to their lands.

He is fleeing something  a romantic disappointment is mentioned in the first story, and hints of post-apartheid moral exhaustion pervade all three. Yet what he experiences over the course of his travels is not the fools paradise of distraction from himself but just the opposite: the steady revelation of a central aspect of his character. By the third story, in which he travels to India with a mentally ill friend who comes apart disastrously, some immense, sad reality of life seems to be asserting itself through Damons quest to keep himself moving, long past any hope that his travels will heal him.

But I would take George W. Bushs schoolboy petulance and solipsism, which at least seem authentic and human, over George H. W.s grandee-with-a-switchblade any day. There is something very modern, almost New Agey, and endearingly insecure, about the tone and posture the son adopts in Decision Points.

Coming from Leopardi, however, that credo can seem a little peculiar. Stunted by scoliosis, wearied from melancholy and badgered throughout his 38 years by his mother, a reactionary marchesa who stormed around the family palazzo in her riding boots, Leopardi was never an adventurer of felt experience.

Jeffersons character was so multilayered and contradictory that successive generations have identified with and celebrated utterly different aspects of the same man. In a similar fashion, historians and biographers have studied various facets of his life  from the obvious, like his political thought, to the more obscure, like his love of wine. Now Virginia Scharff, a professor of history at the University of New Mexico, has sought to understand Jefferson through his relationships with the women he loved: his mother, Jane Randolph; his wife, Martha; his daughters and granddaughters; and his slave mistress, Sally Hemings.",2010-12-17T17:51:18+0000

Tron: Legacy, a $170 million sequel starring Jeff Bridges (above) and backed by a three-year marketing campaign, was No. 1 for Walt Disney Studios with an estimated $43.6 million in sales. Imax sales contributed 24 percent of that gross, indicating strong interest from core science-fiction fans; the question now is whether Disney can keep the momentum going over the Christmas holiday period and reach a wider audience. Yogi Bear (Warner Brothers) was second with $16.7 million, an underwhelming total considering this picture had the benefit of higher-priced 3-D screenings. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (20th Century Fox) was third with about $12.4 million for a two-week total of $42.8 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. In its first weekend in wide release The Fighter (Paramount Pictures and Relativity Media) was fourth with $12.4 million, a strong result for a gritty adult drama that cost $25 million to make. The Tourist (Sony Pictures Entertainment and GK Films) was fifth with $8.7 million for a two-week total of $30.8 million. Sonys romantic comedy How Do You Know, directed by James L. Brooks for over $100 million as a vehicle for Ms. Witherspoon, sold $7.6 million in tickets.

The Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa was to receive the Shigemitsu Award for distinction in international cultural affairs after his Carnegie Hall concert with the Saito Kinen Orchestra on Saturday evening. The award, established a decade ago to honor Mamoru Shigemitsu, the Japanese foreign minister who engineered his countrys entry into the United Nations in 1956, is presented annually on Dec. 18, the anniversary of that event. Peter Grilli, the president of the Japan Society of Boston, won the award last year, and when the society subsequently took over administration of the award, he determined that Mr. Ozawa would become the first Japanese winner. What he didnt realize at the time was that on the very evening of the award presentation, Mr. Ozawa would be conducting Benjamin Brittens great internationalist creation, the War Requiem. In the words of the societys news release, the work echoes the antiwar sentiments of Foreign Minister Shigemitsus General Assembly speech as Japan was inducted into the United Nations. But as it happened, the performance of this imposing work left Mr. Ozawa  suffering from sciatica and still depleted after surgery for esophageal cancer early this year  exhausted and unable to attend the presentation at a postconcert party for the performers at a restaurant near Carnegie. Instead Mr. Grilli  in the presence of Yutaka Shigemitsu, a 92-year-old nephew of the foreign minister, who founded the award  presented the award to Mr. Ozawas daughter, Seira, and son, Yuki.",2010-12-19T22:27:26+0000

Its not an indeterminate war on homelessness, but a methodical approach to do away with a major social problem. Each day, roughly 700,000 people in the country are homeless. About 120,000 are chronically homeless. They often live on the streets for years and have mental disabilities, addiction problems and life-threatening diseases like heart disease, cancer and diabetes. They are also five times more likely than ordinary Americans to have suffered a traumatic brain injury, which may have precipitated their homelessness. Without direct assistance, many will remain homeless for the rest of their lives  at enormous cost to society and themselves.Against this backdrop, the 100,000 Homes Campaign has set the goal of placing 100,000 chronically homeless people  pinpointing those who face the greatest risk of dying on the streets  into permanent supportive housing by July 2013. Its the human welfare equivalent of NASAs race to put a man on the moon. Whether the goal is achieved or not, the campaign is shifting the way cities address a problem that has often been seen as more of a nuisance than a public health emergency.",2010-12-21T03:07:37+0000

And theres De Kas, which serves excellent produce-driven menus in a beautifully restored 1926 greenhouse. I also love running amok at De Kaaskamer, the ideal spot for a tour of Dutch cheeses. But unlike most other major European cities, Amsterdam is a gastronomically deracinated destination. The streets are lined with gauche gaucho steakhouses, middling pasta palaces, wok wielders, burger joints and shawarma stands galore, and, more recently, a torrent of Mad Med tapas taverns.",2010-12-21T19:54:36+0000

us,Andrew Johnson Dead," Andrew Johnson, expanded-President of the United States and member of the Senate from Tennessee, died at the house of his daughter, Mrs. W.R. Brown, near Elizabethtown, Carter County, Tenn., at 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The history this man leaves is a rare one. His career was remarkable, even in this country; it would have been quite impossible in any other. It presents the spectacle of a man who never went to school cession of posts of civil responsibility to the highest office in the land, and evincing his continued hold upon the popular heart by a subsequent election to the Senate in the teeth of a bitter personal and political opposition. Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, N.C., Dec. 29, 1808. His father, Jacob Johnson, who was in the humblest circumstances, was drowned while attempting to save the life of Editor Henderson, of the Raleigh Gazette, in 1812, and six years later young Andrew, at the age of ten, was apprenticed to a tailor named Selby. School was then out of the question, of course, and the outlook was that the young man would grow up to an illiterate life. But the intelle and the outlook was that the young man would grow up to an illiterate life. But the intellect that was in him was aroused through the instrumentality of a Raleigh gentleman, whose practice it was to read aloud to the tailor's employees from books of published speeches. The speeches of some of the British statesmen particularly attracted his attention, and he set about learning to read with the same determination which characterized his later life. By resolute application after work hours and in moments taken from sleep, he soon succeeded and was able to read the speeches and other books for himself. He left Raleigh in 1824, before his apprenticeship had expired, and went to Laurens Court House, S.C., where he worked two years at his trade, and then, after a return to Raleigh and a brief stay there, he removed with his mother to Greenville, Tenn. He soon married, and was fortunate enough to get a wife who was a helpmeet to him in every sense of the word. She set herself at once to supply his greatest lack, became his teacher, giving him such oral instruction as was possible while he was at work, and teaching him writing, arithmetic, and other branches at night. Under her faithful tuition he acquired a fair education. The native forces of his mind supplied the remaining elements of his success. ",2010-12-22T16:22:29+0000

","Lucretia Mott died last evening at her residence, near Philadelphia, in her eighty-eighth year. Mrs. Mott, whose name was probably as widely known as that of any other public woman in this or the preceding generation, was born in the old whaling town of Nantucket on the 3d of January, 1793. Her maiden name was Coffin. When 11 years old, her parents removed to Boston, where she went to school, finishing her education at a young ladies' boarding school in Dutchess County, N.Y., in which, when only 15 years old, she became a teacher. In 1809 she rejoined her parents, who had removed to Philadelphia, and in 1811, two years later, was married to James Mott. She was then in her nineteenth year. Her husband went into partnership with her father, Mr. Coffin, and Mrs. Mott again turned her attention to educational matters. In 1817 she took charge of a school in Philadelphia, and in 1818 began to preach. She made extended pilgrimages through New-England, Pennsylvania, Maryland and parts of Virginia advocating Quaker principles and waging at the same time a vigorous warfare against the evils of intemperance and slavery. In the division of the Society of Friends in 1827 she adhered to the Hicksites. Mrs. Mott took a prominent part in organizing the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia in 1833, and was a delegate to the famous World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840, where, in company with other female delegates, she was refused admission on account of her sex. She was also prominent in the original Woman's Rights Convention held at Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848, over which her husband, James Mott, presided. During the last 30 years she has been conspicuous in such gatherings and in annual meetings of the Society of Friends.

Citing decades of legal precedent, the court ruled that votes should count as long as election officials can determine a voters intent. The court also ruled that there was no evidence of fraud or other irregularities in the election. Unofficial state election results show Mr. Miller losing by more than 10,000 votes to Senator Lisa Murkowski, whom he defeated in the Republican primary in August. Ms. Murkowski later returned to the race as a write-in candidate. She declared victory on Nov. 17, after a hand count of write-in votes showed her well ahead. Mr. Miller has not conceded, and he has prevented certification of the race through repeated legal challenges in state and federal court. ",2010-12-23T05:23:31+0000

In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court, the production company, Overnight L.L.C., led by Rick Schwartz, accuses Mr. Kaufman of misrepresenting his skill and experience and pretending to be knowledgeable about the financing of motion pictures when he was not. Mr. Schwartz, who was credited as executive producer on Black Swan, has helped produce the movies Machete, Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Others.

The reason was not just Walkers physical gifts, but also his Amateur Athletic Union coach, Joe Keller, who, according to Keller himself, was keeping Walker on a righteous path  arranging for him to be home-schooled by a tutor, checking to make sure he did his academic work and paying as much attention to the boys well-being as to his jump shot.

Thirty-three pages into what appears to be an unbroken highway of text, the reader might well wonder if thats a mission statement or an invitation. Dancing Lessons unfurls as a single, sometimes maddening sentence that ends after 117 pages without a period, giving the impression that the opinionated, randy old cobbler will go on jawing ad infinitum.

Holbrooke, who was my friend, came of age in the Kennedy years and exemplified its can-do idealism. He gave his life to the proposition that there was nothing an American couldnt accomplish if he marshaled his energy and talents.

Little Fockers, which cost $100 million to make and generated negative reviews, was No. 1 with about $34 million for the weekend ($48 million total), a soft result that did not meet pre-release estimates. Paramounts True Grit, starring Jeff Bridges as a cranky bounty hunter and made for $38 million, was second with $25.6 million  doubling pre-release projections  for a new total of $36.8 million. Tron: Legacy (Disney) fell to third place with about $20 million for a two-week total of $88.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. Tron: Legacy, which carried a $170 million budget and marketing costs of well over $100 million, is struggling to cross over to a broad audience, at least in North America, and must now rely on strong overseas sales for profitability. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Fox) was fourth with $10.8 million for a new total of about $64 million. Yogi Bear (Warner Brothers) was fifth with $8.8 million for a new total of $36.8 million.

Fermors great friend Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford Cavendish, known as Debo, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, now 90, is the youngest (and last surviving) of the endlessly fascinating Mitford sisters, the six daughters of the eccentric Lord and Lady Redesdale. In 1956, in a letter Fermor wrote to friends after spending a holiday at Lismore, the Devonshires castle in Ireland, he tried to describe his hostess. She was funny, touching, ravishing and enslaving, he wrote, which made up for her engagingly unashamed philistinism. The duchess told Fermor she hated books  with the exception of Beatrix Potters Ginger and Pickles, the tale of a dog and cat who run a country grocery.

Looking back at what truly resonated with audiences outside of the fashion elite, it is tough to think of anything more substantial than the hullabaloo that took place this summer over a single dress  one that hardly anyone had a chance to get a good look at. That, of course, was the white strapless beaded wedding gown worn by Chelsea Clinton at a top-secret ceremony in Rhinebeck, N.Y., on July 31. As it happened, it was a dress by Vera Wang, seen by the public in only a handful of official portraits released by the Clinton family. The dress had some silvery belt thing at the waist and a very tight fitted bodice, and what looked like a rushing waterfall of tulle below the waist. To no small degree of dissatisfaction among the fashion press, Ms. Clintons gown was not destined to be hugely influential in the tradition of bridal gowns worn by glamorous members of prominent political or royal families (i.e., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, Princess Diana, Ivanka Trump). But frankly, she could have worn burlap and remained at the top of this list, since half the fun was in all the anticipation and speculation. You can only imagine what 2011 has in store for Kate Middleton.",2010-12-31T04:16:09+0000
us,Cathy Horyns Key Fashion Moments of 2010,"1. I wouldnt have picked Diors January couture collection as a major fashion moment (John Galliano punched an out-of-date ticket for the Gibson Girl), but the scene illustrated the tension between the weird and the wonderful that exists in fashion. Dior held the show in the house, so everything was creamy with intimacy  just what editors love as they plop down next to friends  but it soon registered that Tavi Gevinson, the 13-year-old blogger, was in the front row. Some of the editors really hit her with looks. At the Armani show that night, the stares were openly hostile. It was obvious the older Italian ladies didnt care to see a child in their midst. And Tavi wore a big bow-shaped hat that pointedly emphasized her juvenile stature. The fact is half the people were still in the dark about what was happening. Blogs? Strange ruminations from a girls bedroom in Chicago? They were still politely applauding satin ball gowns that Charles James would have whipped up in his sleep at the Chelsea Hotel.",2010-12-31T04:16:10+0000

Without the consciousness that only a critical infrastructure can supply, Ozick wrote, readers and writers are doomed to talk at cross-purposes, or at random; it takes a corps of influential critics to unite individual reactions into a common discussion. Indeed, this excellent novelist and excellent critic concluded, Superior criticism not only unifies and interprets a literary culture but has the power to imagine it into being. To see what we are missing, all we have to do is contrast our own moment with the postwar decades when Lionel Trilling prevailed at Columbia, and Edmund Wilson, Irving Howe and Alfred Kazin enlivened the magazines.",2010-12-31T17:41:19+0000

A half-century takes us from the era of formulaic romances and Gothic novels to the metaphysical theater of Moby-Dick; from Mark Twain working on his autobiography to John Barths first novel. Yet across the 50 years since Alfred Kazin lectured about the function of the critic, academic literary criticism in America has arguably changed more than the modern novel, while the kind of critic that preoccupied Kazin  one who writes for the public, lives in literature and tries to create standards  now finds her function revised by technological changes that have reconfigured an audience that was once atomized by Americas urban sprawl.",2010-12-31T17:41:20+0000
