The ban, which took effect three years ago, set French authorities on a collision course with conservative Muslims who said the wearing of such veils by women was an obligation of their faith. Judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, said Tuesday that the ban was a legitimate attempt to preserve the norms of Frances diverse society and that it did not infringe on Europes Convention on Human Rights. The court was ruling on a case brought by an unidentified Frenchwoman who said the law was discriminatory and violated her freedom of conscience. The 24-year-old woman, a college graduate, requested anonymity for fear of reprisals if her identity became known. France was the first country in Europe to enact such a ban, followed by Belgium.

(FX Movie Channel) THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) Brad Pitt received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benjamin Button, a man born in his 80s in 1918 New Orleans, who ages in reverse into the 21st century, in this adaptation of a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Cate Blanchett, above with Mr. Pitt, is Daisy, the dancer who loves Benjamin at whatever stage he is in. And Taraji P. Henson, who was also nominated, is the nursing home caretaker who raises him when his father abandons him. From Fitzgeralds odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, adding that the film sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonists condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald.

In 2005, Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee called them an inhuman practice and pushed for their eradication. But the All Bengal Rickshaw Union protested the ban, claiming that without alternative employment, the drivers would lose their livelihood. The photographer Dougie Wallace, who has a book coming out on taxis in Mumbai, Road Wallah, shot the drivers on these pages, many of whom told him theyve been working for more than 20 years for less than 500 rupees ($8) a day. Still, says Shireen Hyrapiet, an instructor at Oregon State University who has interviewed drivers extensively, many young immigrants see pulling a rickshaw as a means of upward social mobility.

After Carpenter burst onto the West Coast literary scene in 1966, with his gritty first novel, Hard Rain Falling (reissued in 2009 by New York Review Books), he became an unofficial adviser to fellow Bay Area writers trying to ride Jack Kerouacs coattails. Never a hippie celebrity like Richard Brautigan or a living legend like Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Carpenter was a straight man to the more illustrious neo-Beat and -Dada artists of the era. With his moon face, receding hairline, professional discipline and calm demeanor, he was a steadying antidote to the counterculture bedlam of the tumultuous 1960s and beyond.

That young author was Cormac McCarthy, and the influence whose weight Prescott saw him sagging beneath belonged to William Faulkner. Among the hand-me-down characteristics Prescott noted: the wandering pronouns with no visible antecedents; the recondite vocabulary and coined words; the dense prose packed with elaborate figures of speech; the deliberate ambiguity, the hints and withheld information; the confusion in time and place; and the flashbacks that fail to shed much light into the intermittent gloom.

us,Escape From L.A.,"Some dystopian novels, like Cormac McCarthys The Road, explore human relationships in dark, existential post-collapse scenarios, uninterested in either causes or solutions. Others engage with global warming head-on and imagine the possibilities beyond catastrophe, as in Margaret Atwoods ultimately optimistic MaddAddam trilogy. But theres a middle path too  one exemplified by Edan Lepuckis first novel, California, in which characters traverse a cross-section of mid-collapse landscape, framed by the gradual decline of civilization. This approach may seem too optimistic given dire news about melting icecaps and acidic oceans, but it does allow for a reading of the novel as satire, skewering the elements of modern life that have brought us to this tipping point.

The payments will increase gradually over the next four years, according to an agreement that is expected to be approved by the United Nations General Assembly, to just over $1,400. The countries contributing troops had wanted a rate of more than $1,700, based on an estimate provided by the United Nations Secretariat. Countries that fund peacekeeping missions  the United States, Japan and France are the largest funders  called that demand unrealistic. The total peacekeeping budget has increased to $8.6 billion, a record, though as the United Nations points out, that is less than 1 percent of total military expenditures worldwide.

Never since 1895, when the Automobile Club de France organized its first big competition, the race from Paris to Bordeaux, has an automobile race attracted so huge a crowd. Even the Paris-Vienna and Paris-Madrid contests of 1902 and 1903 were eclipsed. Lyons was hardly recognizable. It was the magnet for hundreds of automobiles and thousands and thousands of spectators. On Friday many of the cafs remained open all night. The streets were lined with automobiles unable to obtain garage, and the pavements were black with a multitude of pedestrians moving, because they could not help it, at a snails pace.

Just at a time when the entire world is studying the Reichs economic position in an effort to determine its war potential, this mid- year report reveals there are still a number of monkey wrenches in the countrys war machinery. Germany apparently is still handicapped by a severe shortage of labor, food products and raw materials. The economic expert, who summarized the report, found that the labor shortage is one of the weakest spots in Germanys militarized economy. Even with the present size of fine armed forces, there is a shortage of one million workers and the only apparent way to increase the number of industrial and building workers is to import more foreign labor and comb out superfluous labor in the retail trades. It is estimated that the country could get 450,000 laborers by the combing-out process.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, July 5, 1939.",2014-07-04T15:26:54+0000

Three elements of an improvement would be, I think: 1.) an end to the disastrous mass incarceration experiment that began in the 1970s; 2.) an improved network of mental health services, so that prisons and jails are no longer our default mental health system; 3.) improved treatment programs for addicts, so that a failed war on drugs no longer fills up prisons and jails.

More than a million dollars of gold from big business sources in the eastern States alone have been poured into the Mexican rebel coffers during the last nine months. This is admitted by Constitutionalists of prominence. It is added that since the split between Generals Carranza and Villa much money has been withheld, and the rebel cause now faces serious embarrassment. The bitterness engendered by the clash of the two leaders has loosened tongues, and the facts are now known for the first time. The money has come here in single drafts for $50,000 at a time on two local banks transferring the funds. It is impossible to get documental proof, but it is believed that most of it has gone to the honest needs of warfare. So acute has become the need of more money that Senor Alberto Madero has hurried to New York to impress the capitalists alleged to be financing the revolution with the necessity of funds. General Villa is trying to raise money by concessions for the sale of dynamite and the exportation of cattle. The Pearson and Guggenheim lumbering and mining interests have been allowed to reopen. Unusual protection is being afforded the latter. The New York Herald, European Edition, July 7, 1914",2014-07-06T10:44:19+0000

The director, Pamela Yates, said in a statement that the decision resulted from investigations into the circumstances surrounding the killing of 17 villagers recounted in her 1984 film, When the Mountains Tremble. The scene took place in Batzul, where a local woman told the filmmakers that the men responsible for the murders wore military uniforms. Later reports and a recent visit by Ms. Yates revealed that the men had been members of guerrilla forces dressed as army soldiers. Ms. Yates said that she intended to make a correction that will clarify what happened in this scene in both that film and her 2011 documentary, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator.

us,No More Anthony on Opie & Anthony,"The radio shock jock Anthony Cumia has scratched off another of his nine lives: He was fired last week from SiriusXMs Opie & Anthony radio show. The decision came after Mr. Cumia, below, posted what the company described in a news release as racially charged and hate-filled remarks on his personal Twitter account over a run-in with a black woman in Times Square. The tweets, as well as expletive-laced reactions toward his firing, have been removed from his account but can be found online. In the news release, Patrick Reilly, a SiriusXM spokesman, called Mr. Cumias comments abhorrent and wholly inconsistent with the companys values. Fans have taken to social media to express support of Mr. Cumia, some saying theyve canceled their SiriusXM subscriptions. An online petition to reinstate him had reached nearly 7,000 signatures through early Sunday afternoon. The shows other host, Greg Hughes, a.k.a. Opie, posted on Twitter that he was devastated and would meet with SiriusXM on Tuesday. The hosts have a history of trouble. In 1998, Mr. Cumia and Mr. Hughes were fired from a Boston radio station for an April Fools prank in which they extensively, and falsely, reported that the citys mayor had died in a traffic accident. In 2002, their syndicated show in New York was canceled after they broadcast a live account of a couple supposedly having sex in St. Patricks Cathedral.

The board warns that the situation in Massachusetts offers a cautionary tale to other states about the risks of big hospital mergers and the limits of antitrust law as a tool to break up a powerful market-dominating system once it is entrenched.",2014-07-07T10:42:12+0000

Officials do not know when it was stolen from the Contemporary Art Museum of Caracas, where it was part of the museums collection, because the thieves put up a fake version of the painting in its place  a ruse that was discovered in 2002. Photographs showed that the fake, which experts said was crudely executed, was in place at least as early as 2000. News of the paintings recovery two years ago caused a stir in Venezuela, and officials on Monday made a show of bringing it home, with a live television broadcast from the Caracas airport.

The new rule was announced in an internal staff bulletin, Mr. Haq said Monday.

The muted, wearable collection had its share of standout moments, but it was hard to forget this intricately embroidered pleated wrap minidress that felt at once folkloric and resolutely modern.",2014-07-09T20:00:21+0000

This Disney 3-D animated movie musical produced Let It Go, the Oscar-winning power anthem, written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, on seemingly every childs (and quite a few adults) lips since its release in November. Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee directed this fable about Elsa (the voice of Idina Menzel), an ice princess cursed with a frigid touch, and Anna (Kristen Bell), her younger sister and best friend. When Anna falls for a handsome prince (Santino Fontana), Elsa forbids them to marry, casting their Scandinavian kingdom into eternal winter with a wave of her hand. Horrified, she retreats to an ice palace atop a mountain, but sibling love sends Anna plowing through drifts and up glacial ridges in search of Elsa, confident that she can reverse the spell. Allegorically, Frozen lacks the purity and elemental power of a classic myth like Beauty and the Beast, but at least its storytelling is fairly coherent, and its gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this blockbuster, inspired by Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen. There are moments when you may feel that you are inside a giant crystal chandelier frosted with diamonds. Josh Gad plays Olaf, the snowman sidekick (above, with Anna and Kristoff, voiced by Jonathan Groff) who would rather be a beach bunny, in this Oscar winner for best animated feature.",2014-07-11T05:00:03+0000

He began picking up skyscrapers just three and a half years ago, one after another, paying as little as $8 a square foot. He bought five buildings surrounding Capitol Park, the seat of government when Michigan became a state in 1837. He snapped up the site of the old Hudsons department store, where 12,000 employees catered to 100,000 customers daily in the 1950s. Many of Gilberts purchases are 20th-century architectural treasures, built when Detroit served as a hub of world industry. He bought a Daniel Burnham, a few Albert Kahns, a Minoru Yamasaki masterwork with a soaring glass atrium. Theyre like old-school sports cars, said Dan Mullen, one of the executives who took over Quickens newly formed real estate arm. These were buildings with so much character, so much history.

The Board clarifies that the expulsion as well as a subsequent charge against the opposition group raise doubts about the willingness of the ruling al-Khalifa family, members of the Sunni minority, to find a compromise with the Shiite majority, which is demanding democratic reforms and a bigger role in governing. The Board calls Bahrains moves outrageous and, should Bahrain and the United States fail to resolve its differences, predicts disastrous consequences for Bahrain, its neighbors and the United States since the last thing the volatile region needs is more sectarian divisions and instability. So far, the Obama administration, which has worked to maintain ties with the monarchy despite human rights concerns, has responded weakly.

The hardiest then will rest briefly before hustling over to the Champs-lyses for the annual military parade. Officially, July 14 has been celebrated as a national holiday only since 1880. The parliament then, it has been said, wanted to endow the Third Republic with a fte day comparable to those established under previous regimes. Although nearly a century had passed since the Revolution, strong but futile protests were delivered in parliament against the official glorification of a day associated with the parading of decapitated heads on spikes in the streets.

Taking off in succession this morning from their aerodrome in the English Midlands, the British planes pointed southward and spread their wings out over France. Never before had so many military planes of one country carried out an expedition of this character over the territory of another. The only information given the squadron commanders before they left the ground was that their destinations were somewhere in France. Sealed orders, when broken in the air, instructed the heavy bombers, totaling about eighty units, to make a round- trip, non-stop flight to Bordeaux, the French port on the Bay of Biscay, a two- way distance of nearly 1,200 miles. Similar orders provided a shorter flight for about forty medium bombers passing above the French cities of Le Treport, Orleans, and Le Mans, near Cherbourg. Their cruising radius is more restricted.

us,Teenagers Rule,"Chris Weitzs The Young World tells of a Manhattan dominated by tribes of swaggering, self-possessed adolescents, some buzzed on attention-deficit medication, cruising through the city while adults cringe in the shadows, fearing for their lives. Oh, no, that was my teenage daughters diary of her life in eighth grade last year. (Sorry for the joke, darling; I would never read your journal, really.) But in Weitzs novel, those things do happen  save that the adults are all dead. Indeed, Weitz takes that familiar, real-world theme of precocious autonomy and carries it to its logical end: What if Manhattan was not just dominated by adolescents but actually ruled by them in a Hobbesian world of violence and savagery?",2014-07-11T14:44:08+0000

us,On the Move,"As Americas postwar baby boomers grew up, dipped a toe or more in child psychology studies at college and started families of their own, childrens book publishers took note of a new, pop cultural sensitivity to a wide array of developmentally-based childhood trials and tribulations. Picture books about potty training, tantrum throwing, the death of a pet and other emotionally charged topics proliferated, and were often shelved together at the library under the catchall heading of bibliotherapy. Some authors explored these concerns more artfully than others. Judith Viorst (Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day) and the late Charlotte Zolotow (The Hating Book, Williams Doll) proved to be masters of the genre, their dry-eyed wit, empathic touch and storytelling prowess easily a match for their good intentions.",2014-07-11T14:44:48+0000

In the sweltering hospital waiting room, Devorah, dressed in a long wool skirt and tights for modestys sake, envies other girls sitting near by who are wearing shorts and tapping on cellphones, despite a sign forbidding their use. Devorah, 16, isnt allowed a phone, because her family is part of the strict Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement. She used to admire how Rose, who had a wild side, read fashion magazines on the sly.

us,School for a Scoundrel,"The name Seneca brings a particular image to mind: a gaunt, half-naked old man, glaring wildly, his veins open, his lifeblood seeping into the small bath beneath him after he was forced to commit suicide. Painted by Rubens, memorialized by Dante in his first circle of hell, gilded into medieval manuscripts alongside Plato and Aristotle, Seneca has come to represent the perils of proximity to absolute power. The central question of James Romms Dying Every Day is this: When we confront this tragic Roman wordsmith, tutor to the emperor Nero (and, some argue, the power behind that terrible throne), who stares back at us? Is it a tyrannodidaskalos, a tyrant-teacher? Is he the ultimate exemplar of Stoicism, a would-be philosopher king? Or is Seneca simply an accretion of history, a phantom constructed to fit our ravening for heroes, for antiheroes and for the sensational in the stories of antiquity?",2014-07-11T14:47:56+0000

us,Inside the List,"The Fur Flies: Comedy is like sex, or subatomic particles: The more you try to analyze it, the more elusive it becomes. So its probably futile to look too closely at Joan Riverss latest book, Diary of a Mad Diva, new at No. 7 on the hardcover nonfiction list. But what the heck. As its title suggests, the book is structured as a conventional diary that happens to be filled with the authors brand of rapid-fire politically incorrect jokes  in the second entry, Rivers contrasts herself favorably with Anne Frank: Ive written six books, and Anne? She didnt even complete her one. Rivers is unavoidably outr  racist, sexist, raunchy, crass  which isnt to everybodys taste. (Another way comedy resembles sex, and maybe subatomic particles  Im no scientist  is that different folks like different strokes.) But readers seem divided as to whether Rivers is truly meanspirited or whether its all a provocation, a persona she slips into as easily as the fur coat shes wearing on her books cover. When the CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield suggested as much in a recent interview, noting that Rivers is a well-known animal rights advocate and wondering whether the fur was there just for its shock value, Rivers went ballistic. Are you wearing leather shoes? Then shut up, she said, before storming off the set. I dont want to hear this nonsense. She didnt seem to be joking.",2014-07-11T14:48:57+0000

The presidency has been largely a ceremonial post, but if Mr. Erdogan wins, as is widely expected, he is likely to try to expand the powers of the office. Mr. Erdogan has been the most powerful figure in Turkish politics for a decade. His opponents fear that if he is elected president, he will face no checks on the autocratic tendencies he has displayed in recent months while confronting challenges from street protests and a corruption inquiry. Speaking to more than two thousand supporters in Istanbul on Friday, Mr. Erdogan offered few details but vowed to expand democracy in Turkey if elected and to expand its role in international affairs.

The ongoing conflict and worsening humanitarian situation inside the worlds youngest nation is fueling a refugee exodus into Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda at a much higher rate than initially anticipated, an agency spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, said in a statement on the crisis in South Sudan. The agency revised its funding appeal to $658 million from the original $371 million and warned that without urgent contributions, the consequences could be drastic. In another barometer of the worsening crisis, the charity Save the Children warned that a cholera outbreak that first appeared two months ago had spread, infecting more than 2,600 people and killing more than 60. Pete Walsh, Save the Childrens director in South Sudan, said in a statement that the countrys overstretched health service was plagued by widespread shortages of lifesaving supplies, as desperate parents are coming to clinics with children who are already considerably weakened by the disease.",2014-07-12T00:26:04+0000

Brady, of Baltimore, was accomplished in face of the most unfavorable conditions, and the route chosen on the northern side of the peak was one of the most difficult. The progress of Mr. Brady and the two Grindelwald guides, Christian and Peter Kaufmann, who accompanied him, could be observed nearly all the time through glasses from the Seiler Hotel, at Little Scheidegg. The party took ten hours to reach the summit. The ascent of the Mnch peak, although its altitude is not quite as great as that of the Jungfrau, is one of the most difficult climbs in the Bernese Oberland. From Little Scheidegg, at the foot of the Eiger  which with the Mnch and the Jungfrau forms the Interlaken group of peaks, of which the Mnch is the central one  the journey requires at least thirteen hours, with a stop for rest and sleep at the Guggi Hut, where climbers for the Mnch and the Jungfrau part company. The Mnch was first scaled by Dr. Porges, of Vienna, in 1857. Its altitude is 13,465 feet, and the climb from the Guggi requires between nine and ten hours. It cannot be undertaken by anyone but a most experienced climber, as the difficulties to be overcome are innumerable.  The New York Herald, European Edition, July 14, 1914",2014-07-13T09:43:17+0000

The act provides for nullification by court order of revengeful wills in which husbands or wives cut off their widow or widowers and children with a contemptuous shilling or nothing at all, leaving them destitute while the money goes to charity, to persons outside the family or to some freakish cause. Testators are given self-defense, however, in a clause permitting them to append a side statement to their wills setting forth the reason for ignoring the dependants. The courts will take such a statement into consideration when dealing with a contested will. Those who may benefit under the act are limited to a widow or widower, unmarried daughters of any age, sons under twenty-one and sons or daughters who cannot earn their living because of mental or physical incapacity. If any such persons contest a will, a court will decide whether reasonable provision has been made. If not, the court may tear up the will and redistribute the assets of an estate.

The courts decision, which said that party members who had not been convicted of crimes should not be excluded from public life, appeared to pave the way for the rehabilitation of members of Egypts once-disgraced old guard. Mr. Mubaraks National Democratic Party, which dominated politics for decades, was dissolved after his ouster. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that won successive elections after Mr. Mubaraks fall, was swept from power during a military takeover of the government last year and banned as part of a crackdown on political opposition. Experts say a new election law is likely to further constrict Egypts political life, producing a legislature subservient to the new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, while reviving some of the patronage networks that thrived under Mr. Mubarak.

P. Singh, in a case that drew international attention, prompted an outcry in India and led to the strengthening of sexual assault laws. The court on Monday stayed the executions of Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh; the executions of two other defendants were also stayed by the Supreme Court in March after appeals were filed. All four were convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death last September. The district court that convicted the men categorized the case, in which the victim was repeatedly assaulted with iron rods on a moving bus, as the rarest of the rare, a designation that allowed the application of the death penalty. The four defendants plan to continue their appeals, and a final hearing is scheduled for August, said Manohar Lal Sharma, a lawyer for two of the defendants.

In a speech in Los Palmas, a village ravaged by the disease, Mr. Ban called the visit a necessary pilgrimage that was aimed at expressing solidarity with the cholera victims. He has been seeking to raise $2.2 billion to eradicate cholera, which has killed more than 8,000 people in Haiti since 2010. It was absent from the country for nearly 100 years until after the January 2010 earthquake. Forensic studies have identified the cholera bacteria as an Asian strain carried by Nepalese members of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti. Stanley N. Alpert, a lawyer representing Haitian victims in a lawsuit, called the secretary generals speech devoid of any sense of responsibility for the fact that the U.N. brought the cholera to Haiti and it should have gone into overdrive to shut it down.

(Showtime) LEE DANIELS THE BUTLER (2013) Inspired by the real story of Eugene Allen, Mr. Daniels follows a White House butler, Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker, above), and his wife, Gloria (Oprah Winfrey), as history  particularly the civil rights movement  unfolds over seven presidential administrations in what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called a brilliantly truthful movie on a subject that is usually shrouded in wishful thinking, mythmongering and outright denial. Robin Williams portrays Dwight D. Eisenhower; Liev Schreiber is Lyndon B. Johnson; and Alan Rickman is Ronald Reagan, with Jane Fonda as his wife, Nancy; Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lenny Kravitz are the fellow butlers who become Cecils close friends; and David Oyelowo is the older son whose politics Cecil eschews. In part, their story is a chronicle of the generational misunderstanding that has occurred in upwardly mobile families of every background, especially in the baby boom era, when educated and restless young people turned against the parents who had sacrificed so much on their behalf, Mr. Scott wrote. The Butler has the historical insight and the generosity of spirit to honor the father and the son equally, and to look with skepticism at eachs point of view. He added: We remember those who marched and who stood up for themselves in the face of injustice. It is good to remember that, to paraphrase Milton, they also stand who only wait and serve.",2014-07-18T05:00:03+0000

In a declaration in the House of Commons at the beginning of last week Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it clear that should Warsaw determine to resist an attempted change from within or without in the status of Danzig, Britain, backed by France, would come to its aid.

In addition, two students who filmed the fight  and later circulated the video among students  were also threatened with expulsion. Expelling students for filming fights is unheard-of in my district. The school said it had grounds to expel the two who took the video, as outlined by the handbook given to all students: Students may be disciplined for any other misconduct which is deemed by school authorities to be disruptive or to interfere with the educational process. There seems to be no rule, however, explicitly banning filming and circulating a fight. How much does students ignorance of a rule matter when determining a punishment? Is it ethical for a school to expel students for something they reasonably dont know to be wrong? NAME WITHHELD, CLEVELAND",2014-07-18T15:35:46+0000

Visiting Tokyo, where preparations for the 2020 Summer Olympics are underway, requires a certain shift of perspective, according to Matthew Pillsbury, whose photographs from Japan appear on these pages and will be shown at New Yorks Bonni Benrubi Gallery in September.

So is 13 a lucky number for Siddons? Maybe not, judging from the largely disappointed comments readers are posting online about The Girls of August. But Siddons has overcome negative reviews before. As a student at Auburn University in the late 1950s, she was fired from the campus newspaper for defying the administration with a scorching column in support of integration (an incident that later found its way into her novel Heartbreak Hotel). Never write a column when youre mad or sick or disgusted, or all three, she proclaimed early in the offending essay. These are the things that make bad little columnists get reprimanding letters from the intelligentsia. Only the greenest, foolhardiest, most nave amateur would broach a forbidden subject in Enemy Territory. . . . Meet an amateur par excellence. Later in the same column she mulled the word tolerance  Its a grown-up word. Children and mobs do much better with four-letter ones  and criticized people who were content to let their moral petticoats drag in the good old Southern mud. Auburn finally did integrate in 1964, seven years after that column, and the school eventually forgave Siddons for her justified dudgeon. It awarded her an honorary doctorate of humane letters in 1997, and organized a tribute to her last fall on the anniversary of the columns publication date.",2014-07-18T15:41:39+0000

The steel-helmeted, nightstick-waving police scattered the two separate crowds without firing a pistol shot. Neither police nor members of the crowds were injured. Two Negroes were shot and wounded early today in clashes between roving gangs and scores of police. Bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails rained down from tenement rooftops and smashed in the littered streets. In the weekend of riots, police said that one Negro was killed and 116 civilians and 18 policemen were injured. At least 45 stores were broken into and looted or damaged. The violence, and demands from civil-rights leaders that the city act to protect the Negroes, prompted the mayors office today to order a study of complaints of police brutality.

After that, I put the ketchup through a food mill to achieve smoother texture, but that step is optional. I salt toward the end of cooking because the mix will reduce quite a lot and its too easy to oversalt if you salt before that happens.

While an adolescent girl today is about a third less likely to be subjected to genital mutilation compared with 30 years ago because of activism, legislation and changing attitudes, Unicef said that in countries where it is still practiced, parents continue to compel their daughters to undergo the procedure because of strong social pressure.

The Istanbul chief prosecutors office, in a statement carried by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency, said the officers had fabricated an investigation into a supposed terrorist group as a pretense to spy on top officials. More than 500 prominent figures have been illegally wiretapped since 2010, CNN Turk television reported, citing the prosecutors office. More than 100 officers have been charged with falsifying evidence, illegal wiretapping and espionage, and 67 were taken into custody in a 22-city security operation. Some of those who were detained were involved in a corruption inquiry that ensnared Mr. Erdogans close circle and forced four ministers to resign in December, news reports said. Mr. Erdogan has said the graft investigation was driven by people loyal to Fetullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and is a former ally who still has influence in various state institutions. Sinan Ulgen, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels, called the arrests the latest episode in the war waged against the Gulen community. ",2014-07-23T03:15:58+0000

Warns of Polio Risk in War Zones," The United Nations expressed concern about the possible spread of polio in the war-ravaged countries of Syria and Iraq and beyond on Tuesday despite the biggest vaccination campaign undertaken in the history of the Middle East. A report by the World Health Organization and Unicef said that 36 children had been paralyzed by the polio virus in Syria since the disease first reappeared there last October after a 14-year absence. Polio also has been detected in two Iraqi children in Baghdad, and it paralyzed one of them in April, the report said. Although 25 million children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated multiple times in seven Middle East countries under an emergency campaign, the report said many Syrian children missed out because of fighting and restrictions on distributing medical aid. The report said 765,000 Syrian children under 5 live in hard-to-reach areas. Polio, which is spread by feces, was thought to be nearly eradicated a few years ago, but it has spread in some fragile countries this year. In May, the W.H.O. declared a global health emergency because of the resurgence, imposing travel restrictions on Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon because the virus had spread from those countries to neighbors.

The ruling, which The Board calls mindless and harmful, seized on poorly drafted language in the Affordable Care Act to end subsidies in the states that opted not to set up a state health exchange and instead relied on the federal exchange. It defies common sense to think that Congress really intended that there be no subsidies at all in 36 states, The Board writes. For now, the outcome is unclear: A second federal appeals court panel ruled the opposite way just a few hours later and the Obama administration is expected to appeal the first decision. Consumers are expected to retain their coverage and tax credits while this and similar suits in other jurisdictions wend their way through the court system.

us,"Classical Playlist: Herbert von Karajan, Brahms, Tchaikovsky and More","HERBERT VON KARAJAN: Choral Music 1947-1958Works by Bach, Beethoven and Brahms(Warner Classics; five discs)Warner Classics has issued a series of 13 box sets of the recordings Herbert von Karajan made for EMI between 1946 and 1984, all newly remastered. This five-CD album of choral works offers Beethovens Missa Solemnis from the mid-1950s with the Philharmonia Orchestra and a 1947 Brahms German Requiem with the Vienna Philharmonic. Of special interest for me is the 1952 account of Bachs Mass in B minor, with the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Singers of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde and quite a quartet of vocal soloists: Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Marga Hffgen, Nicolai Gedda and Heinz Rehfuss. This recording, the one I grew up with, harkens to an earlier time of weighty, thick-textured Bach performances. Contrast Karajans opening Kyrie, which lasts 12:17 minutes, with Philippe Herreweghes 1996 account on period instruments, an undulant 9:29! Still, Karajan draws solemnity, depth and character from the score. A fascinating recording. (Anthony Tommasini)",2014-07-23T17:44:07+0000

Putins inauguration in May 2012. The protest against Mr. Putin ended in violence between the police and demonstrators. A three-judge panel concluded that Sergei Udaltsov, the leader of the Left Front, had tried to organize mass riots in regions across Russia using money provided by a lawmaker from Georgia, with which Russia fought a war in 2008. The prosecutors case was partly based on information from a television special called The Anatomy of a Revolution that was broadcast on a state-funded television station. Mr. Udaltsov, the most prominent of 11 opposition activists sentenced to prison since the May 2012 protest, said the case was politically motivated. Mr. Udaltsovs co-defendant, Leonid Razvozzhayev, accused Russian agents of kidnapping him while he was seeking asylum in Ukraine. ",2014-07-25T03:28:13+0000

(Starz Cinema) WADJDA (2013) A rambunctious 10-year-old Saudi girl (Waad Mohammed, above) enters a Quran-reciting contest with a cash prize in the hope of buying the bicycle of her dreams  a mode of transportation discouraged for women, with which she intends to race a boy  and in the process overcome her reputation as a troublemaker. Heartbreak hovers over Haifaa al-Mansours sharply observed, deceptively gentle film, reportedly the first feature ever directed by a Saudi woman, with its decorous, deliberate scenes hinting at the difficulties facing her gender, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. But with impressive agility, Wadjda finds room to maneuver between harsh realism and a more hopeful kind of storytelling. There is warmth as well as austerity in Wadjdas world, kindness as well as cruelty, and the possibility, modestly sketched and ardently desired, of change.

It may sound at first suicidal on the part of this small country to seek to measure itself against the might of the Dual Monarchy. But the Servians dont seem to have an atom of fear. Undoubtedly  and the opinion of all military experts who have seen them is the same  the officers and men of the Servian army constitute the best fighting material in Europe. I saw them, at the time of the first Balkan war  three divisions, or 60,000 men, march through Mustapha Pasha, to the aid of the Bulgarians. Every man had already been in one, two or more actions. Everything one hears and sees leaves the impression that the Servians know what they are about, and that their lack of fear concerning their traditional enemies, the Austrians and Hungarians, is not without good reason.

Salinger, who died in 2010, is the subject of Thomas Bellers gentle New York-centric biography, J. D. Salinger: The Escape Artist, while Harper Lee turns up at the center of The Mockingbird Next Door, by the former Chicago Tribune reporter Marja Mills, new at No. 4 on the hardcover nonfiction list. There are a lot of superficial similarities between Salinger and Lee: Born seven years apart, both wrote beloved novels that have endured for decades as staples of high school reading lists  The Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird, as if you didnt know  and both quit writing in the early 1960s to retreat into strictly enforced silences. But they probably never met for drinks, to judge from the portrait of Lee that emerges in The Mockingbird Next Door. Mills first met Lee and her sister on assignment for The Tribune, and eventually rented the house neighboring theirs in Monroeville, Ala., for a year and a half, during which she had ample time to observe Lee going about her ordinary daily life: eating at McDonalds, feeding the town ducks, fishing with hot dogs as bait. Contrast those humble details with what weve learned over the years about the deeply eccentric Salinger, whose daughter claimed he sat in an orgone box and drank his own urine, and it becomes clear they dont have much in common after all.",2014-07-25T15:29:19+0000

Born in Berlin in 1922, Freud was 10 when his family moved to London (well before his famous grandfather, who escaped Austria only in 1938). He showed precocious talent as a draftsman  and as a troublemaker. Quick with his fists, he was a chronic expellee. Eventually he ended up at a private art school in Essex run by Cedric Morris; when the school burned down one night, Freud took the credit. But he remained a protg of Morris, one of a series of gay elders with whom the young Freud knew how to ingratiate himself  though he was conspicuously, not to say voraciously, heterosexual. His looks were as striking as his talent, despite Stephen Spenders observation at the time that he resembled Harpo Marx.",2014-07-25T15:33:29+0000

Why, in the firmaments name, should the approach of Mars be a danger to this planet of ours? M. Esclangon told anxious reporters. It is a simple matter of planetary motions which brings Mars in line with the earth and the sun every sixteen years, and if this geometrical phenomenon were to be the end of the world every time it occurred, there would have been no world long before this. Mere proximity of Mars to the earth is no menace, M.

(Epix) THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE (2013) A camera-ready Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, above) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) embark on their victory tour of the Panem districts as the Capitol prepares for the 75th games in this franchises second installment, directed by Francis Lawrence from the books by Suzanne Collins. But the champions arent safe yet: this new round of games pits past winners against one another in an ultimate death match. Donald Sutherland returns as President Snow, the target in Katnisss sights; Liam Hemsworth is one of her love interests, Gale Hawthorne; Woody Harrelson is Haymitch Abernathy, the only living Hunger Games victor from District 12; and Elizabeth Banks is Effie Trinket, the tributes escort. Catching Fire isnt a great work of art but its a competent, at times exciting movie and it does something that better, more artistically notable movies often fail to do: It speaks to its moment in time, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Boys (and men) are still boys, of course, including in movies, but the very existence of Katniss  who fights her own battles, and kisses and leaves the boys, only sometimes to save them  suggests cultural consumers are ready for change, even if most cultural producers remain foolishly stuck in the past.

I used as a starting point the renowned chef Rick Baylesss terrific roasted jalapeo tomato salsa with fresh cilantro, from a book he published in 1998 called Salsas That Cook. After I had grilled the tomatoes and jalapeo under a broiler (you could also cook them on a grill), I grilled an ear of corn, also under a broiler. The kernels take on a beautiful color, and their sweetness contrasts nicely with the charred and picante flavors that run through this salsa. The corn also contributes crunch. The salsa is great with tacos, chips, and grains, and is particularly good with chicken.",2014-07-28T13:57:18+0000

Letters from the Michigan chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations and from the Imams Council of the Michigan Muslim Community Council, released by Mr. Hekmatis family, beseeched the ayatollah to grant Mr. Hekmati a pardon, invoking the tradition of mercy associated with the end of the Ramadan holiday. It is unclear whether Ayatollah Khamenei, Irans supreme leader, has seen the letters. Mr. Hekmati, a former Marine from Flint, was arrested in 2011 while visiting relatives in Iran for the first time. He was tried and sentenced to death for espionage, but the verdict was overturned and he was later convicted of cooperation with a hostile government  the United States  and given a 10-year sentence.

The measure of that destruction can be estimated in billions of dollars, thrown away each year in the aggressive enforcement of pointless laws, and in years, whether wasted behind bars or stolen from a child who grows up fatherless. Decriminalizing marijuana use at the federal level will, first, eliminate costly, futile policing programs and enforcement laws that, each year, cost American taxpayers more than $3.6 billion. Second, it is an important step forward in resolving racial disparity in arrests and mass incarceration: The war on drugs aims its firepower overwhelmingly at African-Americans on the street, while white users smoke safely behind closed doors. And third, it offers an opportunity for state lawmakers to roll back the psychological and social damage already inflicted on drug offenders, such as sealing records of drug convictions in order to make it easier for defendants to get jobs and housing after a conviction.",2014-07-29T10:49:33+0000

In particular, its been interesting to watch Ryans liberal critics train so much fire at his blueprints support (not as a universal requirement, as I understand it, but as a potential model for states to follow)for a contractual approach to anti-poverty spending, in which beneficiaries draw up customized life plans, set goals and targets, and have rewards and penalties pegged to their follow-through on those responsibilities. The liberal critiques of this idea, from writers like Annie Lowrey and Jamelle Bouie among many others, have been genuinely informative: I feel (sincerely!) like I have a better handle on the left-of-center view of poverty and anti-poverty policy than I did a week ago, and hopefully my future posts on the subject will profit from that advance in understanding.",2014-07-29T20:43:30+0000

We want you to look at the art and imagine that its a shape-shifting alien whos desperately trying to communicate with you, but its using means that are beyond any language that youve ever encountered before, Ms. Ronson said.

Seventy-five years after that story was first published in The New Yorker, a descendant of the Brevoort, where the couple lived, still stands. But their argument would probably play out not over Courvoisier but coffee with hearts etched into the foam on top, or complicated green juices.
