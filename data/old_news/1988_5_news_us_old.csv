In a compilation of accidents for the years 1970-79, causes of all accidents are compared with causes of fatal accidents. (There is no ''pilot died'' category, but it seems reasonable to assume that, in statistical terms, ''fatal accidents'' are generally equivalent to accidents in which the pilot died.) In the ''all accidents'' category, the pilot is found responsible for the accident in only 38.6 percent of the cases. However, in ''fatal accidents'' the pilot is found responsible 61.5 percent of the time.",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

It has phantasmagorical changes of scene, from a concert for poor Italians in London to pawnshop and sweatshop, workhouse and emigrant ship, prison yard and old-clothes market. It also has a bonus unannounced in the title of the show, in that the Vincent van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has lent not only a number of related drawings by van Gogh himself but a group of the English popular prints and engravings that he collected in huge numbers.",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

The title of Fred Pfeil's first collection of stories suggests a transcendence his characters seldom attain. Indeed, ''Shine On'' records the peculiar diminutions of American life during the 1970's and the way a shrinking economy pinches the imagination as well as the purse. Whether they're ''scratching out a living on a Pennsylvania farm . . . [ or ] trying to be happy as a foreman at the tire plant back in Akron,'' Mr. Pfeil's men and women slog through lives that seem to resist yielding up the barest satisfaction. Two stories, ''Skeeter's Last Reflections'' and ''The Collected Works of Brown,'' telescope the lifetimes of their protagonists into mosaics of pain. In the first, an alcoholic factory worker is run over by a car in the final paragraph, while in the second a man endures a numbing 45 years as a washroom janitor. Some readers may find these small-town portraits almost schematically dreary. But as a narrator Mr. Pfeil is too sharply observant to make his characters into martyrs; instead, his heightened observation becomes a form of compassion. Several other stories examine blue-collar life from the more complicated perspective of the small-town boy who's gone to the city. The best of these, ''The Quality of Light in Maine,'' represents the author's most accomplished work. As he measures the currents that flow among a trio of lovers and friends, Mr. Pfeil's writing takes on the qualities of the light in the story's title: its clarity, its fine distinctions and the luminous surprise of its perspectives.",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"STARLIGHT, by Scott Ely. (Warner, $4.50.) Tom Light, an American sniper in Vietnam, is rumored to have powers over life and death - and a rifle scope that can tell who is about to die. Last year, our reviewer, Richard Burgin, said this novel is written in ''a pared-down prose that controls and accentuates its author's fury at the war. [ The ] dialogue is assaultive and obscene but also wholly convincing.'' THE BEST OF EDWARD ABBEY, edited and illustrated by Edward Abbey. (Sierra Club, $10.95.) It is in his nature that Edward Abbey, the iconoclastic environ-mentalist, anarchist and writer, would insist on editing his own anthology. Originally titled ''Slumgullion Stew,'' the collection includes excerpts from his first, widely unnoticed novel, ''Jonathan Troy,'' his celebrated memoir ''Desert Solitaire'' and a novel in progress, ''The Rites of Spring.'' In 1984, our reviewer, Judith Baumel, said Mr. Abbey ''shows himself to be an irritating, irreverent macho man with a heart of gold, an ornery environmentalist who praises (all things in moderation) indolence, beer for breakfast and rolling a few boulders into Escalante Canyon for fun.'' SHOWDOWN AT GUCCI GULCH: Lawmakers, Lobbyists, and the Unlikely Triumph of Tax Reform, by Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Alan S. Murray. (Vintage, $9.95.) How in the world did liberal tax reformers and conservative supply-siders manage to conspire with lobbyists (the people in Gucci shoes) to overhaul the Federal income tax laws in 1986? ''Even the hordes of Americans whose eyes glaze at the sight of a tax table will enjoy this remarkably lively account of the maneuvers and betrayals,'' Robert Lekachman said here last year. THE NORTHERN LIGHTS, by Howard Norman. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) Living in a lonely outpost in central Canada, a 14-year-old boy finds that a shortwave radio is fast becoming his closest friend. Last year, our reviewer, Ceil Cleveland, called the novel ''a striking achievement.'' THE U.S. SENATE: Paralysis or a Search for Consensus? by George E. Reedy. (Mentor/New American Library, $4.95.) During the Eisenhower years, George E. Reedy served as a senior aide to the Senate majority leader, Lyndon Baines Johnson, making him an ideal person to advise a Democratic Congress on how to deal with a popular Republican President. In 1986, Steven V. Roberts said here that every Democrat in the Senate should read the book. ''If Mr. Reedy could have a maxim chiseled in the stone of the Capitol, it would probably be this: Compromise Is Not Immoral.'' THE FORTUNE TELLER, by Marsha Norman. (Bantam, $4.50.) In this first novel by Marsha Norman, whose play '' 'Night, Mother'' won a Pulitzer Prize in 1983, a psychic uses her powers to solve a kidnapping, but she is frustrated in her attempt to keep her own daughter from being taken away. Last year, our reviewer, Amy Hempel, said the book was ''not exactly literature,'' but ''the parallel stories of missing children . . . keep us turning the pages.'' QUEEN OF HEARTS, by Susan Shreve. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) In another novel about a clairvoyant, the granddaughter of a prostitute kills her husband-to-be but has his baby anyway. Last year, one reviewer called it ''an eerily plausible parable of our times.'' SAUDI ARABIA: The Ceaseless Quest for Security, by Nadav Safran. (Cornell University, $15.95.) With its enormous oil reserves and indefensible borders, the author argues, Saudi Arabia is torn by its dependence on American protection and a desire for Arab unity. Writing in these pages in 1985, John C. Campbell called the book ''the most comprehensive, informative and reliable account of Saudi foreign policy yet written.'' BEFORE LUNCH, by Angela Thirkell. (Carroll & Graf, $4.95.) In another satire by the author of ''Pomfret Towers,'' an architect, his young wife and their relatives and neighbors are caught in a skein of crisscrossed affairs. In 1940, Louise Maunsell Field said here that the novel gives ''a fresh, altogether delightful picture of [ the ] virtues and . . . very human absurdities'' of life in the English countryside. CHOURA: The Memoirs of Alexandra Danilova. (Fromm International, $11.95.) Alexandra Danilova danced with Diaghilev and lived with George Balanchine. '' 'Choura' is crammed with delicious and revealing anecdotes,'' Jennifer Dunning said in The Book Review last year. ''As light as a souffle and as warm and faceted as a ruby, [ it ] is filled with trenchant commentary on the development and the personalities of 20th-century ballet.'' THE BROKEN PENNY, by Julian Symons. (Carroll & Graf, $3.95.) A British intelligence agent is brought out of retirement to smuggle an exiled leader back into an Eastern European country, in hopes of fomenting a revolution. In 1953, our reviewer, Anthony Boucher, called the novel ''the most exciting, astonishing and believable spy story to appear in years.'' ENIGMA: The Life of Knut Hamsun, by Robert Ferguson. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.95.) When the Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun won a Nobel Prize in 1920, he gave the medal to Joseph Goebbels. Ever since, critics have tried to understand how a Nazi sympathizer could write novels that inspired the likes of Hemingway, Gide and Mann. '' [ Robert ] Ferguson's uncompromising, painful, curiously moving portrait attempts neither to conceal the epic contradictions of his subject's character nor to dispel them,'' Tom Clark said in The Book Review last year. ''One is left with the terrible feeling that Hamsun believed himself even when he was acting as a mouthpiece for some of the cheapest lies in history.''",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

In 1947 he went to live at his parents' bait camp on Chinquapin Bay, off the south Texas coast, 20 miles from Bay City. He remained there for 27 years, fishing during the day, painting irregularly at night, copying his visions in a sketchbook in the morning. The sketchbook is lost.

us,FICTION,"INTIMATE STRANGERS: New Stories From Quebec. Edited by Matt Cohen and Wayne Grady. (Penguin, Paper, $6.95.) Canadian literature remains, in this country, largely an unknown landscape, one in which only a few figures have much visibility. And so the large, robust and diverse body of work produced by the generation of French Canadian writers who came of age in the 1970's has been virtually invisible in the United States. ''Intimate Strangers'' offers a preliminary map of that exotic terrain. In their introduction, the editors of this collection, Matt Cohen and Wayne Grady, stress the extent to which these younger writers have distanced themselves from the forms of earlier French Canadian writers, developing work that depends more on the play of language and the urban experience, and less on the traditions of the folk tale and the realities of a rural existence. Victor-Levy Beaulieu, for example, presents a witty sendup of the form of the folk tale in ''The Rubber Ball,'' which features a bizarre protagonist who sets out to make a name for himself by shooting Niagara Falls in a large rubber ball. In contrast, Monique Proulx's ''Feint of Heart'' is a wry dissection of the mating habits of young urban academics. And ''The Good Old Days'' by Andre Major is a straightforward tale of male bonding and the nostalgia that haunts the middle-aged. The nine other stories demonstrate in varying degrees a quality that sets much contemporary French Canadian writing apart from current trends: the embrace of surrealism and with it a fascination with literary structure. Because of this, the stories in ''Intimate Strangers,'' although ably rendered by a number of translators, are not always easy reading. But they are uniformly strong, forming a vivid introduction to a group of challenging writers.",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

In a time of growing worry about trade with the Pacific Rim countries, the story of the opening of the Pacific itself has on the face of it a certain interest. Indeed, the possibilities for commerce as much as for knowledge led the sponsors of Capt. James Cook, a Yorkshire farm laborer's son turned sailor and scientist, to send him out three times in the decade that began in 1768. His mission was to search for a southern continent or find the Northwest Passage, to map lands and harbors and to discover peoples. An assistant director of the University of California Press with a background in history and a previous biography (of Abigail Adams) to her credit, in ''Voyages of Discovery'' Lynne Withey explores anthropology. She does a nice job examining the way in which the Europeans' moral and romantic expectations colored their reactions to and interactions with the Pacific islanders through her skillful quotation from and sensitive readings of the voyagers' own writings. A comfortable aristocrat sees ''in Tahiti a miniature version of . . . feudalism''; a young idealist observes ''a democratic society of equals''; and almost all the voyagers, everywhere they go, are torn between Christian censoriousness and a Rousseau-like belief in the corrupting effects of civilization. But with tales like these, how one wishes for maps.

us,BURIED TREASURE IN THE CITIES OF ROCK,"One can only imagine the astonishment of 19th-century explorers upon finding under jungle creepers and desert sands carefully worked stone figures and large, complex structures. With ancient texts as their sole guides, they must have fancied that these cities of rock had sprung from the pages of classical literature, rather than the other way around. In FOOTSTEPS: Nine Archaeological Journeys of Romance and Discovery (Salem House, $24.95), Bruce Norman profiles the courageous and sometimes rapacious adventurers who laid the groundwork for modern archeological research. In 1817, face to face with crumbling mummies, Giovanni Belzoni crept through labyrinthine Egyptian pyramids. Others found the abandoned cities of Machu Picchu in Peru and southern Africa's Great Zimbabwe. ''Footsteps,'' a lavishly illustrated companion volume to a BBC series that has been shown on cable television in the United States, uncritically accepts the travelers' accounts of ignorance and treachery among the peoples they visited. Mr. Norman, the executive producer of the series, emphasizes the many difficulties the explorers endured, including the suspicions of local inhabitants that the Europeans intended to plunder buried treasure. In the end, their suspicions proved correct. Explorers filled the coffers of European museums with priceless relics. Belzoni reported that an Arab guide, ''on hearing of my fortunate success in collecting several valuable pieces . . . observed to me, that, if I persevered in my researches, I should have my throat cut.'' Undeterred, Belzoni carved his name into all the artifacts, seeking to insure that he'd never become as anonymous as their manufacturers.",1988-05-01T05:00:00+0000

In response, he said he'd been ''constantly trying to improve'' his depiction of women. ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' his 1984 novel about three sorceresses, he said, ''was a very determined attempt to write about women who did have careers of a sort''; the novel was ''one attempt to make things right with my, what shall we call them, feminist detractors.'' His new novel, ''S.,'' he added, represents another effort in that direction. A comic variation on Hawthorne's ''Scarlet Letter,'' ''S.,'' published by Alfred A. Knopf, not only updates the story of that famous adulteress Hester Prynne; but it also attempts, says its author, to tell the story from Hester's point of view.",1988-05-05T05:00:00+0000

His current exhibition at the Diane Brown Gallery, entitled ''Subtle Delusions,'' expands on an idea the artist has fruitfully pursued for several years - copying in three dimensions various shapes derived from chance arrangements of lines on paper. Appearing to sway and prance across the gallery's floor, these latest creations exude a gentle and unpretentious grace. Mr. Fisher explores what occurs as forms metamorphose: he first makes paper, which rests on felt pads to dry; the paper absorbs bits of the felt, and these consequently appear as tiny aberrations - or like minuscule, abstract, hairline scribbles - embedded in the surface. Mr. Fisher calls the marks ''apographs.'' He discovers the random felt fibers, meticulously copies their shapes in pencil on a larger scale, and proceeds to reproduce in plaster, wax or clay what he has drawn. From this, he fashions the untitled bronze sculptures shown with the pieces of paper that act as their inspiration.",1988-05-06T05:00:00+0000

About half the lenders peg their ARM's to the one-year Treasury bill, but if you're shopping around for a mortgage, it's worth knowing that there are other indexes and other choices. The lender's literature may not explain all this, but loan officers will, if you ask. For the borrower, some indexes may be more favorable than others.

The country is proceeding with an ambitious nuclear energy program. 1 France's parliamentary majority, a loose rightist coalition, could be split if President Francois Mitterrand wins Sunday's presidential election convincingly.

Workers said the Government promised to negotiate; the Government said no agreement was reached. 2 Taiwan's aging legislature blocks democracy, according to Chu Kao-cheng, a 33-year-old opposition legislator who makes his point by jumping on desks, smashing microphones and shouting at older legislators. 4 American hostages reportedly abused 3 West German asks U.S. missiles 4 German company calls transfer of heavy water proper 4 27 die in Lebanon battles 5 Afghan leader appeals to rebel moderates and issues warning 5 NATIONAL 7-8, 34-36 The nation's jobless rate fell a tenth of a point in April to 5.4 percent, the lowest since 1974, as the proportion of the population with jobs hit a record, the Labor Department reported. 1 New York's unemployment rate fell in April to its lowest level in 18 years, the United States Department of Labor reported. New York and New Jersey each recorded a seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 3.5 percent. 8 The year 2000 may upset computers, causing malfunctions in machines whose programs fail to recognize that Dec. 31, 1999, will be followed by Jan. 1, 2000. The oddity could affect many records stored on mainframe computers. 1 News analysis: The offer of amnesty to aliens who had lived in the United States for five years or more was the result of a political compromise that imposed limits that the program may never be able to overcome. 7 Religion in the workplace is being challenged by an employee of a private company who was required to attend services at work. His case is testing whether private corporations can force employees to share a religious message. 7 Criticism of Chicago's Acting Mayor, Eugene Sawyer, has come from every quarter after Mr. Sawyer dismissed an assistant who delivered speeches attacking whites, especially Jews. 7 Workers recalled confusion in a Los Angeles skyscraper as they tried to escape from a fire in the building. It was a terrifying night for about 50 people trapped in the tower, many of whom did not speak English. 36 President angry over Regan book 7 Quarantine on bee mites lifted as unworkable 36 Congressional offices called safe despite Wright fire 36 Politics 34 George Bush said he is troubled by some of the allegations of ethical impropriety against Edwin Meese 3d.

A poll in a conservative Idaho district showed Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee, with a slight lead. 34 Jesse Jackson called teen-agers who admitted using drugs to come forward at a high school in Los Angeles. About 100 heeded the Democratic Presidential candidate's call. 34 Dukakis loses court plea on National Guard 34 REGIONAL 29-32 Foster care for children with AIDS is in short supply. New York City has recruited about 75 foster parents in the last three years, but there are more needy babies than parents. 29 An independent agency for bridges in New York City will be proposed by the Koch administration.

It is there, unerringly, even in her journals, represented by the first two pieces in the new book, true cahiers kept during ''The Events in May'' of 1968, capturing the humor, poignancy and utter seriousness of an entire culture's flirtation with and exasperation over change. And it is there in her critical writing, calculated and spare, as in her appraisal of the calm, unswerving voice of Marguerite Yourcenar, ''limpid pessimist,'' or her exploration of the relation between a writer's life and work (the case at hand is Elizabeth Bowen). Her mind's eye, happily, is always open. Most of the pieces in ''Paris Notebooks'' have to do with the French or France, where Ms. Gallant, a Canadian, has lived since 1950, and many of the reviews are of translations. Thank goodness for her ear, not just her eye.",1988-05-08T05:00:00+0000

The crowning event of the evening - and clearly the main drawing card for American businessmen - was a rousing speech by Soviet Leader Mikhail S.

us,FICTION,"GREEN CITY IN THE SUN. By Barbara Wood. (Random House, $19.95.) An interesting tale of Africa in the stormy days before independence is buried under about 300 pages of excess verbiage and extraneous characters in this new novel by the author of ''Domina'' and ''Vital Signs.'' In ''Green City in the Sun,'' Barbara Wood chronicles life in Kenya from 1919 to the present through the experiences of two families, the English Trevertons and the African Mathenges. Two strong women stand out immediately: Grace Treverton, who has defied convention to become a doctor and establish a hospital in Kenya, and Wachera, a medicine woman who seeks to defend traditional African culture against the changes brought by the white settlers. These intriguing figures are surrounded by such stock characters as the imperialistic, insensitive Lord Treverton (Grace's brother) and his sexually repressed wife, Rose. Hovering around this cast, the plot languishes in cliched situations, marking time until a sharply defined second generation emerges into maturity: independent Mona Treverton, frustrated by her father's sexist refusal to let her run their farm; pathetic Njeri, who longs to be white; David Mathenge, torn between his love for Mona and his commitment to African independence; and David's wife Anjiru, an ardent feminist who becomes a leader of the Mau Mau. Their stories are more compelling, but the reader's interest eventually flags with the introduction of a sketchily drawn third generation. Most prominent among the latter is Deborah Treverton, the modern-day protagonist whose return to Kenya after 15 years in California opens and closes the book. Deborah never really comes to life, and the dilemma she faces seems both trite and contrived. It's symptomatic of the book's lack of focus, by the way, that the ''green city'' of the title is Nairobi, which is by no means the center of the action.",1988-05-08T05:00:00+0000

us,WHEN THE PATIENT IS A PET,"PET OWNERS SUFFER AS MUCH AS their ailing animal companions, as may be seen in these photographs taken recently in the busy, 24-hour emergency room at the Animal Medical Center. Founded in 1910 in lower Manhattan, A.M.C. moved uptown in 1961 to its eight-story, state-of-the-art quarters on East 62d Street, in the heart of New York's biomedical community. (New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Rockefeller University Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are only blocks away; the A.M.C. often draws upon their specialized expertise.) There are 75 veterinarians among the 300 employees on the center's staff, who handle 65,000 medical visits each year and can take in up to 225 in-patients at a time. Dogs and cats, of course, comprise the bulk of the center's practice, but its exotic-pets department also treats rabbits, birds, ferrets, tropical fish, gerbils and reptiles - ''Everything,'' remarks one staff member, ''that isn't a dog or a cat.'' The A.M.C. has equipment not found in most veterinarians' offices - for example, a new, $500,000 radiation-therapy unit and a computerized tomography scanner to pinpoint the exact site of a disease. The center is also known for its research on and clinical investigation of such diseases as animal cancers and feline leukemia.

Two cops - one brutal and vengeful, the other kind and caring - patrol the mean streets of Alphabet City in this gritty first novel about the drug subculture of New York's Lower East Side. True to the schematic conventions of such crime procedurals, the ''human'' partner oozes compassion for the local criminals and their prey, who are joint victims of the rampant illegal drug economy, while the hard-nosed cop just wants to beat all the dope fiends to a pulp. The formula twist here is that Soledad Santiago makes the bleeding-heart cop a man and his tough partner a woman. ''I had come back for my vengeance,'' snarls Toni Conroy, a 24-year-old rookie who joins the force to launch a vendetta against the drug merchants responsible for the deaths of her younger brother and her child. Tops on her hit list is a slippery dealer known as The Cobra. Stymied by her partner's square-shooter style, Toni slips under cover as a hooker, tracking her quarry in the company of whores, pimps, addicts and dealers. In no time she becomes a heroin addict herself. And the deeper Toni sinks into degradation, the better Ms. Santiago's writing gets. After tripping over her tongue trying to write dialogue for straight white cops and upscale criminals, she seems to have located a fresh vein in the raw vernacular of the criminal underclass. ''Dawn on the Lower East Side is always sneaky,'' goes one of her unsentimental descriptions. ''It rises over the rooftops in one move, as if somebody had turned on a big dirty light bulb.''

From him I heard, with incredulity, of the birth in 1879 of Ignacz Timotheus Trebitsch in a small provincial town in Hungary, of his conversions from Judaism to various sects of Christianity and then to Buddhism, of his wanderings from Hungary to China, of his adoption of the name Lincoln (the first of more than a dozen noms de guerre), of his election to the British House of Commons and of his activity as a German spy in both world wars.

Russell Martin's well-written first novel traces a year in the life of Jack Healy, a decent, fortyish family man whose strenuous career has put too much pressure on his marriage. This seemingly predictable material is made fresh because Healy is not a typical overworked professional but an astronaut, and because the year revolves around the real-life explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. The disaster looms throughout the story, which begins with Healy, the narrator, visiting his native Colorado, where he attempts to repair a troubled relationship with his schizophrenic brother. Back on the job in Houston, Healy carries out routine tasks for NASA and tries to deal with his wife's defection to Austin and another man; he also works at a tentative, long-distance romance with a childhood friend. The fiery shuttle accident comes as a painful personal jolt, forcing Healy to confront his feelings about his brother and his own role in the space program. Mr. Martin, whose several nonfiction books include a study of neurology called ''Matters Gray and White,'' has given ''Beautiful Islands'' a shapely structure and nicely realized settings, with convincing details on shuttle training and the view from 200 miles up. But he is less successful with his characters, who never quite break out of their carefully described lives to fully engage the reader's emotions. If Mr. Martin can acquire as solid a grip on human beings as he now has on the details of nature and technology, his future novels should be well worth waiting for.",1988-05-08T05:00:00+0000

Conceived as a successor to the British-built Cosworth engine that has captured every Indianapolis 500 since 1978, the Chevrolet-Ilmor V-8 was initially designed, in fact, by two former Cosworth engineers. ''We ran it in one of our spare cars in 1985,'' says Derrick Walker, vice president and general manager of Penske Racing, which, along with Chevrolet, financed the endeavor of the two designers, Mario Illien and Paul Morgan. ''In '86, we ran it for most of the year. For the '87 season, it was offered to other racing teams, too.'' More powerful than the Cosworth, the new engine has had great success in shorter races; efforts over the winter were aimed at improving its durability.

us,YOU CAN THANK THE BEAVERS,"Natural history is so much more exciting than our clay-footed human variety. Glacial invasions, global migrations, the decline and fall of great ecological orders - whether the actors are tiny plankton or colossal mountain ranges, the scale of events is epic. Yet we scarcely give nature a nod as we dutifully keep trying to learn how to take charge by studying and restudying the Roman Empire, Napoleon and Henry Ford. Isn't it time to pay more attention to the rest of life on the planet? A good starting point is LIFE IN THE BALANCE: Companion to the Audubon Television Specials (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $29.95), an intelligent guide to environmental conservation, elegantly written by a nature writer, David Rains Wallace. More than a rehash of the television series it was written to accompany, it is also more than the familiar platform on behalf of whales, wolves and other endangered species. In illustrated chapters that describe the earth's major geographical features, Mr. Wallace shows how the natural world we take for granted is continually shifting and changing. The gentle, lush North American landscape of fields, ponds and streams that European settlers found was most likely created by abundant beaver colonies, building log dams that gradually tamed the fierce, gravel-washed rivers left behind when the polar glaciers receded. In judging the often disastrous environmental consequences of modern industry and agriculture, the author very occasionally confuses his priorities. He observes that game laws don't always work well in the third world: ''In recent years, birds have been machine-gunned by the thousands in Lebanon.'' Not only birds, unfortunately. But over all, this is a thoughtful and lively attempt to square economic progress and ecological well-being.",1988-05-08T05:00:00+0000

Advocates of change say the issue is fairness, not revenue, and complain that small businesses are at a competitive disadvantage in competing with not-for-profit groups. [ Page A1. ] A very good year in commercial banking seems in the offing if first-quarter results are an indicator. The biggest banks rebounded with healthy earnings, benefiting from belt-tightening, moderate interest rates and gains in the trading of securities. [ D1. ] Little likelihood of rigidly fixed exchange rates was predicted by Richard G. Darman, the former Deputy Treasury Secretary who shaped much of the Administration's current dollar policy. [ D2. ] MARKETS The Dow Jones industrial average fell below 2,000 as stock prices declined for a fourth straight day. Volume remained lethargic as the Dow fell 10.11 points, to 1,997.35. The last time the Dow closed below 2,000 was April 21. [ D1. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were mixed in sluggish trading as market participants prepared for the start of the Treasury's $26 billion quarterly refunding, which begins today with the $8.75 billion sale of three-year notes. A sharp increase in commodity prices and signs that the Federal Reserve may be tightening monetary policy helped to push down note prices. [ D1. ] The pound rose sharply on unfounded rumors that the Government's key advocate of currency weakness was preparing to quit. Gold rose $3.60 an ounce on the Comex, to $447.30. [ D18. ] Prices of precious metals futures rallied on fears that South Africa would react to further United States economic sanctions by reducing its exports of platinum and gold. [ D18. ] INTERNATIONAL The Paris Bourse rose strongly and the franc held its own the day after France's Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, won re-election. [ D1. ] Saudi Arabia is drafting a new charter for Aramco, cutting its legal ties to the U.S. But it is seeking joint ventures with the four American oil companies that formerly owned the oil giant.

us,Q&A,"Q. Our wood deck appears to be made of cedar. There seems to be no sealer or finish, and when people walk or sit on it, a gray-brown dust gets all over clothes and shoes. What can we put on the deck to prevent this? A. First clean the wood thoroughly with one of the special wood restorers or cleaners that are sold for rejuvenating old wood siding and shingles. Scrub thoroughly according to directions on the package; then let the wood dry and apply two coats of a decking stain (not a shingle stain, but a stain made for wood decks). This should seal the wood and prevent the powdering. Q. The previous owner of our 75-year-old house put down carpet over the beautiful hardwood floors. The carpet, which is in poor condition, has foam backing and is glued down. After taking up a few square feet we tried lacquer thinner, ammonia, paint remover and various cleaners to clean the adhesive off, but have been only partly successful, while contending with terrible fumes. How can we get back to the original hardwood? A. Your best bet is to scrape up as much as possible with a stiff putty knife or a long-handled scraper used to remove ice from sidewalks. Use a floor sanding machine to get the rest off and to get down to the bare wood. Then the floors can be refinished properly. In most cases three sandings are required: one with coarse grit to get the floor clean; one with medium to get rid of the scratches left by the coarse paper; one with fine, for final smoothing. Machines can be rented from most hardware stores and tool rental agencies, or you can hire a floor finisher to do the whole job. Q. For safety, we want a bar or hand grip on the wall above our bathtub. The walls are covered with thin vinyl tiles (vintage 1958) which we cannot replace, so we must work carefully. What is the best way to make the holes in this plastic tile, and what precautions should we take? A. The plastic tiles are easily drilled with an ordinary twist drill bit. First, scratch a small X with the end of a small file to keep the tip of the bit from skipping around and scratching the tile.",1988-05-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Wooing White Sox,"Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida last night agreed to meet today in Tallahassee with Eddie Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf, the owners of the Chicago White Sox. Earlier yesterday, Martinez canceled the breakfast meeting after he heard reports that the White Sox would not be moving to Florida, but would probably keep playing in Chicago. Martinez agreed to reschedule the meeting after being asked to by State Senator Curt Kiser. A state House committee approved a $30 million package to lure the team to Florida, but a corresponding Senate committee failed to include the money in its version of the annual state budget. The White Sox said Wednesday that they had agreed not to move if Illinois lawmakers approved a revised lease on a new Chicago stadium, saving the team up to $60 million over 10 years. ''They've given us their word that if we pass this bill, they'll stay,'' Gov. James R. Thompson said. ''Better than that, I can't ask.'' Under the Illinois proposal, the team's attendance would determine its rent on a $120 stadium to be built by a state authority near aging Comiskey Park, the team's home. The White Sox would not be required to pay rent in any year in which the team's attendance does not reach 1.2 million customers, and would split $4 million in annual operating costs with the Illinois state authority. Thompson, who said Illinois legislative leaders and Mayor Eugene Sawyer of Chicago had endorsed the proposal, hopes to begin legislative action next week. ''We don't want to take a back seat to St. Petersburg, Florida,'' he said. ''If this were a factory, we wouldn't let it go to Florida.'' (AP)",1988-05-13T05:00:00+0000

The Senate leadership gave all but final approval to the agreements reached in Geneva. Page 1 Soviet officials reopened verification terms on the missile accord after Secretary of State George Shultz said all problems had been worked out. Negotiators finally resolved the point. 5 A nuclear-powered Soviet satellite is expected to crash in late summer, the Soviet news agency said. Coincidentally, a Soviet official and American scientists called for a ban on nuclear reactors in orbit about the Earth. 4 Mysticism in Soviet society is serious business for many people, including members of the intelligentsia. One psychic healer in Moscow has a state business license and clients from all walks of life. 1 A century after Brazil ended slavery, the country is involved in wide-ranging discussions of the problems confronting blacks. Attention has been focused on poverty and discrimination many face. 1 Pope John Paul II urged Bolivians to fight the drug trade as a matter of Christian duty. The Pope made his remarks in Santa Cruz, which police say is the country's largest transit point for cocaine smuggling. 3 Brothels in Hamburg are closing as fear of AIDS keeps customers away. Some have shifted to other forms of entertainment. Businesses unrelated to prostitution are also moving into the red-light district. 4 Fighting continued in Beirut as Shiite Moslem fundamentalists of the Party of God seized additional positions from Amal, the rival Shiite militia. The fighting broke the latest cease-fire. 7 Some top American aides are optimistic on a Noriega deal 3 Indian troops enter Sikh temple 4 Israeli patrols keep West Bank quiet 7 National 8-11, 54 The military's role in stopping drugs from entering the country would be expanded under a measure approved by the Senate as an amendment to the defense authorization bill. The vote was 83 to 6. 1 An ambassador who denied briefing Vice President Bush about charges that Panama's military leader was involved in drug trafficking told a Congressional delegation about the charges 17 days later, three people at the meeting said. 10 A sharp rise in inflation is not likely in the next month or two, but increased inflation in the longer term is a threat, according to the performance in April of a Government index on producer prices, which rose moderately. 1 Tax rules for artists were revised by the Internal Revenue Service after writers and artists protested changes in the rules on deducting expenses. Lobbyists said the revisions did not go far enough. 1 AIDS has hit a chorus for gay men, killing 35 members of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus since 1982. Founded 10 years ago, the singing group has achieved stature in the city's artistic community. 1 Confidence in the Justice Deparment is undermined by the continued presence of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, according to some Republican members of Congress who want Mr. Meese to step down. 9 Three lowly states seek progress together 8 Where symphony is a matter of inheritance 8 Pentagon says germ warfare research is safe 54 Politics 10 Jesse Jackson plans to appoint two black Democrats with excellent relations to the party's leadership to major positions in his campaign as part of his strategy for the national convention. 10 Jesse Jackson said his criticism of Michael Dukakis is part of a fight for control of the Democratic Party's approach to policy and that he did not mean to equate Mr. Dukakis and Vice President Bush philosophically. 10 Michael Dukakis appeared confident as he campaigned for the Democratic Presidential nomination in California and Oregon. The trip seemed almost to be a preview of the general election campaign. 10 Regional 33-36 The Williamsburg Bridge will be shut at least three more weeks and will then gradually reopen, city officials said. Cars will be allowed on it first, then subway trains and trucks. 1 Republicans are fighting in New York and that could affect the Presidential campaign. Vice President Bush's younger brother, Jonathan, and the national committeeman, Richard Rosenbaum, are at odds. 33 Two people were shot and robbed of nearly $400,000 in cash, the police said, when at least three gunmen accosted them as they delivered the money to an office building in lower Manhattan. 33 How companies deliver money is not regulated by state laws 36 Delays in a city redevelopment plan for the Lower East Side of Manhattan, announced four years ago, have been caused, in part, by disputes among city officials, developers and neighborhood groups. 33 Noise from jetliners in New Jersey grew louder over some communities after the number of flight paths into airports was increased to ease air traffic congestion. Residents are angry. 33 The identity of a man found floating in the East River was discovered a year after his body was found. The police credited luck, detective work and a circumstance of Jewish tradition. 35 The case of a former state official has been referred to Federal prosecutors by the New York State Investigation Commission, which said the retired head of the State Thruway Authority conspired to commit extortion. 35 Brawley's family hints she might testify 34 Settlement announced in ''arborcide'' case 35 Wells Fargo robbery defendant is ordered released 36",1988-05-14T05:00:00+0000

us,THE NATIONAL CONVENTIONS IN 1948,"Like Reuven Frank of NBC, I, too, have sweaty memories of those three political conventions at Philadelphia in 1948 - no air-conditioning in the auditorium, hotel rooms, or television ''studios,'' which were simply rooms hung with white sheets (''1948: Live . . . From Philadelphia . . . It's the National Conventions,'' April 17). The electric bulbs exuded heat as well as light, and the facial makeup - which, we thought, was to make us prettier, not to correct the distortion caused by the lights - melted into one's collar. (Let it be asserted and revealed right here that it was not Richard M. Nixon's makeup that ruined him in the 1960 debates with John F. Kennedy, but the lighting, which is the most unstable factor in televison-studio technology.) Mr. Frank recounts how the civil-rights speech by Mayor Hubert H. Humphrey of Minneapolis made him a national figure and drove the Southern Democrats out of the convention and into the Dixiecrat Party. But a recurrent itch compels me to record a memory. The left-liberal Democrats argued all night in a suite in Rittenhouse Square about the civil-rights plank of the platform. I left about 4 A.M., after Humphrey promised to call me at my hotel as soon as a decision had been made.",1988-05-15T05:00:00+0000

us,HOW ANTIQUE IS ANTIQUE?,"No subject is of greater interest to antiques collectors than how to detect fakes and repairs in period furnishings. In FAKE, FRAUD, OR GENUINE? Identifying Authentic American Antique Furniture (New York Graphic Society/ Little, Brown, $29.95), Myrna Kaye, a former consulting curator of furniture at the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston, describes scores of ways in which American antique chairs, tables, chests and sideboards are not all that dealers and auctioneers claim them to be. One of the more popular scams, of course, is selling modern works as antiques; these pieces of furniture are either made of old wood or else crafted as reproductions and then aged. The author urges shoppers to question everything, pointing out that antiques are frequently enhanced for profit. She tells how an undecorated drawer on a high chest is transformed with a boldly carved shell, how a fraudulent label is added to the underside of a desk and how two old Chippendale-style chairs are combined to produce a rare form - a double-backed settee. The primary focus of Ms. Kaye's book, which contains more than 200 illustrations, is on 18th-century American furniture. That is understandable, because the period is a favorite of collectors and there exists plenty of relevant documentation on forgeries and doctored furniture. Those in search of guidance on the 19th-century revival styles must look elsewhere. The author's chatty style and sweeping generalizations detract from the merit of many stories - especially those in which the participants are not named or, when they are, have not been allowed to respond to Ms. Kaye's statements.",1988-05-15T05:00:00+0000

There was a poster promoting an astrology video she had starred in. There was some literature on horoscope pendants she sold that purportedly cause the wearer to think subconsciously about money. Those thoughts should then attract pleasing sums of cash. First, however, you must part with some money. The pendants are $14.40; an extra $5 gets you a chain. If you supply the time, date and place of your birth, Ms. Palmer will work up your horoscope chart and, in a two-hour chat, give you a good idea of what's coming up. Precision counts.

In a long life that ended in 1949, Zandonai took Puccini-esque declamatory style and prettied it up considerably, but never discarded its character. The least ''offensive'' parts of 20th-century music were incorporated into his operas - Strauss's orchestration, for example, and Debussy's whole-tone language.

us,NONFICTION,"THE RISE OF AMERICAN AIR POWER: The Creation of Armageddon. By Michael S. Sherry. (Yale University, $29.95.) It is a sobering idea Michael S. Sherry pursues in this book, which won the 1988 Bancroft Prize in American history. In the 1920's and 30's it was assumed that the prospect of bombing cities was so horrifying it might make war obsolete. When World War II began, bombers were first sold to the public and Congress as precision weapons against military targets, but in the popular imagination they soon became dark angels of vengeance, and the few voices that raised moral objections to bombing noncombatants were muffled. Mr. Sherry, a Northwestern University historian, is hardly a graceful writer (and his publisher has left many typographical and grammatical errors in his text), but his book demands to be read. Most of the material comes from published sources, but here it is focused on moral questions, making history uncomfortably personal. As the bomber force grew, targets had to be found, and they were - cities, even though the strategic value of destroying them was not examined. Even a few generals objected, but civilian leaders overruled them. Technological fanaticism seized the nation and a vast cadre of civilian experts grew up around the Air Force, advising, evaluating and making weapons for the bombers - the napalm that fried the population of Tokyo and then the atomic bomb. The actors in this tragedy soared from triumph to triumph, and to Hiroshima. The tragedy continues - the final catastrophe, or resolution, is to come - and now we are the actors.",1988-05-15T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"THE IMPERFECT ART: Reflections on Jazz and Modern Culture. By Ted Gioia. (Oxford University, $16.95.) This is an unusual jazz book for two reasons: it deals with the music not just on its own terms but in a broader cultural and esthetic context, and it was written by a musician. Ted Gioia, a young pianist who teaches jazz history and performance at Stanford University, has chosen a formidable theme for his first book: ''how peculiar jazz is in comparison with other arts'' and what makes it that way. He works some dazzling, quirky variations on this theme in seven essays, some previously published, the titles of which (''Jazz and the Primitivist Myth,'' ''What Has Jazz to Do With Aesthetics?'') indicate both the scope of his vision and the self-importance that occasionally trip him up. Much of what Mr. Gioia has to say is thoughtful and thought-provoking, but a number of his observations are debatable at best. For example, his claim that ''jazz has evolved away from the firm ground of composed music towards the terra incognita of complete improvisation,'' while it may have been true 10 or 15 years ago, ignores the increased emphasis on composition that has characterized much of the jazz created over the past decade. What is most unusual about ''The Imperfect Art'' is the apparent inner conflict it reflects: while the musician in Mr. Gioia obviously loves jazz for its spontaneity and directness, the esthetician in him seems uncomfortable with its intensity, its ''inherent tendency towards excess'' and its capacity to bore listeners - the latter being, he suggests in one perceptive essay, a dirty little secret most critics would rather not discuss.",1988-05-15T05:00:00+0000

John Taylor's story of how Roy's son took revenge in the early 1980's, with the help of Ivan Boesky and other financiers, is ''a tale of raw corporate power,'' David McClintick said in The Book Review last year. It captures ''the supreme importance of egos and personal relationships in the governance of business, particularly show business.'' MORE DIE OF HEARTBREAK, by Saul Bellow. (Dell, $4.95.) Despite their intellectual powers and vast learning, Kenneth Trachtenberg, a specialist in Russian studies, and his uncle, Benn Crader, a world authority on lichens, are miserable failures when it comes to love. ''The exploration of [ their ] relationship, with its widening ripples of betrayal, deceit and self-deceit, of conspiracy, of sex confused with love and, inevitably, money as stakes in a bruising confidence game, is the material of [ a ] brilliant new novel,'' our reviewer, William Gaddis, said last year.

A GUARD WITHIN, by Sarah Ferguson. (Pantheon, $7.95.) After suffering a series of losses and disappointments, a woman is pushed over the edge when her psychiatrist dies. In 1974 our reviewer, Joseph McElroy, said this autobiographical account is written in a way that evokes the author's ''sickness of need'' so that, for the reader, it is ''overwhelmingly felt.'' SKINNY ISLAND, by Louis Auchincloss. (St. Martin's, $3.95.) Spanning the last century, these short stories of the idle rich are ''set like vertebrae on the expensive backbone of Manhattan,'' Peter Cameron said here last year. But the book ''is more than a record of how the other half lived, and continues to live. It is first and foremost elegant fiction.'' MORTAL CHOICES: Ethical Dilemmas in Modern Medicine, by Ruth Macklin. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) An ethicist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine uses medical case histories to show how philosophers can help doctors make difficult moral decisions. Last year Rayna Rapp said in these pages that the book ''provides a lively and useful primer for the rapidly expanding field of bioethics.'' THE MOON PINNACE, by Thomas Williams. (Anchor/ Doubleday, $8.95.) Unsure whether he should marry the girl next door, a young World War II veteran leaves New Hampshire to explore California on his Indian Pony motorcycle. In 1986 our reviewer, Howard Frank Mosher, called the novel ''a timely, powerful antidote to the low-risk, low-intensity minimalist fiction so much in vogue these days.'' The same publisher has reissued three more of Mr. Williams's novels of life in New England, each priced at $8.95. THE HAIR OF HAROLD ROUX, which won a National Book Award, is about Aaron Benham, an academic of the 1960's who is writing a novel about student life in the 1950's. In 1974, The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said that Mr. Williams's novel was much better than the imaginary one it contains, but that he found Benham himself ''absorbingly complex. He shows us how the man of inaction transmutes his paralysis into a fiction of action.'' Beginning in the years after the Depression, WHIPPLE'S CASTLE tells of a family whose members all must overcome unique physical limitations. In 1969 our reviewer, R. M. Adams, said that while the novel was flawed, ''there are pages on end where the sweep and fluency of [ the author's ] style, its special gift for rendering the rub of ordinary experience, seem like sufficient ends in themselves.'' In TOWN BURNING, which was published in 1959, another World War II veteran comes to terms with himself and his family by helping battle a fire that threatens to destroy his hometown. BROTHER ENEMY: The War After the War, by Nayan Chanda. (Collier/Macmillan, $12.95.) Since the fall of Saigon, Vietnam has shown that it is much better at waging war than at maintaining peace. This account by the Washington bureau chief of the Far Eastern Economic Review ''offers much insight about why the Vietnamese victory over the United States is proving to be so bitter,'' Robert Manning said here in 1986. ROSIE THE RIVETER REVISITED: Women, the War, and Social Change, by Sherna Berger Gluck. (Meridian/ New American Library, $8.95.) During World War II, women were recruited by the Government to work in munitions factories, but after armistice they were expected to resume more traditional roles. Last year our reviewer, Rosalyn Schram, said this oral history ''tells more of the story than labor force statistics alone can reveal. . . . This book presents a solid lesson in the interconnectedness of public policy and women's private spheres.'' THE ORTON DIARIES, edited by John Lahr. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) From Christmas 1966 until he was murdered by his homosexual lover less than a year later, the British playwright Joe Orton recorded his bitter observations about life. Last year, Benedict Nightingale said here that this book ''shows how the plays reflected the man, and how both plays and man excited jealousies that turned lethal. . . . Under Orton's own companionable charm there was something hard and callous. . . . His sympathies are few, his objects of scorn many.''",1988-05-15T05:00:00+0000

An outdoor terrace or garden can make an ideal setting for warm-weather entertaining.

The U.S. wants countries to set a firm date for ending protectionism. But the European Community maintains the U.S. is as much at fault as anyone else for slowing down the elimination of barriers. [ Page A1. ] The world's growth outlook is better than expected, but trade imbalances are being reduced more slowly than predicted, O.E.C.D. officials said. ''The risk of inflation remains under control,'' one official of the group said. [ D1. ] Private banks are jeopardizing an international strategy for resolving the third world debt crisis, the World Bank asserts. But the banks say the World Bank complaint is unfair.

[ D6. ] A sharp rise in commodity prices pushed Treasuries narrowly lower. The increase in commodity prices provoked additional concern in a market that is already nervous about inflation. [ D16. ] Soybean and corn futures soared by their daily limits, reflecting dry weather over the Grain Belt, dwindling crop surpluses, inventory building by food processors and speculative buying.

[ D18. ] COMPANIES Irving defeated a hostile takeoverbid by the Bank of New York in a shareholder vote whose results were announced yesterday. Bank of New York's failure to replace Irving's board means it cannot dismantle poison-pill defenses. A friendly takeover of Irving by Banca Commerciale Italiana is now expected to proceed. [ D1. ] International Lease Finance awarded Boeing most of a $5 billion airliner order, with the rest going to Airbus. It was the largest order ever for commercial airliners.

They opted instead for work that was concocted, often quite casually. on the spot and that routinely incorporated impoverished or deliberately unesthetic materials. The Americans favored uninflected and, if possible, virtually unstructured presentations. Smithson's combinations of rocks and mirrors from the early 70's - called ''non-sites'' and the subject of an exhibition at the John Weber Gallery earlier this season - exemplify the American attitude.

Lighter fluid (liquid or gel; the gel is safer) is the most popular method, but it can flavor the food, as can briquettes or plastic starters treated with lighter fluid. Let the fuel turn ash gray to burn off as much of the chemical as possible. An electric starter, the safest igniter, should be plugged into a properly installed and grounded outdoor outlet.

The chief U.S. negotiator flew to Washington for consultations. Page 1 Propaganda billboards in Moscow are being removed. The campaign against the signs, which trumpet the virtues of Communism, has been under way over a year and is part of the larger struggle against bombast in public life. 1 The Senate rejected amendments to the new arms treaty by wide margins. But the votes to kill the amendments, brought approval of the treaty only slightly closer. 3 Fighting sharpened in Beirut between rival Shiite militia groups in southern Beirut. Fighting also broke out between opposing factions of the P.L.O. 2 Colombian cocaine traffickers, whose dominant groups are often called the Medellin cartell, are unlikely to be deterred by the conviction of Carlos Lehder Rivas, one of their number. 5 U.S. may confiscate drug trafficker's island 5 Return of relief workers to Ethiopia will be sought by the United Nations. But U.N. officials in Ethiopia say the Government, which expelled the relief agencies last month, is opposed to letting them return. 32 The accordion capital of the world, Castelfidardo, Italy, was hurt when rock-and-roll music became popular.

The rise was driven by sharply higher prices for apparel. 1 Consumer prices in the region rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Goverment said. It was the largest monthly increase in four years in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area. 38 The stock market had its slowest day of 1988 as the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 1,952.59, down 6.13 points. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange - 120.6 million shares - was the lightest since Dec. 29. 37 Conflicts of interest in corporate law have increased. The rise in corporate takeovers has put many top law firms in a bind for representing new clients whose interests compete with other or former clients. 1 A woman opened gunfire at a school in Winnetka, Ill., killing an 8-year-old pupil and critically wounding five other pupils. She fled to a house and wounded an occupant there. After an eight-hour seige, police stormed it and found her dead. 6 Incineration plan fans flames in Maryland town 6 Hepatitis A found increasingly among drug abusers 11 Politics 8 Jesse Jackson raised $1.9 million in April, equal to the amount collected that month by Michael Dukakis, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination. 8 Michael Dukakis stressed morality as he campaigned in California. He assailed the Reagan Administration for contemplating a deal with Panama's leader that would involve dropping drug charges. 8 Democrats debated the defense issue at a meeting of the party's platform committee. Liberal Democrats, who want cuts in the military budget, opposed calls that the party should emphasize a strong defense. 8 An aide to Vice President Bush said that after a 1985 meeting with the United States Ambassador to Panama, he and the Vice President had ''the sense'' that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega may have been involved in drug trafficking. 8 Political Marketing: independent groups join TV chorus 8 REGIONAL 33-35 Transit police are cutting back and will no longer ride every subway train at night under changes announced by the Transit Police Department.

us,NONFICTION,"EVE AND THE APES. By Emily Hahn. (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $17.95.) Intentionally bypassing famous female primatologists (such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey), Emily Hahn, who herself has owned a number of apes, focuses in this book on a second tier of women who have had a particular fascination with these animals. Ms. Hahn, a writer for The New Yorker, explores the stories of nine individuals and their charges. She writes of Belle Benchley, an early director of the San Diego Zoo, and, in one of the most captivating chapters, of Penny Patterson and her success in teaching sign language to gorillas. Perhaps the saddest story involves Augusta Hoyt, who in 1931 went with her husband to French Equatorial Africa to collect (kill) a large gorilla specimen for the American Museum of Natural History. After Mr. Hoyt shot a large male, the couple watched horrified as Africans speared the rest of the gorillas - except for Toto, a struggling, biting baby that was thrust into Mrs. Hoyt's arms. The creature clutched her, and ''that was that.'' Later, Toto was treated by the best pediatricians in Paris. After 10 years, she was sent to the circus, with the stipulation that the gorilla be housed in the style to which she had become accustomed. Mrs. Hoyt felt forever guilty over the fate of Toto's family, but to many people she was merely an indulgent rich woman with a spoiled exotic pet. This book is a fascinating introduction to primatology, by a woman who identifies so closely with her primate cousins that occasionally it is difficult to tell whether she is referring to man or ape.",1988-05-22T05:00:00+0000

How better to assure their children's success than to get them started early, to teach them to read during that brief shining time when kids absorb knowledge as naturally as they breathe?

''A biography, Sirs, should begin with the breath of a man when his eyes first meet the light of day,'' Carl Sandburg once wrote. Adopting this philosophy in covering Sandburg's 89 years, North Callahan has written a creditable biography of the writer and the man, often using his own extensive recollections of the poet whose ''reckless ecstasies of the language'' have become part of the American tongue. Sandburg was a man of various talents and inclinations: musician as well as poet, biographer of Lincoln, Midwest wanderer and Chicago journalist, to name a few. Any author would have his hands full attempting to synthesize a life of such breadth and prolific diversity in a relatively spare 258 pages. Mr. Callahan brings to his effort the requisite scholarship - he is professor emeritus of history at New York University and the author of 15 books on American history and literature, including a biography of Sandburg published in 1970 - and a wealth of personal insights culled from years of contact with his subject. (The two men shared a deep interest in the Civil War and the way it changed the nation.) He has enhanced this work with telling anecdotes that give the man from Galesburg, Ill., a dimension beyond the printed page. In his early years, Sandburg wrote of how ''life is more vast and strange than anything about it - words are only incidentals.'' But his ''incidentals'' - novels and biography and poems alike - became Americana. Mr. Callahan's book does Sandburg justice.",1988-05-22T05:00:00+0000

They agreed to two arms accords, the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, and the SALT I agreement on offensive nuclear weapons, the first such pact setting limits on numbers of strategic missile launchers. The Senate approved both pacts. The ABM treaty is still a matter of dispute between Moscow and Washington. June and July 1974 Moscow and Yalta - One month before he resigned because of the Watergate scandal, Mr. Nixon visited Mr. Brezhnev again. They discussed implementation of SALT I and limits on underground nuclear testing, and signed an agreement on economic cooperation. November 1974 Vladivostok - President Ford, who had pardoned Mr. Nixon in September, and Mr. Brezhnev tentatively agreed on the numbers of offensive strategic weapons each side would be allowed. This set the stage for the strategic arms limitation talks agreement - SALT II - of 1979.

That works out to an annual rate of 5.3 percent, up from last year, but not too alarming. What really set off the inflation fears was the trade-deficit figure for March. It was much better than expected, declining to $9.7 billion, the lowest monthly figure in three years. Another sign of economic strength was the report that industry was operating at 82.7 percent of capacity, the highest in more than eight years.

Hot on the heels of the Government's insider trading cases and Oliver Stone's film ''Wall Street,'' there promises to be a spate of business-oriented novels. After all, if the business of America is business, what better place to set a crime thriller for our times than on Wall Street, where fortunes are gained and lost quicker than it takes a body to fall 32 floors? This is just how George Bellak's second novel, ''The Third Friday,'' begins, as Cy Bannerman, a financial wheeler-dealer, takes a header off the terrace of his luxury high-rise. The authorities call it suicide, but his partner, Max Roberts, doesn't think so. While proving that Bannerman received an unwanted helping hand, Roberts gets to bed several of Bannerman's former mistresses. And, less pleasantly, in the wake of a number of other murders he also becomes embroiled in a mob-controlled money-laundering scheme. Unfortunately, this only sounds exciting. Billed as ''a novel of suspense,'' Mr. Bellak's book lacks one central element of the genre: tautness. In fact, he insists on telling his story in such mind-boggling detail that eventually the eyes glaze over. At one point, the reader is even informed that Roberts attends a movie in which there are ''four car crashes, two fires, a yacht explosion, and an underwater duel with spearguns.'' However, there is a bonus in this book - what amounts to an unintentional stock tip. Not a page seems to pass without a phone call being either placed or received.

The 53-year-old Texan drove the first lap around the 2 1/2-mile oval yesterday at 210.669 miles an hour, then slipped progressively to 210.605, 209.113 and 208.415 for a 10-mile average of 209.696.

The Redmen won behind the combined four-hit pitching of the starter, Tom Singer, and Glenn Bratteng, who went the final one and a third innings. St. John's went ahead in the first when Walt Heckel singled, stole second and went to third on a throwing error. He scored on a single by Bob Lambraia, who was doubled home two outs later by Mike Weinberg. Weinberg, who was named the most valuable player in the tournament, hit a two-run home run in the third, his second in two games. His seventh-inning three-run homer on Friday night capped a victory over Villanova that set up the championship. Villanova beat St. John's in the opening round of the double-elimination tournament and was unbeaten until the final two games. Villanova was the Southern Division champion of the Big East and entered the tournament with a conference record of 16-2. The Redmen, second-place finishers in the Northern Division, had a 9-9 mark. St. John's will play in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Regionals next week.

(AP) Golf Rose Leads Colonial: Clarence Rose used a burst of birdies on the back nine to surge into a three-stroke lead yesterday in the third round of the $750,000 Colonial National Invitation tournament in Fort Worth. Rose, who lost in a playoff last Sunday and has yet to win in eight seasons on the PGA Tour, broke out of a three-way tie for the lead with a five-under-par 65 that included four birdies in a stretch of six holes on the back nine. He completed three rounds in 200, 10 under par. His three-shot margin equaled the largest 54-hole advantage on the tour this year. Joey Sindelar's 15-foot birdie putt on the final hole gave him a 67 that left him alone in second at 203.(AP) Tennis Sweden Gains: Anders Jarryd of Sweden defeated Milan Srejber of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 7-5, yesterday to enable Sweden to qualify for the final against the United States in the $750,000 World Team Cup tournament in Dusseldorf, West Germany.

The gap, which could exceed $250 billion in the next five years, exists because the rapid military buildup during the first five years of the Administration, combined with tax cuts, resulted in heavy military spending that Congress and the Administration are now unwilling to finance through tax increases.

us,New & Noteworthy,"HAMMER, by Armand Hammer with Neil Lyndon. (Perigree/Putnam, $9.95.) Named in part after the Socialist Labor Party's arm-and-hammer symbol, Armand Hammer made a fortune dealing with the Soviet Union and a reputation as a humanitarian and amateur diplomat. ''Dr. Hammer has managed to turn himself into a sort of living footnote to some of the principal events of his time,'' Ted Morgan said in The Book Review last year. ''Great events seen through the eyes of a minor character have a fascination for us - we can identify with him.'' THE THANATOS SYNDROME, by Walker Percy. (Ivy/Ballantine, $4.95.) In Walker Percy's novel ''Love in the Ruins,'' a Louisiana psychiatrist uses a device called an Ontological Lapsometer to measure the sickness of souls. In ''The Thanatos Syndrome,'' the doctor returns from prison to find his wife and former patients acting more like computers than people. ''Though the novel's surface action spins along at a brisk thriller pace . . . the real plot, as with all this writer's fiction, chronicles the continuing battle between good and evil in a modern society where both words are out of fashion,'' Gail Godwin said here last year. ''Walker Percy has the rare gift of being able to dramatize metaphysics.'' The same publisher has also reissued Mr. Percy's first novel, THE MOVIEGOER ($3.95). CULTURAL LITERACY: What Every American Needs to Know, by E. D. Hirsch Jr. (Vintage, $6.95.) In an updated version of his attack on the progressive education movement and the pragmatist philosopher John Dewey, E. D. Hirsch Jr. (aided by Joseph Kett and James Trefil) has added more than 300 items to his list of facts and concepts he believes any American should be embarrassed not to know. ''This is a delightful book,'' Robert Stevens said here last year. Mr. Hirsch, he added, ''is probably wrong. He certainly is iconoclastic; but he should be read.'' DUE EAST, by Valerie Sayers. (Berkley, $3.95.) When a 15-year-old South Carolina girl gets pregnant and the father kills himself, she announces that she is having a virgin birth. Last year our reviewer, Jack Butler, said this novel ''just wraps itself around you.'' Valerie Sayers, he added, ''has that rare knack of appearing simply to open up a reality, as if it were so clear before her eyes that she doesn't have to create it so much as invite us in.'' THE LIFE OF LANGSTON HUGHES. Volume One: 1902-1941. I, Too, Sing America, by Arnold Rampersad. (Oxford University, $9.95.) When this first installment of Arnold Rampersad's biography of the black poet Langston Hughes was published in 1986, our reviewer, Gwendolyn Brooks, said the book ''sparkles when it is involved with Hughes's devotion to his craft,'' and that she eagerly awaited Volume Two. THE HOUND OF HEAVEN, by Glover Wright (Jove/ Berkley, $3.95.) When a priest crucified by the Vietcong is resurrected, some Roman Catholics think the Second Coming has occurred; others believe the devil has returned. In 1986, Newgate Callendar said here that the author of this thriller ''asks us to believe a great deal. But . . . so well has he integrated theology and action, so clear and sensitive is his writing, so scary are the final pages, that 'The Hound of Heaven' goes right to the top in its genre.'' THE LAUNCHING OF MODERN AMERICAN SCIENCE: 1846-1876, by Robert V. Bruce. (Cornell University, $12.95.) The author won this year's Pulitzer Prize for history for his story of how science in the United States evolved from an intellectual backwater into the powerful presence it is today. Last year Rosalind Williams said here that while ''the general reader will find the book tough slogging,'' it succeeds admirably in providing ''a wealth of information on the people and institutions of mid-19th-century American science.'' THE LOTUS FLOWERS, by Ellen Bryant Voigt. (Norton, $7.95.) Living in Vermont and contemplating her Southern childhood, Ellen Bryant Voigt has written poems about a woman ''poised at mid-life between the gravitational pull of the past and its 'cruel perfected music' and the flaming world of the present,'' Edward Hirsch said here last year. ''Against her losses, Ms. Voigt poses a loving and fiery attentiveness to her world, balancing grief and exhilaration.'' BEVERLY: An Autobiography, by Beverly Sills and Lawrence Linderman. (Bantam, $4.95.) In her rise to the heights of the opera world, the soprano Beverly Sills never waited for destiny to hand her any favors. Last year our reviewer, Dale Harris, said her memoirs recount ''a classic American success story'' in which ''forgiveness, clearly, is not one of her weaknesses.'' BAD GUY, by Rosalyn Drexler. (PAJ Publications, $7.95.) A rather unconventional psychotherapist invites Jesus Allendez, a 15-year-old sociopath who has raped and murdered his elderly neighbor, into her home as a live-in patient. Rosalyn Drexler ''is an exotic taste,'' one reviewer said in 1982. She escalates ''actions to the absurd, by surreal exaggeration that is deft and believable because it never quite loses touch with reality.'' BEST INTENTIONS: The Education and Killing of Edmund Perry, by Robert Sam Anson. (Vintage, $6.95.) In 1985, just after graduating with honors from Phillips Exeter Academy, a 17-year-old Harlem youth was shot and killed near his home by a plainclothes policeman. Robert Sam Anson ''is interested in exploring . . . the irony that someone who had already traveled so far would end up lying on a sidewalk so close to where he had grown up, a cop's bullet in his belly,'' Robert Coles said in The Book Review last year.

Gifted students were trained in both disciplines, and Bartok, like Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev, was a piano virtuoso as well as a composer of genius. Similarly, he created an impressive body of works for piano and orchestra, largely for his own use in appearing before the public.

What is not explained is why the National Training Center is located in the Mojave Desert. In every campaign of every war, topography, terrain and climate have played an important role. Yet, our military planners ask their forces to train against the Soviet Army on a ''rocky, moonscape desert.'' Such an environment is very much unlike that of northern and western Europe, where any major armored and infantry conflict with the Red Army is most likely to take place.

The film does carry an eye-catching credit. It was directed by William Friedkin, who won an Academy Award for ''The French Connection.'' Not surprisingly, then, this television movie contains lots of chase scenes featuring painfully heavy breathing on the sound track. Then there are the autumn leaves that, after a vicious murder, turn blood red in closeup. That sort of thing. Actually, what we have here is a sequel to a 1986 ''CAT Squad'' that, much to everyone's surprise, chalked up a Top 10 Nielsen rating. Joe Cortese, Jack Youngblood and Steve James are returning to depict once again the characters of Doc, John and Bud, members of an elite - read covert - Counter-Assault Tactical Squad created by the United States Government.

The market's liquidity -which allows stocks to be traded without distorting prices - is at its lowest level in two years, one investment firm says. A trader described the situation as ''very dangerous,'' and others pointed out that a marketplace with low liquidity was vulnerable to shocks. [ Page D1. ] The Fed should change its approach to monetary policy, some people in the credit markets are saying, to forestall a further steady rise in interest rates.

But when called upon, he quickly came out of retirement. Oglesby, the pitching coach of the Riverside Red Wave, took the mound in the 20th inning of a California League game against the San Jose Giants in Riverside and wound up suffering the loss in the 6-hour-19-minute game, which ended early yesterday. After retiring the side in order in the top of the 20th, Oglesby was touched for three runs and four hits in the 21st as the Giants defeated the Red Wave, 8-5. ''I forgot the last time I pitched, maybe 15 years ago,'' said Oglesby, who hurls batting practice on a regular basis for the Red Wave. Oglesby was listed as a pitcher rather than as a coach on the Riverside roster before the game. California League teams are allowed to make such designations to fill out their 25-man rosters on a daily basis.(AP)",1988-05-24T05:00:00+0000

Henry is not a bad sort beneath his unshaven cheeks, and Gem, the foster son, is a sensitive lad who gets upset by the trapper's trade. ''I don't like to kill 'em,'' says Gem. ''It's part of life, boy,'' says Henry. ''Things grow and you kill 'em.'' As for Ruby Rose, she wakes nightly in terror of the dark, which is filled with animal snorts and screams. She has a mystical or merely superstitious side, and is given to sprinkling around a whitish powder of some sort and painting the walls white to keep out the darkness. She says to herself: ''Death roams in the dark. To keep away the dark is to keep away death.'' For a near illiterate woman, she sure talks fancy: ''The dark has got into the heart.

Dorsett has requested a trade because he is unhappy with his secondary role to another running back, Herschel Walker, in the Cowboys' offense.

us,Dining Out Guide: Connecticut,"This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. Ratings are followed by the date of original publication. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Bertrand Excellent (Dec. 6, 1987), 253 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich (203-661-4459) - A Guastavino vaulted ceiling of brick and tile, Roman arches and a sky-lighted atrium are dramatic architectural features of this restaurant in a neo-classical building. The captivating, complex menu is overseen by Christian Bertrand, a former executive chef at Lutece. Good appetizers include puff pastries filled with seafood, leeks and basil, and anise-marinated salmon. The confit of duck with chanterelles is an acclaimed entree. A new spring menu includes red snapper braised in white wine, sauteed chicken breast with spring vegetables in a basil-cream sauce and a new appetizer of timbale of smoked salmon with a julienne of endive and caviar. Most desserts are excellent. Prices at lunch are $4.50 to $11.75 for appetizers, $14.50 to $19.50 for entrees; at dinner, $4.50 to $35 for appetizers, $15.50 to $27.50 for entrees. Lunch hours are noon to 2 P.M. Friday; dinner, 6 to 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. New England Food Co. Excellent (March 20, 1988), 4 Liberty Street, Danbury (203-798-8122) - Sophisticated and moderately priced dishes on a frequently revised menu are presented by a husband-and-wife team. Everything on the small menu is freshly prepared with precision. By day, the restaurant does an active take-out business; at dinner, the focus moves to a gently-lighted, comfortable dining room that seats 20. The June menu will feature starters of minted romaine soup and seafood cakes of shrimp, scallops and scrod. Permanent stars on the entree side are pecan chicken in a sour-cream-mustard sauce and the poached fish of the day. New items include loin of lamb with barley and sauteed vegetables, and quail with peach sauce. Breads are homemade, as are the excellent desserts. Prices during the day are $3 to $4.75; entrees at dinner, $9.95 to $14.95. Dinner hours are 5:30 to 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Robert Henry's Excellent (March 1, 1987), 1032 Chapel Street, New Haven (203-789-1010) - In the former Union League Club in New Haven, Robert Henry's is an elegant high-ceilinged restaurant with marble columns, chinoiserie and comfortable seating. The owner, Jo McKenzie, and her talented chefs offer a small, inventive menu that includes starters of braised artichoke hearts in basil sauce, duck leg confit with apples and mache, and a tartar of tuna and smoked salmon served between layers of small blinis. One of the seasonal entrees is grilled duck breast with wild rice and vegetable confit in ginger sauce. There is an appealing array of desserts; a good choice is homemade ice cream in crisp cookie shells. Prices at lunch are $8.50 to $14; at dinner, $4 to $8.50 for appetizers, $19.50 to $27 for entrees. Lunch hours are noon to 2 P.M. Friday, dinner 6 to 10 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Three Flags Very good (Nov. 29, 1987), 544 Main Avenue (Route 7), Norwalk (203-846-4248) - This is a formal and elegantly appointed restaurant disguised by its plain exterior on a busy suburban highway. The flags of Italy, France and Greece are depicted on the logo, but the owner describes his carefully chosen menu as European nouvelle rather than Mediterranean. It boasts a baker who prepares all dinner rolls, breads and desserts in house. Starters include foie gras served on vinaigrette-dressed radicchio and greens, scallops and shrimp in champagne sauce and baked in puff pastry, and fresh crab meat ravioli with ginger sauce. Recommended entrees include the seafood combination and red snapper in papaya-butter. Other choices are veal medallions with seasonal vegetables, and capon leg stuffed with duck liver and spinach. Prices at lunch are $7 to $12.50 for entrees; at dinner, $6 to $14 for appetizers, $14.50 to $25 for entrees. Lunch hours are 11:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. Friday, dinner 5:30 to 11 P.M Friday and Saturday, 5 to 9 P.M. Sunday. The ratings: Poor Satisfactory Good Very good Excellent Extraordinary",1988-05-27T05:00:00+0000

But Government economists said they were not so concerned about the likelihood of inflation. [ Page A1. ] The revised G.N.P. figures are far beyond what any forecaster foresaw - and provide a reminder of the uneven art of prediction. [ D5. ] COMPANIES New York State and Lilco agreed to close the Shoreham nuclear plant, ending more than two decades of controversy. Lilco will take a $2.5 billion loss on Shoreham that will effectively relieve it from Federal income taxes for the next decade, an aspect of the plan that was assailed by some Federal lawmakers. [ A1. ] Investors reacted with skepticism to the Texaco takeover bid of Carl C. Icahn. While Texaco's largest shareholder said he would pay $60 a share, Texaco's stock rose only $3.125, to $50. That skepticism was reinforced by a report by an Icahn associate that banks would finance the takeover only if it was acceptable to Texaco's board. [ D1. ] United Airlines ordered 30 Boeing 757 jetliners and took options for 30 more, giving Boeing its third billion-dollar-plus order in two weeks. United chose engines made by Pratt & Whitney for the aircraft. [ D1. ] The name of United Airlines' owner was changed back to UAL as stockholders voted to abandon Allegis. [ D4. ] Rowntree rejected a bid of $4.3 billion by Jacobs Suchard, the Swiss chocolatier, calling it inadequate. [ D4. ] Roche, the maker of the anti-acne drug Accutane, was ordered by the F.D.A. to take strong measures to prevent its use by pregnant women. Accutane has been linked to birth defects. [ A1. ] Field Publications will buy Funk & Wagnalls, the nation's second-largest general reference encyclopedia. One industry expert estimated the price at $70 million to $100 million. [ D15. ] A Federal appeals court agreed to prevent Advil from comparing itself to Tylenol, upholding a lower court ruling. [ D15. ] A court ruling cleared the way for Allegheny International to hold its annual meeting, but a date has not been set. [ D4. ] MARKETS The S.E.C. approved proposals to give it power to regulate stock-index futures and to close down the nation's stock and options exchanges in the event of another market crisis. The proposals, approved by a 3-to-2 vote, will be sent to Congress. [ D1. ] Stock prices moved moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.38 points, to close at 1,966.75. Broader market gauges were also higher. [ D6. ] Prices of Treasuries fell and short-term interest rates rose as market participants reacted negatively to the Government's report that the G.N.P. grew 3.9 percent in the first quarter. [ D1. ] The dollar drifted aimlessly and finished the day marginally higher against several major currencies. Gold was down 30 cents an ounce on the Comex, to $454.10 an ounce. [ D14. ] Oil futures prices advanced as technical factors spurred a late flurry of heavy buying. Meanwhile, cocoa futures plunged.

us,22 YEARS TOWARD SHOREHAM,"The Long Island Lighting Company's efforts to build a nuclear-power plant at Shoreham have covered more than 20 years and cost more than $5 billion. April 1966: Lilco announces plans to build a 500-megawatt nuclear power plant in Shoreham on the North Shore, 55 miles east of Manhattan. May 1968: Lilco applies to the Federal Atomic Energy Commission for a construction permit. The utility predicts Shoreham will cost $70 million and be in operation by 1973. March 1969: Lilco directors approve a plan to upgrade the plant to 820 megawatts. Design problems delay the start of hearings. Shoreham is predicted to cost $261 million and be completed by 1975. Fall 1970: Hearings begin. They will include 70 sessions over nearly three years. July 1971: A Federal Appeals Court rules that the A.E.C. is not complying with environmental laws and requires that utilities file more detailed impact statements for nuclear plants. April 1973: Lilco begins construction. Lilco and Suffolk County officials start drafting emergency plans. Lilco estimates Shoreham will cost $506 million and be completed in 1977. September 1977: Lilco directors decide to supervise the project and dismiss Stone & Webster as construction manager. Lilco says Shoreham will cost $1.2 billion and open in 1980. March 28, 1979: The reactor core of Three Mile Island 2 in Middletown, Pa., overheats. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission orders expanded emergency plans. February 1983: Suffolk withdraws its emergency plans, saying a safe evacuation of Long Island is not possible. Governor Cuomo orders the state not to approve an emergency evacuation plan prepared by Lilco. November 1983: Major construction ends; Lilco says Shoreham has cost $4 billion. A panel appointed by Mr. Cuomo says Shoreham's location makes emergency planning impossible. January 1984: Dr. William J. Catacosinos, a member of the Lilco board, becomes chairman and chief executive. He says building Shoreham was a mistake and suggests it may never open. August 1985: The reactor starts up with low-power testing. December 1985: The Public Service Commission votes to disallow $1.4 billion of the Shoreham cost from its base for computing rates, saying the money was spent as a result of management mistakes. July 1986: Mr. Cuomo signs legislation establishing the Long Island Power Authority. Its charge is to consider taking over Lilco. August 1987: A Federal judge rebuffs a Lilco challenge to the power authority and declares the agency constitutional. November 1987: The P.S.C. denies a rate increase and orders Lilco to present ''reasonable plans to provide reliable electric service'' without Shoreham. December 1987: Officials from the state, Lilco and the power authority meet as a group for the first time. March 29, 1988: The power authority makes a $7.45 billion offer to buy Lilco. The offer is rejected. May 26, 1988: The State and Lilco announce an agreement in principle to close Shoreham and help Lilco regain financial health.",1988-05-27T05:00:00+0000

us,NEWS SUMMARY,"INTERNATIONAL 2-5 The Senate approved the arms treaty eliminating medium- and shorter-range missiles based on land, 93 to 5. It was the first major American-Soviet arms control pact the Senate has approved since 1972. Page 1 President Reagan stressed rights in a speech calling on Mikhail Gorbachev to improve the Soviet human rights record. Mr. Reagan's speech was intended to set a tone for the summit meeting, his aides said. 1 Progress in solving regional disputes at the Moscow meeting is hoped for by American officials, who said Vietnam's pledge to withdraw 50,000 troops from Cambodia was an encouraging sign. 1 The press encamps in Moscow 5 South Korean dry-cleaning machines are competing successfully on the American market. West German and Italian manufacturers, who had pushed aside American companies, now find Korean prices much lower than theirs. 1 Syrian troops entered Beirut to enforce a cease-fire agreement. About 800 Syrian soldiers marched into the city's southern suburbs, where rival Shiite Moslem militias have fought for 22 days. 1 Labor Party elections in Israel of candidates for Parliament showed the party was moving to the left. The results of the party's first open elec tion come as polls suggest Israeli public opinion is moving to the right. 3 Prospects for the National Front in elections for France's National Assembly are not good in Marseille, according to polls. A loss would be a blow to the leader of the extreme right party, Jean-Marie Le Pen. 3 Progress in Nicaraguan peace talks was reported by Sandinista and contra leaders. Government negotiators rejected a plan proposed by the contras, but were said to be more agreeable to the proposal in private. 3 The deposed President of Panama said the United States should allow Latin American democracies to take the lead in any new talks over the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 2 Argentines are eating less beef and smoking less. But beef consumption is still greater than anywhere else in the world. The drop in cigarette sales is attributed to a decline in real wages. 4 NATIONAL 6-10, 28 Care at nursing homes is suffering because of rising costs, shortages of nurses and government limits on spending. Homes that depend on Medicaid payments for lower-income people are in the worst shape. 1 The role of parochial schools in religious education is being questioned by a growing number of Roman Catholic educators, who argue that the church should spend more money on other programs. 1 A $299.5 billion military bill won Senate approval after Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato dropped his insistence that it include an amendment allowing the death penalty for murders by narcotics traffickers. 6 Emotional trauma in Winnetka, Ill., where a woman opened fire in an elementary school classroom, has prompted the community to provide psychological counseling and security at the school. 6 Improper prescribing of Accutane or misuse of the anti-acne drug is being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration in cases where the drug led to severely deformed babies, the agency's Commissioner said. 6 Philadelphia's Police Commissioner, Kevin M. Tucker, is resigning. Mayor W. Wilson Goode said he would select a replacement for Mr. Tucker, who is credited with restoring respect in the department, before June 10. 6 Another Justice official will leave the department. Charles J. Cooper, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel, said he was leaving for personal reasons and praised Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. 10 F.A.A. proposes more Boeing 737 inspections 8 New inmates to be tested for AIDS virus 8 Moderate exercise in pregnancy found unharmful to fetus 8 Politics 7 George Bush said he is not troubled by people pointing out that he is behind in the polls. The Vice President, who began a week of meetings in Maine, said the air made him feel combative. 7 A black advertising executive, Frank L. Mingo Jr., is working for Michael Dukakis's Presidential campaign. But he has contributed to the campaign of Jesse Jackson, whom he served as an adviser in 1984. 7 REGIONAL 29-31 Alternative sources of electricity on Long Island are being considered by Lilco after the decision to shut the Shoreham nuclear plant. Lilco said it could meet only 95 percent of the expected demand this summer. 1 The decision to close Shoreham and keep Lilco an investor-owned utility ends uncertainty about electricity supplies and costs that business leaders say has stalled economic growth on Long Island. 30 Wedtech paid Stanley Simon, the former Bronx Borough President. A former law partner of Mario Biaggi also paid Mr. Simon, a witness testified at the Federal racketeering trial of Mr. Simon and Mr. Biaggi. 29 Four bridge workers were injured when a wooden platform they were standing on to repair beams under the Williamsburg Bridge collapsed. The four were treated at Bellevue Hospital Center and released, the police said. 29 A South Bronx clinic owes $4 million and is in danger of closing. The Martin Luther King Jr. Health Center was once among the nation's largest community health centers. 29 Bess Myerson was arrested in South Williamsport, Pa., and charged with shoplifting. The former Miss America and New York City Cultural Affairs Commissioner faces trial next fall on Federal fraud and conspiracy charges. 29 A teacher beaten with a baseball bat was in critical condition as doctors tried to save one of his eyes. The attack, the fourth on a teacher in a week, prompted calls for action from their union and from Mayor Koch. 31",1988-05-28T05:00:00+0000

We have private collection; we dump all our trash in large Dumpsters, which are then taken away in bulk. (I collect returnable bottles in a department store shopping bag, hanging under a kitchen countertop.) But the trash collector obviously does not separate the trash.

William Wartman focuses in this book on his search for an understanding of his father, who died when the author was a child, and on his own role as a father to his son. As his 30th birthday approached, in 1978, Mr. Wartman (who is the president of the Philadelphia Writers Organization) became aware of certain changes in himself. For months his outlook had been gloomy, his energy level low. He feared he was dying of a brain tumor, as his father had at around the same age; it turned out to be hypoglycemia, but the fear shook him up. He began to ask questions of his mother, who had always kept silent on the subject of his father's death, and other family members. He started to interview people who had also lost their fathers as children. Along the way, Mr. Wartman came to terms with his feelings about his father and realized the importance of his own son to him. In delving into his past and that of others in ''Life Without Father,'' he presents vivid, engaging glimpses into a variety of family situations. The book, written in an accessible style, sometimes slips into facile psychologizing - for instance, the author says in passing that the reason his mother was angry at him when he divorced his wife was that ''to my mother, both my Uncle Jeff and I were Wartman men who left women - as her Wartman man, my father, had left her.''

Arthur Rubinstein told me that he always approached certain familiar passages uneasily, taught by experience that the bottom could drop out at any moment. His technique for forestalling disaster was to concentrate at that point on something entirely apart from music, perhaps the good dinner he would be enjoying later. His fingers would remember where to go, so long as his head did not set up roadblocks. In effect, the pianist tricked his mind into obeying him.

us,NONFICTION,"CHARLES LAUGHTON: A Difficult Actor. By Simon Callow. (Grove, $18.95.) Henry VIII, Captain Bligh, Quasimodo, Inspector Javert, Tiberius Claudius - the common denominator, of course, is Charles Laughton, one of the more respected midcentury stage and screen actors on both sides of the Atlantic. In a biography that focuses almost exclusively on the modes and motivations behind Laughton's acting technique, Simon Callow, an English actor and author, theorizes that Laughton's success with such roles ''consisted of driving himself relentlessly to reveal unpalatable aspects of his personality.'' But Mr. Callow also contends that Laughton ''doesn't ask us to identify with [ a characterization ] , because he doesn't identify with it: he is the subject of his own demonstration. His performances never console nor do they sedate: we are moved by the naked truth of them, and by the courage and self-expenditure of the man giving them.'' Mr. Callow is both probing and articulate. He meticulously describes Laughton's 90-odd roles and includes anecdotes and relevant material from reviews, original interviews, letters, Elsa Lanchester's memoir of her husband and Charles Higham's 1976 biography of the actor. But Mr. Callow does nothing to disguise his own adoration. The narrative is peppered with superlatives that cumulatively surpass credibility. Despite the author's evident bias, the reader gets a persuasive account of the madness that figured in Laughton's method. What emerges is an impassioned and dedicated portrait of an unhappy human being who was compelled to confront in his art the internal demons he repressed in his real life.",1988-05-29T05:00:00+0000

Mike Lupica, whose sports columns appear regularly in The Daily News and Esquire, is a master miniaturist. He has perfected the art of using a single mood or moment to dramatize an entire season or career. His tone is by turns enthusiastic, contentious and poignant. A man of strong passions and opinions, Mr. Lupica proudly proclaims, ''My three favorite sports are baseball, baseball, and baseball.'' Tennis, basketball, boxing and horse racing are close behind, but winter sports generally bore him, as does cricket, ''a great sport for England, a country in which people just go from one queue to another, waiting for something to happen.'' Mr. Lupica's wit can be devastating, but he is at his best when paying tribute to sports greats like the hurdler Edwin Moses or telling a story as simple as that of an avid Mets fan who happens to be blind. His newspaper columns, which make up the bulk of this collection, are tasty appetizers that leave one hungry for more, a desire satisfied by the handful of lengthier magazine pieces included here. A surprisingly sympathetic profile of John McEnroe is particularly memorable, as is the recounting of a meeting between Ralph Branca and Bobby Thomson, 35 years after Branca threw Thomson the most famous home-run pitch in New York history. Least successful are Mr. Lupica's one-line quips, taken from his Sunday column. A few of them are tasteless asides that mar an otherwise engaging and often exhilarating collection.",1988-05-29T05:00:00+0000

His buildings are both four stories with brownstone facades. But Mr. Sebag, along with a partner, Enrique A. Ochoa, bought one of them, at 229, in 1985 for only $50,000; the other, at 231, the partners purchased early in 1987 for $185,000. They subsequently sold a similar building nearby for $214,000, and expect that type of building, common in the area, to sell in the current market for $250,000 to $300,000. ''The whole area is not what it used to be,'' Mr. Sebag said. One of the reasons for the change is the large number of projects like those of Mr. Sebag and Mr. Ochoa. Their gut renovation of 229 and 231 105th Street, both formerly owned by the city, will cost $1.2 million and create 12 one-bedroom apartments, two two-bedroom duplexes and two duplex professional offices. The units, priced from $145,000 to $190,000, will feature oak floors, fireplaces and individual boilers and water heaters.

us,New & Noteworthy,"IN HITLER'S GERMANY: Everyday Life in the Third Reich, by Bernt Engelmann. Translated by Krishna Winston. (Schocken, $8.95.) Not all Germans acquiesced to Nazi rule, Bernt Engelmann discovered in his interviews. Many citizens actively supported Hitler; some bravely resisted. Last year in The Times, John Gross called this book ''an unusual blend of memoir and oral history. . . . The portrait of a society that emerges has many dramatic moments, but it is even more valuable for the way in which it conveys the everyday climate of life in the darkest of dark times.'' PERSIAN NIGHTS, by Diane Johnson. (Fawcett Crest, $4.50.) As the Shah's regime crumbles around her, an American woman living in Iran suspects that her lover works for the Central Intelligence Agency. Last year, our reviewer, Jayne Anne Phillips, said that Diane Johnson's seventh novel is ''funny, incisive, frightening and eminently skillful. In addition, it displays the Cassandra-like quality of good fiction and dovetails nicely with continuing Iranscam disclosures. . . . When we read, at a climactic moment in the novel, 'It seems the Americans are gun runners,' the words hit home with a sickening thud.'' A CONFLICT OF VISIONS, by Thomas Sowell. (Quill/ Morrow, $7.95.) Throughout history, Thomas Sowell argues, civilization has been divided between those who were convinced that people are inherently flawed (and perhaps evil) and those who believed in the perfectibility of humankind. Mr. Sowell, who casts his lot with the former, ''makes his case fairly, lucidly and persuasively,'' Fred Barnes said in The Book Review last year. He provides ''a framework for understanding social theories and politics.'' INVENTING THE ABBOTTS: And Other Stories, by Sue Miller. (Laurel/Dell, $8.95.) These short stories by the author of ''The Good Mother'' show that Sue Miller is ''adept in her depiction of the ways in which people abuse one another,'' Penelope Lively said here last year. She reports ''from a frontier, from the discontented and guilty world of divorce and the single parent, of marriage as a threatened institution.'' AMONG FRIENDS: Who We Like, Why We Like Them, and What We Do With Them, by Letty Cottin Pogrebin. (McGraw-Hill, $7.95.) ''Friendship,'' Letty Cottin Pogrebin writes, ''is a category each of us invents.'' In 1986, our reviewer, Marcia Froelke Coburn, said, ''The way [ this ] book jumps between philosophy and how-to advice is disconcerting, but the chapters about the sociopsychological aspects of male bonding, women's intimacy and male-female friendships are insightful.'' THE TIDEWATER TALES, by John Barth. (Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.) Peter Sagamore, a blocked minimalist writer whose books keep getting shorter, is the opposite of his creator, John Barth, who has produced his most expansive novel yet. In ''The Tidewater Tales,'' Sagamore and his wife, an oral historian, sail the Chesapeake, entangling themselves in one story after another. ''This is lively stuff,'' William Pritchard said here last year, ''and Mr. Barth has never been more engaging, nor more engaged in his narrative complications.'' Also available is LOST IN THE FUNHOUSE: Fiction for Print, Tape, Live Voice (Anchor/ Doubleday, $7.95), Mr. Barth's collection of short pieces of experimental fiction, which was published in 1968. The same publisher has reissued THE FLOATING OPERA (1956) and THE END OF THE ROAD (1958), which appear in a single edition ($8.95). THE BEER CAN BY THE HIGHWAY: Essays on What's ''American'' About America, by John A. Kouwenhoven. (Johns Hopkins University, Paper, $9.95; Cloth, $27.50.) When this book of linked essays on American culture was published in 1961, Charles Poore said in The Times that its author ''is an acute and extraordinarily genial analyst of our mechanized folkware.'' It has been republished with a foreword by Ralph Ellison. THE ENIGMA OF ARRIVAL, by V. S. Naipaul. (Vintage, $6.95.) This ''haunting'' story about a young man from Trinidad who immigrates to England is so clearly autobiographical that it is curious that V. S. Naipaul insisted on making it a novel, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. ''With disarming self-deprecation he describes how in his determination to be 'literary' and to record everything except what was happening in front of his nose, he succeeded in missing the great story that he himself was part of -the postwar migration of far-flung colonial subjects to the heart of the declining British Empire.'' THE MARSHALL PLAN, by Charles L. Mee Jr. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) Is the United States paying more than its fair share for defending Europe? Charles L. Mee Jr.'s history of the Marshall Plan tells how America's tangle of postwar commitments began. ''There is a wistful reassurance in being reminded of the heroic age of policy making in the years after World War II,'' A. W. DePorte said here in 1984. Though he questioned some of the book's scholarship, he called it ''good light reading for anyone who wants to learn something about the origins of that very successful American initiative.''

A downturn is predicted for the second half of this year because of weaker demand from the auto, appliance and home construction industries. There is little consensus, however, about how steep the downturn will be. [ Page 29. ] Retailers are concerned by slumping sales of women's apparel, even before the industry enters its slowest business period of the year. Sales of women's clothing fell 7 percent in the first quarter from the comparable year-ago period. Sales of men's wear, meanwhile, were up nearly 7 percent. Many of those in the industry blame a lack of excitement or innovation, but others cite the turnovers and job losses involving buyers and merchandisers that have resulted from mergers, divestitures and consolidations. [ 29. ] The securities industry is bracing for another wave of layoffs as trading volume dwindles. Estimates of the number of endangered jobs vary widely, with one study predicting more than 18,000 layoffs in New York City alone. Other forecasters see 8,000 to 10,000 job losses throughout the industry, with the most severe effects expected in New York and London. [ 29. ] April orders for machine tools declined 0.6 percent from the previous month, to $253 million, the industry's trade association reported. But the figure represents a 94.2 percent increase from the year-earlier period. Exports continued to rise sharply.

The provincial electric utility hopes to raise dramatically its sales of power to the Northeastern states if restrictions on imported electricity are curbed.

As a result, builders are shying away from speculative projects and mortgage banking companies are laying off employees. Several leading economists predict that a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will carry an interest rate of 11.25 percent to 11.50 percent by year-end, compared with 10.58 percent last week. Some economists suggest that a continued slowdown in housing might help the economy, acting as a brake on inflation by offsetting rising demand for other goods and services.

us,News Summary,"International A3-15 Reagan and Gorbachev clashed over human rights as the President, quoting from Alexander Solzhenitsyn, appealed for increased civil and religious liberties in the Soviet Union. Page A1 President Reagan met Soviet dissidents and for 55 minutes was surrounded by the people whose plight has helped shape his own anti-Communist oratory. A1 Soviet history exams were canceled until textbooks can be revised and brought up to date with the approach to history advocated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. History exams will be replaced by ''oral discussion of current events.'' A1 Two modest arms control accords are expected to be signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, American and Soviet officials said tonight. Limited headway toward a treaty reducing long-range nuclear arms was also reported. A12 News analysis: Human rights are a sensitive subject at the summit. President Reagan came determined to press the matter, but if he pushes too hard, he may embarrass Mikhail S. Gorbachev and slow the reforms he wants to encourage. A13 A breakdown of ideology in China has been signaled by growing tensions as the country moves with greater speed away from any conventional or historical model of Communism, and more toward a system driven by discernibly capitalist engines. A1 Brazil's economic crisis has brought the Government and a special Constitutional Assembly to loggerheads over how to change the country's development strategy.

A1 New Medicare legislation would shield elderly middle-class Americans from ruin by huge medical bills, in the view of health care experts and Congressional sponsors. A1 A Texas community organizer has helped build a remarkable network that is changing politics in Texas. Neither his low-income constituency nor his intense demeanor and slightly disheveled appearance peg him as a likely power. A16 Terrorists, spies and other intruders have become more adept and betterequipped at penetrating sensitive materials and guarded buildings.
