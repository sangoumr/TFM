Reelfoot Lake is less a lake than a system of bayous, creeks and swampland connected by areas of shallow open water. It was created in the winter of 1811-1812 when a series of powerful earthquakes and aftershocks caused 15,000 acres of cypress forest to sink. The waters of the Mississippi River rushed into the depression. To eyewitnesses, the river seemed to be flowing backward.",2019-03-01T00:00:10+0000

At parties Id collect unsigned, loose-leaf doodles from people around a room, and then wed guess who drew each based on our assumptions about one another. Like handwriting analysis, but with bunnies. Why bunnies? Because theyre tough to mistake for any other creature, thanks to the exaggerated stretch of their ears. Theyre fun to draw even for people who possess no art skills at all. (Plus, imagine asking Jonathan Lethem to draw a chicken.) I later began asking authors at readings to sign their books with a rabbit, scrawled in 10 seconds or less. The time limit gave the whimsical scheme structure, and it also put participants at ease; I wasnt asking for serious art. Still, theyd often protest, I cant draw! before inevitably conceding, and eventually admitting they enjoyed the break from routinely asking to whom they should inscribe the book. Margaret Atwood, for one, embraced my request with a glow: This is great! she said, adding a carrot.

The Ring was both horrifying and meaningfully divergent from its source material, a Japanese book and film series. The third installment of the American series, Rings (2017), was a minor commercial success and a massive critical flop. For now, the franchise appears to be on pause. ",2019-03-02T11:00:01+0000

us,The Next Generation of Stone Tools for Your Face,"There are high-tech beauty devices  flashing LED-light firming masks, pH-measuring patches  and then there are the antitheses: simple stone tools that can stimulate circulation and impart a rested, youthful effect simply by being glided across the face (no plug required). Often cut from minerals such as jade and quartz, these implements have been used for centuries in Chinese medicine and represent the most basic form of natural skin care, says the New York City-based dermatologist Dr. Patricia Wexler. Lately, the options have expanded beyond the ubiquitous jade roller to include tools for gua sha, an ancient form of manual massage that involves scraping the edges of a flat stone along the meridians of the face with slow, firm movements. Doing so can increase circulation, improve lymphatic drainage, de-puff eyes  and provide a calming effect, says Dr. Wexler. Without an on-off switch or any visual cues, though, these implements require a bit of practice. Here, a quick guide to stone-tool facial massage.",2019-03-05T21:39:58+0000

Their representation is small and growing only marginally  in 2007, women in uniform made up 14.4 percent of the force  and their stories tend to be ignored in favor of legacies left by men who have shaped the narrative of service to country. Despite being overlooked, servicewomen are forging new career paths for themselves and the next generation as they enter jobs that were once closed to them. Consider pioneers like Capt. Rosemary Mariner, who was one of the first female Navy pilots in the 1970s and the first woman to lead a naval aviation squadron. She died in January from ovarian cancer, and her memory was honored last month with a flyover using all-female pilots. Or First Lt. Marina A.

A woman named Dolours Price had died, and she had been an I.R.A. soldier. She had been the first woman to join the I.R.A. as a front-line soldier  leading bombing raids, targeting people for execution. She was a very dramatic, impetuous figure. Keefe says he was so intrigued by some of the details in the obituary that I wanted to see where they went.

Think about positive and negative space, she said, observing from a directors chair as her 12 students  a retired preschool teacher, a fine-linens importer  assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not. One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprins late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature.

We were determined to get it right, according to Dan Fogelman, the shows executive producer. The choice of whom to tap was not hard. In June 2018, NBC announced that Fogelmans literary hero, Tim OBrien, would join the show as a consultant. He ultimately took on a bigger role and joined the writing staff, according to Fogelman. OBriens books about the Vietnam War have sold more than six million copies, won numerous awards and repeatedly been recognized as some of the most important works of American fiction of the 20th century. The Things They Carried, probably OBriens most famous work, which he didnt publish until 1990, conveyed his intimate experiences as an American draftee through haunting short stories that explore the physical and emotional baggage that the soldiers of Alpha Company carried with them in Vietnam. In many ways, his episodic, character-driven storytelling style was a natural fit for This Is Us.",2019-03-20T09:00:09+0000

us,Graphic Novels That Will Diagnose Your Disease,"Dr. Ian Williams, a Welsh-born physician, started publishing comics under a pseudonym in 2007, the year he began a website devoted to so-called graphic medicine. Currently located in Brighton, Williams is now one of the primary creators of what has become a rich field combining comics and health care, broadly conceived. A group of artists, academics and medical professionals now maintain a resource-rich version of the website (graphicmedicine.org), sponsor an annual international conference and oversee a book series. In 2015 they issued the Graphic Medicine Manifesto, a part-prose, part-comics title this paper reviewed favorably. Williams, one of the manifestos authors, is now out with his second book of graphic fiction, THE LADY DOCTOR (Penn State University, $24.95), which, like his first, The Bad Doctor, is set in a small town in Wales and offers the engrossing perspective of a hard-working and fallible physician. Lois Pritchard, 40, single and a secret smoker, wears a sharp black bob and pointy high-heeled boots. A general practitioner, she also works part time at the local Genitourinary Medicine clinic, treating various problems of genital and urinary origins that the book selectively illustrates, including numerous S.T.D.s (muck in the fuel pipe, as one man puts it).",2019-03-22T17:46:55+0000
