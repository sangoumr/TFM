This was both descriptive -- according to what passed then for cartography, and because it was a steppingstone in the sea -- and prophetic. Stepped on for millennia, Sardinia is still underrated. Italians generally think of only one thing in connection with Sardinia: summer vacation.

Forget that when he did finally manage to write about his life, in what would turn out to be his first book, the manuscript sailed down a stream of writerly acquaintances accumulated over a life spent among a significant percentage of the authors and journalists living in New York: McCourt's book was not a triumph of connections. He had a childhood worth writing about -- a sad, hard Irish-American childhood -- and a refreshingly unembittered voice with which to tell it, and that is why the book, just published by Scribner's and entitled ''Angela's Ashes,'' appears to be on a trajectory less associated with the output of retired public-school English teachers, which McCourt happens to be, than with that of youthful literary sensations.",1996-09-01T05:00:00+0000

But this photograph was taken in early August on a ranch in Starr County, Tex., not far from Rio Grande City, where a drought has been unrelenting for months, as it has throughout the Southwest. Dust has begun to drift along the fence lines. The few cattle that have not been rounded up are reduced to eating cactus that has been burned to make it more palatable. Most cattle have gone to auction already, underweight, before their time. The animals in this photograph -- Brahman cattle, mostly, suited to the heat of south Texas -- proved too wily to gather. Whether they will prove wily enough to survive the summer is another question.",1996-09-01T05:00:00+0000

us,A Jim Crow Sperm Bank?,"Is Floyd C. Kimble a kindly philanthropist? Or a creepy amateur geneticist? A recent report in The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, Wash., alleged that Kimble's Foundation for the Continuity of Mankind -- a $40 million sperm bank in Spokane -- is soliciting donations only from Caucasians, out of a belief that a hybridized white race will need pure sperm for future replenishment. Kimble, a 68-year-old Ohio businessman, pleads innocent, saying that the misunderstanding stems from unfortunate quotes by his sperm-bank manager, Dora Vaux, who once worked for a ''genuis'' sperm bank in California. (Vaux, above, said that even if the bank accepted sperm from blacks, it would be kept in a separate freezer.) Kimble is worried about hybrids -- he says they are disease-prone -- but insists his goal is to preserve pure semen stocks from healthy, smart people of all races. ''If there is a superior colored person, we want that person,'' he says. ''We definitely want some of the Orientals.'' But, thanks all the same, no artists. ''Artists,'' says Kimble, a nuts-and-bolts type, ''are not a prerequisite for the survival of mankind.''",1996-09-01T05:00:00+0000

The ritual, Swindle says, has lost its practical value, which was originally a demonstration ''among primitives'' that one wasn't carrying a concealed weapon. Besides that, it's just plain vile. ''Think of all those unwashed hands,'' says Swindle. ''You're talking about fungal viruses, cold viruses, warts. Who wants warts?'' Dead-serious in his quest, Swindle refuses to glad-hand anyone. ''I usually try to soften the blow,'' he says, ''by telling them I fractured a finger playing basketball. But you have to be careful. Sometimes they'll reach for your left hand, like they do with Bob Dole.'' Hmmm. That probably doesn't soften the blow much, which may explain why Swindle's only convert is his wife.

us,The Whole Gorey Story,"Edward Gorey's art is macabre, but despite his fixation (or, rather, passion) for murder and mayhem, it is by no means gory. His detailed black-and-white line drawings so perfectly express the mood or capture the mystery of an otherwise brutal scene that there is no need to revel in blood or guts or even torn undergarments. Edward Gorey, the author, illustrator, set designer and ballet maven, has for the better part of his professional life been a master of a genre of graphic storytelling -- his work is a synthesis of the comic book and the graphic novel best described as a picture book for adults. His satires (often of tawdry Victorian mysteries) are not mere commentaries on the manners and mores of a distant age; they are inventive narratives about evil adults, mischievous children, illicit lovers and improbable beasts. They tickle the funny bone as they raise hair on the back of the neck. A brilliant draftsman, Mr. Gorey has raised the crosshatch, a timeworn 19th-century mannerism, into a timeless visual language. Gorey fans who, like me, have enjoyed his three previously published ''Amphigorey'' anthologies of graphic tales will welcome THE WORLD OF EDWARD GOREY (Abrams, $29.95), by Clifford Ross, an artist, and Karen Wilkin, an art critic. A superb sampling of classic stories, visual essays, covers, posters and sketches is sandwiched between an informative interview with Mr. Gorey and a concise analysis of his work at the beginning of the book and a complete bibliography and photographs of his library and studio at the end. His best-known drawings, for stories like ''The Hapless Child,'' ''The Gilded Bat,'' ''Other People's Mail'' and ''Edward Gorey's Dracula,'' are treats, to be sure. But I particularly adore the lesser-known treasures, like the excerpt from ''The Inanimate Tragedy.'' The caption for the last panel, showing three inanimate objects on a landscape, characterizes Mr. Gorey's dry wit: ''The Two-Holed Button concealed its apprehension.''

us,Graceland in the Philippines,"For rowdy American servicemen stationed in the Philippines in the early 1990's, all roads lead to Olongapo, the spilled-beer and barbecued-meat-scented Sodom that caters to their every whim. Here, at a ramshackle former movie theater renamed Graceland, two young brothers, Chester and Albert Lane, team up with Ward Wiggins, a fortyish former college professor, to perform a stunning nightly ritual, transforming the life story of Elvis Presley into a parable of birth, death and resurrection. With Chester as the romantic young punk from Tupelo, Albert as the jaded movie idol and Ward as the bloated, sequined, drug-addled Aztec Superfly, the three work their collective magic on increasingly enraptured crowds. For the Lane brothers, the show is a lark, but for Ward it's nothing less than a spiritual calling. ''We were realer than real,'' he says, looking back. ''I wasn't an impersonator. . . . I was Elvis.'' In his latest novel, BIGGEST ELVIS (Viking, $22.95), P. F. Kluge, the author of ''Eddie and the Cruisers,'' writes lyrically, whether he's describing the gaudy onstage triumphs of his Elvis trinity or the crushing hardships of life around the Subic Bay naval base. And he links the stages of Big E's life to what he sees as the phases of America's identity -- a descent from vigorous pioneer nation to aging, swollen colossus. Yet as time passes, the Philippine inhabitants of Olongapo, mired in poverty and trapped in a military economy, come to see Ward, the Biggest Elvis of the book's title, as a sort of ecumenical saint and community savior; just how that happens is the subject of this dreamy, melancholy tale of economic and pop-cultural imperialism.

us,Subdivision Days,"It is 1963 and in the suburban subdivision where 12-year-old Suzanne Keller is growing up, the houses are clean and freshly painted. Suzanne's parents and their neighbors are young marrieds, hopeful families settling down on President John F. Kennedy's New Frontier. Even the trees that dot the lawns of Blue Spruce Lane and Mountain Laurel Drive are so new they allow the neighbors ''a clear view of each other's yards. Nothing was secret or hidden.'' In Marly Swick's first novel, PAPER WINGS (HarperCollins, $21), America's communities are still cradled inside one another, like a set of nested dolls: family, neighborhood, nation. Ms. Swick likes to fix certain moments in her sights: the humming, slow-motion instants before everything changes. And so, when Lee Harvey Oswald takes aim at J.F.K., he is drawing a bead on Suzanne's family too -- and their white-collar neighbors with their wistful dreams for the future. By the time Lyndon Johnson has been sworn in as President, the Kellers' lives have already begun to alter in slow but permanent ways. Suzanne's mother begins to close herself off, retreating behind dark glasses like Jackie Kennedy. Suzanne's father starts the long drift that will lead him away from his wife and into the arms of another woman. If Ms. Swick's book sometimes feels a little too kitschy -- like a time capsule crammed with Tupperware and old 45's -- it's saved by her self-assured tone. In her confident hands, ''Paper Wings'' becomes a moving elegy to the era that, like John Updike's mythical 50's, still looks to many like ''the last happy time.''

us,Great Stone Faces,"Defaced by time, pigeon gunk and insensitive landlords eager to remove potential liabilities, New York's once abundant crop of architectural stonework has suffered countless indignities. However, some of the city's most hardscrabble neighborhoods are still graced by a noble array of gods, gargoyles and fanciful bas reliefs. To 19th-century developers, such carvings were an inexpensive way to dress up otherwise dreary buildings, masking the unrelieved misery of tenement life within. The photographer John Yang has made a haunting record of Manhattan's ornamental stonework, most of which hovers above the city's streets unnoticed by passers-by and uncared for by its owners. From East Harlem to the Lower East Side, Mr. Yang's OVER THE DOOR: The Ornamental Stonework of New York (Princeton Architectural Press, $34.95) dispassionately captures grinning nymphs, mythical griffins and busts of long-forgotten children, often modeled on the buildings' original inhabitants. The worn-away and vandalized faces -- some with noses and eyes gouged out -- bring to mind the broken remnants of Roman antiquity and a more enlightened culture ravaged by barbarians. Mr. Yang's stark photographs almost implore New Yorkers to look up, take stock of their sculptured heritage and stop the destruction. Andrew Jacobs",1996-09-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Pictures of Faith,"It isn't God but faith that is in the details of Thomas Roma's dramatic, honest photographs of services in black Brooklyn churches in COME SUNDAY (Museum of Modern Art/Abrams, $35). Tapping every shade of gray between starch white and stark black, Mr. Roma's photographs gracefully capture countless details: the shine on an exposed tooth, the precise thickness of a braid, a hand's tight clutch on a Bible. Mr. Roma is particularly skilled at portraying texture, finding and exploiting contrasts among the corduroys, silks, polyesters and wools of Sunday-best suits and dresses. Between walls of plywood paneling and stucco, in pews and in folding chairs, Mr. Roma's subjects chat, crack smiles, doze, read, weep and cheer. But mostly they pray, and in his introductory essay Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of Harvard University's Afro-American studies department, writes that the intensity of their prayers is linked to earthly hardships. ''Roma's worshipers are figures of transcendence, paradoxically all-too-rooted in this world by the burdens of unemployment and underemployment, ghetto housing and crime-infested neighborhoods,'' he writes. Mr. Gates is of course correct. However, ''Come Sunday'' is not primarily concerned with belief itself; if one sensibility pervades the praying faces of Mr. Roma's subjects, it is absolute trust -- perhaps the most dramatic evidence of faith available.

us,Young Lust,"Nicky Wertheim is only 10 years old, but the merest sight of Julia Turrell, nine years his senior, fills him with an emotion he can't even name. It's lust. And what would be passing puppy love for anyone else becomes for Nicky pure unbridled infatuation. He and Julia are destined to cross paths again and again, in a series of encounters that brings them both sheer joy and abject misery. In his first novel, SNAKEBITE SONNET (Little, Brown, $22.95), Max Phillips uses darkly comedic tones to draw a bead on the sweet agonies of passion and sex. Part coming-of-age story, part social commentary, Mr. Phillips's novel maneuvers Nicky through his childhood in suburban New Jersey and his college years at Cornell, then follows him to the East Village punk and art worlds of the early 1980's. With deft satiric wit, Mr. Phillips explores the confused emotions of adolescent romance and the even more convoluted world of adult attraction. Ultimately, of course, Nicky finds that perceptions of love and the real thing are often at odds, and that reconciling the two can be just as hard as sorting them out in the first place.

Immense and robust, it was a fitting metaphor for the primitive forces in man's own nature. But in less than 100 years, having destroyed over half of it, the rain forest is now seen as a fragile thing, not menacing but nurturing and cuddly.

Ms. Guzman, now 26 years old, has confronted the imminence of death by writing poetry. In the Washington Heights apartment where her parents, brother and sisters care for her, she has tapped out several hundred poems on her computer, using a blink of the eye to select the letters as they are displayed, one after the other, on an electronic board. A 20-line poem can take the better part of a day. ''Sometimes when I get really inspired I can go up to five hours at a time,'' she says. ''But I get very tired.'' Her writing may reflect the darkness of a terminal illness but, she says, ''It's an escape from reality, letting my imagination run wild.''",1996-09-22T05:00:00+0000

That evening, it was packed for a five-hour reading of ''Gatsby,'' from Nick Carraway's father's advice to reserve judgment on people who haven't had the advantages you've had, to the famous ending: ''So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.''",1996-09-22T05:00:00+0000

The rooms are messy, the ashtrays full, yet the parents, friends and neighbors -- sprawled on brown velvet sofas or sitting on the floor -- enjoy one another's company, along with a smoke, a beer, a cup of tea and ice cream. Such is life for the working poor in the housing project in Nottingham, England, that Nick Waplington documents with remarkable intimacy in THE WEDDING: New Pictures From the Continuing ''Living Room'' Series (Aperture, $40), the successor to a collection he published in 1991. Loosely organized around the union of Janet and Clive, the photographs are boisterous and raw, bursting with color, movement and emotion. Mr. Waplington shot for months and from all angles: a baby's leg occupies the foreground of one image; a solitary beer-sipping guest, slumped between a wall and a television set, is the focus of another. Always, Mr. Waplington celebrates the beauty of the ordinary, and his images constitute an intense representation of the power of love. Christine Schwartz Hartley",1996-09-22T05:00:00+0000

Less familiar is R. J. Reynolds's Red Kamel brand, aimed at smoking's next generation: self-consciously hip twentysomethings, who tend to believe they're immune to advertising. A revival of a failed brand introduced in 1913, Red Kamels are often given away in downtown clubs like Nation in Manhattan. Their ads mix Soviet colors, old-style labor imagery and copy that reads like a rejection of ad copy. ''Back for No Good Reason,'' goes the slogan, ''Except They Taste Good.'' Why would this appeal to Generation X? R. J. Reynolds declined to discuss it, so we rounded up our own panel of experts and put the question to them.",1996-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,Muddling Through the Enlightenment,"Set in a thriving 17th-century northern European port, Eric Darton's first novel, FREE CITY (Norton, $18), attends the stormy birth of the Enlightenment, when faith vied with reason and science threatened to replace religion in defining human destiny. These differing explanations of the cosmos make it difficult for anyone to come up with a consistent world view; for the unnamed inventor whose fictional journal makes up the novel, this is especially perplexing. Both a surgeon and a mechanical engineer, he oversees the construction of various automatons and an airship, experiments with anesthetics and stimulants, speculates about artificial memory and movies, and dabbles in law and politics. Yet despite all this accomplishment, he finds his prodigious reason nearly equaled by his lover's apparently occult powers, which have been gained, it seems, primarily by instinct. But his real problems are caused by his patron, the mysterious Roberto, a man whose ''ambitions have succeeded all reason,'' to whom he is symbiotically joined -- at least until he realizes that he is being drained of his genius simply to feed the other's devious schemes. Witty and surprising (by far the most thoughtful and morally rigorous character is a talking duck), Mr. Darton's book is an allegorical gambol through a frequently bizarre universe of foible and imperfection. Its conclusion that most things somehow work out in the end -- or, at least, that life goes on -- is fitting, if unsurprising. After all, progress often seems mostly a matter of muddling through.

But, says a group of more than 500 economists, including seven Nobel laureates, the tax gift would be economically reckless -- crowding out valuable public programs and private investment that the economy needs to grow. President Clinton was cornered by Mr. Dole into offering his own tax-cut plan -- for families with young children, for college students and for employers who hire welfare recipients. These tax cuts are also tantalizing, but they too make little economic sense, as some of his own advisers admit in private. Yet there is a major difference between the two plans.

us,The Fine Art of Murder,"In a world in which public relations is considered performance art, it's no wonder that Stuart Finley feels disillusioned. Stuart, the 28-year-old narrator of OBSCENE BODIES (HarperCollins, $22), Kim Benabib's perceptive first novel, is an assistant curator in the Old Masters drawings department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his mentor, the legendary chief curator Harlan Kohlman, has instilled in him a sense of skepticism, not to mention taste and standards. But there is more to Stuart's story. ''Obscene Bodies'' is a murder mystery that opens with a corpse and the observation that ''in some way all of them were accomplices.'' By the time the identity of the body has been disclosed, Stuart will have been drawn into the orbit of Miles Levy, a famous SoHo painter and conceptual artist who is intensely absorbed by his own image, endlessly refashioning it through publicists, dealers and groupies -- and drugs. Filled with eyebrow-raising roman-a-clef characters (Mr. Benabib's mother was a New York painter, his father a dealer), the novel provides a detailed inspection of hipness. But it is the ''obscene bodies'' (overhyped paintings) of the title that bring Stuart's predicament into focus: how to maintain Kohlman's standards in the face of the material rewards available to Levy. By making Levy more than just a one-dimensional con man and by opening Stuart's eyes to the heroic and almost impossible task of the artist to ''make it new,'' Mr. Benabib has given his story both honesty and complexity.

The space plane takes off like a standard jet, climbing to 30,000 feet in three minutes. Then the pilot cuts the jets and flicks on the kerosene-fueled rocket engines. Within 30 seconds, the plane breaks the sound barrier and leaves the Earth's atmosphere. Ten minutes later, it is 90 miles up, moving at Mach 19 - 13,000 miles per hour - and silently coasting on the momentum of the burned-out rockets. (Passengers in the upper-deck solarium get a brief but unparalleled view of the galaxies. Seat belts are essential; there's not gravity during this part of the trip.) After three minutes of free fall, the plane has dropped to 150,000 feet and re-entered the atmosphere; here, air resistance slows the plane and enables it to glide (again in silence) for the next 20 minutes. At 36,000 feet, the pilot turns the jets back on and prepares to lando nt he standard runway. Total time from New York to Beijing: 70 minutes.
