us,Screen: Solas's 'Lucia',"At last we're privileged to see Humberto Solas's ""Lucia,"" completed in 1969, when the director was 26; it opened at the First Avenue Screening Room on Tuesday. Spanning nearly 70 years of Cuban history, this extraordinary movie focuses on three generations of women whose lives reflect the society around them.The first section of the movie is set in 1895, when the Cuban nationalists were warring against the Spanish rule. Lucia (Raquel Revuelta), an aristocrat with ruffles at her throat, has a brother in the rebel army. Since so many men are being killed off, she doubts that she'll ever marry. But she falls violently in love with a stranger who claims to be apolitical, and elopes with him even though he's married. As they ride toward the coffee plantation where the rebels are hidden, troops hired by the Spanish gallop out of the hills, her lover throws her off his horse, and she realizes that he was simply using her to discover the nationalist' secret headquarters. Many are killed, including her brother, and she later stabs her betrayer to death.Some differ sharply in their responses to the three parts of ""Lucia."" I found this section lushly overacted  almost in the style of silent movies. The women have been directed to flutter and squeal until they appear like a parody of winsome maidenhood. Operatic music throbs whenever the lovers' eyes meet, and the enthusiastic battle scene seems straight out of one of our Westerns: It's odd that a Cuban film maker should have used such mossy capitalistic models. The men fight with a gleeful gusto that's almost amusing, and what comes through is the glory of war, not its tragedy  although that's probably not what Mr. Solas intended.'Lucia, 1933"" is far more successful. This Lucia, a delicate, discontented daughter of the middle class, flees her parents' world of canasta parties and posh country houses and takes off with Aldo, a young revolutionary, who's involved in the overthrow of the dictator Gerardo Machado. But the new rgime is as rotten as the old one. Disgusted, Aldo tries to revive the revolutionand is shot dead.The vulnerable young woman who dwells with loss and change is admirably played by Eslinda Nunez, who can ring the changes from intense happiness to misery, and conveys fragility even when shouting at her mother or working, wan and pregnant, in a cigar factory. The street scenes, with everyone running and bleeding and weeping, distill all the confusion of urban warfare, the uncertainty of who did what to whom. The weaknesses are the images of corruption (an unconvincing orgy) and the fact that the revolutionary's character is inadequately developed. Since he lacks any dimension beyond his political beliefs, the impact of his death is lessened.The final episode, ""Lucia, 196 ,"" is absolutely splendid, and reveals Mr. Solas's vast talent for comedy. The third Lucia (Adela Legra) is a stunning young field workeras robust as the last Lucia was frail. Newly wed to a beguiling hulk (Adolfo Llaurado), she revels in their long days of sexual clowning (In ""Lucia, 1895,"" sex was made to appear very threatening, and desire almost unbearable.) But the husband won't let Lucia return to work or even leave their house. As he nails up the windows so that other men won't see her, she complains that she's no longer allowed to look at her own mother.Well-wishers warn the man that he's betraying the revolution through his machismo and his possessiveness; he replies that he's the revolution. Lucia is told that a wife is not a slave, that her husband must learn that times have changed. When he insists on total obedience, it's remarked that he's behaving as his father did, and according to his prerevolutionary upbringing.Wretchedly divided, she leaves and goes back to the fields. There's a hilarious scene when he orders her home, chases her and is himself chased by her female co-workers, who surround and hold him while he and Lucia yell with fury. Daft about each other, they're unable to separate or to agree about her way of life, and as the movie ends they are still fighting between embraces The whole picture stresses thatalthough many women haven't yet won the most ordinary kinds of freedomthe present is far superior to the past I wish that ""Lucia, 196 . ."" might be seen by all the sexes: it's the best discussion of equality (and inequality) I've seen on screen, and the clashes are clarified by comedy.",1974-03-01T05:00:00+0000

To Eli, San Willow seems to be as fabled as Xanadu and quite as remote.""Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is about the adventures of Rodger and Eli getting from nowhere to nowhere. Eli, a killer with the ladies at first, always leaves them unsatisfied. He seems to have a sex problem. Rodger spends a lot of his time getting his dad out of scrapes. He also drinks, smokes and goes to sleep at night crying for his mom, who was killed in a plane crash with Eli.It's difficult to determine just what sort of movie the makers of ""Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies"" had in mind when they began it. Americana? Comedy? Drama? A psychological study of the Oedipal relationship?Little Rodger really does have a problem with his father, whose girlfriends he loves, whose whores he pays off and whom, at the very end, he comforts when a particularly bitchy woman has walked out on Eli saying that he was lousy in bed. ""I love you,"" says Rodger, cradling his weeping dad.The production appears to have been expensive. The aerial photography is lovely, and the performances are O.K., but the movie is such a mess of unexplored moods and loose ends that it makes the later, similar ""Paper Moon"" look like a masterpiece.The film, which was made three years ago, is being shown here in a version that the original producers, writer and director so disapprove of that they took their names off it. The names included in the credit box above for those contributions appear on the screen and are fictitious.

us,Six Burckhardt Films Celebrate City Nostalgically,"New York, which, in the case of the 59-year-old Swiss-born photographer and film maker Rudy Burckhardt, consists of only Manhattan and Queens, was a wonderful town. And it is nostalgically celebrated in the collection of six of his short subjects made from 1939 through 1967 that is being shown at the Film Forum. Mr. Burckhardt, whose New York photographs have been lauded in one-man shows, now illustrates that he is equally artistic in his movie documentations of our town's people and places.In the silent, 7-minute ""Pursuit of Happiness,"" shots of hurrying mid-Manhattan crowds focus on not only now-quaint 1939 hair, dress and suit styles but also a variety of faces that ironically mock the film's title. And it sets the tone for subsequent subjects such as the 20-minute ""The Climate of New York"" (1949) and the 15-minute ""Under the Brooklyn Bridge"" (1955), the best of the lot in this observer's view.""Climate,"" which takes its subtitles from the poetry of Mr. Burckhardt's friend, the poet and dance critic Edwin Denby, courses among empty lots and children and their elders enjoying a quiet Sunday in Astoria, through subways, to buildings at dusk in Manhattan, with perceptive, stark clarity that beautifully preserves the past. Just as sharp and memorable are the vignettes of the demolition of an ancient warehouse juxtaposed against scenes of nude boys swimming and diving from decayed piers in the blighted areas of ""Under the Brooklyn Bridge.""Although it is out of step with the rest, the 1964 ""Miracle on the B.M.T."" (the Independent, really), provides a swift tour of subways and streets while it concentrates on a threadbare romantic comedy about a lonely boy and a girl, played by Red and Mimi Grooms.However, ""Eastside Summer"" (1958) is a fond continuation of ""Climate"" in its unadorned portraiture of the tenements, shops and the largely Hispanic population of Avenues A, B and C. The past and present haven't changed much here or in the 1967 ""Square Times"" and its garish, sleezy Times Square night life.""Rudy Burckhardt's New York"" has not been previously shown theatrically, says the Film Forum management. But it is informative and fascinating visual history that deserves public recognition.",1974-03-02T05:00:00+0000

Today, by common convention, the actual music of an opera of the past is no longer touched. We expect to hear the notes as the composer wrote them. But the libretto! That is another matter.

us,Mame Puts On New but Familiar Face--Lucille Ball,"Some great characters of literature will not be still. They keep coming back. Dracula is one. Auntie Mame is another.This determinedly eccentric Beekman Place hostess, who was first introduced to us by Patrick Dennis in his 1955 novel, appeared next as a 1956 Broadway comedy, ""Auntie Mame,"" which was adopted into a 1958 film and then as a 1966 Broadway musical called ""Mame,"" which has now reappeared as a 1974 movie musical.It opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, a little tired though certainly not out of breath. The newest ""Mame,"" with Lucille Ball in the title role wearing a different colored wig for every Administration from Hoover's through Truman's is as determined to please in its way as Mame is in hers.The opening credits, which look like a Cubist collage in motion, are so good they could be a separate subject. The songs by Jerry Herman, when he isn't writing material (""Open a New Window"") more fit for a lesser Walt Disney effort, are full of zest and sometimes wit. From time to time the dances by Onna White are allowed to take over the screen, a rare occurrence in most movie musicals these days.It's all relentlessly good-natured but unless you've been packed in storage some where it's so familiar that it puts a tremendous burden on its star. Miss Ball is a great comedienne who has spent the last 20 years creating an in-home image as a lucky nut whose worst-laid plans al-always turn out successfully.When the character of Lucy, an inspired slapstick performer, coincides with that of Auntie Mame, the that of Auntie Mame, the Big-Town sophisticate, ""Mame"" is marvelous. I think of Lucy's turning a Georgia fox hunt into a gigantic shambles, or of her bringing the curtain down on a New Haven first-night when, as a budding actress, she falls off a huge cardboard moon. I even treasure her prying loose the fingers of a sloshed Beatrice Arthur who won't give up her martini glass.Miss Ball has some great moments but she is not even a nonsinger who fakes singing very well, and as for the dances, well, she just more or less follows what the chorus people do with her, or she stands aside and sort of conducts them. What is worse is that she has been photographed in such soft focus that her face alternately looks beatificall a religious glowor like something sculptured from melting vanilla ice cream.Gene Saks, the director, has so protected Miss Ball's appearance that when the comparatively rugged Robert Preston, who plays Mame's Georgia millionaire, comes into the same frame, he too, becomes suddenly fuzzy of contour, as if he'd walked into a Nylon tent.Neither is the camera (or maybe its the customer) terribly kind to Beatrice Arthur, another fine comediienne who plays Mame's bitchy actress-friend. Miss Arthur (""Maude"") has been dressed up to look like a football player in drag, which may be more in keeping with the kind of comedy ""Mame"" is than I remember from earlier incarnations.So much of it is insult or put-down comedy that when Mame undertakes to save her nephew Patrick (Bruce Davison) from the clutches of bigoted suburban bores, the effect is less funny than smugly rude.The movie does have two first-rate production numbers, one, early on, featuring Miss Ball and her 9-year-old nephew (KirbyFurlong), which becomes a salute to the nineteen-twenties. The other is the title song performed by the star and a chorus of what looks to be about 1,000 redcoated black-toppered fox hunters. Both numbers have a kind of plush, old-fashioned extravagance about them that takes us back not to the periods depicted in the film but to the innocent fifties when movie musicals hadn't yet thought of themselves as significant.I have great reservations about ""Mame."" but I suspect a lot of people couldn't care less. All things being equal. Mame's next metamorphosis could be as a television series, by which time most of us may be too old to remember that her story wasn't handed down to us on tablets.",1974-03-08T05:00:00+0000

us,"' Montreal Main,' the Offbeat Life of 13-Year-Old Boy","""Montreal Main,"" the Canadian-made feature that opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum of American Art, is obviously the dedicated effort of a production crew and a cooperative cast who conceived and performed it all with a will. But despite a cinma vrit-like approach, their delineations of the relationships between a young, bearded artist-photographer and a 13-year-old boy, the boy's parents who are disturbed by this strange friendship, and a covey of homosexuals and others, makes for dolefully sincere but vague and unconvincing drama.Frank Vitale, who wrote the original story, directed and stars as the artist, has focused his color cameras on the sleazy, Bohemian areas of a Montreal far removed from a tourist's itinerary. And his disquieting, if not moving, slice of offbeat life is in keeping with its squalid, if authentic, surroundings.The cast, reportedly non-professionals using their real names and improvising much of the dialogue, does not act so much as react to situations that often call for fuller explanations.

You could hear them cracking through the dry red shank and manzanilla brush, then the echo of their footsteps as they ran through a concrete drainage tunnel under Interstate Route 5, just half a mile from Tijuana, then their heavy breathing; it was like stalking big game, rather than men who only wanted bread. The wetbacks were all around us. They had been patient, these wetbacks. Mexico had taught them how to be patient. They had waited on the Tijuana side until they had met the right coyote, which what they have traditionally called one who specializes in smuggling hungry people to the Promised Land. In Tijuana they had also spoken of a pollero, a more recent, less fearsome name for a coyote. In Spanish, a pollero is one who tends to his chickens, his patios, and the wetbacks had joked that they wanted to be pollos for a reliable pollero; they would pay $250 or even $300 to a good pollero who would hide them in a truck or under a truck or even next to the engine of a truck and take them to Los that could vanish Into the city. Even before Tijuana they had waited. They had waited in the dust outside little huts of adobe, huts filled with hungry children and holloweyed old men and old women, humorless and taciturn, still waiting for the promises of a revolution to come true; wretched little places in Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, Durango, Jalisco, Chihuahua and Sonora, places with lovely names where God seemed forever bringing drought or flash floods or more children; always children. But they had waited and perhaps they had sold a good cow, a few pigs and they had saved pesos and centavos until now, finally, their time had come. With all of their belongings in a cardboard box or a shopping bag or a battered piece of luggage they had gone to the bus station and purchased a ticket which enabled them to ride north on the Autobus of the Three Stars of Gold and soon they could see the rutted, dreary streets of Tijuana.",1974-03-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Czech 'Valerie',"The exquisite color of ""Valerie and Her Week of Wonders"" sustains this admirably conceived Czechoslovak film, directed and co-written by Jaromil Jires, now showing at the Elgin Theater, 171 Eighth Avenue.As Mr. Jires depicts the tender, sensual and bizarre daydreaming of a 13-year-old girl, with the accompaniment of lyrical music and a flow of simple and surreal imagery, the picture evokes a pictorial music of its own. So do the expressions of the young heroine, Jaroslava Schallerova, looking like a beautiful young Rita Tushingham.In content, the film is a weird exercise, striking out boldly in the paths of Bergman, Fellini and Buuel with characters in something of a clutter who shift into evil incarnate or plain tooth-chomping vampires. One creepy sequence in a coffin-crammed lair is right out of ""Dracula.""Mr. Jires finally brings his story back to reality in simple, neat fashion, but only after his Grand Guignol transformations have redundantly cluttered the action and landscape, like a milling horror-show road company. ""What ails you, child?"" the daydreaming girl is gently asked by her grandma, a part-time vampire.The movie remains far more impressive when it blends the heroine's virginal wonderment with the sights and sounds of nature, minus the macabre symbolism tapped from other sources.

us,The Screen: 'Christo's Valley Curtain' Is a Real Tall Story,"""Christo's Valley Curtain,"" directed by Albert and David Maysles and Ellen Giffard, is a 28-minute report on the hanging of a curtain in August, 1972. It was no ordinary curtain. It was made of nine tons of orange nylon polymide fabric, was a quarter of a mile long, was suspended from four steel cables as much as 365 feet above the floor of Rifle Gap, Colo., and cost $700,000. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it was torn to ribbons by the wind, but that didn't matter.Christo, the Bulgarian-born New York artist who conceived the project, was not interested in hiding a garbage dump or a pot-bellied mountain. He's a compulsive ""packager,"" and when he came to hang the valley curtain he'd already had experience as the man who wrapped one mile of Australian coastline and Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. Separately, of course.""Christo's Valley Curtain"" was shown at the First Avenue Screening Room Sunday and will be repeated there today and tomorrow at noon and midnight. Technically, I suppose, you could say it supports the Screening Room's feature, ""Confessor,"" an amateurish mishmash of poetic film making that you might want to break your neck to avoid.If, at 73 minutes, ""Confessor"" is 72 minutes too long, ""Christo's Valley Curtain"" is not long enough. It makes no lugubrious attempt to explain Christo's art (""revelation through concealment,"" according to David Bourdin), which can be shown more easily than it can be explained.Christo himself, a wiry, intense man wearing jeans and white hard-hat, talks about his esthetics as involving the entire process of packaging, or in this case, of curtain hanging. That is, the business of negotiating with engineers, architects, politicians and construction workers. It's like being a kid all over again, though here the play looks a bit dangerous.The surprise of the film is the enthusiasm with which this project was greeted by the residents of the town of Rifle (pop. 2,150) and by the construction workers who risked limbs and lives on the stunt. Says one hard-hat: ""It's not the erection of it [that's important], it's the thought.""The film is marvelous reportage of the sort the Maysles brothers do best, but it brought out every philistine feeling I've ever had. Seven hundred thousand dollars? Even though Christo raised the money from the sale of his own drawings and models, that seems the sort of staggering indulgence that once sent the mobs ransacking Versailles.This much about ""Confessor"": It's a series of disconnected images, some surreal (a football player runs through a museum. Superman lies dead on a New York street) and all banal, describing urban alienation. It is less expensive to observe life in any midtown cafeteria on a weekday afternoon.",1974-03-15T05:00:00+0000

A typical Alekhine game evolved into a threeringcircus in which so much happened so quickly the opponent did not know what to expect next. On the other hand, an opponent of Capablanca was all too often deluded into thinking that nothing was going on until resignation became imminent. Alekhine's conjuring of complications reached its ascendancy after World War II, but the Capablanca style was never outmoded  it needed only a Bobby Fischer to revive it. Fischer demonstrated the superiority of bishop over nigh knight with pawns on both sides of the board in winning the fourth game of his match with Mark Tananov in Vancouver ni 1971. In the Orense International Tournament, the American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier also took up the cudgel for Capablanca, pulling off a clean victory against Guillermo Estevez of Cuba that was made possible by the superiority of a bishop in free play over one blocked by its own pawns. What Estevez needed was a sharp freeing maneuver in the opening such as 6 PKR3; 7. BR4, PKN4; 8 BN3, NK5. Instead, his 6 00 led him into a variation of the Queen's Gambit in which his king bishop was misplaced at QN5. With 11 NK5, Bisguier was already threatening 12 NxN followed by the breakup of the kingside with 13 BxN, thus forcing the retreat of the black king bishop. Since Bisguier threatened to set up a classical attacking position with 13 QB3 and 14 PKN4, Estevez had little choice but to exchange minor pieces with 12 NK5.",1974-03-17T05:00:00+0000

But like its likable midgets, the comedy-melodrama that opened at local theaters yesterday, unfortunately, rarely measures up to its king-sized intentions.Angel Tompkins, as the double-dealing damsel on the lam from a mobster she has bilked, is, of course, not averse to latching onto Billy Curtis and the other midget ""Little Cigars"" in his troupe in order to avoid her pursuers. Thereafter, naturally, it's one caper after another, until the big one and the ultimate double-cross.It's not really a double-cross because, it turns out, Miss Tompkins loves Mr. Curtis as much as moneyto the accompaniment throughout these hectic holdups of a series of one-liners in four-letter dialogue that are not terribly funny.

us,Screen: 'The Super Cops' Arrives:Film Depicts Real-Life Batrman' and 'Robin' The Cast Drug Pushers Chased by Determined Duo,"""The Super Cops,"" this week's only new cop film, is based on the story of David Greenberg and Robert Hantz, the two New York City policemen who became known, not always fondly, as Batman and Robin because of their pow-bam-smash adventures fighting drug pushers in the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant. It opened yesterday at the Criterion and other theaters.The nicknames define the comic-book style of the film, which was written by Lorenzo Semple Jr., and directed by Gordon Parks, and is played, mostly super cute, by Ron Leibman (Greenberg) and David Selby (Hantz).The movie is escapist sociology: rather silly but not boring. Its pace is set by the big beat of Jerry Fielding's soundtrack music, which scores the flights, pursuits and last-minute escapes, including one in which the two intrepid cops are rescued by a wrecking ball that is demolishing the building they're standing on.As in ""Serpico,"" the villains of the film are not really the hoods and drug pushers but the other cops, who are either corrupt or lazy.In ""The Super Cops"" this corruption is hardly more than a plot device, something to impede what otherwise would be the immediate rise to success of the two ambitious policemen. The movie, however, is fuzzy on details and so inconsistent that, at the end, when Greenberg and Hantz are being promoted, I couldn't help wondering how they made it in the face of all the departmental opposition.At one point in the film, the real Detectives Greenberg and Hantz show up playing crooked cops. Which makes me wonder even more. If one is a cop who isn't on the take, one can always sell his story to the movies. It has become one of the residuals of honesty.",1974-03-21T05:00:00+0000

us,' CasualRelations' and 'Princeton' on Bill,"Impatience dwells a long way from outrage, and boredom never was a substitute for shock. Mark Rappaport's ""Casual Relations,"" whose two-day run ends today at the First Avenue Screening Room, is supposed to be outrageous, but it's no more stimulating than one prolonged shot of a pitcher and a basin.The movie yields a vague patchwork of preoccupations: a young woman dreams at monsters and wakes exhausted, a man suffers through a bad trip, another woman watches television all day long, a couple lunches one year after their separation, there's a very dull murder in a swamp, a chap who likes newsreels of catastrophes gets his knee fondled in a movie theater, a typist in an office recalls a threatening dream, and an amateur photographer admires one photograph in a gallery.A woman who does nude modeling also performs in stag films and a vampire picture. Both are filmed with such enthusiasm that you suspect that these were the movies that the director really wanted to make. But his vampireswho move as slowly and stiffly as limbs in plaster castsseem like forlorn traitors to their class.A puff for Princeton on the same bill has been mysteriously nominated for an Oscar. But it seems more like a fund-raising kit than a documentary. ""Princeton: A Search for Answers,"" by Julian Krainin and DeWitt Sage Jr., mocks the seriousness of teaching and learning when we're given only little scraps of lectures, ranging from ""Man is an animal"" equipped with ""a mind which has a passionate lust to know"" to ""Nobody really knows what a galaxy is like."" Scholars are poorly served when their work is presented as a slick collage.Outside of one fine reading of ""Measure for Measure"" and a chorus rehearsal for Bach's B minor Mass, the professors and students appear desperately conscious of the camera. There's some further gargle about ""the place of man""ah, man""in the scheme of things,"" plus praise for ""the diversity of opinion"" cherished at Princeton. Evocations of the arts and shots of Frisbees and a number of young blond persons fail to characterize the institution in any way that might distinguish it from any other leafy university.",1974-03-23T05:00:00+0000

It scores the typical American hospital for being everything its inmates don't need to regain their sanity an alien, antiseptic environment whose implicit message is that they are irredeemable outcasts from humanity. And it insists that such institutions be replaced by just the oppositeintimate surroundings that tell the patient he is just like you or me, only more so. More precisely, what Dr. Bettelheim insists on is the model of the Orthogenic School of the University of Chicago a hospital that specializes in the treatment of autistic and severely schizophrenic children, which Dr. Bettelheim directed from 1944 until his retirement last year at the age of 70, and about which he has already written three books, Love Is Not Enough, Truants From Life and The Empty Fortress. In these books he dealt with the therapeutic techniques he applied at the Orthogenic School, and with case histories that illustrated them.

On the other hand, Mr. Jones said, there has been a significant increase in adult reading over the last two or three years. (We'll take any trend we can get.) This was accompanied by a decline in juvenile use of the library, attributable to the fact that there are fewer children in Muncie these days and also to the increased resources available in the schools. Other trends: the library is using more paperbacks than ever and the circulation of audiovisual materials has shot up markedly. The library hasn't been bothered by censorship groups, although the city's porn bookstore was closed by the police. It :s now back in business because the court threw the case out.

The finished rug may be about as interesting as a doormat or it may indeed be the genuine article, a carpet that flies.

us,Big Sky of Montana: Chet Huntley's Controversial Legacy,"FOR such a gigantic and controversial project as Big Sky, the late Chet Huntley's $25million, 10,647acre resort and recreation area in the mountainous wilds of western Montana, the weekend of March 22 seemed a strange time to stage a grand openingat the end of the ski season and months before summer Vacationers were due. Big Sky's ski lifts had started operating last Dec. 15, and there had been talk of using the present season to get the bugs out so that by next winter Big Sky of Montana, Inc. could burst on the map as the state's longawaited answer to Colorado's Aspen and Vail and Idaho's Sun Valley. But the managers had hastily arranged the opening, evidently with the hope that the ailing Chet Huntley, the 62yearold former broadcaster, could preside over the official flowering of the project to which he had lent the last years of his life. Although they denied it, they knew they were racing against time, for Huntley had undergone surgery ,for lung cancer in January and was taking weekly chemotherapy treatments. His title was chairman of the board of Big Sky, but in fact he was only the celebrity fronting for the five corporations that actually own the placeChrysler Realty, Northwest Orient Airlines, Burlington Northern Railroad, Continental Oil and Montana Power. attended corporation meetings, held a 1 per cent interest in Big Sky and owned a hideaway home on the property, but he had no daytoday functionwhich may have been unfortunate because he knew Montana, he knew what he wanted to make of Big Sky and he knew how the two might be fit together. When I had heard Huntley talk about Big Sky, I realized that because he really did have a lot. of Montana manure on his boots, his feeling for the development was much more genuine than that of the builders who were actually putting the place together. Huntley died on March 20, three days before opening. If he had had any reservation about Big Sky, about the course it was taking, about the contrast between the vision and the reality, he did not voice it publicly. That wasn't his job, not this time, and of course that confused a good many people because of his previous performance. In his years on radio and television, his comments on the course of the world and nation were avidly solicited. With his giant voice, he would cut through the puffery and humble the hucksters and buffoons of the world. But his job at Big Sky was different. His job was to have his photograph on all the Big Sky ads, to defend and promote the project,",1974-03-31T05:00:00+0000
