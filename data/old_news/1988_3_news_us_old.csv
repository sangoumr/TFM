But private forecasters said they still expected the economy to expand, though sluggishly, in the next few months. [ Page A1. ] Spending for construction fell 2.9 percent in January, the Government reported. It was the biggest drop in 10 months.

[ D1. ] The Macy offer for Federated is no better than Campeau's, investors seem to agree. Campeau is expected to carve up much of Federated if its bid wins, while an R. H. Macy-Federated combination would create the nation's biggest chain of fashion-oriented department stores. [ D1. ] The chairman of GAF offered to buy the company for $51 a share, or $1.4 billion, but all seven of GAF's independent directors said Samuel J. Heyman's revised offer was not high enough.

The floors are not very large and I am fairly handy, so I was thinking about sanding and refinishing the floors myself. Is this a project that can be done yourself, or should a professional be called in? A. If you do the job yourself you will have to rent a drum-type floor sander, plus a smaller disk sander for the edges.

For one jockey, it seems, the impulse proved irresistable. That, in the view of racing officials, was exactly what happened in the eighth race at Garden State Park Monday night when Armando Marquez found himself coming down to the wire with Julie Krone right by his side and threatening to beat him across the line. As it happened, Marquez did hold off Krone's challenge, but after reviewing the finish, the judges decided he hadn't done it in a very sporting way and placed Krone first. They said that just before the finish Marquez had grabbed her reins, slowing her charge. At a hearing later, Marquez, a 22-year-old Panamanian who lives in Philadelphia, said that his hands had accidentally become entangled in his rival's reins. The stewards didn't buy it.

us,"Dining Out Guide: 3-Star, Varied Cuisine","This is a summary of reviews of restaurants that have appeared in The New York Times. The date of original publication is listed after the phone number. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. THE FOUR SEASONS, 99 East 52d Street (754-9494) - (Nov. 22, 1985) For more than a quarter century, this venerable institution has pampered the elite and has managed to maintain standards of food quality and service that are paragons of the industry. The menu changes daily, but you might start with a terrine of pike and salmon; duck livers with apples and Calvados, or stuffed cabbage with pheasant. Entree options are duck au poivre; snapper baked in sea salt and pepper with two sauces; veal cutlet with ginger, and double lamb chops. Entrees $34 to $42.50. Pool Room: Fridays, noon to 2 P.M. and 5 to 11:15 P.M.; Saturdays. 5 to 11:15 P.M.; closed Sundays. GOTHAM BAR AND GRILL, 12 East 12th Street (620-4020) - (Oct. 4, 1985) The spacious and comfortable multi-tier dining room has a post-modern decor with pink marble bar, tall columns and parachute shades. The cooking approach is contemporary and frequently freewheeling, and the dishes are dazzling but rarely incongruent. You may be hard pressed to choose from the alluring appetizers: goat cheese ravioli with pancetta, tomato, shallots and an herbed chicken broth; squab salad with couscous, croutons and a curried vinaigrette, and a salad of curly, sharp Italian lettuce with Roquefort croutons and Caesar vinaigrette. Among the regular entrees are grilled salmon and artichokes a la grecque with spinach, tomato, olive oil, garlic and eggplant; grilled rack of lamb with flageolets, mustard and roasted garlic custard, and thin sliced venison with sauteed green apples, red onion compote and poivrade. Entrees $23 to $26. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 6 to 11:30 P.M. Saturdays, 6 to 11:30 P.M.; Sundays, 5:30 to 10 P.M. HATSUHANA, 17 East 48th Street (355-3345) - (Feb. 21, 1986) Cheerful dining rooms on two levels, each with elongated sushi bars flanked by rows of simple wooden tables, provide a suitable stage for the colorful production put on by the personable sushi chefs at this high-ranked Japanese restaurant. The menu is extensive, and with fish as fresh as this, some of the least elaborate presentations are the most appealing. Sushi and sashimi are the highlights of the menu, and a good way to get acquainted is to order the Hatsuhana special, which includes both raw fish specialties and tempura and grilled skewered fish. If you are feeling experimental, sample the tiny fried Japanese crabs. All the grilled teriyaki-style fish are highly recommended. Dinner entrees $18 to $29. Fridays, 11:45 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. and 5:30 to 10 P.M.; Saturdays, 5 to 10 P.M. MITSUKOSHI, 461 Park Avenue, at 57th Street (935-6444) - (March 8, 1985) This comfortable restaurant below a porcelain and pottery shop of the same name has three seating areas: the over-illuminated main dining room, the sushi bar and the private tatami rooms with a sunken well under the table. Excellent sushi and sashimi are available and it is fun to have them at the sushi bar; the basic platter is a vivid palette of contrasting tastes and textures - tuna rolls, tuna sashimi, salmon, salmon caviar roll, fluke, shrimp and a triangle of Japanese omelet, which should be eaten last. Other selections are dictated by market availability - from lightly smoked eel to a luxurious quail egg and sea urchin combination and wondrously sweet baby Gulf shrimp. Entrees $15 to $25. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 2 P.M. and 6 to 10 P.M. RIVER CAFE, 1 Water Street, Brooklyn (718-522-5200) - (July 25, 1986) With its stunning views of Manhattan and the East River, this restaurant would cause a slight rush of pulse in even the most jaded New Yorker. Besides the atmosphere, the kitchen offers some of the most provocative food to be found in the city. To start, you may choose from smoked salmon; sauteed quail and quail ravioli in soy and mushroom consomme, or chilled duck foie gras with dressed lentils and endive puree. Entree options are pan-roasted squab with corn risotto and confit of dates; salmon seared with ginger and cracked pepper with burgundy butter, salsify and leeks, and calf's liver with smoked kidneys and eggplant confit. You might want to save room for the parfait of banana praline and coffee with milk chocolate sauce. Dinner prix fixe $52. Fridays, noon to 2:30 P.M. and 7 P.M. to midnight; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 3 P.M. and 7 P.M. to midnight. HUBERTS, which received a 3-star rating on April 26, 1985, has closed at its previous address and plans to reopen on March 15 at 575 Park Avenue, at 63d Street.

us,"BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1988","COMPANIES Macy is expected to contest the legality of Campeau's latest tender offer for Federated Department Stores. The Macy strategy apparently will be to contend that the offer represents a new bid, not an amended proposal, and that it violates Federal laws and a Delaware anti-takeover statute. [ Page D1. ] A $1.1 billion bid for Koppers was made by Beazer, a British construction company. Koppers is a Pittsburgh-based road builder and manufacturer of construction materials. The offer was for $45 a share. Kopper's shares rose to $51.75, up $6.625. [ D1. ] Chrysler will not sell Acustar Inc., its parts-making unit, but will sell or close four plants, affecting about 2,000 workers. A sale had been strongly opposed by Chrysler's unions. [ D1. ] A new cable entertainment service is planned by Ted Turner, who has gained tentative approval of the plan from a number of cable operators. The eventual goal would be to provide original productions for cable. [ D1. ] USAir ordered 50 Boeing 737 jets and took options on 30 more in a deal that could total $2.4 billion. [ D4. ] K Mart is expected to announce its entry into wholesale clubs through a joint venture with SHV, a Dutch company. [ D4. ] Batus sweetened its tender offer for Farmers Group to $63 a share, or $4.5 billion. [ D4. ] Leading airlines raised fares for the second time in two weeks, reflecting unexpected strength in winter traffic. [ D4. ] THE ECONOMY Retailers reported unexpectedly slow sales for February, with a number of large chains posting declines for stores open more than a year. Analysts, while noting that the comparison was with a relatively strong February last year, still expressed concern. [ D1. ] Vehicle sales rose 25 percent in late February. For the month, sales of domestic vehicles were 15.9 percent higher, while sales of imported vehicles fell 4.4 percent. Detroit's heavy discounting received most of the credit for the strong results. [ D5. ] A Senate panel's compromise on a landmark banking bill is expected to help secure its passage in the full Senate this spring. But strong opposition is likely in the House. [ D2. ] The Fed's chairman advocated two changes in the tax system. Alan Greenspan told Congress that he favored the imposition of consumption taxes and a reduction in the capital gains tax. [ D5. ] Nonfarm productivity improved last year by 0.9 percent, just half as much as in 1986, according to revised figures. [ D5. ] MARKETS The stock market had a mixed day, dominated by takeover activity. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.80 points, to 2,063.49, but other indexes had gains. [ D8. ] Bond prices were little changed in light activity as many traders waited for fresh data on the economy. [ D15. ] The dollar held steady in trading described as the lightest in more than a year. Gold fell to $428.20 an ounce, down $2.05, in New York. [ D16. ] Cattle futures were down amid reports of a packinghouse closing. [ D16. ] The New York Stock Exchange named a new president, Richard A. Grasso, who has been in charge of automated trading. The current president, Robert J. Birnbaum, is retiring. [ D4. ] INTERNATIONAL Mexico accepted $3.67 billion in bids from foreign banks in its innovative program to swap debt for bonds. [ D5. ] Chip makers are pressing for more sanctions against Japan. An industry group said sales of American computer chips in Japan last year fell $200 million short of agreed-upon levels.

Adjustable rates are attractive to first-time home buyers as well as trade-up buyers because of the initial low rate.

In that case, the borrower has to qualify on the basis of his or her ability to pay the higher second-year interest rate. Listed are the most common types of mortgages and average rates.

The position could become a complication in talks on a withdrawal of Soviet troops. Page 1 Panama ordered all banks to close ''until the supply of dollar bills can be regularized.'' The move was intended to avoid a run on deposits that would force banks into insolvency and trigger a general financial collapse. 1 A treasure hunt in the Philippines has aroused controversy and speculation. Government officials say they are skeptical, but will be happy to accept their share if any treasure is unearthed. 1 A new package of aid for the contras will be fashioned by a bipartisan group of five Senators by building on elements of the $30.8 million plan defeated by the House on Thursday. 3 Ending his Middle East trip, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that he had delivered letters containing the American negotiating plan to the leaders of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Egypt. 5 Israel sought to bar journalists from the entire occupied West Bank for the first time. The Israeli move was imposed under longstanding rules permitting army officers to declare any area a closed military zone. 5 News analysis: A Mexican bond swap was a bold attempt to solve the third-world debt crisis, critics agree. But many bankers are accusing Morgan Guaranty Trust and the United States Treasury of bungling the plan. 35 Soviet Union riots killed 31 people in the southern Soviet city of Sumgait, Moscow reported. The press agency Tass said members of various nationalities, including women and old men, were among the victims. 28 Sandinistas go on the political offensive 3 Hong Kong journal: Demands for democracy 4 Mediator reports major gains at Afghan talks 4 Kissinger urged Israel to ban TV reports of unrest 5 NATIONAL 6-8, 32-33, 50 The U.S unemployment rate eased one-tenth of a point in February to 5.6 percent, the lowest level in eight and a half years, the Labor Department reported. 1 A Federal law on women contractors that classifies them as minority-group members in the awarding of highway construction bids has triggered a bitter protest in Chicago and threatens to pit women against racial minorities. 1 Warning labels have proliferated on various products. But there is little evidence that they have much effect on consumers' behavior, or that they reduce the liability risks or insurance premiums for businesses. 1 An increase in postage rates that would raise the cost of a first-class stamp to 25 cents from 22 cents was approved by by a Presidential advisory panel. The United States Postal Service is expected to accept the recommendations. 6 The hazards of space flight have been assessed by many groups in the space agency, but the agency's efforts are fragmented and lack objective measures for evaluating the risks, a new report said. 32 Nancy Reagan's mastectomy lat October was discussed by the First Lady in an interview. Mrs. Reagan said that she made the right choice in having her whole breast removed, rather than just the lump. Her decision has been widely criticized. 6 A meeting on racism at Dartmouth ended a week of anti-racism events at the college, where a disciplinary hearing is to be held today for four white students accused of harassing a black professor. 7 Northwest Airlines faulted on safety 6 Arizona aide tells about threat 50 Politics 8 Are there any issues out there? The 1988 Presidential campaign has produced few that seperate the candidates. A New York Times/CBS News survey suggests how little the candidates' own messages have penetrated with some voters. 8 Vice President Bush led the polls in South Carolina as his three Republican rivals spent the day crisscrossing the state in search of support in the last primary leading up to Super Tuesday. 8 Robertson may drop libel suit 8 REGIONAL 29-32 Unemployment in the New York area fell last month to the lowest level in almost 18 years. But Mayor Koch warned that consequences of the October stock-market collapse might yet undermine the city's economy. 1 Two more men were arrested in the slaying of a rookie New York City police officer who was guarding the South Jamaica, Queens, home of a man who had complained about drug dealing in his neighborhood. 1 Two other suspects in the shooting, Todd Scott and Scott Cobb, apparently have managed to swagger through the criminal justice system like they do the streets of southeast Queens, where the police say they are low-level dealers. 31 45 E.M.S. workers were dismissed by the Koch administration after a one-day job action in which almost half the technicians and paramedics who were scheduled for duty called in sick during two shifts. 29 A lawyer for Larry Davis and the Bronx District Attorney differed sharply on whether Mr. Davis's acquittal in the slayings of four suspected drug dealers would help him at his next trial, where he faces charges stemming from a shoot-out with the police. 31 The Long Island Power Authority, the state agency considering a takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, said that it would soon begin taking the steps necessary to win control of the utility. 29 Many people live on the streets in New York City because they decide to avoid the shelter network. The decision is complex, according to interviews with homeless people and their advocates. 29 In a lawsuit over psychiatric wards, an advocacy group contends that New York City hospitals were illegally turning away mentally ill people.

Where can we find out about such tours? - S. S., Bethesda, Md. Answer:Japan's well-developed tourist industry offers many opportunities for tours on the island of Honshu and elsewhere. However, the tour companies' programs, of one to several days, do not attempt to cover the whole of the 800-mile-long, diversified island on one trip. The visitor should study the bus and train tours available and perhaps fit two or three of them together. An alternative is to take a tour that concentrates on one area of Honshu, like Tohoku, the northeastern district, or the Inland Sea section. Another option is to buy a seven-day rail pass, which could be used for swift, independent travel around the island on bullet trains, with travelers booking their own accommodations.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

''Zions Cause'' is an anecdotal tale of a Kentucky hamlet over 30 years. But the real story is about time and mortality, human failing and strength. The residents of Zion are kissing kin to those in Grover's Corners, N.H., and Winesburg, Ohio: scandal and idiosyncrasy flourish here as thick as weeds. These Bible-quoters and churchgoers are afflicted with weak consciences and strong wills - and too often predictably so. But the elegiac voice of the narrator, Jim, a reflective loner who has grown up and become a lawyer by the end of the book, is sure. A man digs a deep hole in the ground and sits in it to the amazement of his neighbors (''It beat anything I ever saw,'' says Jim's guardian; ''it was maybe like death, if death is, as it says somewhere, a place of utter peace''); an angry man so short he has to look up to his 10-year-old son tries to catch an enormous fish with his hands and encounters fate (''He had gone to meet it, leaving that boy on the bank to wait alone through the long, uneasy silence stretching on and on above the water motionless as a dirty windowpane until that parted scum, like man's last and ultimate sheet, met and covered it''). When his narrator falls in love, however, the author stumbles into a swamp of cliches. Still, it's not surprising that several of Jim Peyton's plays have been produced on television and the stage. Mr. Peyton doesn't write so much for the eye as for the ear.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

At first glance, the photograph on the jacket of ''Manhattan Water-Bound'' seems at odds with the title. Why would a book about the waterfront feature an aerial view dominated less by the water than by the land? It requires a closer look (as do many of the maps in the book) to get the point: unbeknown to most Manhattanites, their waterfront, however underused, is never far away, and one of the last great hopes for opening it to the public lies in the vacant West Side tract (prominent in the jacket photograph) where Donald Trump hopes to build Trump City. This book by Ann L. Buttenwieser, an urban planner, takes a scholarly look at waterfront development in America. Focusing on Manhattan, she traces the historic clash between commerce and recreation as government officials and private developers expanded the borough's borders into surrounding rivers to accommodate growing population and industry. Even with the public's recent rediscovery of the waterfront, she cautions that much of Manhattan will continue to be bound more by a wall of concrete than by water if many pending plans for residential and commercial projects are approved. ''Manhattan Water-Bound,'' heavily annotated and sprinkled with anecdotes, provides a valuable perspective on current development.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

If you're a squat pudgy sexist approaching middle age with little to look forward to and less to forget, Paul Erdman's sixth novel is a fairy tale written for you. It's about Danny Lehman's conversion from a nebbish in Philly to a wheeler-dealer in Vegas. At the start, he owns a shabby coin shop and whoops it up with bowling and bagels. Then, in a hop, a skip and a jump, he builds a bullion empire that out-Deaks Deak International, takes a pair of hoods to the cleaners after laundering their money, picks up a couple of casinos (the Palace is one of them), and even gets involved in a leveraged buy out. By the end, he has amassed almost as much money as a Hunt brother could lose, and left every woman around him weak-kneed. He's not much to look at but, as a stewardess observes in Mr. Erdman's embarrassing prose, ''he would be one hell of a lot of fun in the sack.'' Needless to say, Danny isn't exactly Gloria Steinem's idea of Mr. Right. Or Horatio Alger's. What's the secret of his success? Good financial advisers: a bartender, a Hollywood sharpie and a six-foot prostitute with a heart of gold. So the plot is far-fetched, but who wants reality? If you have enough reality in your life, ''The Palace'' isn't exactly the worst way to escape. It certainly beats tequila or television. But Danny wouldn't be caught dead reading it. ''After all, you could hardly make any money while reading, could you?'' he asks. ''So why waste the time?''",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Her lucid and nimble style targets the reader who can take a reference to Eddie Murphy in one sentence and ''Giselle'' in the next. She has been writing for The New Yorker for the past 15 years, and ''Sight Lines'' is her third book of collected reviews. It chronicles the period from 1981 to 1987. This was an odd and, in many respects, a bleak time, with the death of George Balanchine in 1983, a lack of innovative choreography and the decline of the international stars who had made dance so exciting in the 70's. If this collection does not have the power of her first or second, it is because by and large what Ms. Croce got to see was not so compelling. And when she disapproves she can be downright nasty, as in her appraisal of a short male dancer at the New York City Ballet whose outstretched leg had the impact of a ''fully extended finger.'' She goes straight for the jugular when something strikes her as false - Pina Bausch makes women ''look worse on the stage than any misogynist ever has'' -but at times her enthusiasms for some post-modern choreographers slip the leash and run wild. Her writing, though, is often poetic: ''The waltz, with its three-beat phrase, makes a drama of balance. Weight is continually suspended, as if it could somehow be abolished, leaving us free to float. The tango, in four beats, offers no such incentive to keep moving. As an image of destiny, it is tragic rather than poignant, a dance in which we confront our mortality, luxuriate in it, but do not transcend it.''",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"FAST LANES, by Jayne Anne Phillips. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $5.95.) Unlike the selections in her first collection of short fiction, ''Black Tickets,'' many of these stories of dispossessed drifters are unfocused and even a bit cliched, Jay McInerney said here last year. But in the best of them, such as ''Bluegill,'' in which a young woman engages in a monologue with her unborn child, ''events have a dreamlike inevitability.'' THE SECRET HOUSE: 24 Hours in the Strange and Unexpected World in Which We Spend Our Nights and Days, by David Bodanis. (Touchstone/Simon & Schus-ter, $9.95.) Viewed microscopically, the author shows, even the most suburban home teems with disgusting creatures, such as the 2 million mites that inhabit a typical double bed, living on tiny flakes of skin. Yet a penicillin mold on a slice of Cheddar cheese (pictured) can appear as beautiful as some imagined extraterrestrial garden. In 1986, K. C. Cole said in The Times that this picture-filled book is ''nothing short of astounding.'' It ''zooms in relentlessly on the mundane matters of modern life, proving once again that the difference between the ordinary and the exotic is only your point of view.'' FAMILY RESEMBLANCES, by Lowry Pei. (Vintage, $6.95.) Exiled for a summer with her eccentric young aunt, a 15-year-old girl learns that love stories don't often have happy endings. Lowry Pei's ''clean, limpid, almost translucent prose renders the perfect plot . . . all but invisible,'' Lee Smith said here in 1986, ''as small events build to genuine suspense.'' KAISHA: The Japanese Corporation, by James C. Abegglen and George Stalk Jr. (Basic, $12.95.) After working in Tokyo, the authors conclude that it is not Zenlike management styles that have led to Japanese corporate success but sheer aggressiveness. In 1985, our reviewer, Nicholas D. Kristof, praised the authors for going beyond ''dark conspiracy theories or giddy paeans.'' ''Like most things created in Japan, this book is sturdy, well designed and a good buy.'' SUMMERTIME, by Maureen McCoy. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $6.95.) The mother, wife and daughter of a man dying of leukemia spend a summer awaiting the inevitable. Last year, Emily Listfield said here that the novel ''has a cumulative power, and in the end an overriding optimism - reasoned, sanded down by the necessary compromises, but optimism nonetheless - that is moving.'' MORTAL SPLENDOR: The American Empire in Transition, by Walter Russell Mead. (Houghton Mifflin, $9.95.) By extending the liberal vision and insisting on decent working conditions for third world laborers, the author argues, the United States would not only be morally right but would also serve its own economic interest. This book ''should be required study for Democratic Presidential candidates and their staffs,'' Randall Rothenberg said here last year. A WORLD OF LOVE, by Elizabeth Bowen. (Penguin, $5.95.) With the careful prose that is her trademark, Elizabeth Bowen tells what happens when an Irish girl discovers a batch of old love letters in a run-down country house. ''Miss Bowen's powers are at their summit,'' A. S. Morris said here in 1955. ''She is interested in the outward and unexceptional as it must, if carefully observed, illuminate the hidden and particular.'' HEALTH AND HEALING, by Andrew Weil. (Houghton Mifflin, $8.95.) After studying a range of alternative therapies, a Harvard-trained physician concluded that most important to success is that patient and practitioner have faith in the cure. In 1984, our reviewer, Gerald Weissmann, said the ''amiable, open-minded guide [ is ] sympathetic, but not uncritical.'' HEARTBREAK HOTEL, by Gabrielle Burton. (Penguin, 6.95.) The residents of the Heartbreak Hotel in Buffalo work at the Museum of the Revolution, which displays miniskirts, Barbie dolls and other examples of sexist oppression. ''Reading this novel is like watching a boisterous, surrealistic three-ring circus on the theme of being a woman in America,'' Brett Harvey said here in 1986. ''Women readers in particular will roar and cringe with recognition, and many will be swept up in Gabrielle Burton's triumphant vision.'' TONE DEAF AND ALL THUMBS? An Invitation to Music-Making, by Frank R. Wilson. (Vintage, $6.95.) Using his expertise as a neurologist and late-blooming amateur pianist, Frank R. Wilson analyzes the brain and the muscular system and explores the biology of timing, rhythm and tempo, concluding that it is never too late to learn. In 1986, our reviewer, Robert J. Lurtsema, said the book was obscure in places but, on balance, ''thought-provoking and valuable to both the novice and the accomplished musician.'' REINDEER MOON, by Elizabeth Marshall Thomas. (Pocket Books, $4.50.) Written by an anthropologist, this first novel tells of an adolescent girl's life in a Siberian clan 20,000 years ago. Last year, our reviewer, Gay Andrews Dillin, called the book ''entrancing.'' It ''illuminates our path back into the distant past, allowing us to see it with new understanding.'' WOMEN OF THE LEFT BANK: Paris, 1900-1940, by Shari Benstock. (University of Texas, $12.95.) Reversing what has been conventionally accepted as foreground and background, Shari Benstock argues that Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Jean Rhys, Djuna Barnes and other members of their Parisian literary community were as important to the development of modern literature as T. S. Eliot, James Joyce and Ezra Pound. ''Modernism as we will understand it for a long time to come will be defined by [ this ] book,'' one reviewer said in 1987.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Its central conflict is between Bodie Woodard, a shy, sensitive introvert who opposes the war, and his twin brother, Harmon, a swaggering macho go-getter who supports it. As Harmon gears up to go fight and Bodie struggles to decide whether to flee to Canada, Harmon's sweet-natured wife, Darlene, prepares to deliver a child that Harmon suspects is really Bodie's. Acting as a kind of barnyard chorus to the present-tense narration is the twins' grandfather Leon, a seventh-generation farmer who delivers soliloquies to his dead wife in a kind of rustic prose poetry. One of Leon's fingers has been lost to a pulpwood saw, but his others have ''chopped and tinkered and mended, planted, reaped and brought into being the web of life around him.'' Harmon and Bodie, both master carpenters, are also menders and fixers, and their work processes are meticulously described, often as displacements of terrible events and emotions. Mr. Metz, an architect who lives in New Hampshire, captures these simple people and their remote environment with loving care, from details like the smell of Leon's chewing gum to a lyric vision of little girls sprinkling fireflies from Mason jars. The brief Vietnam scenes are harrowing, communicating directly the tragic sense of waste that is implied elsewhere in the novel. The problem with ''Catamount Bridge,'' though, is that Mr. Metz tends to explain his own symbols and symmetries, as well as set up characters who too neatly embody virtues, types and political opinions. His prose is admirably clear, but it's also a bit too tidy and schematic to deliver the power it systematically accumulates.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

us,CUTTING CORNERS,"FOR YEARS, I WAS A ''pe-riphery shopper,'' buying only fresh produce, meat and dairy products that lined market walls. Occasionally, I navigated up and down the aisles displaying staples and frozen foods, adding imported canned tomatoes, orange juice concentrate and ice cream to my basket. But I was convinced that just about anything made from scratch was best. In recent years, however, I've relaxed a bit, and have discovered a good number of excellent convenience foods that, when combined with fresh foods, do not compromise the quality of a dish. They simply make the cooking process easier and quicker. Furthermore, some vegetables and fruits that are flash-frozen at the peak of their season are far more flavorful - and less expensive -than fresh but out-of-season produce. Fresh green peas, for example, are often mealy, waxy and almost devoid of flavor in all but a few short weeks in summer. Willa Gelber, a partner with her husband-chef, Karl Dauner, in Custom Cuisine, a Manhattan catering firm, uses tiny frozen peas and kernels of corn to add color and flavor to a rich risotto served with a stuffed capon breast. Chasing down costly out-of-season ingredients simply does not make good business sense, she says.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

In OSCAR WILDE'S LONDON: A Scrapbook of Vices and Virtues, 1880-1900 (Anchor/Doubleday, $24.95), an engaging social history of late Victorian London, Wolf Von Eckardt, Sander L. Gilman and J. Edward Chamberlin talk at length about Wilde, though always in the context of the city where he lived. (Mr. Von Eckardt and Mr. Gilman are the authors of ''Bertolt Brecht's Berlin,'' and Mr. Chamberlin has written another book on Wilde and his times, ''Ripe Was the Drowsy Hour.'') Fin de siecle London, they tell us, was a time of startling contrasts. While William Morris was espousing the virtues of hand craftsmanship, new technology was bringing the city its first telephones and electric lights. And though a third of the working-class population lived in abject poverty, wealthy West Enders - Wilde among them - enjoyed the opulence of London's yearly social season. Opium dens, public houses, child pornography and prostitution flourished side by side with the temperance societies and child-rescue leagues that opposed them. The authors' inclusion of diary excerpts and period journalism lends an immediacy to this portrait of an era caught between romanticism and change, decadence and social reform. They discuss everything from Victorian art to the changing map of London and the resurgent interest in the occult. If at times they are guilty of highlighting the sensational, the wealth of extraordinary photographs, illustrations, cartoons and paintings they provide more than compensates.

Mr. Spoor, now 65 years old, earned a reputation for brusque management while presiding over a 12-year period of rapid growth at Pillsbury, but took an early retirement in 1985. He was replaced by John M. Stafford, then a 48-year-old executive whose affable manner was expected to result in a calmer executive corps and higher profits. But Mr. Stafford, who resigned last week, was not up to making the necessary tough decisions, according to Wall Street analysts, and in 1987 he presided over the company's first earnings decline in 16 years.

Assata Shakur is something of a folk hero to a number of blacks, even those who would not follow a revolutionary to the next block. She is Assata to them and to her fellow activists of the 1970's, a woman whose worst crime may have been being black and militant. But she remains JoAnne Chesimard to law-enforcement officials, a convicted cop killer, a prison escapee and a fugitive. In this deftly written book of autobiography and poetry, Ms. Shakur, now 40 years old and living in Cuba, traces her transformation from a carefree middle-class girl in Queens to a revolutionary woman who would not shy away from violence but who says she did not commit the crimes with which she was charged in the 1970's. ''Before i was ten, i could recognize a Van Gogh on sight, and i knew what cubism, surrealism, and abstract expressionism were,'' she writes. By her early 20's she was equally a connoisseur of jails: ''They have a smell unlike any smell on earth. Like blood and sweat and feet and open sores and, if misery has a smell, like misery.'' The book's abrupt shifts in time can annoy after a while, as can the liberties she takes with spelling - ''court,'' ''America'' and ''Rockefeller,'' for example, become ''kourt,'' ''amerika'' and ''Rockafella.'' But, all in all, the author provides a spellbinding tale that evokes mixed feelings in the way the autobiographies of Malcolm X, Sonny Carson and Claude Brown did in years past.",1988-03-06T05:00:00+0000

Registered independents can vote in either primary in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and in the Republican primary in North Carolina.

The 24-year-old Steiner, who retires with eight World Cup race victories and two slalom crowns, outdueled Corinne Schmidhauser of Switzerland in a treacherous competition that saw most of the other favorites fall in the first run. Schmidhauser, who was initially awarded second place, was disqualified for missing a gate in the second heat. The disqualification gave Austria a sweep of the top three places. Steiner was only third-fastest in the second run with a time of 37.45 seconds. But with the second- and third-place finishers in the initial heat falling in the second run, she had a cushion to work with. Steiner finished with an aggregate time of 1 minute 16.42 seconds. Her teammates, Anita Wachter and Monika Maierhofer, finished second and third, respectively, in 1:17.05 and 17.32. Steiner's victory was worth 25 points, and vaulted her from fifth in the slalom standing to first with 87 points. The previous standing leader, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, with 80 points, was sidelined for the season on Friday after suffering a knee injury in an aborted downhill race.(AP) Horse Racing King's Swan Rules: King's Swan took the lead from Matthews Keep in the stretch yesterday and went on to a five-length victory in the $110,000 Grey Lag Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Aqueduct. King's Swan, ridden by Jose Santos, carried the high weight of 130 pounds. Palace March was runner-up ahead of Matthews Keep and Mr. Classic. It was the fourth consecutive victory for King's Swan. He had won the Stymie, Assault and Aqueduct handicaps in his three previous starts. The 8-year-old gelding went a mile and one-eighth on the fast track in 1:50 3/5 to earn $66,000 for Alvin Akman. He paid $3.80 for $2 to win as the favorite. Track and Field West German Loses Medal: Carlo Thraenhardt of West Germany, holder of the world indoor high-jump record, was stripped yesterday of a bronze medal won Saturday at the European indoor track and field championships in Budapest, for leaving the arena without permission. The decision to throw out Thraenhardt's third-place finish followed a protest by the Rumanian team immediately after the high-jump competition Saturday at Budapest Sports Hall. Yesterday's ruling gave Sorin Matei of Rumania the bronze medal. Matei jumped 7 feet 8 1/2 inches, as Thraenhardt did, but took one jump more than the West German to clear that height. The event was won by Patrik Sjoeberg of Sweden, the defending titleholder, with 7-10. The Olympic champion Dietmar Mogenburg of West Germany took the silver. After exceeding the 30-second regulation during his first attempt at 7-6 1/2 Saturday, Thraenhardt, who holds the world indoor record of 7-11 1/4, packed his gear and stormed out of the arena without authority when the jump was disallowed by the judges. He explained that his concentration had been disturbed by a clash on the track during a men's 3,000-meter race, and also said he was impeded by one of the high-jump officials. Thraenhardt agreed to return to the competition after consultation with his coach. In competition yesterday, Linford Christie of Britain failed in his attempt to become the first man to win the 60-meter and 200-meter double at these championships, which date to 1970. Christie finished third behind Nikolay Razgonov of the Soviet Union and Nikolay Antonov of Bulgaria. (AP) Ski Jumping Nykaenen Sweeps: Matti Nykaenen of Finland completed a weekend sweep when he captured the 90-meter hill jump yesterday at the annual Lahti Ski Games in Finland. Nykaenen, who won three gold medals at the Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, had finished first in the 70-meter hill event Saturday. Yesterday, Nykaenen jumped 111 meters and 103 meters, which gave him 208.4 points, compared with 205.5 points for Jan Boklov of Sweden. With his two victories over the weekend, Nykaenen amassed 50 World Cup points to increase his lead to more than 100 points over Pavel Ploc of Yugoslavia.(AP) Speed Skating Title for Flaim: Eric Flaim of the United States was declared the winner of the world men's speed-skating championships at Alma Ata in the Soviet Union yesterday after finishing fourth in a 10,000-meter race, which was won by the Dutch skater Leo Visser, the Tass press agency reported. Another American skater, Dave Silk, had won the 1,500-meter race earlier in the day, but fell during the final event and finished in 11th place. Silk was third in the overall standing, and Visser was second. (AP) A First and 3 Seconds for Jansen: Dan Jansen of the United States won one race and was runner-up in three others at Savalen, Norway, to top the World Cup point standing after a weekend speed-skating sprint meet. Jansen is in first in the 500-meter standing with 177 points. He is followed by the Olympic champion, Uwe-Jens Mey of East Germany, who has 175, and Jan Ykema of the Netherlands with 152 points. Jansen also leads in the 1,000-meter standing with 102 points, 2 ahead of Ykema and 4 ahead of Nick Thometz of the United States. Jansen won the first 500-meter race on Saturday in 37.68 seconds. Ykema won the second 500-meter race yesterday in 37.86, followed by Jansen in 37.91, Thometz in 37.97 and Mey in 38.05. Thometz won yesterday's 1,000-meter race in 1 minute 17.49 seconds followed by Jansen in 1:17.74 and Ykema in 1:17.76. Ykema won the first 1,000-meter race on Saturday in 1:17.82, followed by Jansen in 1:17.94 and Thometz in third place in 1:18.36.(AP) Road Running Five-Mile Run to McKenzie: Mark McKenzie of Scotch Church, N.Y., who covered the course in 25 minutes 33 seconds, won the New York Road Runners Club's 27th annual Bob Preston Memorial five-mile run in Central Park yesterday. Katharine Young of the Atlanta Track Club won the women's title in 29:57. Auto Racing 3d Straight for Bonnett: Neil Bonnett took the lead 20 laps from the finish and charged to his third victory in as many weeks, taking yesterday's Goodwrench 500 Nascar stock-car race at the North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham. Bonnett won a Winston Cup event two weeks ago in Richmond, Va., and followed that with a triumph last Sunday in an all-star race in Australia. Lake Speed was second yesterday, and Sterling Marlin barely held off Alan Kulwicki to take third. (AP) Marathon Record Set in Los Angeles: Martin Mondragon of Mexico broke away in the last mile to win the Los Angeles Marathon yesterday in a record-breaking time of 2 hours 10 minutes 19 seconds. Mondragon, competing as part of Mexico's Olympic trials, broke the course record of 2:12:59 set in 1986 by Ric Sayer of Ashland, Ore. Blanca Jaime of Mexico City won the women's competition in 2:36:10. (AP) Show Jumping Best Wins on Santos: Greg Best of Flemington, N.J., and Santos, an 11-year-old German-bred gelding, won the Cadillac Grand Prix of Palm Beach yesterday at the Palm Beach (Fla.) Polo Club. Twelve of 50 entries qualified for a timed jumpoff by riding without penalty over the 17-jump 579-yard first-round course. The United States Olympic veteran Michael Matz of Collegeville, Pa., took an early jumpoff lead on Chef, finishing the six-jump 293-yard jumpoff course in 34.091 seconds. Matz's lead held for eight rides until Louis Jacobs of East Aurora, N.Y., rode without a fault on Manuel in 33.426 seconds to take the lead. The final entry was Best, the 1987 champion, who rode Santos to a clean ride in 32.473 seconds. It was Best's sixth career grand-prix victory and his first on Santos.",1988-03-07T05:00:00+0000

In a verbal strafing of the Mets' clubhouse that will appear in the upcoming issue of Esquire magazine, Straw identifies Davey Johnson, Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter, Lenny Dystra and Wally Backman as the primary culprits for last year's second-place finish.

Redington left the town on the Kuskokwim River after staying just over four hours to feed and rest his 14 dogs. He is known as the Father of the Iditarod, a race he helped create 16 years ago but has never won. Redington arrived in McGrath, 410 miles into the race, about four hours ahead of Herbie Nayokpuk. Behind them were Jan Masek of Anchorage in third, and Joe Garnie of Teller in fourth. Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie took their layovers early in the race. That turned out to be a successful strategy, because a pack of about 20 leading mushers later bogged down in new snow. As those mushers took their 24-hour layover at the Rohn Roadhouse, they watched helplessly as Redington, Nayokpuk and Garnie sailed past on the smooth trail the former leaders had packed.(AP)",1988-03-10T05:00:00+0000

That line -wholly in character for Stanley and yet a classic expression of tragedy's inexorable pull - sets off what is still among the most shocking acts of human destruction the American stage has known. In the collision of Stanley, the working-class stiff, and Blanche, the frayed Southern belle, Tennessee Williams gave life to forces that run far deeper than his play's specific place (New Orleans) and sociological context (the postwar 1940's). ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' is not a morality tale about a brutal man victimizing a frail woman but a terrifying plunge into the madness that afflicts anyone, male or female, brute or sensitive, who submits to his own personal executioner - the passion so incendiary that it consumes the self.",1988-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The question concerned the age of Dunigan, a former Edmonton Eskimos quarterback who abandoned the Canadian Football League and signed a minor league contract as an outfielder with the Expos on Wednesday. The Expos issued a news release stating that last year's outstanding offensive C.F.L. player was 25 years old. C.F.L. news media guides and city records in Lakewood, Ohio, where Dunigan was born, show his birthdate as Dec. 6, 1960, which would make him 27. Dunigan insisted he was 25. ''I was born in 1962,'' said Dunigan, a former Louisiana Tech University quarterback who led the Eskimos to the Grey Cup. ''Either way, I feel like I'm 21. If it doesn't bother the Expos, it doesn't bother me.'' Dan Duquette, the Expos' farm director, said Dunigan's age wasn't a factor.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"N.H.L. Flyers 5, Capitals 2: Brian Propp scored two goals last night as Philadelphia broke Washington's five-game winning streak with a victory at home. The triumph moved the Flyers back into first place in the Patrick Division. The Flyers, who began play tied with the Islanders a point behind Washington, broke a three-game losing streak and also celebrated the return of Tim Kerr, who made his first appearance since last April 24. Kerr, a center, had been sidelined by a shoulder injury that required five operations. Propp's second goal came at 8 minutes 28 seconds of the final period on a power play and gave the Flyers a 4-2 lead. He fired a slap shot past Clint Malarchuk, the Capitals' goalie, from the right faceoff circle.(AP) Kings 3, Bruins 3: Bernie Nicholls scored his second goal of the game on a power play with five seconds remaining in the third period to give Los Angeles the tie in Boston. The Bruins had taken a 3-2 lead just 54 seconds earlier when Bob Joyce, who played on the Canadaian Olympic team, tipped in Glen Wesley's shot from the point for his third National Hockey League goal. Boston held a 2-1 lead after the first period, but Nicholls tied the score 2-2 at 15:25 when he interecepted a clearing pass and fired the puck into an open net with Reggie Lemelin, the Boston goalie, out of position. The point for the tie gave Los Angeles a 7-point lead over the Vancouver Canucks in the race for the fourth and final playoff berth in the Smythe Division. Boston is second in the Adams Division, 6 points behind the Montreal Canadiens. (AP) Red Wings 5, Canucks 2: Dave Barr scored twice to lead Detroit handed the visiting Canucks a record-tying ninth consecutive loss. The Canucks' losing streak tied a club mark initially set in 1975 and matched in 1984. Rick Zombo, a Detroit defenseman, scored his second goal of the season 36 seconds into the final period to snap a 2-2 tie as the Red Wings ran their unbeaten N.H.L. streak to six games. Vancouver played without Coach Bob McCammon, who was given a five-game suspension by league officials following an incident in a game earlier this week against the Islanders. Vancouver's David Bruce scored late in the second period to tie the score but Zombo took a pass from Gerard Gallant inside the Vancouver blue line and fired a slap shot past Steve Weeks, the goalie, to put Detroit ahead to stay. Jeff Sharples and Barr added goals 2:11 apart later in the period. It was Weeks's debut with Vancouver since he was acquired from Hartford earlier this week.(AP) CYCLING American Wins Third Leg: Andy Hampsten of the United States broke away from a small group in the final kilometers yesterday to win the third leg of the Paris-Nice race, beating Sean Kelly of Ireland by 27 seconds. Sean Yates of Britain held the overall lead of the race, which ends Sunday. Hampsten, riding for La Vie Clair, finished fourth in the Tour de France in 1986 but switched to the American team 7-Eleven last year and dropped out of the top rankings, although he did win the last two Tours of Switzerland.(AP) NORDIC SKIING Utah Strengthens Lead: Utah, bolstered by a strong performance from its men's cross-country team, widened its lead over Vermont yesterday at the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in Hancock, Vt. Per Jakobsen of Colorado won the race in 34 minutes 18.4 seconds. But three Utah skiers placed in the top 10 to give the Utes 331 total points to Vermont's 299 after two days of the four-day competition. Utah and Wyoming tied for first in men's cross-country. In the women's race, Utah placed second to Vermont. Brenda White of Vermont, an Alpine skier who switched to cross-country, won the women's 10-kilometer race in 27:12.9.(AP) Double Victory for Norway: Norwegians scored a double biathlon triumph yesterday when Elin Kristiansen won the women's 10-kilometer individual event and Gisle Fenne won the men's 20-kilometer event at the World Cup races in Holmenkollen, Norway. Kristiansen, 19 years old, runner-up in the world championships in France a week ago, shot clean and beat the World Cup leader, Nedezda Alekseyeva of Bulgaria, by 46.8 seconds. Despite two misses on targets, and two minutes added to his racing time, Fenne was so fast that he beat Sergei Antonov of the Soviet Union by 1.2 seconds. It was Fenne's first World Cup victory. Frank-Peter Roetsch of East Germany, a double Olympic champion, and Valery Medvedtsev, who won a silver medal for the Soviet Union, were not entered.

Yitzhak Shamir sharply renounced the plan two days before leaving on a crucial visit to Washington. 1 Yasir Arafat demanded a direct role for the P.L.O. in any international conference on the Middle East and rejected a U.S. proposal for indirect representation through a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. 1 The P.L.O.'s observer mission to the United Nations must close within 10 days or the U.S. will go to Federal Court to close it, the Reagan Administration said in a letter to the P.L.O.'s chief observer. 4 New economic sanctions on Panama were imposed by President Reagan in the latest move in an effort to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. The steps include withholding a payment of nearly $7 million. 1 The lack of cash in Panama is strangling the country's economy. One week after Gen. Noriega ordered all banks closed, businesses and individuals are scrambling to survive. Some workers are paid in food. 6 Concern for Lisbon's slums is growing. Government officials hope membership in the European Community will mean money for redevelopment of neighborhoods like Alfama, the oldest part of a city that is showing its age. 4 Afghan refugees in Hangu, Pakistan, are uncertain when they will be able to return home, but are ready.

us,Guidepost,"Staying Dry Spring showers bring out raincoats and umbrellas. But which ones will keep you driest? While raindrops roll off water-repellent fabric in a light rain, the material won't prevent a soaking in a downpour. Water-repellent material is better at keeping raindrops out of the fibers. Waterproof gear like slickers and rubber boots is coated or laminated to provide complete protection. Rainwear can have its resistance restored by most dry cleaners. Treatment for a cotton trench coat, for example, costs $9.50 to $12 in New York City. Clothing made of untreated fibers may also be treated for rain, either by a dry cleaner or at home with a fluorocarbon- or silicone-based spray. Here is a guide to how some garments stand up to showers.

But recent data suggest strongly that this is a minimum requirement. Optimal health benefits require, I believe, three times more exercise. And though there is no evidence that more than three hours of aerobic exertion weekly is beneficial for health and longevity, there is certainly no evidence that additional exercise is harmful. In fact, many people find very high exercise levels to be personally rewarding.

Then the stuff we threw away our stuff in: One plastic one-gallon storage bag and a tie Three plastic 13-gallon garbage bags and ties Four large paper bags from the grocery store. It was a pretty normal week of garbage disposal for us. We threw away the same kinds of things we've been throwing away for years and the same kinds of things we imagine we will dispose of in the future (although we are expecting to add diapers to this list in May). Most people probably throw away the same sort of things as we do, although certainly in different amounts. So this is what the residents of Long Island are contributing to the landfills in Wisconsin and other states to which our refuse is trucked. Which leads me to four questions: Why isn't there any national, state or local system for recycling most of the trash? Why are so many unrecyclable materials permitted? Why are products packaged in a way that creates unnecessary junk? When are we going to wake up?",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

Without ox or ax, he strides larger than life through the pages of this thoroughly sophisticated tall tale. Drunk as a skunk or inaugurating a commercial utopia in the South Shetlands, Dan Yack - '' 'The millionaire?' 'The famous hell-raiser?' 'The beautiful Hedwiga's lover?' 'The very same' '' - cuts a lanky, flamboyant figure of formidable mental and financial resources. A fair-haired Englishman with a taste for liqueur brandy and gramophone records, Yack, monocle aglitter, is a kind of demonized Lord Peter Wimsey run amok on a gigantic scale. Sozzled, he proposes esthetic adventure to a trio of artists in St. Petersburg; sober, he waits out the south polar summer alone on iron rations of plum pudding and whisky (the latter strictly for washing). In this first American appearance of Blaise Cendrars' 1927 novel, published on the 100th anniversary of his birth, the French avant-garde master chronicles his outrageous brainchild in a style that mirrors Yack's extremes of fortune, studded with exclamation points and awash with verbal effervescence, a dizzying soar and plunge of mood. Cendrars' extravagance, like Yack's, is shrewd: no detail seems too lavish when the subject is ice sculpture in the Antarctic waste or the nonpareil mechanical orchestra of stuffed cats that churns and carols for the enraptured Yack in a Chilean bar. And Nina Rootes, translating with verve and a rollicking vocabulary, keeps breathless pace with this grand gallop.",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

Whitaker, who won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics, appeared to have an easy time from the start and was peppering the champion with right jabs throughout the fight. He moved easily out of trouble but was missing combinations late in the fight after suffering an injury to his left hand in the middle rounds. Although Ramirez kept trying to come in, he failed to score often and Whitaker was able to stay out of trouble most of the way. There were no knockdowns. Judge Harry Gibbs of Britain scored the fight 117-113 in favor of Whitaker, which was in line with the way most people at ringside saw it. But Newton Campos of Brazil had it 118-113 for Ramirez, and Louis Michel of France scored it 116-115 in Ramirez's favor. Whitaker lost for the first time in 16 fights since turning pro in November 1984. Ramirez improved his record to 101-6.(AP) N.H.L.

us,New & Noteworthy,"THE WOMAN OF THE PHARISEES, by Francois Mauriac. Translated by Gerard Hopkins. (Carrol & Graf, $8.95.) In this novel, Francois Mauriac, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1952, tells the story of Brigitte, who forces her religion on unwitting members of a Bordeaux community, sowing tragedy in their lives. Beside Mauriac, ''Gide seems artful and barren . . . Malraux harsh and narrow, Sartre ephemeral,'' Frederic Prokosch said here in 1946. Mauriac's ''style seems a little arid but . . . fulfills its function with precision, coolness, economy.'' CHURCHILL & ROOSEVELT: THE COMPLETE CORRESPONDENCE, edited by Warren F. Kimball. (Princeton University, 3 volumes boxed, $65.) By arranging, annotating and introducing the approximately 2,000 messages exchanged by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt, the Rutgers historian Warren F. Kimball shows that their relationship wasn't always as amiable as it seemed. ''The publication now of the complete correspondence does a great service in removing some of the gloss from the legends,'' Alistair Horne said here in 1984. ''Altogether the three vast volumes read like a skillful and compelling history of World War II - as indeed they are.'' ALEXANDER'S BRIDGE, by Willa Cather. (Meridian/ New American Library, $4.95.) Bartley Alexander, a renowned builder of bridges, is at the peak of his career -and in the midst of a marriage - when his first sweetheart, a beautiful Irish actress, re-enters the scene. When this first novel by a little-known author named Willa Cather was published in 1912, a reviewer in The Times recognized her special talent for ''catching and describing in terse, refined phrase the salient features of personality.'' The same publisher has gathered more of Cather's early work in a volume called WILLA CATHER: 24 Stories ($5.95). VISIONS AND NIGHTMARES: America After Reagan, by Robert Lekachman. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) Even when President Reagan is long gone from the White House, free-market philosophy will reign, writes Robert Lekachman, predicting more privatization, militarization and dismantling of the welfare state. While our reviewer, Michael C. Janeway, said last year that the prose can be annoyingly polemical, ''when backed by fact and figure, [ the book is ] an intelligently passionate brief against the Reagan Administration.'' MARYA: A Life, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Berkley, $3.95.) A young woman tries to overcome a troubled childhood with the single-minded pursuit of academic perfection. In 1986, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times that the novel is ''a fresh departure for Miss Oates -quieter, more controlled and realistic, and personal to the point of suggesting autobiography.'' HERE LIES: An Autobiography, by Eric Ambler. (Mysterious Press, $8.95.) Eric Ambler's autobiography begins like an Eric Ambler novel: with an ominous car accident and a bout with amnesia. While the rest of the book is written in a more conventional manner, it is ''far from . . . commonplace,'' The Times's John Gross said in 1986. ''Mr. Ambler turns out to write as well about domesticities as he does about exotic intrigue.'' THE INVISIBLE BAR: The Woman Lawyer in America, 1638 to the Present, by Karen Berger Morello. (Beacon, $10.95.) By the turn of the century, half of all lawyers in the United States may be women, the author writes, yet it wasn't until 1950 that Harvard Law School admitted female students. In 1986, Rita E. Hauser said here that the ''well-researched'' book is an ''important history.'' ''Many women attorneys were crusaders for the poor and needy. . . . They were among the earliest public interest lawyers the nation knew.'' OVER THE EDGE, by Jonathan Kellerman. (Signet/ New American Library, $4.95.) Alex Delaware, the psychologist hero of Jonathan Kellerman's previous two mysteries, receives a disturbing late-night call from a brilliant young patient he hasn't seen for five years. ''Mr. Kellerman is one of the ablest mystery writers to have emerged in recent years,'' John Gross said in The Times last year. '' 'Over the Edge' is as sleek and high-powered a performance as its predecessors.'' FARTHER AFIELD: A Gardener's Excursions, by Allen Lacy. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) Allen Lacy is a professor of philosophy who writes about gardening. When this second collection of essays was published last year, our reviewer, Susan Brownmiller, said Mr. Lacy is ''among that admirable elite who elevate the pleasant pastime of writing personally and with firm opinions about their private gardens into something that approaches literature.'' THE MACHIAVELLIANS: Defenders of Freedom, by James Burnham. (Regnery Gateway/Kampmann, $7.95.) The problem with democracy, James Burnham wrote, is that there is no such thing as majority rule; a powerful elite is, by necessity, always in control. In 1943, one reviewer said Mr. Burnham ''brings to the consideration of the eternal problem of power in society a mind like a surgeon's scalpel. . . . Timid readers may be shocked.'' FLESH AND BLOOD, by C. K. Williams. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $8.95.) When C. K. Williams's fifth collection of poems, each consisting of eight long lines, was published in 1987, our reviewer, Edward Hirsch, compared them to John Berryman's ''Dream Songs'' and Robert Lowell's ''Notebooks.'' ''Many of his poems present single extended moments intently observed: a girl with an artificial hand stepping onto the subway or a bum scribbling into a battered notebook in the public library. Others are like miniature short stories, sudden fictions.''",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

us,HIS DAYS AT BLACK ROCK,"Despite the ubiquity of their work, most graphic designers tend to remain anonymous. DORFSMAN & CBS (American Showcase, $49.95) attempts to change all that. The authors, Dick Hess and Marion Muller, review the life and work of Lou Dorfsman, CBS Inc.'s vice president and creative director for advertising and design. Though relatively unknown outside the field, Mr. Dorfsman is something of a legend among design aficionados. Under the enlightened aegis of CBS executives, most notably Frank Stanton, president emeritus of CBS Inc., Mr. Dorfsman took a fledgling operation and made it look classy. Over a career that has spanned 40 years, his reach, mostly behind the scenes, extended to advertisements and annual reports to the now-famous CBS typefaces. Under his direction, everything the corporation touched took on a distinctive CBS look, from the wall clocks at Black Rock to the salt and pepper packets in the company cafeteria. Unfortunately, ''Dorfsman & CBS'' suffers from a testimonial-dinner tone. (Mr. Hess is a graphic designer, and Mrs. Muller, according to the jacket, is a ''longtime friend and occasional collaborator with Lou Dorfsman.'') Do we really need to know how wonderful Mr. Dorfsman's children are? Nevertheless, the authors tell us a lot about Mr. Dorfsman and help explain just what it is corporate designers do. Leafing through this abundantly illustrated book, one is struck by the fact that television nurtured one of print's most innovative graphic designers.",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

As a listener, I can bask in the way it sounds: the serene counterpoint that issues from resonant gongs, a fiddle-like instrument called a rebab, tinkling ''keyed metallophones'' and Ms. Hadidjah's gentle, firm, intricately controlled voice, which has a throaty quality I haven't heard in much Asian singing. Sometimes there's a salvo of drumming or a wry male voice answering Ms. Hadidjah, and I can nearly hum the recurring, almost catchy melodies, although they're in non-Western tunings.

They may be insignificant for consumers, but they are make-or-break ones for the nearly 130,000 fast-food outlets that dot the country. The recent top-management shakeup at the Pillsbury Company put the spotlight on troubles at its Burger King subsidiary, but if misery likes company, then Burger King must be a happy place: For all the purveyors of fast food, with the exception of giant McDonald's Corporation and tiny White Castle Systems Inc., are crashing into the law of supply and demand. Simply stated, there are just too many fast-food outlets around. It is not that Americans have soured on fast food. In fact, they spent $55.7 billion on it last year alone. But after double-digit sales growth into the early 1980's, the pace has slowed. The market has become oversaturated at a time when food and labor costs are rising. And, despite all of the advertising aimed at differentiating products, customers - at least those who are not diehard McDonald's or White Castle loyalists - do not seem to care which ones they go to. ''Nowadays, a driver won't even make a U-turn to go to a different fast-food outlet,'' said Malcolm M.

us,NONFICTION,"FORTY-EIGHT MINUTES: A Night in the Life of the NBA. By Bob Ryan and Terry Pluto. (Macmillan, $16.95.) So much happens in even five minutes of a professional basketball game. The clock ticks while players execute complex moves planned during a hurried timeout. Arms and legs move nonstop on the hardwood court. Steals, fakes, whistles and slam dunks. It goes so fast that you can never see everything. To capture all the drama of one 48-minute basketball game, the sportswriters Bob Ryan and Terry Pluto break down, play by play, the Jan. 16, 1987, duel between the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers, a rebuilding team led by rookies, had come to Boston after losing seven of their last eight games, while the then world champion Celtics had won 53 of their last 54 games at home. Another Boston Garden sellout crowd expected an easy Celtics victory. Instead, the fans got a thriller. Beyond the plays and calls, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pluto explain both teams' roles in the history of the National Basketball Association and explore the coaching and business sides of the sport. They reveal through excellent interviews the thoughts and feelings of the players. There is also a worthwhile discussion of whether the Celtics organization deserves the reputation it has among some people for having ''pandered to the bigots who happened to be basketball fans'' by acquiring so many white players in a predominantly black league. ''Forty-eight Minutes'' is like an exciting game - but it's more thought-provoking.",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

The Mexican weaver is a hard-working craftsman whose standard of living is low. Although the American tourist may not feel rich in his own country, his possessions and his ability to travel make him enormously wealthy compared to the average Mexican.

A fashionable piece of fiction about a lazy bunch of downside Dallas eccentrics, ''Afoot in a Field of Men'' is narrated by a character with the same name as the author (hmmm . . .) who wants ''to figure out how to make a living doing nothing.'' Presented as interrelated short stories, this collection should probably be billed as a novel, except the reader might then expect something in the way of structure or plot. As it is, the divorced narrator lives with her lover and grown son in a series of dumpy east Dallas apartments. In her well-intentioned and responsible effort to do nothing, the narrator, Pat, who also writes and clings to credentials as a ''sometimes somewhat of a female folklore scholar,'' becomes an office temp and then works in a bookstore (as does the real-life writer Pat). The people she meets on these jobs make great copy. Except for Leo the lover, who is not so interesting - so Pat the author packs him off to Galveston. Whereupon good-natured and generous Pat the narrator gets a new roommate named Pauline, a neighbor who's about to be evicted with her three children and two dogs. There is mild substance abuse, as well as babies and dogs who have frequent accidents on the floor. Mostly, however, there are kids everywhere (Pat's two others have also arrived). Eventually our cheerful narrator is taken aback by the throngs: ''Even in the Bible story . . . the multitude didn't just decide to move in and stay.'' She may not have a sense of purpose, but Pat (author or narrator, take your pick) makes a stab at turning a sense of humor into an acceptable substitute.",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

Even though he came from the Long Island rather than the Hudson Valley squirearchy, he maintained fairly good relations with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Wherever he went during his impressive career - the United States Army, the State Department and various embassies in the Middle East, the Central Intelligence Agency (from 1951 to 1974), the Chase Manhattan Bank - his name opened doors. A scholar and linguist, he became fluent in Arabic. He made himself invaluable as a translator and then as a political interpreter. The strongest part of this memoir comes near the end when he offers his opinion of American foreign policy. In an important statement, Mr. Roosevelt writes: ''The distinction between Communists and the nationalist extremists has not always been understood by the 'wise men' of Washington.'' About the fall of the Shah of Iran he has this to say: ''If, in the beginning, the Shah had shown the ruthlessness of his predecessors -Darius the Great, Genghis Khan, Reza Shah - the Iranian masses would have bared their necks, and prostrated themselves before the Great Khan.'' Mr. Roosevelt also clams up. Abiding by C.I.A. rules, he tells us: ''I cannot give the exact nature of these assignments nor their time frame, nor do I wish to do so. . . .'' Fortunately, the Freedom of Information Act has enabled others to learn at least some of what should be public knowledge, including mistakes in policy.",1988-03-13T05:00:00+0000

The medication is sandwiched with an osmotic agent that swells when it takes up water. The sandwich is then coated with a semipermeable membrane and a laser is used to drill a tiny hole through the membrane. In the stomach, water passes through the membrane into the pill, putting the drug into solution and causing the osmotic material to swell, which pushes the drug out of the hole. This delivers the drug to the body at a constant rate instead of all at once, as happens when a traditional pill dissolves.",1988-03-16T05:00:00+0000

A shy, decent and illiterate Greek furrier named Gerasimos Jiras has been living in Paris for many years when, in 1971, a young relative named Ilias arrives with some information and a get-rick-quick scheme. It is Ilias's idea to befriend and exploit the older man by revealing dire news about Gerasimos's stepparents, then he stumbles onto an even better plan.",1988-03-17T05:00:00+0000

Finally, Mayor Koch has persuaded Samuel LeFrak, the builder, to produce housing there. It's a big step forward. The Lower East Side below Houston Street was once mostly Jewish and poor. Now there's a polyglot population with dramatic differences in income and age. Poorer residents need subsidies to rent improved apartments. Better-off families need help to afford cooperatives like those put up years ago on Grand Street by the United Housing Foundation.

North and two other men of illegally providing the Nicaraguan rebels with profits from the sale of American weapons to Iran. Page A1 Admiral Poindexter was accused in the Iran-contra indictment of having methodically deleted from White House computer files messages that he wrote and received. D27 U.S. troops are flying to Honduras, a senior Administration official said. The White House charged that Nicaraguan troops had invaded Honduras and attacked a major base camp for Nicaraguan rebels. A1 Nicaragua denied that its forces were fighting inside Honduras and invited foreign observers to visit the border area to verify its position. A12 Civil disorders swept Panama after a failed attempt to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The strongman's regime said the uprising was led by the chief of police. A1 Three Ulster residents were killed and dozens were wounded as an assailant threw grenades into a crowd of several thousand mourners at the burial of three Irish Republican Army guerrillas. A1 American-Israeli differences were underscored as President Reagan warned after meeting unsuccessfully with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir that opponents of Washington's peace plan would have to answer for failure. A3 Pakistan says superpowers can help end Afghan deadlock A9 NATIONAL A14-29, B6-7 Economists are predicting faster growth than they had expected just a few weeks ago, amid evidence of resilience in the nation's economy, particularly among consumers. A1 The F.D.I.C. may have to pay up to $4 billion this year to solve banking problems in Texas in the largest one-year drain on the Government agency that insures deposits in the nation's banks. D1 The Senate upheld the nuclear lobby in voting 53 to 4l against imposing responsibility for accidents on the contractors that operate the Government's nuclear research and weapons program. A29 The President vetoed a civil right bill intended to clarify antidiscrimination laws that were limited by a 1984 Supreme Court decision. Mr. Reagan disregarded warnings from key Republicans of a backlash. A1 Evan Mecham, defending himself in Phoenix at the first impeachment trial of a governor in nearly 60 years, appeared relaxed, laughed frequently and wove in several self-deprecatory jokes. A14 A software 'virus,' a type of computer program that can secretly spread from computer to computer and potentially destroy stored data, has infected a commercial personal computer product. D1 POLITICS B6-7 Vice President Bush surged ahead of Bob Dole in the Republican Presidential races because of planning and organization and mistakes made by the Kansas Senator. A1 Jesse Jackson accused rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination of being too passive about South Africa. He urged that they pledge to order American companies out of South Africa unless that country holds ''fair and free elections.'' B6 The Democratic Presidential race looks murkier than ever after the Illinois primary. It seems increasingly likely that no aspirant will have a majority of convention votes by the time the primaries end June 7. B7 Ex-Mayor Byrne is beaten in race for court clerk B6 WASHINGTON TALK B6 Anti-abortion aid raises church-state issue REGIONAL B1-5 A campaign financing inquiry in New York State will include the Legislature, the State Boards of Elections and more donors seeking to influence politicians, according to state officials. B1 Promotions for future police officers to sergeant, lieutenant and captain in New York City must first complete at least two years of college, according to a new order. B1 Radiation Technology Inc., a North Jersey company that uses radiation to sterilize spices and medical equipment, pleaded guilty to submitting falsified data to the Government concerning safety at its plant in Rockaway. B1 Robert Garcia was bribed by former executives of the Wedtech Corporation, prosecutors told a Federal judge. Representative Garcia has denied any wrongdoing involving the Bronx military contractor. B3 Small employers are retrenching in New York City unlike the rest of the nation, where most new jobs have been created by small businesses, a government study said. B3 Photographs of Jennifer Levin prove that Robert E. Chambers Jr. murdered her in Central Park in 1986, according to the prosecutor's summation to the jury. B3 An inquiry into Playland was ordered by the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, amid charges of ''mismanagement and improprieties'' at the county-owned amusement park. B2 William H. Honan has been named the chief cultural correspondent of The New York Times. The paper's new cultural news editor will be Marvin Siegel, now deputy editor of The Week in Review. C29 Large families are an endangered species. But parents who have decided to preserve this vanishing way of life believe that the joy of raising a large family, even on a modest income, far outweighs the burden.

us,Review/Film; Tracing an Uncommon Love,"For a movie that starts with voyeurism, advances to acute acne and concludes with a bout of necrophilia, ''Love Is a Dog From Hell'' is a remarkably innocent romance. Dominique Deruddere, a 31-year-old Belgian director, found the idea for his first full-length feature in the stories of Charles Bukowski, an American writer with an underground reputation who did the screenplay for ''Barfly.'' The funny, tender, surprising result can be seen at the New Directors/New Films festival tonight at 8:30 and Sunday at 6 P.M. at the Museum of Modern Art. (The program opens with ''A Warm Reception in L.A.,'' by Vincent Cafarelli and Candy Kugel, a zippy five-minute singing cartoon about a writer whom nobody calls back.) Mr. Deruddere, who collaborated with Marc Didden on the screenplay, first did a short movie based on Mr. Bukowski's account of a man making love to a dead woman, then worked his way back to the youth of the necrophiliac, here called Harry Voss. The interpretation of how Harry got that way is a bit pat, but the three matched sections of the final work are filled with such sympathy for his longings that they compel understanding.",1988-03-18T05:00:00+0000

At times, this seems to be the case. Several of these paintings look unfinished, falling victim to Ms. Diamond's wide-brushed, wet-on-wet painting method. But others may be among the best paintings she has made. This exhibition has a reach to it that one had ceased to expect from Ms. Diamond. It shows her taking on new subjects (particularly an unspecified, generic still life), aligning herself more aggressively with painters of the past and present and honing the vaudevillian bravura that always characterized her work.",1988-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The loan was termed a temporary measure until a permananent solution is devised. Analysts said a full bailout of First Republicbank could cost $3 billion, making it the costliest such Federal rescue ever.",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000
us,New & Noteworthy,"THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, by C. S. Lewis. (Mentor/New American Library, $2.95.) When this book of epistles from the Devil to his disciple was published in 1943, our reviewer, P. W. Wilson, praised C. S. Lewis for a clever portrayal of ''the devious processes of the diabolical mischief-makers,'' adding that ''somewhere in the inferno there must be considerable annoyance.'' THE NAZI DOCTORS: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide, by Robert Jay Lifton. (Basic, $12.95.) How did doctors, trained to uphold the Hippocratic oath, become involved in the gruesome experiments and killings of the Third Reich? This history of Nazi war crimes committed in the name of science shows how a program of euthanasia, carried out in mental institutions to eliminate people considered defective, eventually led to systematic genocide in concentration camps. In 1986 our reviewer, Bruno Bettelheim, said the book ''painfully revived my memories of the time I had spent in two of [ the camps ] - memories of which I am unable to free myself, as no survivor of them ever can.'' The events recounted, he said, ''are dreadful enough. That doctors perpetrated them makes reading the book particularly upsetting.'' THE LAST SONG OF MANUEL SENDERO, by Ariel Dorfman. Translated by George R. Shivers with the author. (King Penguin, $7.95.) In this political fantasy by a Chilean novelist, fetuses unite and refuse to enter a world filled with corruption. ''After the complications of plot and puzzle have done their work, the richness of the invention breaks through the gate of reality,'' Earl Shorris said here last year, ''and the reader touches congruently the soulful imagination of Ariel Dorfman.'' HOLY SMOKE, by G. Cabrera Infante. (Faber & Faber, $8.95.) John McPhee once wrote an entire book about oranges. The Cuban novelist G. Cabrera Infante has done the same with cigars. The result is a social history of one of his favorite pastimes. He ''weaves his way from one theme to another, as though in a tobacco trance, turning aside to follow an idiosyncratic fancy, gliding back to his starting point,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1986. ''Everything reminds him of something else, and everything else reminds him of a cigar.'' AFTERWORDS: Novelists on Their Novels, edited by Thomas McCormack. (St. Martin's, $9.95.) Perhaps a million tiny decisions go into the writing of a book. In one of these 14 essays, Norman Mailer compares two versions of his star-crossed novel ''The Deer Park,'' showing how the slightest change in wording can be a deliberate act with powerful artistic consequences. ''What might have been a parade of solemn, solipsistic exercises is saved by good measures of humor, rueful self-criticism, biographical digressions and intelligent insights on fictional theory,'' Robie MacAuley said here in 1969. ''The silent struggle to tell it and be heard - this is what 'Afterwords' is about.'' THE CAPITALIST REVOLUTION: Fifty Propositions About Prosperity, Equality, and Liberty, by Peter L. Berger. (Basic, $8.95.) In his celebration of capitalism, Peter L. Berger is too ready to ignore its faults, Lester C. Thurow said here in 1986. But overall, he found the sociologist's book ''a nondogmatic, rational, reasonable, never shrill, balanced argument.'' FIASCO, by Stanislaw Lem. Translated by Michael Kandel. (Helen & Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $6.95.) Stanislaw Lem's story of an expedition to a planet inhabited by strange, uncommunicative aliens examines the problems that arise when ideologies clash. ''In its deeper resonances it transcends the science fiction genre and reinforces Mr. Lem's claim to be one of the major writers of our time,'' our reviewer, Paul Delany, said last year. JOE & MARILYN: A Memory of Love, by Roger Kahn. (Avon, $4.95.) The lives of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe intersected only briefly, but during their stormy nine-month marriage they were known in the press as Mr. and Mrs. America. ''Little new ground is broken here,'' Robert Strauss said in The Book Review in 1986, ''and Mr. Kahn, one of baseball's purplest prose writers, leans more to the feats of DiMag than the traumas of Marilyn. But, in all, this is a worthy compilation of anecdotes.'' ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, by L. M. Montgomery. (Signet/New American Library, $2.50.) In 1908, when this story of an orphan growing up on Prince Edward Island was published, an anonymous Times reviewer found the ''little asylum waif'' to be ''altogether too queer.'' The novel became a classic anyway and is being released in a new edition along with its sequel, ANNE OF AVONLEA ($2.50). THE FIERY CROSS: The Ku Klux Klan in America, by Wyn Craig Wade. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $10.95.) Since the Civil War, the various factions of the Ku Klux Klan have risen and fallen and carried on their campaign against blacks, Jews, Catholics - everyone, it seems, except bigoted white Protestants. Last year our reviewer, Theodore Rosengarten, called this history ''an ambitious, timely, comprehensive chronicle of America's most persistent racist organization.'' LIFE DRAWING, by Emily Arnold. (Laurel/Dell, $4.95.) In the heyday of Abstract Expressionism, a girl born to a failed scriptwriter and a frustrated would-be singer struggles to be an artist anyway. In 1986, Will Blythe said here that this novel is a ''generous portrait of an artist responding to the demands of vision in love and painting in a period when artists carried more paintings than investments in their portfolios.''",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000

''No Ceiling but Heaven'' is the strife-filled tale of the Midwestern Harden family, as narrated by the mentally retarded Johnny. The Hardens' difficulties center mostly on Bobby, Johnny's twin brother, who is angry and destructive, a borderline psychopath. As he is gradually presented to us, Bobby is beating up a neighbor who has mocked Johnny, dealing drugs, brawling in defense of his hopelessly inebriated father (who for years has topped off his evening with a full bottle of liquor) or generally inciting trouble. Though the author never clearly makes the link, it's obvious that one of the sources of Bobby's rage is his father's alcoholism; Bobby also feels guilty when faced with Johnny's handicap, even though it's a disability that at times seems rather slight. But despite the novel's endless bleak scenarios, a strong portrait of love somehow manages to emerge, one that is expressed through Johnny's sympathetic though matter-of-fact voice. Although the boys' mother is given short shrift, Johnny eloquently conveys the enormous devotion that links Mr. Harden and his sons, as well as the twins' love for each other. Thus, within this family's whirl of troubles, the author has managed to reveal the unbreakable bonds that connect fathers, sons and brothers. This story is a tribute to those complicated, mysterious kinds of love.",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"SOVIET SUCCESSION STRUGGLES: Kremlinology and the Russian Question From Lenin to Gorbachev. By Anthony D'Agostino. (Allen & Unwin, $45.) One school of thought sees all signs of struggle in the Kremlin as playacting, a device to gull the West into giving aid and comfort to the comparatively ''good'' Soviet leader who is at odds with supposedly ''bad'' domestic foes. Actually, according to this viewpoint, the two factions are as alike as peas in a pod. Anyone still subscribing to this theory need only read ''Soviet Succession Struggles'' by Anthony D'Agostino to be persuaded that the conflicts that have marked the Soviet regime since Lenin's time have been deadly real. (But the book does demand commitment: Mr. D'Agostino, a professor of history at San Francisco State University, is inclined to bog down in minutiae.) The author postulates two broad political orientations - a militant, ideological impulse, which he calls the ''Leningrad line,'' and a more pragmatic, liberal ''Moscow line'' - that recur like a leitmotif through Soviet history. The contest between them is endemic, he finds, to the system, and the clashes that break out into the open when a leader dies are only the climactic moments of a constant process. The prize in these succession struggles, the author holds, goes to the tactician who occupies a centrist position, alternating between the two extremes as circumstances dictate. This suggests that Mikhail Gorbachev can be expected to retreat from his reforms if the going gets tough. Mr. D'Agostino's well-researched, if controversial, argument is an interesting contribution to the debate over the nature of Soviet politics.",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000

Ron Hubbard, was a ''cosmic outlaw,'' in the words of L. Ron Hubbard Jr. There is little of the son in this book but a good deal of Bent Corydon, who headed one of the Scientology ''missions'' in California during the 1970's until Hubbard decided to take over these lucrative franchises, leaving their well-rewarded leaders bewildered and broke. This book, supposedly a biography of Hubbard (who died in 1986), turns out to be a series of tales about naive people who were put through abusive tests before they were allowed to pay thousands of dollars to an organization that humiliated them. Mr. Corydon does little to explain why he remained attached to a group that fed its members scraps and hurt him beyond measure. Hubbard, who gained worldwide prominence with his book ''Dianetics'' (1950), is portrayed as a greedy, vindictive man whose hidden agenda centered on hoarding vast sums of money and escaping legal accountability. In recent years, the church has agreed to pay millions of dollars to former members who claimed they had been defrauded. Mr. Corydon draws heavily on the court documents. His interviews, while offering a good deal of color, are often disjointed. The church is a strenuous litigator: the publisher says several lawsuits were undertaken to delay or suppress the distribution of the book. And L. Ron Hubbard Jr., as part of the settlement of his own claim against his father's estate, tried to have his name removed from it.",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000

Carlson, a professor of humanities at Western Michigan University, and John J. Fogarty, an associate professor of English at Ferris State College in Michigan, is an oral history of the last 15 Summer Olympic Games. The authors interviewed 58 American gold medal winners, whose revealing stories cover everything from training techniques to politics to the major personalities of the Olympics. Raymond Barbuti, a track star at the 1928 Amsterdam Games, remembers being ''pretty well crocked'' during a confrontation with Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the American team leader. Hours before, Barbuti had won the 400-meter dash and went out to celebrate, only to learn later that MacArthur wanted him on the 1,600-meter relay team the next day. Barbuti refused at first, because it meant replacing someone else. MacArthur, of course, prevailed, and the team won another gold. Helen Stephens, who won two gold medals in track at the 1936 Berlin Games, tells of her meeting with Adolf Hitler. He gave her ''a little Nazi salute, and I thought, 'I'm not going to salute you.' So I extended my hand and gave him a good ol' Missouri handshake.'' The athletes naturally deplore the intrusive politics that threaten the Games, and some of them have harsh words for Olympic officials.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"UNCOMMON WISDOM: Conversations With Remarkable People. By Fritjof Capra. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) After it was published in 1975, ''The Tao of Physics'' by Fritjof Capra inspired so many imitators that he could be said to have started a genre. By elegantly drawing parallels between the acausal, relativistic world of modern physics and the teachings of Buddhism, Mr. Capra produced an intellectual gem. What made the book so credible was that its author was trained as a physicist. But as he shows in the autobiographical ''Uncommon Wisdom,'' he was never so much a scientist as a devotee of that grab bag of countercultural magic that has come to be called new-age philosophy. It is not clear who would want to read this book, which traces the intellectual origins of Mr. Capra's thought. His tales of hitchhiking through Big Sur, smoking marijuana and discussing the novels of Hermann Hesse have a certain nostalgic charm. And his story of sharing a couple bottles of wine at breakfast with the radical psychotherapist R. D. Laing is priceless. But most of the conversations reported here - be they with Werner Heisenberg, Gregory Bateson, E. F. Schumacher or Indira Gandhi - are more tedious than enlightening. Mr. Capra's ideas are more cogently expressed in ''The Tao of Physics.''

Drinan is a law professor and a Jesuit and was a congressman from Massachusetts for 10 years. Those credentials combine to make him a passionate and persuasive spokesman for human rights throughout the world. In ''Cry of the Oppressed'' he notes that it was not until relatively recently that racism, torture, genocide and violations of ''the rules of war'' were proscribed by international law. But the United States, Father Drinan writes, ''has failed to ratify the United Nations' central human rights documents.'' The Senate's unwillingness to ratify these covenants, despite the efforts of President Carter and many influential secular and religious organizations, ''highlights the roots of America's reluctance to commit itself to binding international agreements.'' Worse, Father Drinan says, any progress made by Mr. Carter has been undermined by the Reagan Administration, which assumes that ''human rights are of value not by themselves but only if their attainment is consistent with and helpful to the containment of communism.'' While he laments the President's general record, the author does concede that the Administration has been generally mindful of violations by Communist countries. Father Drinan has a gloomy view of the present situation, but he believes the game is worth the candle: ''The United States has a daunting moral, legal, and political duty to verify and enhance the transcendence of human rights.''",1988-03-20T05:00:00+0000

Nor do visitors come to play tennis, even though most of the island's eight inns have courts, few of which seem to get much use.

The witnesses were Joseph Bernstein, a developer; Gerald Guterman, a developer; William Stern, campaign chairman for Governor Cuomo; Lawrence Buttenwieser, chief fund-raiser for Attorney General Robert Abrams, and Robert Pressman, a business executive. Lunch With Goldin: The $25,000 Pitch MR. BELLINGER: Mr. Bernstein, isn't it a fact that in the main you attempt to avoid making political contributions whenever possible? MR. BERNSTEIN: That's correct. Q.And you would characterize yourself as apolitical in the conventional sense? A.Very definitely not political. Q.As a matter of fact, you didn't even vote in the 1985 New York City elections, is that true? A.That's correct. Q.And yet you contributed over $100,000 to various political candidates? A.Well, I haven't aggregated it, but I don't think it's impossible. Q.Mr. Bernstein, would it be fair to say that you contributed money to political campaigns to avoid possible economic retaliation or reprisal if you did not contribute? A.To characterize why I would respond to a solicitation for a contribution, I would say it's more trying to avoid a negative impact that trying to incur a positive result. So the answer is yes. Q.And, in fact, you have previously mentioned a certain intimidation factor that you felt with respect to this? A.You could call it that. Q.Mr. Bernstein, you also stated that you were personally solicited for campaign contributions from the City Comptroller, Harrison Goldin. Is that correct? A.Yes. Q.Would you describe the circumstances surrounding this solicitation? A.I believe I received a telephone call from Mr. Goldin, wanting to have lunch. Q.Have you ever phoned Mr. Goldin? A. Yes, I have. Most recently. Q.And for what purpose? A.To try to get him to vote on a project that we have before the Board of Estimate. Q.And what project was that? A.That was the rebuilding of the High School of the Performing Arts that just burnt down. Q.Did Mr. Goldin accept your call? A.Yes. Spoke to me several times, but I wasn't able to convince him. Q.Again, would you continue on with describing the personal solicitation Mr. Goldin made to you? A.He asked us to have lunch - I am sorry, I don't recall specifically. It may have been breakfast. I am not sure which, but it was at the Edwardian Room at the Plaza Hotel. Q. What happened when you arrived at the Plaza Hotel? A. I guess we ordered some food, and started talking, and he made mention a little bit about running for Mayor, and that it would be nice if we were to support him. Q. And what else did he say? A. He thought that a contribution of $50,000, $25,000 for each of two years, would be appropriate. Q. What did you feel about this request from Mr. Goldin? A. Well, I felt I didn't have a middleman between me and him. He was right in front of me, so I kind of looked at my brother, we both kind of nodded, yeah, that was it. Q. Mr. Bernstein, isn't it also a fact that you and your brother discussed the audacity of Mr. Goldin's request? A. I guess I should say it was a little bit shocking, yes. Q. Mr. Bernstein, did you comply with the City Comptroller's request? A. Yes. Q. In fact, you made a contribution of $25,000 to the Committee for a Better Government in mid-February of 1984? A. I believe that's correct. Q. Mr. Bernstein, were you aware at this particular time that that contribution was in violation of the New York State Election Law? A. I don't believe so. Q. Were you ever so informed? A. Well, what I was informed was that the check was coming back, and that I should cut five separate checks, and that's what I have also as exhibits here, the checks that were cut back. 'I Will Defer To Your Arithmetic' MS. LOWE: Mr. Guterman, would it be fair to say that in a narrow time span, running from the end of December to early - well, the end of December 1984, to early December 1985, you contributed - excuse me, from late December '84 to early January '85 -you contributed exactly $100,000 to Harrison Goldin's campaign for Comptroller? MR. GUTERMAN: I don't recall exactly. Q. What I would like to do is to look at the contributions that begin on Dec. 17, 1984. . . What I would like to do is beginning on page 8, and continuing on the next two pages, there are a series of corporations, most of whom are located at 255-55 Union Turnpike, in Glen Oaks, New York. And I would like you to scan down with me, beginning with Nelson Investors Incorporated, and go down to the bottom of the page and tell us whether each of those corporations is a corporation in which you or Hanover Companies had an interest as of Dec. 27, 1984? A. I believe they are. Q. Now, you can check my arithmetic, but when I took out my calculator and added up these 4,700, 4,800, 4,600 contributions, I came up to exactly $100,000, does that sound right to you? A. I will defer to your arithmetic. Doing Business With the Government MR. BIENSTOCK: I want to refer to the day of the primary, if I might, and ask you whether or not the nature of fund raising dramatically changed on that date? MR. STERN: Yes. . . That night he won. And there was a madhouse. Everybody came down from the Koch headquarters, and as we were going toward the stage, I was going to the stage with the Governor, people were giving me checks, people were giving me money on my way to the stage, saying, ''I have been looking for you for weeks, where have you been?'' Q. Did you form a judgment as to why the nature of the fund raising changed after the primary? A. Yes. people trying to ingratiate themselves with somebody who was to be governor. Q. And did that apply to particular industries? A. Yes. Everybody who sells things to government or is closely related to anybody in government. And therein lies the secret of the form, I think. People who are doing a lot of business with the government and who are regulated by government, are the usual suspects of the public finance debts of Wall Street, real-estate developers, public employees unions are enormous givers. Looking for Cash: A 'Bald Request' MS. CUSHMAN: Can you please describe for the commission the manner in which these $15,000 contributions were solicited by yourself or by yourself and Mr. Abrams? MR. BUTTENWIESER: Our routine was define a congenial time to meet directly with the prospective contributor. To the considerable discomfort of my diet, it was either breakfast, lunch and dinner. It would usually be three of us. We would have a very pleasant meal together. Talk about what friends talk about. Bob's career and ultimately about the possibility of a contribution to his campaign. Q. Isn't it fair to say that these breakfast meetings with yourself were expressly designed to be the setting in which a request would be made of the contributor for a $15,000 pledge for Mr. Abrams's campaign? A. It was. Q. How did - you talked about these meetings with us on prior occasions. Isn't it fair to say to describe them as almost a formula in the sense that they tended to follow over and over and over again the same overall script? A. They did have a repetitious quality at least for Bob and for me. It was hard for me to vary the script enough to keep it - but I tried. . . . I don't want you to think that it totally revolved around eating. It could be a cocktail or it could be a visit in the office without a piece of bread being broken, but it did tend to have some element of nourishment involved. Q. That makes it something of a social affair? A. We tried to do that. Q. A little bit of a framework around the bald request for money? A. A nice change we called it. Helping a Party 'To Do Good Things' MR. MAGAVERN: Mr. Pressman, referring to the January 3, 1985 contribution to the Bronx Democratic Committee, $5,000. . . In your opinion, did that contribution enhance the economic environment of New York City? MR. PRESSMAN: No. Q. Did it have any relationship to the welfare or vitality of New York City? A. Only to the extent you are helping a political party which continues in its efforts to do good things for the city. Q. Was that party under any threat? Was there any competition that required or a particular need for funding? A. That, I would not know.

Butterfly.'' Here was the incredible true-life tale of a career French foreign service officer brought to ruin - conviction for espionage - by a bizarre 20-year affair with a Beijing Opera diva. Not only had the French diplomat failed to recognize that his lover was a spy; he'd also failed to figure out that ''she'' was a he in drag.

Pratt of the Federal District Court in Washington, who earlier this month had found Eastern in contempt of an injunction he issued last year against the sale or transfer of its assets, said he would fine Eastern $10,000 a day starting April 5 if it continued to violate his order. The ruling was a severe setback for Frank Lorenzo, the Texas Air chairman, in his bid to force concessions from Eastern's unions. [ Page D1. ] Kansas City Southern received a takeover offer of $60 a share in cash from an investor group that holds an 11.3 percent stake. Its offer for the balance amounts to $588 million. The group is led by a New York developer, Howard Kaskel. [ D1. ] G.E. filed two suits against Whirlpool and Roper, and it formally announced its new offer of $54 a share, or $507 million, for Roper. Whirlpool had sued G.E. on Friday, charging that G.E. was interfering in its merger agreement with Roper. G.E.'s suits said the Whirlpool-Roper deal was illegal. [ D1. ] A Federal jury awarded $8 million in the death of an I.B.M. executive who was killed in a plane crash in 1985. Lawyers said the settlement in the wrongful-death case was the largest ever. [ D1. ] Campeau suffered a new setback in the battle for Federated Department Stores. Campeau again argued unsuccessfully in Federal court for the removal of Federated's ''poison pill'' plan. [ D5. ] A. H. Robins's proposed bankruptcy reorganization was approved by a judge, clearing the way for a shareholder vote. [ D5. ] TRW will buy Chilton for about $360 million from Borg-Warner, in a further move into the information-systems business. [ D5. ] Merv Griffin may raise his bid for Resorts International, from the current $35 a share. [ D5. ] THE ECONOMY A Senate panel voted to double the ''gas guzzler'' excise tax on automobiles with fuel economy of less than 22.5 miles a gallon. In the 1988 model year the tax falls exclusively on luxury imports from Europe, Congressional aides said, and it is not likely to meet significant resistance as it moves through Congress. [ D2. ] The Supreme Court will decide whether T.W.A. acted illegally when it refused to create vacancies for returning strikers by laying off 1,300 nonstriking flight attendants with less seniority. [ D8. ] MARKETS Stock prices fell broadly as trading volume slowed sharply on Wall Street, except for takeover-related issues. The Dow Jones industrial fell 20.30 points, to 2,067.14. Volume shrank to 128.8 million shares, the lowest level this year. [ D10. ] Sharp increases in ''short interest'' for the month ended last Tuesday were reported by the Big Board and the Amex. [ D27. ] Bond prices fell again. Nervous traders responded to a drop in the dollar and a rise in the prices of oil and other commodities by selling fixed-income securities. [ D23. ] Crude oil futures prices closed mostly higher in wild trading. [ D24. ] The dollar fell against most major currencies. Gold rose $5.45 an ounce in New York, to $449.45. [ D24. ] INTERNATIONAL West Germany resisted a French call to increase growth. Bonn said at a meeting of a new Franco-German financial council that there was no need for additional measures. [ D23. ] The drought in India has brought on the country's worst slump in eight years but did not do as much damage as many experts had feared earlier, India's Government says.

Overweight umpires became the source of jokes at last year's World Series.

Gregg said Bruce Froemming has dropped 50 pounds, McSherry has lost 33 and Harry Wendelstedt 21. ''Bruce and I are having a race,'' Gregg said. ''I'm winning so far, but we both want to keep going.''

Tomba had runs of 57.30 seconds and 55.45, for a combined time of 1 minute 52.75 seconds, 55-hundredths of a second faster than Okabe's. Okabe's time of 54.30 was fastest in the second run, and he posted the best finish of his career. It was Tomba's ninth World Cup victory of the season - he has also won three giant slalom races - and improved his chances of beating Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland for the overall title. (AP) FIGURE SKATING Gordeyeva and Grinkov Leading: Yekaterina Gordeyeva and Sergei Grinkov used verve and precision to lead a one-two-three Soviet placing after the first part of the pairs event last night at the world championships in Budapest. Gordeyeva and Grinkov, the Olympic gold medalists, were joined at the top by Yelena Valova and Oleg Vasiliev, the Olympic silver medalists, and Larisa Selezneva and Oleg Makarov. Two American teams came next. The Olympic bronze medalists, Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard, with razzle-dazzle skating to a jazzy, percussive beat, were in fourth place; Gillian Wachsman and Todd Waggoner were fifth.(AP) N.B.A. Pistons 123, Pacers 104: Isiah Thomas scored 9 of his 25 points during a 14-0 third-quarter run last night that carried Detroit to its 18th consecutive home victory in Pontiac, Mich.

The Pistons trailed, 80-77, with 2 minutes 41 seconds to play in the third quarter, but the 14-0 run gave Detroit a 91-80 lead with 5 seconds left in the period. Although a 3-point basket by Scott Skiles at the end of the third quarter brought the Pacers within 8, Detroit pulled away early in the fourth quarter. Wayman Tisdale scored 27 points for Indiana (32-34). (AP) Bucks 111, Hawks 98: Randy Breuer scored 27 points and matched his season high of 17 rebounds to lead Milwaukee to the victory at home.

The goal, the fourth by the Whalers in the final 20 minutes, capped a wild offensive flurry after the Jets had carried a 1-0 lead into the final period. The victory pushed the Whalers (31-36-7) into fourth place in the Adams Divsion.

Mark Messier carried the puck into the Detroit zone and slipped a pass to MacTavish, who bounced a shot off the Red Wings' goalie, Greg Stefan, for his 15th goal of the season. The victory extended Edmonton's unbeaten streak to five games and pulled the Oilers (43-21-10) within 5 points of idle Calgary in the race for the Smythe Division title.

After a scoreless first period, Bob Sweeney gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead when he beat the Flyers' goalie, Mark LaForest, with a shot from the crease at 13:28 of the second period.

Title: Rodney Johns sank a 15-foot shot with 3 seconds left in overtime last night to lead Grand Canyon College over Auburn-Montgomery, 88-86, in the title game of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics tournament. After a timeout, Johns intercepted Auburn-Montgomery's inbound pass as the game ended. With 1:08 left, Grand Canyon's Craig Johnson had made a foul shot to tie at 86-86. Seconds later, Bobby Harris stole a Grand Canyon pass and drove in for a layup, but Johnson blocked the shot and Grand Canyon called a timeout with 13 seconds to play to set up Johns's game-winning shot. Johns, who scored 41 points, was named the tournament's most valuable player. The Antelopes, of Phoenix, won their third N.A.I.A. title since 1975 and finished their season 37-6.

This dreadfully solemn spy film, which is entirely without surprises, stars Robert Hossein (who also directed the film) and Candice Patou (Mr. Hossein's wife) as former lovers who once worked together as K.G.B. agents and have been brought together at an abandoned estate outside Geneva. ''Geneva,'' a voice says as the film begins. ''Subtle . . . cold . . . haunting . . . cruel as a seagull.'' There you have it, in a nutshell. It turns out that the K.G.B. has constructed an elaborate trap for these wily ex-partners.

Mr. Reagan declined to say whether he would issue pardons in the affair. 6 Roman Catholic bishops refused to set aside the controversial policy statement on AIDS that they issued last December but voted instead to hold a broad discussion of the AIDS issue next June. 6 Planting fever has returned for small farmers, the largest segment of American agriculture. And out of the more aggressive members of the group are likely to come some of the big farmers of the future. 6 A nominee to a Federal court, Bernard H. Siegan, has been told by Reagan Administration officials that he should consider withdrawing his name. The nomination has been blocked in the Senate Judiciary Committee for 14 months. 6 Two military contractor employees were charged with falsifying tests on a hand-held mine detector for the Army.

us,MIND/BODY/HEALTH,"DON'T DIET. By Dale M. Atrens. (Morrow, $16.95.) With the fervor of a roadside revival preacher, Dale M. Atrens exhorts us to embrace adiposity and live. A professor of psychobiology at the University of Sydney, Australia, Mr. Atrens believes it is our fixation on fat, not the fat itself, that gets us into trouble. He zealously hacks his way through a thicket of what he considers to be popular misconceptions about the demon pudginess, and if, in the end, his passion is more convincing than his rather sparse empirical backup, it is still refreshing to hear someone say enough is enough. Mr. Atrens's basic argument is that it's physiologically almost impossible for many people to lose weight, as evidenced by a high recidivism rate and the unflagging profitability of diet paraphernalia, from liquid concoctions to surgeons' staples. In doggedly seeking slimness, we open ourselves up to two serious health threats - the stress of constantly regarding food as the enemy, and the despair of feeling like a failure. And, he asserts, we don't really insure ourselves against heart trouble or cancer; he blames those mostly on saturated fats, not body weight. It would be nice if he were right. Unfortunately, Mr. Atrens's prose, which can be as dense as a Dobos torte, does not offer much in terms of sustenance. A lot of what he says makes sense - in particular, a vitriolic attack on the woman-as-scarecrow esthetic -but too much of it is infuriatingly vague. He dismisses the notion of tables of appropriate weight and then differentiates between the grossly obese (who need to lose weight) and the pleasingly plump (who don't), without giving readers a clue as to how he defines his categories.",1988-03-27T05:00:00+0000

us,MIND/BODY/HEALTH,"THE NEW AGE: Notes of a Fringe-Watcher. By Martin Gardner. (Prometheus, $19.95.) Martin Gardner preaches to the unbeliever. He seeks not only to explain seemingly unexplainable phenomena, but to put them into context. Half of this book, which will be in stores in late April, is composed of Gardner columns called ''Notes of a Fringe-Watcher,'' written for the Buffalo journal Skeptical Inquirer. The remainder includes articles and reviews written for a variety of publications. The result is a sometimes lively, often repetitious, collection that manages to say too much and too little. On Shirley MacLaine, for example, Mr. Gardner can't write enough. Yet the uninitiated unbeliever may stumble over unexplained references, such as ''CSICOP'' (Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal). When explaining why scientists need to know magic, Mr. Gardner is often entertaining and informative. Many pieces should be of great interest to general readers. Unfortunately, the format -all pieces are in the order in which they were published and are accompanied by many author notes and letters to the editor - clutters the book and draws attention away from the articles. To his credit, Mr. Gardner always maintains a firm grasp of the subject, and a tone that is skeptical without being snide, whether he is writing about numerology, 19th-century spiritualists or what he calls ''prime-time preachers.'' At his best, he effectively explores the mixture of sincere belief and crafty deception that is ''conspicuous by its prevalence in the history of bogus science.''",1988-03-27T05:00:00+0000

For more than a decade, editions of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia have carried increasingly shorter references to the boy. In the last 15 months, a movie debunking the myth has attracted 20 million viewers.

us,MIND/BODY/HEALTH,"THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLETE GUIDE TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AFTER 50. Edited by Robert J. Weiss and Genell J. Subak-Sharpe. (Times Books, $24.95.) Old age is a shipwreck, de Gaulle used to complain, but Dr. Robert J. Weiss and Genell J. Subak-Sharpe insist that it is never too late to turn it into something more like a Caribbean cruise. Dr. Weiss, a former dean of the Columbia University School of Public Health, and his co-editor offer tips for staying well, shaping up and looking on the bright side. Healthiness, they say, is often the close companion of positive thinking, while depression can be bad for the body as well as mind. It is never too late to start over, to exercise, eat with care and lose weight. And it is never too late to stop smoking; after 10 or 15 years of abstinence, former smokers may be as fit as if they had never inhaled in the first place. There are also stern admonitions and useful telephone numbers to call for help with overdrinking. For those unready to look their age, there are descriptions and diagrams of cosmetic surgery on the nose, chin, breast and pate. Dr. Weiss and Ms. Subak-Sharpe canvassed the faculty at the School of Public Health and they have summed up the consensus on such major problems as heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer's. The resulting plain talk might make useful reading while trying to get past the busy signal when calling the doctor's office. Clearly the guide's best advice is to consult a physician - whether the reader is about to try a new exercise video, a megavitamin diet or a trip abroad. Despite the title, the ''Complete Guide'' is not really complete, and much of the message will be familiar to faithful readers of newspaper health columns. But it does provide useful ammunition to people trying to talk themselves and friends into taking care.",1988-03-27T05:00:00+0000

Many function as secretaries, having built-in answering machines and memories that record the time of a call or automatically dial a series of preprogrammed numbers. Still others come with facsimile machines that double as home copiers. But regardless of its many capabilities, the telephone also has become a sophisticated design object. ''Twenty-three million telephones are now sold in America a year,'' says Paul I. Becker, president of Becker Inc., a company that represents several telephone manufacturers.

Zurbriggen assured himself of a finish in the top five with a 48.42-second clocking in the difficult second run on the Schattberg course.

Brushing aside the Anglican Church, which did not even deign to provide them with Welsh-speaking bishops, the agricultural and industrial laboring classes of Wales embarked on an extraordinary and costly building campaign. Between 1811 and 1914 they erected some 5,000 unrendered stone or stucco chapels for Baptist, Congregationalist (or Independent) and Methodist worship.

He is clearly wrong. The Search for Change halfway house proposed for Larchmont is an experiment, not a norm. Mr. Menikoff and Search for Change have continuously failed to address the unique and serious questions raised in connection with the proposal, presumably because they have no answers.

us,New & Noteworthy,"BABETTE'S FEAST: And Other Anecdotes of Destiny, by Isak Dinesen. (Vintage, $4.95.) In the title piece of this collection of five short stories, a French political refugee who arrives in a small Danish fishing village turns out to be a Parisian chef who astounds the ascetic Lutheran locals with a sumptuous meal. ''What other hands might have made the most venal kitsch . . . Isak Dinesen has transformed, by imagination, by wit, by savoir-faire, above all by belief, into genuine if anachronistic art,'' Gerald Sykes said here in 1958. FAITH, SEX, MYSTERY: A Memoir, by Richard Gilman. (Penguin, $7.95.) At the age of 27, the drama critic Richard Gilman, who considered himself a Jewish atheist, had a moment of epiphany at the public library. A year later he converted to Catholicism, but eventually he felt so intellectually constrained that he lost his faith. Last year, our reviewer, Mary Gordon, said that in this intellectual autobiography ''the pleasures of the prose are great.'' ''In recounting this history, [ he ] presents us with a work deserving of all honor for its dark honesty, its fierce, reflective intellectuality, the lambent constancy of both its vision and its style.'' WATCHERS, by Dean R. Koontz. (Berkley, $4.95.) Last year, our reviewer, Katharine Weber, said that the richest character in this thriller is a genetically engineered golden retriever named Einstein, who is being stalked by a mutant killer. ''Despite some pedestrian writing, the suspense holds to the end. Displaying a little more depth and a lot more humor than Stephen King, Dean R. Koontz has really hit his stride.'' TALES OF A NEW AMERICA: The Anxious Liberal's Guide to the Future, by Robert B. Reich. (Vintage, $8.95.) The liberals can rise again, Robert B. Reich believes, if they develop new myths in which traditional rivalries - between capitalism and communism, the United States and Japan, labor and management - are seen not as zero sum games but as symbiotic relationships. Last year, Nicholas Lehmann said here that the book was ''ambitiously and intellectually honest,'' but sometimes ''maddeningly vague.'' A SPORT OF NATURE, by Nadine Gordimer. (Penguin, $7.95.) A white woman raised in South Africa marries a black revolutionary and inherits his cause when he is assassinated. Last year, our reviewer, Maureen Howard, called the book ''a powerful novel of awakening, emergence, and, in so far as fiction can make it possible, a call for a new order.'' BLUES, by John Hersey. Illustrated by James Baker. (Vintage, $6.95.) Cast as a dialogue between a stranger and a fisherman, John Hersey's book about angling for bluefish off Martha's Vineyard is a philosophical meditation on one of mankind's first sports. ''Almost no one has answered 'why fish?' better than Mr. Hersey,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg said here last year. ''What Mr. Hersey does best of all is evoke wonder.'' BERLIN WILD, by Elly Welt. (Onyx/New American Library, $4.50.) During World War II, Josef Bernhardt, a teen-aged Jewish mathematician, hides out with other fugitive geniuses at a neurological institute in Berlin. Last year, our reviewer, Julia Markus, found the novel ''overly clever'' but admired its ''descriptive ability and intelligence.'' HOLD ON, MR. PRESIDENT! by Sam Donaldson. (Fawcett Crest, $4.95.) So far, Sam Donaldson has spent more than a decade covering the White House for ABC News. Last year, The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt criticized Mr. Donaldson for being rather self-absorbed, but he liked the book's ''sharp snapshots'' of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. ''Without ever waxing solemn or punditlike, he shrewdly weighs and illustrates the respective jobs they've done.'' THE HOLLOW WOMAN, by Simon Ritchie. (Signet/ New American Library, $3.50.) This mystery novel about a one-armed Canadian private eye named John Kenneth Galbraith Jantarro begins with a botched kidnapping case, in which a mother and child are killed. ''The ending is scary,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review in 1987. ''Hitchcock would have loved it.'' SERPENT IN THE SKY: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt, by John Anthony West. (Julian/Crown, $12.95.) John Anthony West is one of the latest of a long line of maverick scholars who argue that ancient Egyptian knowledge was actually imported from the lost civilization of Atlantis. In 1979 one reviewer said the book ''reads like a Rosicrucian primer, discussing the concepts of cosmic harmony . . . Pythagorean harmonics, hieroglyphics and symbolism, and mathematics.'' THE RUG MERCHANT, by Phillip Lopate. (Penguin, $6.95.) An Iranian rug seller who would rather be an art historian tries to save his business, situated on the Upper West Side's rapidly gentrifying Amsterdam Avenue, from landlords who want to triple his rent. Last year, our reviewer, Jerome Charyn, called the novel ''a sad, tight, lyrical song among the glittering ruins of Manhattan. . . . a quiet descent into an urban hell.'' HARDBALL: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner, by Bowie Kuhn. (McGraw-Hill, $5.95.) The former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn was so unpopular among fans that our reviewer, Daniel Okrent, wondered who would want to read his life story. In fact, he discovered, the book ''is a much worthier, more interesting and better-written book than the autobiographies we're used to getting from baseball's usual memoirists, the players. . . . It is in many ways a remarkable book, by a man who deserved better than the hand that most baseball writers - myself included - dealt to [ him ] during his tenure.''",1988-03-27T05:00:00+0000

The two-year-old dispute was one of the most contentious trade disputes, and the council had recommended sanctions if Japan did not yield. The Administration hailed the accord as proof that negotiations, rather than retaliation, could bring change. [ Page A1. ] House and Senate negotiators grappled with other trade issues, trying to sort out their differences before the Easter recess. [ D9. ] THE ECONOMY Sales of new homes rebounded smartly in February after three straight declines.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.57 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 1,998.34, and advancing stocks outnumbered declining issues 1,024 to 478. Analysts attributed the gain to the dollar's modest recovery and to takeover activity. [ D12. ] Bond prices moved higher in light trading, responding to a rise in the dollar. The improvement took place in spite of a rise in equity prices and stronger-than-expected economic reports. [ D19. ] Platinum futures prices surged $7 an ounce on news of U.S. economic gains and racial unrest in South Africa.

But if Blackledge, who led Penn State to the final No. 1 ranking for the 1982 season, emerges as a star with the Steelers, he will lend more luster to the acclaimed crop of quarterbacks drafted in 1983. In addition to Blackledge, who was the second quarterback selected, the crop included John Elway, the No. 1 pick; Jim Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien and Dan Marino. First, however, Blackledge must win the Steeler starting job. He will be competing with Mark Malone, who managed only one touchdown pass while throwing 11 interceptions in the last seven games of the season; Buddy Brister, a third-year pro, and Steve Bono, a former backup for the Minnesota Vikings.(AP)",1988-03-30T05:00:00+0000
