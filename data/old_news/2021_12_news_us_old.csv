Most people I know have complained about memory problems, provoked by difficult times and traumatic events, and compounded by the redactions and distortions of social media. We know we all remember things a little differently, with reality fracturing into competing narratives the further we get from any given occurrence. But when disaster is near-universal and the gulf of disagreement vast, its easy to question our own recollections as suspect. Here, then, are books full of dueling paradigms, uncertain and chancy remembrance  with the past looming both as a resource and as a nightmare, and the future at its mercy.",2021-12-03T09:55:09+0000

Two enormous volumes of plates, the size of 19th-century ledgers, and an accompanying almanac, Annals of the North  the dimensions of a hard-bound dictionary  constitute this account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, beginning in 1972 and extending past the end of the 20th century. Peress, from Paris, went to Derry as a young Magnum photographer, knowing little English; right away he witnessed the British Armys massacre of 14 civilians in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Within a year, he had embedded himself so thoroughly that his photographs were often called upon as evidence in court. He developed ties with many people, sometimes tragically; one of his closest Republican friends turned out to be an informer and was killed by the I.R.A. It is clear from this work  the title comes from the I.R.A.s Green Book  that Peress left a chunk of his soul in Ulster.

These vessels are the only residents of this more than 200-year-old traditionally built house, or kominka. A lopsided white one, with gently indented fingerprints mottling its surface like fish scales, rests on the decaying tatami in the large front room.

More than 30 countries, including the United States, have now detected the variant. But it is still unclear how contagious, dangerous and resistant to vaccines it may be. President Biden on Thursday extended a requirement for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses until mid-March and introduced a new requirement that international travelers be tested for the coronavirus one day before departing for the United States. After oil prices collapsed when reports of Omicron first emerged, OPEC Plus, a group of oil-producing countries that includes Russia, decided to stay on course with its plans to increase production  but said its meeting would remain in session in case adjustments were required. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the variant could prolong the supply chain problems that have caused persistently high inflation.

On the way to the checkout, he marveled at a product he said hed already purchased from a different dollar store: a clock radio with a built-in fish tank far too tiny for a fish, a cool dollar-store-only object. The entire place suddenly felt like a tidy analogue of Wilsons show: filled with things too mundane, too accidentally strange, too tacky or sad or flawed or lacking in panache, to actively star in anyone elses account of the world.",2021-12-07T10:00:12+0000

A push to develop such a vaccine began in earnest about a decade earlier and was gaining momentum. Thats something that Im spending a lot of time on, he said. Also, a lot of scientists are struggling in a positive way to make advances. It was, he went on, somewhat embarrassing that a new and updated flu vaccine had to be made every year.

us,Will Smith Is Done Trying to Be Perfect,"Will Smiths superpower as a performer  as a movie star  has always been his radiating charisma. Who else could have credibly portrayed Muhammad Ali, the most charismatic man ever? In King Richard, Smith transmutes that gift into something subtler but just as powerful in his portrayal of Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena. (Smith, as he was eager to acknowledge, was supported in the film by Saniyya Sidney as Venus, Demi Singleton as Serena and Aunjanue Ellis as the girls mother and Williamss wife at the time, Oracene Price.) Richard Williams, as embodied by Smith, is a man who has been physically bowed but not beaten. He has a limp from a racist attack as a child; his carriage is tense, a little unsure, as if always on alert for a sucker punch. Hes someone who has spent time beneath the underdog. And yet when it comes to Williamss daughters and his dreams for them of tennis greatness, Smith invests his character with his trademark on-screen self-assurance. That Smith, who is 53 and who this autumn published a searching memoir, Will, was able to express those disparate traits so effectively is something he attributes to the work, precipitated by that book, that he has lately put into himself. I wouldnt have been able to play Richard Williams in this way, Smith says, before I had examined my life and understood so many aspects of my childhood and how that affected the decisions I made as a parent.",2021-12-09T10:00:22+0000

After being convicted of that crime, Ruth (Sandra Bullock), did 20 years in prison. Now paroled, she telegraphs her angst with sunken eyes and chapped lips; the films sickly yellow lighting does the same, as does Ruths night-shift factory gig decapitating salmon. But the dead officers sons (Will Pullen and Tom Guiry) dont think that Ruth has repented enough  a judgment shared by the adoptive parents (Richard Thomas and Linda Emond) who raised Ruths orphaned baby sister, Katherine, to forget her older sibling. The adult Katherine (Aisling Franciosi) is haunted by memories of a mysterious brunette.

Since then, Dani Garcia, his restaurant in Marbella, Spain, picked up a third Michelin star (its now closed), and the chef formed his own company, Grupo Dani Garcia. Now, he has returned to New York and is on the marquee of Casa Dani in the Manhattan West complex, west of the Moynihan Train Hall. What Im doing at Casa Dani is not fine dining, he said. I want to showcase the culture of Spain, making it easy, fresh and fun, more like home cooking. He said a great deal had changed since he was first in New York, especially the increasing availability of ingredients. His thinking has also changed, he said. Twenty-five years of fine dining, which is more conceptual and less from the heart, is enough, he said. What hasnt changed is having Alberto Carballo, the chef de cuisine, at his side. A soaring 180-seat dining room, a sea of beige designed by David Rockwell, sits on a level below the bar and open kitchen. There are tapas; fried items like cod fritters; bigger portions (raciones), many with seafood; and rice and noodle specialties. There are also a few main dishes, including daurade and hanger steak, and even larger-format platters for the table like whole Spanish turbot. A section on the menu is devoted to fresh tuna prepared several ways, which Mr. Garcia considers to be representative of the soul of Spanish cooking.

And its not just the history of this location, which was built in 1911, and formerly housed Fifty, Commerce, Grange Hall, Blue Mill Tavern and a speakeasy before that. Were taking it back to a colonial tavern, Ms. Williams said, even including a Tavern Room, fitted with a dark wood back bar, a zinc counter, custom stools and compact booths. They also did their homework, looking to an old store in Virginia that was once a train station for floor and ceiling boards, a Vermont maker of Shaker-style furniture for the chairs and benches in the large dining room and even the fonts Ms. Sodi used for the menu. Its all about simplicity and craftsmanship, Ms. Williams said. Food in the tavern, open now with the dining room coming soon, starts with oysters served raw, pickled or fried. Then the choices are smoked cod cakes, country ham, marrow with mushrooms, greens with buttermilk dressing, spoon bread and baked apple. Wines are domestic, mostly East Coast. The dinner menu, in the sparsely decorated white-tablecloth dining room, will feature roasts like duck and pork. For breakfast, also on the horizon, there will be scrapple, porridge, eggs and smoked fish. In keeping with the historic approach, bartenders haul ice for drinks like milk punches and switchels in 25-pound blocks with vintage tongs, and electronics are hidden in drawers. There is no espresso machine. But at the same time, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi insist its not a theme park frozen in the past: They use olive oil, not typical of the era being evoked. It fits with some of our dishes, but were also thrilled to be using ingredients that arent French or Italian, to be exploring a new genre, Ms. Williams said.
