Zyed Benna, 17, and Bouna Traor, 15, were electrocuted while hiding from the police on a state electrical site in Clichy-sous-Bois, a poor suburb of Paris. In similar neighborhoods across the country, their deaths were viewed as a symbol of police misconduct. In its decision Wednesday, the court noted that the patrolman did not try to warn the boys of the danger of the site and that both he and the dispatcher had failed to alert the utility to the boys presence.

However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.

Anna Karenina, for example, the title heroine of the magisterial 1877 novel by Leo Tolstoy, thinks herself happy enough with her distinguished husband, her sweet-tempered young son and her impeccable standing in the highest levels of St. Petersburg society, until she meets a dashing cavalry officer and gives it all up for him. Her infidelity is not casual or discreet, as it is for other respectable women in her set, but helpless, urgent, terrifyingly intense; she doesnt know what hit her. The infidelity of the many filmmakers who have tried to tell Annas story on the screen is not, generally, of that kind. A novel of the length (over 900 pages) and complexity of Anna Karenina and a feature film of, say, two hours duration do not make an ideal match; dissatisfaction is inevitable, outright betrayal highly likely.

But in a twist of fate, it will also be the first New York City Marathon televised live nationally, so the country will have a front-row seat for the race, which is being run despite much opposition and with the sentiment among many New Yorkers that this is an insane use of city resources in the middle of a disaster.",2012-11-02T17:31:07+0000

The window has just been extended to three years, with the hope of getting a better picture of how many are in distress.

(HBO) WE BOUGHT A ZOO (2011) A Los Angeles journalist, Benjamin (Matt Damon), struggling to hold on to his family and job after the death of his wife, decides to move his 14-year-old son (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old daughter (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) into a dilapidated house with mountain views and a menagerie that has a lovely keeper (Scarlett Johansson, above, with Mr. Damon). Its for the good of his children, he rationalizes in this adaptation of the British journalist Benjamin Mees nonfiction book of the same title, directed by Cameron Crowe. The creaks, groans and clichs of the screenplay, which was written by Aline Brosh McKenna (27 Dresses) and reworked by Mr. Crowe are, however, finally outstripped by the attractiveness of the performers, those with two legs and more, and especially by the tenderness that Mr. Damon brings to his role, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Mr. Crowe doesnt linger over Benjamins despondency. Rather, she added, he gives it gentle due in passages that remind you that theres often a strain of melancholia in this directors work, a sadness that suggests that Mr. Crowe intimately knows the darkness and uses his movies as a way to resist (or deny) it. Whatever the case, you may not buy his happy endings, but its a seductive ideal when all of Gods creatures, great and small, buxom and blond, exist in such harmony. ",2012-11-03T05:00:06+0000

Americans for Responsible Leadership appealed the ruling, however, which automatically stayed the audit. The Fair Political Practices Commission asked an appeals court to lift the stay, but the court denied the request. Ann Ravel, the chairwoman of the commission, said her agency planned to ask the State Supreme Court to lift the stay, but acknowledged that voters would probably cast ballots on Tuesday without knowing who financed the Arizona groups donation. The voters are the losers in this, she said. ",2012-11-03T05:12:17+0000

To pull the election out, Romney needs to win several states where the polls show him basically tied with the president (or even slightly behind, in some of the latest Virginia polling) and then win a state or two from a list (Ohio, Wisconsin, Nevada, longer shots like Pennsylvania) where the polling has never really shown him doing anything but trailing.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Iran held Canadas government responsible for the court order, issued last week, which applied to Irans embassy in Ottawa, two former cultural centers and a diplomatic residence. Irans official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mr. Mehmanparast as saying the political motivations behind such a move are not hidden to anybody. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice temporarily froze the assets in response to a request filed by the family of an American, Marla Bennett, who was killed in a Jerusalem bombing 11 years ago that was said to be the work of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group supported by Iran. The Bennett family won a default judgment against Iran for $12.9 million in an American court but was unable to collect; they are now trying to enforce it with Iranian assets in Canada. It is unclear whether the court will allow the family to seize the properties. ",2012-11-06T01:05:52+0000

The exhibition, which was organized by the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, includes more than 120 examples of furniture designs for home and office as well as over 50 drawings, models, photographs, films and other materials, and is the first comprehensive retrospective devoted to Nelson (1908-1986), one of the best-known American designers of the postwar era. Although hes most famous for eye-catching designs like the Marshmallow Sofa, the Coconut Chair and the Ball Clock, Nelson  who was trained as an architect at Yale and was an influential editor at Architectural Forum magazine in the 1930s and 40s  was most passionate about designs role in the way people lived and worked. His 1945 book, Tomorrows Houses (with Henry Wright), espoused the family room and the storage wall; the latter, which was produced by Herman Miller, where Nelson was the director of design from 1945 to 1972, was one of his lasting contributions to the field. (He designed an L-shaped desk for Herman Miller that was a forerunner of the office workstation.) Among many other projects in his productive career, Nelson also did corporate image design for clients like General Electric and I.B.M.; he was the head designer for the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959; and he came up with a 64-foot-long car and a walk-in engine for Chryslers pavilion at the 1964 New York Worlds Fair.",2012-11-07T17:31:11+0000

A judge in Ecuador last year found Chevron responsible for environmental and other damages caused by Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, during nearly 30 years of oil production in the Amazon. Because Chevron says it has no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs  including indigenous peoples  are sueing the oil company in Argentina, Canada, Brazil and Colombia.

Like sufferers of all these illnesses, Nuzum seems by turns lovable, charismatic, exhausting, irritating, self-destructive, impossible and sometimes plain dumb.

us,Histories of War,"Earlier this year, a British publisher told me something that made me especially proud to write nonfiction. Nowhere else in the world, he said, is nonfiction for young people written as it is in the United States, where authors often select their own subjects rather than have them handed down by a publisher; find their own images rather than farm the job out to a photo researcher; and work closely with designers to lay out each page. He is right: American nonfiction for children and teenage readers is often a labor of love. Two new books about war, Steve Sheinkins Bomb and Doreen Rappaports Beyond Courage, offer particular excellence  vivid writing and original research inspired by personal passion  in a field that all too often is invisible.",2012-11-09T15:49:01+0000

us,Stealing the Sunlight,"In most childrens books, from Little Bear to The Jungle Book, nature exists as a kind of utopia, a lush playground with anthropomorphized animals. Its rare to find stories that realistically depict the natural world  as a beautiful but fragile realm under siege.

Because our children are so screen-addicted and nature-starved, we fear further exiling them from the outdoors with tales of environmental peril? Or maybe its because such stories would expose any grown-up who travels by aircraft or uses Ziploc baggies as an environmental offender. Whatever the reason, eco-lit needs more attention, and devotees will be pleased to discover a new addition from the Icelandic author Andri Snaer Magnason, who writes with a Seussian mix of wonder, wit and gravitas.

Melgaard brings in a large cast of collaborators and gives them very little direction, an approach, he says, that allows room for surprise. A New Novel by Bjarne Melgaard, on view at Luxembourg & Dayan, 64 East 77th Street, through Dec. 22, even has some fashion thrown into the mad, mad mix, thanks to a collaboration with Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler, who designed an evening dress inspired by Melgaards paintings, in versions to fit a 50-inch doll and also a 6-foot doll, as well as three mens ensembles in Melgaards size. Proenza Schouler fans might also notice material from the designers past collections upholstered onto Melgaards hulking, off-kilter furniture and patchworked into a rug on the gallerys ground floor. This kind of collaboration is a lot of fun and gives us freedom to play a little outside of our usual system, said McCollough and Hernandez in an e-mail.

Their answer, he added, was to be naughtier, more aggressive, more theatrically sexual.

I favor British folk and folk-rock artists like Shirley Collins, Ewan MacColl and Martin Carthy  and above all Sandy Denny, who died in 1978 at 31. (By then shed made her mark with the legendary folk-rock outfit Fairport Convention, but she might forever be best known for her ethereal vocals on Led Zeppelins Battle of Evermore.) Her voice, at once primal and refined, is like a solitary walk through the woods in late autumn. As for younger British musicians, Im smitten with the Unthanks, a Northumbrian band fronted by the sisters Rachel and Becky Unthank, whose rich, haunting harmonies are just right.

The missing journalist, a former Marine whose articles on the Syria conflict and the insurgent Free Syrian Army have been published by several news organizations, was last heard from on Aug. 13. A video that showed a person said to be Mr. Tice, apparently in the custody of Islamist militants in Syria, surfaced on Oct. 1, but its authenticity was never confirmed. American officials initially said they believed that Syrias government had detained Mr. Tice, who entered Syria without official permission. Last week, a State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said she had been urging the Syrian government to be more forthcoming with any information it might have about Mr. Tice.

us,Britain: Radical Cleric Wins Deportation Appeal," An immigration appeals tribunal ruled Monday that sending a militant Islamic preacher known as Abu Qatada to Jordan to face terrorism charges would violate his right to a fair trial under European human rights law. Judge John Mitting ordered Abu Qatada, 52, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, to be released from prison on Tuesday under tight bail conditions. The ruling was a blow to the British government, which wants to rid the country of foreign-born radical clerics it says are fomenting Islamic militancy. British security officials say Mr. Othman was one of Al Qaedas top operatives in Europe. Previous attempts to deport him were blocked by the European Court of Human Rights over concerns that evidence obtained from others under torture might be used against him in Jordan. The preacher, who is of Palestinian descent, was convicted in absentia of involvement in two bombing plots in Jordan in 1999 and 2000, and faces a retrial if returned home. Home Secretary Theresa May said the government would appeal Mondays ruling. Qatada is a dangerous man, she said. The government has been doing everything it can to get rid of Abu Qatada, and we will continue to do so. ",2012-11-13T01:10:49+0000

us,Report Says U.N. Failed in Sri Lanka," An internal review of how the United Nations handled the bloody final months of Sri Lankas civil war in 2009, when as many as 40,000 civilians were killed, has concluded that the response was a grave failure of the U.N., according to a leaked draft report. The panel, led by Charles Petrie, a former U.N. official, criticized what it called a sustained and institutionalized reluctance by staff members in Sri Lanka at the time to stand up for the rights of the people they were mandated to assist. The reports executive summary says many senior U.N. staff simply did not perceive the prevention of killing of civilians as their responsibility. The report also found fault with the way senior officials in New York dealt with the crisis. Officials chose not to speak up about broken commitments and violations of international law by both the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels because that was seen as a way to increase access to victims of the conflict. A spokesman for Secretary General Ban Ki-moon refused to comment on the draft but said the final report would be made public soon. Lyse Doucet, the chief international correspondent for BBC News who obtained the draft, reported Tuesday that the executive summary, which sets out the panels conclusions in stark terms, was removed from the final report.

us,Can American Diplomacy Ever Come Out of Its Bunker?,"When Ronald Neumann began his Foreign Service career in the early 1970s, he sometimes carried a pistol to protect himself. It was a reasonable precaution. American diplomats in those days lived without benefit of blast walls or security advisers, even in volatile countries, and consulates were at times housed on the ground floors of apartment buildings, with local families living on the upper stories. Neumann worked with a freedom that is scarcely imaginable for many diplomats today; he could go anywhere, by himself, and talk to anyone. In the early 80s, when he was the deputy mission chief in Yemen, Neumann got wind of a threat to burn down the embassy building in the capital, Sana. The Arab world was in turmoil at the time, after an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and months of mounting violence. Much of the anger was directed at Americans. The embassy was easily accessible to any passer-by, an ordinary house in a residential neighborhood with no police protection. But Neumann  whose boss was out of the country at the time  did not close it down. Then things became more serious: there were rumors that angry Palestinians in Sana were planning to attack Neumanns house. Neumann, a taciturn Vietnam veteran, took it in stride. I brought a shotgun home from the embassy and locked the front gate, Neumann told me. My wife asked me if there was anything else we could do. I told her no. So she said, In that case Ive got some curtains Ive been meaning to wash; I might as well do it now. I remember thinking, This is probably how they handled it when the Indian raids went down in the old West; just stay inside and mend the saddles.",2012-11-14T10:00:26+0000

Three companies  the SHS Group, the Council for Educational Travel-USA, and Exel  agreed to the settlement after the Labor Department accused them of overcharging the students for housing, reducing their wages to levels below those required by minimum wage and overtime laws. Hersheys was not accused of wrongdoing because it contracted with Exel to operate the packing plant. The students were in Pennsylvania as part of a State Department-sanctioned education program, but the department has terminated the Council for Education Travel-USA as a program sponsor for forcing the students to do arduous factory work. Under a separate agreement with the Labor Department, Exel will pay $143,000 in penalties for excessive workplace noise and for failing to keep proper records about workplace injuries.

I wanted to create awareness for animation, explains Ellison, whose hilarious alter ego, Case Case, is the anchor of the online pop culture journal Status Update. So rather than people uploading their work individually on YouTube, I thought it was important to create a more curated context. The selection of films will run the gamut from digital to analog  full-on C.G.I. to hand-drawn or stop-motion animation. Participating artists include Robert Bittenbender, Cody Critcheloe, Erin Dunn, Steve Emmons, Lauren Gregory, Ryan Whittier Hale, Rhett LaRue, Jacolby Satterwhite, Monira Al Qadiri and Lale Westvind, as well as Ellison herself, who will moderate a post-screening discussion.

(HBO) CROSSFIRE HURRICANE (2012) The director Brett Morgen culls from more than 1,000 hours of film, 500 hours of audio and 80 hours of new interviews to chronicle the 50-year history of the Rolling Stones and their transformation from, as Mick Jagger says, the band everybody hated to the band everybody loves. What sets the band apart from the rest? A chemical reaction seems to have happened, says Keith Richards (above, second from left, with his band mates Charlie Watts, left, Bill Wyman, Mr. Jagger and Ronnie Wood). You cant really stop the Rolling Stones. You know when that sort of avalanche is facing you, you just get out of the way. Among the documentarys highlights are depictions of the chaos that accompanied the bands early tours; the birth of the Jagger-Richards songwriting partnership; the death of the guitarist Brian Jones in 1969 and the terror later that year at the Altamont Festival, where four people died; and Mr. Richardss 1977 drug arrest in Toronto, which threatened to break up the band. In a recent interview with Jon Pareles in The New York Times, Mr. Richards pronounced himself amazed at the bands longevity. There is a certain magnetic glue that pulls us all together, that overrides any other peripheral things, he said. Once we get behind our instruments, theres something bigger. The sum is greater than the parts. Theres just a feeling that we were meant to do this, we have to do this, and were just following the trail. ",2012-11-15T17:31:52+0000

In the last few years, Ljubljana has seen several notable museum openings, a new public bike-rental program and a major renovation of its Hapsburg-era opera house. With the country surrounded by Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, the national cuisine is infused with a cornucopia of influences; the capitals latest restaurants are bypassing novelty and getting creative with traditional Slovenian fare. There are also surprisingly offbeat facets of the city, like Metelkova City, a cluster of clubs and galleries that opened inside a complex of former military buildings after Slovenia declared independence, in 1991.

If youre socially conservative and populist but skeptical of Wall Street and big business, then youve probably argued the partys biggest mistake was to nominate a plutocrat and run a campaign tilted too far toward economic individualism and the interests of the rich. If youre fiscally conservative but libertarian on social issues, then youve probably made the case that Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock and anti-immigrant yahoos took the focus off the economy, and that cultural conservatives need to pipe down and let the party modernize on gay rights, immigration and abortion.

We even understand about understanding understatement and rejecting its clenched, single-strand-of-pearls aspirations. We did, after all, invent Target. In contemporary American fiction, class markers arent in short supply, nor are writers shy about using them.

On his new Web site, MenInCities.com, which goes live this week, a limited-edition collection of no more and no less than nine distinct but coordinating accessories is released each month. Everything, from worn-in leather wallets to antique-inspired beaded bracelets, is priced at $39.99. I love that you can see the entirety of every collection on one page, Alpert says. I want our customers to be able to shop without distractions and just focus on the designs in front of them. Pulling from previous experience as the designer for the boho jewelry line Ruby Kobo, Alperts first collection for Men In Cities is filled with easy, simple pieces that are enough to wear to the office (think muted silver cuffs and a deep blue bracelet with a small skull pendant). I wanted everything to be straightforward. I design items that I feel work well together, he says. My personal style is T-shirt, jeans, accessories. But If you feel like a rock star and want to wear 10 bracelets at a time, go for it. We want men to be able to add character to their own look, just a touch of formality with a cravat or tie clip.

Despite cutting among as many as four action scenes at a time, the director, Daniel Espinosa, maintains a visually coherent, narratively rational sense of time and space, no matter how fast the story shifts about, which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house, slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. The story, written by David Guggenheim, ebbs into more familiar cynicism rather than building toward political complexity, she added.

This year, however, the festivals budget was drastically slashed, by 37 percent (from $869,000 in 2011 to around $556,000 for the next three years) in a round of nationwide cuts made by the British Arts Council, the central source of government funding for all the arts.

us,New On Savile Row | The Alexander McQueen Mens Store,"Not much about the new Alexander McQueen mens flagship (the worlds first) on Savile Row in London suggests the dark, dour designs that the late artist was often earmarked for. Not even the colors. The designers posthumous homecoming to the street where, at age 16, he worked as an apprentice at the bespoke tailors Anderson and Sheppard and then at the neighboring Gieves and Hawkes, seems a fitting return to the companys British tailoring roots. Working hard to elevate McQueen mens wear to a higher level of detail and tailoring, the creative director, Sarah Burton, worked closely with David Collins Studio to outfit the stores interiors in the spirit of McQueens major muses like the arts, nature and military pageantry. Inside, the shops walls recall the faded grandeur of stately English homes, clad as they are with white plaster panels and acanthus carvings that, up close, are compounded barnacles, feathers and foxgloves. This play on nature continues throughout the store; display cases and tables stand on clawed feet, and tall mirrors are propped up by what appear to be squirrels. A narrow strip of red carpet meant to invoke a military procession traces a line down the center of the store, atop which stands a colonnade of brass clothes railings carved to look like a vertebrate. Perhaps the biggest extravagance is the back-of-house glass inspiration cube curated by Sadie Coles. The first exhibited work is a Sarah Lucas sculpture, Icon, from her Bunny series, that portrays the British dancer Michael Clark. Of course the point and legal stipulation of keeping a store on Savile Row is that there will be in-house tailors busy at work and visible from the street in their basement workshop. An important detail, among many, that the new McQueen store doesnt overlook.",2012-11-19T19:01:56+0000

us,"Easy to Wrap, Ready to Rock n Roll","AMY WINEHOUSE: AT THE BBC This is a smart response to an awful reality. When Amy Winehouse died last year, it was unclear how much unreleased music remained. But there was still room to fill out her legacy, as this CD and DVD collection, which gathers recordings she made for various BBC productions over the course of her career, attests to. Musically, the performances are taut, all the better to steady Winehouse as she sang, which was necessary because even as far back as 2004, she could be as wobbly as she was ferocious. Live, she could play it straight, or indifferent, or aggressive, her voice an otherworldly mumble. When she roared, like on a 2006 Tears Dry on Their Own captured on the DVD here, it gleamed, and she brought real sass to standards like Lullaby of Birdland. The 2007 take on You Know Im No Good is eerie, cutting and woozy. And some recordings open old wounds  is the barely-there Love Is a Losing Game from 2009 emaciated by aesthetic strategy or failing health? The DVD, an hourlong documentary about a 2006 performance backed only by guitar and bass in a tiny Irish church for about 100 people, is indulgent apart from the exquisite performance clips and snippets of an interview in which Winehouse recalls being flabbergasted by Thelonious Monk and Ray Charles in her youth. Performances like the ones in this set are too often considered detritus, less essential than an artists formal releases. But this collection reflects the breadth and power and, yes, wisdom of the BBC, the state-owned broadcaster that performs an outsize role in British cultural life, and with releases like this, may also be the nations official eulogizer as well.

Instead, the pop-up gallery hosted an intimate inauguration last Saturday night with Questionable Beliefs; Part 3, an exhibition by the artist Danny McDonald. The evening began with various set pieces trickling out from the diminutive storefront: first a fortune teller, then Turkish delights dispensed from an emergency rations box, black light manicures administered curbside, a purple question mark funerary wreath was brought forth. McDonald is a veteran on the downtown scene having worked under Colin de Land at his American Fine Arts Gallery in SoHo during its 90s heyday. The artist intended his presentation at Magic Fingers to read as a tableau vivant in the form of a theatricized political cartoon. As darkness fell, the curator Alison Gingeras emerged sweeping a witchs broom, presumably to clear the area for McDonalds alter ego Mindy Vale, who masquerades as a Gypsy horror drag queen. Minutes later with a dead megaphone in hand, Vale popped out of the front window lamenting the loss of electricity and the kinds of hardships many New Yorkers have suffered of late and then, sitting on step stool, proceeded to cut up $100 bill doormats and toss sections into the crowd as a symbolic Robin Hood gesture. The events crescendo was Vales karaoke performance of the Oliver Twist song Who Will Buy? before she ran up the block with three pink balloons headed for the after-party at The Pyramid Club. As Gingeras obliquely summed up the performance, Mindy is the perfect ambassador to preside over this return to the East Village.",2012-11-19T21:00:56+0000

us,New (Kids) Label Alert | Ellas Wool,"A year ago, Vibeke Kvan Johansen noticed that in the span of two weeks her local Brooklyn playground went from teeming with about 200 children to having just 5 or so on its jungle gyms. The weather, of course, had become cold. But the emptiness was still strange to her; in Johansens native Norway, where a warm day is 30 Fahrenheit, children frolic outside all year long. The secret: a layer of not-at-all-itchy merino wool under their clothing (right against the skin). Johansen, a former hair and makeup artist and mother to Ella, 4, and Mikkel, 17 months, asked nannies and parents in her neighborhood what their little ones had on beneath their outerwear, and not one said wool. So, shes made it her mission to spread the woolly word, bringing Nordic knitwear brands to the United States and selling their bodysuits, leggings, hats and more on her Web site, ellaswool.com. Why wool? Its a heat regulating material, absorbs 30 percent of its weight in moisture before feeling wet, is softer than cotton and is better for those with allergies or sensitive skin. But perhaps its best benefit is that it allows children to play outdoors when the temperature drops, which, if youre a parent is always a good thing. (Active children eat all their dinner and go right to bed!) Its my mission to have as many kids as possible outside to play all year long  with style, Johansen says. I already see myself as the wool queen, she adds with a laugh. Maybe not of the U.S. yet, but at least of Park Slope.",2012-11-19T22:00:59+0000

Rather, she said, they were excited about another platform for their books. The app is free but comes with only one digital book, to let customers test the experience. Two other books will be available for purchase through the app at $4.99 right away. Additional e-books will be made available once a month.

As much as the Alpina summons the rich chalet atmosphere one would expect to find in Gstaad  fireplaces, goat-hair throws, fondue  there is much about it thats refreshingly exotic to Switzerland. And that suits Onno Poortier, the Dutch-born hotelier behind the project, just fine. There are enough traditional hotels in Gstaad, he said. To start, the 21,500-square-foot Six Senses Spa comes from Thailand. (It has a Himalayan salt room and an appealingly primitive cave thats used for couples massages). The cigar lounge was inspired by one inside the Partags cigar factory in Cuba. Theres a Swiss stbli eatery specializing in fondues and raclettes, but also a branch of the extravagant Japanese restaurant Megu. Even the price scheme seems a strange hybrid: rooms start at about $910 per night, but that includes a $320 credit to spend on aprs-ski cocktails, among other things. The hotel jealously guards its Alpine serenity.

us,Fooled You,"You could argue that the fundamental question behind all literature is: What does it mean to be human? Some people have even argued that storytelling itself is what makes us more than just monkeys with iPhones  that Homer created the modern consciousness, or that Shakespeare (as Harold Bloom has it) invented the human identity. In recent years, however, literature has lost a lot of ground on that score to evolutionary psychology, neurobiology and computer science, and particularly to the efforts of artificial intelligence researchers. So as we wait for the Singularity, when our iPhones will become sentient and Siri will start telling us what we can do for her, many of the savvier fiction writers have begun to come to grips with the fact that the tutelary spirit of the quest for the human may not be Dante or Emily Dickinson or Virginia Woolf, but Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped start the revolution in computing.",2012-11-21T16:56:21+0000

But since he turned 50, around the turn of the century, hes published lovely historical fiction about the disastrous sexual misunderstandings of youth (Atonement, On Chesil Beach), and contemporary fiction about an alternative-energy researcher (Solar) and a deeply sane, happily married surgeon (Saturday).

For that reason, Thomas, who teaches writing and journalism at Princeton and is the author of several books, concentrates on Eisenhowers foreign policy and national security decisions to the exclusion of almost everything else.

Yet its reputation as an intellectual and cultural hub still lingers  five Nobel Prize winners are associated with the city, including the economist Amartya Sen and the poet-novelist-painter-songwriter Rabindranath Tagore. But like the rest of India, this clamorous yet charming city is changing: in 2011, the democratically elected Communist government of West Bengal was voted out of power after 34 years. For many Bengalis, this political transition reflects a desire to catch up with the rest of India.

Mr. Sarkozy was not formally indicted but questioned as a witness under caution, meaning that evidence obtained could be used against him in a future prosecution, the Bordeaux prosecutor told French news agencies. The accusations stem from Mr. Sarkozys first presidential campaign; no longer president, he has lost his legal immunity. Mr. Sarkozy denies that he took any money from Ms. Bettencourt, now 90, or that his campaign benefited from any illegal fund-raising. Ms. Bettencourts former accountant told the police that she handed over 150,000 euros (about $192,000) in cash and was told the money would go to the Sarkozy campaign. Mr. Sarkozys party, the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, is in the midst of a prolonged and bitter leadership fight. A Sarkozy protg, Jean-Franois Cop, and a former prime minister, Franois Fillon, both claim victory in an internal party vote. Reports on Thursday said Alain Jupp, a former prime minister and foreign minister who helped found the party, would serve as a mediator. Mr. Sarkozys own popularity has been rising again.

Sephardic Jews already benefit from a preferential naturalization procedure that requires them to live in Spain for only two years before claiming citizenship, but the change means that Jews will have to present only a certificate confirming their ancestry to claim a Spanish passport. The government did not say how many Jews it expected to apply for citizenship, but it noted that a large number of Sephardic Jews lived in Turkey and across Latin America. While estimates differ, the number of Jews living in Spain  25,000 to 45,000 people in a population of 47 million  is only a fraction of the number who lived in the country before 1492, when Jews were told to convert to Christianity or go into exile.

The judge, Mara Lourdes Afiuni, refused to enter the courtroom, and the judge presiding over her case ordered the trial to proceed without her. Ms. Afiuni was arrested in December 2009 after ruling that a jailed businessman should be freed while awaiting trial, a move that angered President Hugo Chvez.

us,Whats on Thursday,"6:45 A.M. (MoreMax) BEGINNERS (2011) In the first of two father-and-son tales starring Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer (above left, with Mr. McGregor), in an Oscar-winning role, plays Hal, the septuagenarian father of Oliver (Mr. McGregor), for whom he has two announcements: that he is gay and that he has terminal cancer. This film from the writer and director Mike Mills weaves together two love stories, one past and one present, that gradually fuse into a single life. Goran Visnjic plays Hals much younger partner; Mlanie Laurent is Anna, the French actress who sweeps Oliver away from his misery; and a scene-stealing Cosmo is Arthur, Hals Jack Russell terrier. So much of Beginners seems, looks, sounds, feels so hermetically perfect you may long for some air to blow, stir and even mess up its bright Los Angeles homes, the swanky old hotel where Anna stays and all these precious moments, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Even so, the movies attractions are undeniable, including its narrative design, which seems more complex than it is, but is engaging to piece together. And the performers are charming, particularly Ms. Laurent and Mr. Plummer, with his killer eyes (still seducing after all these years) and a voice that echoes in your ears. In Big Fish (2003), at 6:50 p.m. on HBO Signature, Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom (Mr. McGregor is his youthful version), a traveling salesman from Alabama who has spent a lifetime embellishing the truth in this fantasy from Tim Burton, adapted from the novel by Daniel Wallace. Billy Crudup is Blooms estranged son, Will, a reporter in Paris who has been summoned home for a deathbed reconciliation, during which Edward elaborates on his biography. Edwards doctor asks: Wouldnt Will prefer to believe that on the day of his birth his father was subduing a legendary catfish rather than selling household gadgets in Wichita? The movie insists that the only possible answer is yes, and thus chooses maudlin moonshine over engagement with the difficulties of real life, which is exactly the choice Edward has made, A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. ",2012-11-29T06:00:09+0000

us,Spielbergs Lincoln and Its Critics,"In the wide-ranging online conversation about Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushners Lincoln, its been interesting to watch the movie be praised and criticized for the same artistic choice: Its determinedly narrow focus on the month or so of politicking and debate that pushed the 13th Amendment through a reluctant House of Representatives. To the films fans  my op-ed colleague David Brooks and A.O. Scott are in-house examples, but there are many others  this narrowing brings the democratic process to life in a way that few political movies ever have, capturing the squalor and vigor, the glory and corruption of the Republic in action, as Scott puts it, and throwing Lincolns distinctive balance of provisional cynicism and ultimate idealism into sharp relief. To itsvariousdetractors,this narrowing is a betrayal of the true story of emancipation, which was actually settled on the ground more than in the halls of Congress, through the agency of slaves as much as by the votes of politicians, and which failed to deliver fully on its promises (thanks to Reconstructions failures, and Jim Crows ascendance) precisely because of the kind of compromises that Lincoln the film treats as the better part of political valor.",2012-11-29T16:59:16+0000

Even their kale salad, dressed with fish sauce and lime juice and mixed with kohlrabi, stands out among the seemingly endless iterations of kale salads across the city. Ogrodnek and Stern had intended to keep their menu simple, and their prices low, but they abandoned that approach. Our original plan was to keep it low-end, or more casual, Ogrodnek says.

Matthew Benson, a spokesman for Ms. Brewer, said the program is neither Congressionally authorized nor enshrined in federal law. Ms. Brewers order reversed a longstanding practice by the states Transportation Department of giving drivers licenses to beneficiaries of deferred-deportation action, like asylum seekers, by accepting their work permits as proof of their authorized presence. The suit was filed on behalf of five young adults who were brought to the United States from Mexico as children. ",2012-11-30T00:58:27+0000

us,Whats on Friday,"2:20 P.M. (Starz) ORANGES AND SUNSHINE (2011) Emily Watson, above with Hugo Weaving, portrays Margaret Humphreys, a social worker in Nottingham, England, who, starting in 1986, exposed the deportation of as many as 130,000 children from orphanages and group homes in Britain to Australia between the 1940s and 1967. One deportee, now an adult, recalls being told at 10 that he was being sent to a sunny paradise where he could pick oranges off trees. Instead, many of the youngsters found themselves forced into hard labor and enduring physical cruelty and sexual abuse at places like the Bindoon Boys Town, presided over by the Christian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order. The victims were informed that their parents were dead, while their parents  mainly unwed mothers deemed unfit  were told that their children had been placed for adoption in better homes. This film presents a chilling portrait of bureaucratic stonewalling and denial as Margaret presents her evidence to politicians who meet her accusations with indifference and skepticism, express only a vague regret and assume no responsibility, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times about this drama, directed by Jim Loach from Ms. Humphreyss 1994 book, Empty Cradles. When she eventually faces a group of clergymen at Bindoon, she is met with absolute silence. He added: Rona Munros screenplay for Oranges and Sunshine is unnecessarily flighty. As the story ricochets between Britain and Australia, the film often loses track of time and becomes fragmented as it struggles to integrate too many subplots. What holds it together is Ms. Watsons calm, sturdy performance.",2012-11-30T06:00:06+0000
us,Russian Court Ruling Seeks to Ban Pussy Riots Videos," A Moscow court on Thursday ruled that videos of performances by the punk group Pussy Riot were extremist, falling under a law intended to rein in hate speech. The court called for limiting public access to Web sites and blogs displaying the videos. But the ruling is unlikely to cut off access to them, since it applies only to servers in Russia. One video from February shows band members in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior beseeching the Virgin Mary to rid Russia of Vladimir V. Putin, who was returned to the presidency in March. Last summer, three of the performers were sentenced to two years in a penal colony. An appeals court released one of them on bail in October. Thursdays ruling cited psycho-linguistic research proving that the videos humiliate various social groups based on their religious beliefs and contain hidden calls to rebellion and nonsubmission to authority.

Mr. Santos said that Colombia would withdraw from a 1948 treaty that allowed countries in the region to settle their disagreements in the court, which is in The Hague. In its ruling this month, the court reaffirmed Colombias ownership of a group of small islands but gave Nicaragua control of a portion of the surrounding waters.

The narrative powers of fashion photography have continued to play a central role here; in fact the Museum of Modern Arts first exhibition devoted exclusively to the genre was entitled Fashioning Fiction in Photography Since 1990. In recent years, technical developments in digital photography have led many photographers to tell stories by artificially enhancing or manipulating their images on the computer.

After a brief, passionate love affair with a distant cousin named Fusun, the narrator, Kemal, obsessively amasses objects that evoke their relationship in 1970s Istanbul. He has become, he says, the anthropologist of my own experience. As Kemal grows older he takes to visiting unlikely museums in the cities he passes through, from those that dramatize the lives of artists, writers and architects  Gustave Moreau, John Soane, Czanne, Mario Praz  to such particular institutions as the Museo del Mare in Trieste and the Muse du Temps, a clock museum in Besanon, France. In visiting these places, Kemals sense of what is possible in the disposition of objects grows ever deeper. As he views the playing cards, rings, necklaces, chess sets and oil paintings of the State Museum of Wrttemberg, he becomes convinced that Fusuns possessions deserved display in comparable splendor. He realizes that objects beget narrative, just as stories need objects.

Culture, she writes in the introduction to Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art From Egypt to Star Wars,  is now largely defined by all-pervasive mass media and slavishly monitored personal electronic devices. The digital revolution has heated up our social interaction to the point where it has severely damaged our ability for sustained analytical thought, making the aesthetic encounter fraught with jarring interruptions and the chatter of competing visual and aural stimuli. Looking at art, then, is a discipline Paglia believes will help us retrieve the necessary stillness that can realign our senses and produce a magical tranquillity. Hence Glittering Images, a primer of sorts that takes its reader on a tour of 29 of Paglias favorite artworks, a list that includes the Laocon; Donatellos Mary Magdalene; paintings by Jacques-Louis David, Monet and Picasso; as well as examples of more recent trends like Pop, Conceptual, Land and Performance Art.
