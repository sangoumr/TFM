In place of these familiar con stituents of the modern paint er's career there was instead a steady flow of observation, inspiration, and realization. Avery was one of the purest painters of the twentieth century, not only in America but anywhere, and his work remains even now a miracle of untroubled clarity and lyr ic grace.",1970-01-04T05:00:00+0000

There is the dimension of humanity to its humor so that you can love it as well as laugh at It. Last of the Red Hot Lovers is the story of Barney Cashman's battle to join the sexual revolu tion. For my money, it is Mr. Simon's most consider able achievement to date. Robert Moore's staging makes most agreeable use of visual humor. James Coco as Barney is a joy and Linda Lavin, Marcia Rodd and Doris Roberts are admirably contrasted. Of course Mr. Simon has done it again. But I think he may have done some thing more.

Rough play, squeezing or dropping the pup can cause injury. As for the older dog, a finger in the eye is likely to cause snap ping or biting. There is a temptation for everyone in the family to pick up the dog or to romp with him. Too much exercise will ex haust the pet. A bed should be provided in a quiet, draft free corner, where he can sleep undisturbed.",1970-01-04T05:00:00+0000

I don't worry about whether such a namechange will fool anybody; I'm more impressed by the stockholders' faith in the efficacy of symbols. This is the same com pany, of course, whose management scored the miscasting coup of the year by expressing its man in the efficacy of symbolsby giving Barbra Streisand the title role in Hello, Dolly! However, if Fox had been casting the film four years ago, the role might have gone to Julie Andrewsas six years ago it would have gone to Elizabeth Taylor, and 13 years ago to Grace Kelly.

us,The Screen: 'Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots' Opens,"AS Tennessee Williams's play, ""The Seven Descents of Myrtle,"" was being turned into a movie, it went through several title changes, including ""Blood Kin"" and ""Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots,"" the latter being the title of the film that opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux East and Trans-Lux West Theaters. I mention ""this information  ordinarily the sort that belongs in a scholarly footnoteonly because it illustrates the futile indecision that still racks the entire movie.""The Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots"" is slapstick tragicomedy that looks and sounds and plays very much like cruel parodyof Tennessee Williams. However, it may well be that any slapstick tragicomedy must, by definition, be parody.The locale, a decaying old Delta, plantation house that Williams once called Belle Rive but now is named Waverley, is as familiar as the life- and death-forces who do battle within it.They are, in inverse order of their ability to conceive issue: Jeb Stuart Thorington (James Coburn), the last of the legitimate Thoringtons, a man who seems oddly muscular for someone suffering from terminal cancer of his one lung; Myrtle (Lynn Redgrave), the healthy hooker whom Jeb has married on ""The Happy Couple"" television show, to get children and a $3,500 check to restore Waverley, and Chicken (Robert Hooks), Jeb's black, alluvium - earthy half - brother, who possesses the new blood by which the Thoringtons will survive.While dat ole debil ribber (the Mississippi) rises to flood stage, Jeb lies dying in his room at the top of the house dreaming theatrical flashbacks (he and Chicken used to take their whores together and apparently, though it's never really clear, have each other).Downstairs, Chicken quietly waits for Jeb to expire, while Myrtle spends most of her time running between the floors, trying desperately to get Jeb to make love to her, and making love to Chicken, who possesses a legal deed to what she wants to inherit.The movie is haunted by ghosts of earlier, more memorable Williams characters who are easily identifiable even though there have been some changes in sex and color. Myrtle has the strength of Stella Kowalski and carries on in non-stop, expository monologues that could have been tailored for Baby Doll. She's down at the heel, but not at the bosom.Jeb fondles Big Mama's Old Mardi Gras gown and carries on like Blanche DuBois, though he looks like Lee Marvin. Chicken is Stanley Kowalski in the blackface that Williams pretty well ignored in his earlier plays.Sidney Lumet, who improved Williams's ""Orpheus Descending"" when he returned it into ""The Fugitive Kind"" with Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani, has directed this new film with a kind of desperate extravagant theatricality, which can't hide the fact that the original play, adapted and expanded by Gore Vidal, might better have been written by Ronnie Graham as a sketch for ""New Faces of 1952.""Lumet actually stages some scenes as if they were taking place within a proscenium, which I rather like, but the frantic, farcical pacing makes the performers, especially Miss Redgrave and Hooks, seem even more inept than is, perhaps, absolutely necessary, considering their talents.The title, incidentally, derives from the information that Myrtle, when introduced, is the lone survivor of a topless, all-girl band called the Mobile Hot-Shots, whose other members all seem to have expired rather violently.One, I remember, was ravished under a railway trestle by person or persons unknown. It's a curious thing about Williams, especially late Williams, that what happens off-stage is often more vivid than what happens on.",1970-01-15T05:00:00+0000

It is a play that seems to have been torn out of a human soul, a tale told by an idiot signifying a great deal of suffering and a great deal of gal lantry. Clearly Williams has put an almost agoniz ing amount of himself into the play. Yet it is at times enormously funny as well as poetically mysterious, and it is illuminated with that special theatricality that Williams has always shown, even in the lower depths of his career. Mil ton Katselas's staging is most striking and Peter Wexler's most beautiful setting not only uses the Beaumont Theater better than ever before but pro vides the visual accompani ment to the fantasy. Jes sica Tandy is quite mar velous as Camille and I ad mired equally Clifford David as Byron and Philip Bosco as Charlus. This is a lovely play, a play of gen uinely poetic vision.

us,"Screen: A Royal Battle of the Sexes:'Anne of 1,000 Days' Bows at Plaza Burton Cast as Henry Miss Bujold Stars","NO American playwright has ever found a completely satisfying language for historical drama. Several years ago, in his ""A Lion in Winter,"" William Goldman decided to make Henry II of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine sound like a contemporary suburban couple who had stumbled backward through their television screen and landed in a bickering heap in history.One of the most prolific and tireless of American playwrights, the late Maxwell Anderson (""Elizabeth the Queen,"" ""Mary of Scotland)"" developed his own neo-Elizabethan verse-and-prose rhythms that were more stately than dramatic. However, I've always remembered Anderson's 1948 ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" with a special fondness, principally because of the performances given by Rex Harrison as Henry VIII and by Joyce Redman as Anne Boleyn, the second of Henry's six wives. My suspicion that ""Anne"" was really an actors' vehicle is now confirmed by the movie version that opened yesterday at the Plaza Theater.This ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" is one of those almost unbearably classy movies, like ""A Man for All Seasons"" and ""Becket,"" that have a way of elevating the reputations of moviemakers without doing much for the art. It's been photographed in color and with care in all sorts of lovely English settings; the Tudor costumes are chic and seemingly wrinkle-free; it has a score by Georges Delerue that is mostly alarums and excursions, punctuated by an occasional madrigal, and it makes an extremely complex period in English history (the Reformation) comprehensible by defining it in terms of private personalities who were also public figures.Like the original play, the screenplay by John Hale and Bridget Boland, from an adaptation by Richard Sokolove, is the story of Henry's courtship of Anne (while he is still married to Katherine of Aragon), his break with Rome when he decides to divorce Katherine to marry Anne, and his final break with Anne when she cannot provide him with a male heir.The play has been opened up considerably, to take advantage of the exterior locations, but the heart of the film is still a sort of epic battle of the sexes, with Richard Burton, as Henry, in one corner, and Genevieve Bujold, as Anne, in the other. Burton, whose film career has included a series of almost-great performances (""Look Back in Anger,"" ""Night of the Iguana,"" ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""), is in excellent form and voicefunny, loutish and sometimes wise.Miss Bujold, the French-Canadian actress (""King of Hearts,"" ""Isabelle""), is a constantly delightful surprise as the young girl who first comes to respect Henry for the power she can wield, and then, just about the time he is growing tired of her, to love him. I say she's a surprise only because she has such a perfectly conventional beauty that her intelligence seems an unexpected dividend.It is the very real intelligence of these two performers, as well as of Anthony Quayle (Cardinal Wolsey) and John Colicos (Cromwell), that lessen the pompous effect of the Anderson dialogue. ""By God!"" Henry might say, ""Nobody has ever talked to me like that before!"" And you know he's about to tell Anne how beautiful she is when she's angry.Anne, on the other hand, is gifted with the sort of foresight favored in second-rate hindsight dramas: ""My Elizabeth,"" she screams at Henry, ""will be a greater queen than any king of yours!"" When Henry goes letching after Anne, old Wolsey is likely to wink and observe: ""Where the dove is, the hawk cannot be far behind.""

us,Screen: 'Change of Habit':'House of Cards' Also Shares Double Bill,"THERE's something good to be said for do-gooders to judge by ""Change of Habit"" and ""House of Cards,"" the mixed bag of brightly colored dedication and melodrama that was opened yesterday at local houses. In short, the good guys triumph in good causes, more or less, a fact that's been commendable even before film was invented.But each item in this double bill is merely exemplary of professional technique and dialogue rather than memorable characterization and emotion. And, despite the obvious fireworks and sincerity, ""Change of Habit"" and ""House of Cards"" simply emerge as satisfactory entertainments.Since they are not literally comparable, it should be noted that ""Change of Habit"" is a mite closer to true dedication than ""House of Cards."" In ""Change of Habit,"" the 35-year-old Elvis Presley, is, believe it or not, starring in his 31st film, this time as the hip, devoted medico heading a clinic in a Latin-Negro slum neighborhood.He is abetted by three nuns, portrayed by Mary, Tyler Moore, Barbara McNair and a newcomer to movies, Jane Elliot, who shed their traditional habits and are secretly sent out in fetching miniskirts and hairdos to get closer to the laity while alleviating suffering as nurses in that clinic.Devoted Presley fans, who have been fascinated by his swaying hips and rock rhythms ever since the 1956 ""Love Me Tender,"" should know that he strums the guitar to a few new tunes (including a rock spiritual in a church) this time too. But he is mostly the somewhat subdued, callow, slightly unconvincing and largely mystified Pasteur to the poor throughout most of the proceedings.He can't be blamed, really. As a speech therapist, Miss Moore gets herself involved with an autistic child, a stuttering, dangerously sick, teen-age Puerto Rican boy, and, amorously, with our confused hero. Miss McNair, as the black nun and herself a ghetto product, is really caught up with her own militant black ""brothers"" as well as the local loan shark tycoon, and Miss Elliot's run-in with supermarket scroungers eventually drives her from the church.Let's face it. Nuns and their habits have changed and if the religious they portray seem a bit too with it, enough to raise the hackles of their reactionary parish priest, Mr. Presley can't be faulted for remarking confusedly, ""I get a feeling there's a message here."" But it's only a slight and not terribly impressive one.The message is a good deal slighter but set in an infinitely more complex adventure format in ""House of Cards,"" the adaptation of the 1967 Stanley Ellin novel that was shot in Italy and France. In this case, George Peppard, as an itinerant boxer-writer-drifter in France, becomes enmeshed in single-handedly combating a sinister, neo-Fascist group bent on taking over Europe and, perhaps, America.Mr. Peppard is bland, tough and athletic as the impecunious adventurer, who is hired as a tutor of Inger Stevens's young son. Miss Stevens is not only pretty enough to turn any adventurer's head, but also, it turns out, is surrounded by a coterie of her late general-husband's relatives, millionaire refugees from Algiers, and others bent on fomenting that vague takeover, who have labeled her an alcoholic and generally unstable.The foggy indications are that Mr. Peppard is a gent, who is sort of opposed to their dirty plans, and a red-blooded American boy, who only casually has eyes for that rich widow-lady, Miss Stevens.Set against the opulent backgrounds of a Parisian mansion, a chateau in Dijon and Roman settings such as the Colosseum, his efforts to free her and her kidnapped son, become a long, improbable but action-filled chase, strewn with a half-dozen killings, in which complicated incidents often mystify rather than excite a viewer.Mr. Peppard, as noted, is an indestructible citizen, who, like the rest of the cast, is aided by some casual but sometimes effective lines. Miss Stevens is attractive either in gowns or practically nothing, as she shares a train berth with her rescuer. As members of that dastardly crew, Keith Michell, Ralph Michael, and Orson Wells help keep a viewer attentive on several occasions. Welles again plays a bearded, malevolent, Buddha-like villain that has become almost a stereotype. And, one got the feeling finally that ""House of Cards,"" despite all the complications, is largely a stereotype too.",1970-01-22T05:00:00+0000

us,'Female Animal',"THE distributors of ""Female Animal"" are touting this new sex teaser as a successor to ""Inga"" and ""Fanny Hill."" It's duller than either, at any rate. Here is a mess of pottage, replete with nudity and anatomical intertwining to mollify most Peeping Toms. This Italian-Spanish co-production creaked and panted into town yesterday, mooring at the Victoria (of all theaters!) and the Avco Embassy East.It's the old one, fresh from the Stone Age, about a bad girl  played by a comely, blank-faced and elastic brunette named Arlene Tiger  and How She Got That Way. Kicked out of home by a mean stepmother, she becomes a kind of jet set Cinderella as a servant in a household of rich, perverse worldings.There's papa, who casually hands the bewildered girl over to his svelte, longtime mistress. The spoiled son also scores. Let's see, who else? Oh, yesthe stable boy, who apparently is also a sideline plaything of the father. The girl's uncle fails, her cousin succeeds. The chauffeur, who may be just tired, snubs the lot of them.The sexual passages, with the alert photography underscored by sinuous music, are clearly the point. The acting, the English-spoken dialogue and the direction are atrocious, almost infantile. Miss Tiger's pursuers are, in order of prominence, Vassili Lambrinos, Andr Landzaat, Jean Avery and Robert Darchi.Sadder than all the wasted energy is the wasted scenery, a lush, tropical locale gleaming in handsome color. Otherwise, ""Female Animal"" just mews, carnally and piteously.",1970-01-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Johnny Cash Onstage and Off:Elfstrom Documentary at Theaters Here Among the Highlights, a Remarkable Debut","JOHNNY CASH: THE MAN, HIS WORLD, HIS MUSIC,"" which opened yesterday at the De Mille and several other theaters in this area, is a slightly lengthened version of a documentary shown last March over the National Educational Television network. Directed by Robert Elfstrom, the movie was fine on television, and it seems to me even better in the theater, where the color is truer, the visual detail finer and the audience situation more properly theatrical.Among the depressing clutch of cinma-vrit documentaries, ""Johnny Cash"" stands out both because its principal people are performers who belong onstage and because Elfstrom handles his camera with restraint unusual in a field much given to palming off trickery as truth.The movie follows Cash through parts of a few regular concerts, a prison concert, a concert and visit on a South Dakota Indian reservation and a recording session with Bob Dylan (""One Too Many Mornings""). Between times, Cash rests at home with his wife, June Carter, accepts a Country Music Record of the Year award, meets fans and auditions a couple of hopefuls.Although much time is given over to a visit to the Dyess Colony in northern Arkansas, where, in the mid-1930's, Cash spent his childhood, it never pretends that it is interpreting the ""Johnny Cash phenomenon."" At one point, Cash, who grew up in poverty and reported an income of $2-million in 1968, says ""I've learned to adapt very well to prosperity,"" and indeed he has, and he is no fool, and the film knows when to leave well enough alone.We are given many remarkable performances (more good songs than on any combination of Johnny Cash records I've been able to put together) and many remarkable glimpses of a man who in performance is well worth looking at. With his fight pants, ruffled shirt and massive frock coat (like the costume of a misplaced 18th-century highwayman), his massive frame, deeply lined face and utterly expressionless eyes he seems perfectly self-contained and wholly without need for the accoutrements of amiable stage personality.He is superb onstage, reserved and very decent off stage with his fans (a fine and rigorously uncondescending filming of a meeting with autograph seekers) or with family and friends in Dyess. Privately he is not so impressive, as if he were straining toward a slightly unnatural posture of meditative depth, except when he is with Miss Carter  whose open-featured, humorous and intelligent good looks work to humanize the Johnny Cash presence and whose musical talent (for example, in the rendition of ""Jackson"") helps to make that presence interesting.The best sequence in ""Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music"" doesn't feature Cash, or June Carter, or even Mother Maybelle or the Tennessee Three. Rather, it introduces a young man who is not, I believe, mentioned in the screen credits.His name is Don Freed, and he auditions two songs for Cash (""Bank of Mariposa"" and ""Come Away from the Roadside""). He plays the harmonica and the guitar, and he sings in a tight, pleading voice that seems to know all the conventions and truths of sadness. I think he is extraordinary, and if there were no other attraction (there are many), he would be reason enough for seeing the movie.",1970-01-24T05:00:00+0000

Like the aborigines' min min, an elusive light which beckons but remains unreachable, Sylvie's dream of further education seems futile. So the two run away deep into the Australian outback, a land of limitless sky and parched earth, a desert of gibbers and sometimes a willywilly. Their destination is the sheepstation of Gulla Tank and the sympathetic ear of a friend, Mrs. Tucker. In the honest frontier house hold of the Tucker family, Reg finds the meaning of discipline, and Sylvie the meaning of womanhood. With powerfully simple understatement Mavis Clark paints the harsh land down under and the people and wild things which survive there. Her strong, terse prose is reminiscent of Mary Patchett's Cry of the Heart and evokes tears. Her images are pragmatic and original: the rising moon looks like the round full yoke of a yellow egg, and an approaching train sounds like wind in the earth's stomach.",1970-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Other Voices':Documentary Studies Mental Treatment,"""OTHER VOICES"" is a cinma-vrit documentary, skillfully shot in black and white, dealing with the treatment of a few patients at the Delaware Valley Mental Health Foundation at Doylestown, Pa. The foundation, which occupies houses and house trailers in the Bucks County countryside, places some of its patients in residence with families who provide continual supervision as a background for the specialized, and, I believe, controversial therapy practiced by the foundation's director, Dr. Albert Honig. The filmmaker, David Sawyer, and his photographer and co-director. Robert Elfstrom, spent a year and a half visiting the foundation, photographing five patients during a major part of their residence.Dr. Honig calls his approach ""direct confrontation."" The doctor forces himself upon his patient's attention  arguing, yelling, bullying, embracing, wrestling. While the treatment pays full attention to psychological causes (everybody seems to have some kind of mother problem), direct assault is made upon the behavioral symptoms of the illness. Dr. Honig doesn't mind telling his patients what messes they are, and they respond in kind.Therapeutic sessions are highly dramatic, emotional, and sometimes violent. Dr. Honig is a large man who looks a little like Walter Matthau and sounds like a cross between Selma Diamond and Jackie Gleasonvangry. I assume he has a sense of humor. At least, when he sitsliterallyon the stomach of a frail looking young woman and compassionately asks, ""What can I do to help you, you poor thing?"" the answer, if he's not kidding, is painfully self-evident.One effect of Dr. Honig's approach is that the patient finds himself forced into a kind of dialogue, a posture as if he were being interviewed by a very bright, insistent and none-too-friendly journalist. As a result, and in spite of all the mauling, there seems to exist between patient and therapist (Dr. Honig and his assistants) a sense of real equality. ""We're not attacking the patient; we're attacking the irrationality,"" Dr. Honig explainsand the method of attack and the rhetoric call to mind certain aspects of old-time religion.Most of the patients seem very intelligent (all of them must be backed by plenty of money), but one is retarded, and he also is given no quarter. Over the year and a half the patients change physically. One young man apparently achieves a superb recovery; anotherequally promisingonly succeeds with the suicide he had desired since the beginning.The intrusion of the camera and the filmmakers seem to disturb nobody (though it is never ignored). Few of the therapeutic sessions are private anyway. Obviously, Sawyer and Elfstrom were out to make a movie, and not just to record treatment. I think they have succeeded, but the movie is tactfully, perhaps necessarily, less interesting than its material. For the purposes of art, truth is always less real than fiction.",1970-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'The Milky Way':Bunuel Weaves Surreal Spiritual Journey,"WOMEN, pronounced St. Chrysostom, are ""a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a deadly fascination, and a painted ill.""The good, fourth century mysoginist, just one of the dozens of saints, rascals, nuns, picaroons, inquisitors, heretics, bishops, whores and humble people who are either represented or evoked in Luis Buuel's marvelous new film, ""The Milky Way,"" clearly had an ambivalent attitude towards women. Because of Buuel's similar preoccupation with things he professes to abhor, the fine, irascible Spanish film director (""Thank God I'm an atheist!"") has often been suspected of ambivalent attitudes towards the Roman Catholicism he has renounced and the God he has denied.While there must always be a certain amount of ambiguity in any proclamation of atheism, there can be no further question about Buuel and the Church. That is, not after ""The Milky Way,"" which has the form of a lovely fantasy and the density of a theological essay, and which often sounds like the sort of shaggy dog story that might be told in a seminary.The film, which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is shaped as a sort of surreal Pilgrim's Progress undertaken by two contemporary, not especially pious Frenchmen. Pierre (Paul Frankeur), a bearded, virile, respectful old man, and Jean (Laurent Terzieff), his younger, skeptical companion, are making a pilgrimage (for reasons never specified) to the tomb of the Apostle James at Santiago de Compostella in Spain.En route, they have a series of extraordinary encounters with personages out of the past, including Priscillian, the fourth century Spanish bishop, martyred for his Manichean unorthodoxies, and the Virgin Mary, who appears to them sitting in a tree.At one point they meet the devil, lounging in the backseat of a sports car that's just been wrecked. He is a typically Buuelian devil, both polite and practical, who suggests to the poor Pierre, whose feet hurt, that he take the dead driver's new shoes. Later, they come upon a Jansenist convent whose nuns, not very enthusiastically, are helping one of their order to realize her desire for crucifixion. They also act as seconds in a duel between a Jansenist and a Jesuit, are instructed in the virtues of chasity in marriage, and finally, when they reach Santiago, find, not the Celestial City, but an empty tomb.While Buuel is obviously fond of Pierre and Jean, he's not exactly obsessed with them. He doesn't hesitate to drop them from time to time to pursue with greater freedom his principal themereligion as a man-made phenomenon whose dogmas have been the bases for religious wars, inquisitions and madly irrational theological arguments conducted with the utmost reason.The movie is constantly side-stepping itself to show, among other things, why Jesus wore a beard (Mary thought it suited him), the Marquis de Sade tormenting a helpless young thing who persists in saying there is a God, Priscillian apologizing to the Communion host (""It was not I who reaped and kneaded Thee"").Through all of the miracles and magical encounters, through all of the deadly nonsensical debates on the true meaning of the Trinity, and through all of the Alice-in-Wonderland-like discussions on the differences between consubstantiation and transubstantiation, Pierre and Jean maintain a saintly sanity that is, in itself, very funny and even moving.Unlike such an angry film as ""Viridiana,"" in which Buuel used Freudian psychology to attack the Church (specifically its concept of charity and the subsequent evil of pity), ""The Milky Way"" goes about its business with a comic, masterly cool that is more remorseless than anything he's done before. The film is closer in tone to his early, surreal ""Un Chien Andalou"" and ""L'Age d'Or"" than to the later, non-ironic, malevolent but comparatively gentle ""Nazarin"" and ""Simon of the Desert,"" which almost persuaded some people that Buuel was returning to the fold.One of the nicest things about ""The Milky Way,"" and about the only thing that indicates the director's age (he'll be 70 this year) is its technical facility. Buuel employs no fantastic effects, though this is a livelier fantasy than, say, ""The Wizard of Oz."" Everything is photographed straightforwardly, in cheerful but not bilious color, and seen with documentary-like clarity.For what is, in effect, his ""Greatest Story Ever Told,"" Buuel recruited a large cast of mostly French performers for many cameo roles, including Pierre Clementi (the Devil), Michel Piccoli (de Sade), Bernard Verley (Jesus), Edith Scob (the Virgin Mary) and Delphine Seyrig (the prostitute).Even if you're non-Catholic, as I am, ""The Milky Way"" can also be enjoyed as a kind of Pilgrim's Progress through the Buuel iconography. The film is packed with symbols that repeatedly recur in all of his films (dwarfs, doves, beggars, blind men, religious instruments, graves). And, if you're willing to do a little homework, the film can become so fascinating that you're likely to recall a disturbing remark made by one character, who materializes briefly and is identified in the cast only as The Lecturer. ""My hatred of science,"" he says with bored resignation, ""and my horror of technology will finally lead me to this absurd belief in God. . . .""",1970-01-27T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Ake Falck's 'A Time in the Sun' Opens:Young Bride's Illness Reversed by Love,"AT the very first, as the credits come on, it looks like a kind of micro-cinematography. Somewhat later, atter we know the characters, it devotes such close attention to fragments of human anatomy that it seems at times to be recalling those ""geography of the body"" movies that in provincial film societies used to substitute for art (and sex).But much later, after the hero and heroine have married and settled down to her pregnancy, the area of vision has widened to include rarely less than a bed, a body, or a corner of a cozy apartment. And it becomes apparent that Ake Falck's ""A Time in the Sun,"" which opened yesterday at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, has a visual program, a pleasant one, to match its decently sentimental story.The story concerns a handsome, successful young writer who meets a lovely young nurse who is dying of Hodgkin's disease. He marries her anyway, and gets her pregnantwhereupon she has both the baby and a complete reversal of the symptoms of her illness. Such a story, though in this case based on fact, pertains more to fantasy than to fiction. The film is wholly aware of its fantastic potential (the writer calls the girl his ""princess""), and it is just as aware of each exploitable turn in its tale of suffering and success.As with most women's pictures (a genre I highly admire), there is a fair blend of agony and ecstasy in ""A Time in the Sun."" But as with most women's pictures, the ecstasy is chiefly agony, and in health as in sickness the heroine has a pretty sloppy time of it.The misery of Hodgkin's disease and the radiation treatments (nausea; uncontrollable itching) is matched by the pain and anxiety of childbirth. The film stays close to both, but it exploits neither. Indeed, it understands the process of physical recovery as being an escape from the body's tyranny.Thus, the kinds of detail Falck chooses to photograph change as the characters' frames of reference change. He is especially good at figuring intimacy in terms of the camera's space (husband and wife virtually lean into the frame during their happy marriage idyl, and that frame closely defines the limits of their world). But he is especially bad at opening his film up, and two such sequences, a dance at the beginning and the new father's outdoor exaltation near the end, almost nullify the stylish discipline of the rest.But ""A Time in the Sun"" is really interesting only for its female lead. Grynet Molvig, a 28-year-old Norwegian pop singer whom I have not seen before, plays the afflicted girl with such intelligent, restrained, sustained directness that she achieves a performance of unusual excitement, which is totally in the service of her characterization. An attractive, unglamorous blond who looks a little like the late, wonderful Nicole Berger (""Shoot the Piano Player."" ""Story of a Three Day Pass""), Miss Molvig wholly avoids tricks or easy appeals to sympathyin a role that might have invited both. Her qualities suggest a thoroughly understood humanity, and they make me feel good about the profes-of acting.",1970-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Yet his arrest seems oddly peripheral to it. We learn of his legal briefs; of the young girl who spied on his family with an electronic device; of the credit world that judged him guilty before his trial; of the University of Am sterdam, which canceled his invitation to teach a term abroad.

He looks at his materialism (the longing for sleek and shiny comforts) and his politics (ves tigial, nostalgic: little more than a function of my desire not to grow old), at his intellectual style (that ambivalence prized by the old, despised by the young) and his professional role (the teacher teaches himself, diffidently at first, shame lessly after a while).",1970-01-29T05:00:00+0000
