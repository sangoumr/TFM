That's ""Flap,"" for Flapping Eagle, which also provides Anthony Quinn with his best role in several years, as a dim-witted tribal revolutionary and con man and the pride and problem of his home reservation. The picture is a delightful surprise, for several reasons.There is the sight of Mr. Quinn, after all those glum, one-note dirges, dimensionally stretching his central role with sly comic gusto and relish. There is Clair Huffaker's excellent adaptation of his novel ""Nobody Loves a Drunken Indian,"" with its cutting sociological ironies and beautiful, barbed-wire dialogue, handled by a solid gallery of unstereotyped, picaresque characters.And finally, you'll never guess who directed it, exquisitely at home on the New Mexico rangeland, with its Indian shantytowns. Carol Reed, that's who. Yes, Sir Carol, the distinguished British knight who mastered suspense and won an Oscar for the splashy ""Oliver!"" has quietly nurtured a blooming cactus of prickly humor and even pricklier truths.The real beauty of the picture is the crisp pacing and graceful dexterity as the tumbling, ribald antics of the hard-headed hero and his tribal pals build to a grave, touching and admirably restrained conclusion. If only one of those rock laments and a croupy vocalist weren't slopping up the sound track. And by the way, somebody, why is an ex-Army sergeantthat's Mr. Quinnwearing a Navy jacket?Sir Carol's direction is so snug and the parts so well-defined that the first-rate cast seems to be performing effortlessly. Among them are Claude Akins, Tony Bill, Victor Jory, Don Collier, Victor French, Rodolfo Acosta, Anthony Caruso and Susana Miranda. Shelley Winters adds a scalding note as a petulant madam.The plight of the American Indian is no laughing matter. The laughter here makes it matter even more.",1971-01-01T05:00:00+0000

Among his fantasies he not only etiokes Fellini, but also Fellini images. By evoking memories of other, much better movies, Ma zursky and Tucker simply call attention to the self indulgent emptiness of their own. They can be very funny men when they confine their scrutiny to the little disasters of con ventional family life, and when they work inside the frame of what is, in es sence, the blackout sketch. Unfortunately Mazursky and Tucker have insisted on making a movie about a moviemaker who doesn't have too much of interest on his mind, and who doesn't seem too different from the Hollywood freaks he puts down.",1971-01-03T05:00:00+0000

This is no great esthetic event: Norman Mailer was all too correct when he called Reid hip as a mind but square as a stylist. Yet there is little doubt about the book's pertinence to all sorts of current concerns. It addresses the youth culture and the sexual revolution. (It is another of the many books that Charles A. Reich should have read before writing The Greening of America.) It squarely confronts the major issues of women's liberation. (Happily, Kate Millett did read it before she wrote Sexual Politics.) It surpasses Herbert Marcuse's attempts to reconcile Freud and Marx. It hasn't an elitist bone in its body. And whereas 15 years ago this reviewer contemplated Reich's theories of sexeconomy and orgone energy with horrified shudders, reading The Mass Psychology of Fascism today made him, wonder a little.

us,Books of The Times,"There is a discouraging paradox about the Orangeburg shootings of Feb. 8, 1968, in which 3 students of South Carolina State College were killed and 27 wounded. For the events leading up to the incident were both inevitable and preventable. They were inevitable in that the confrontation between the police and students came as the lethal climax to a series of piledup grievances. But the killings could have been prevented at any given moment by an intelligent action or word. That the stu dents were unruly and provocative, that they used Insulting language and threw things, has been admitted. But that the only way to handle the students was to shoot Into them, seems, in spite of a jury verdict that justified the police, scarcely proven. At least it is scarcely proven in this documented analysis by two reporters who covered the case then and who believe it of sufficient importance not to let it dis appear from the consciousness of Ameri cans. For they show that the highway pa trol was insufficiently trained in riot con trol and, what is worse, rudderless. There was then, as in the events leading up to the killings, no leadership on the part of the Establishment from the Governor, Rob ert E. McNair, down. ",1971-01-05T05:00:00+0000

Some of the color photography has a cool, crisp flavor, especially when the camera scans various Las Vegas facades. But it's truly sad to see the involvement of such people as Broderick Crawford, Scott Brady and Kent Taylor in the smoking out of a Nazi-minded counterfeiter.The other film, ""Satan's Sadists,"" is the main offender, a ragged little cash-in on depravity and bloodshed, which the sponsors proudly announce has already coined a mint in theaters across the nation. ""See wild hippies on a mad murder spree!"" promise the ads, also suggesting a link with the Tate murders.For the first half hour, all we could take, a group of many, human vermin bully, vilify and slaughter three helpless civilians in the remote California desert. Then they go after more. Brady and Taylor, hapless guys, show up in this one, too.But the saddest sight of all is Russ Tamblyn (remember ""tom thumb""?), as the psycho masterminding the killers.

Under all those layers of make-up and charm, Mr. Barkan is, I suspect, an actor of real talent.

us,The Screen:Museum Series Offers Ambitious 'Akran',"The current movie in the Whitney Museum's New American Filmmakers Series is ""Akran,"" by Richard Myers, who lives and works in OhioAkron, of course, ""Akran,"" which is a work of ambition and great technical virtuosity, runs for almost two hours and features a cast of, I do believe, hundreds, along with the public and private places, the street corners and back lots of the city that in some degree is, or helps create, the subject of the film.More immediately, the subject is a young man (Robert Ohlrich) who remembers and experiences and perhaps dreams whatever goes on in ""Akran,"" and who escapes each of the film's crises. It is, therefore, a kind of subjective biographywhich is at the same time meant to be universal, pretty much to the degree to which it is also subjective. In this, ""Akran"" resembles much recent narrative work, and, in film, the early semi-autobiographical movies of Jerzy Skolimowski. I don't know whether Myers intends ""Akran"" as autobiography (for what it's worth, Mrs. Myers plays the hero's girl and wife and sometimes, I think, mother) but it doesn't much matter. The film's mode is personal confessionnot so much of conscience as of consciousness.But the film's means are highly unusual, and in technique ""Akran"" must represent something of a tour de force. With a sound track mix consisting of more or less patterned noise along with snatches of monologue in the air or via tape or television (but almost no ordinary dialogue) and with an overpowering visual style that takes its start in sequences consisting wholly of stop shots, ""Akran"" leaves no doubt about the range and intensity of its ambitions.I rather like the intensity and resent the range. As it deals with the intimacies of its hero's life and especially his past, ""Akran"" achieves a density of image, mixing memory and desire, that does more to validate the poetry of the recollected commonplace than anything else I have seen in recent movies.But where it strains toward a major overview of the quality of the American experienceseen through the moods and anxieties of its protagonistit begins to lose as much as it had gained, and curiously, becomes simpler as it means to become more complex.A voice begins intoning ""Paul Hindemith is dead; Pope John is dead; Jean Cocteau is dead . . ."" Television announcers give notice to all the sublimations of our collective guilt. And finally ""life"" appears  as a peep show, as a penny arcade, as one or another of those handy metaphors that, at least in cinema, are generally substitutes, rather than symbols, for what cannot possibly be genuine understanding.Occasionally, an attempt at major historical understanding does succeed in film, but only (as in ""Rules of the Game"" or ""Weekend"") in works of great clarity, formal control and intellectual precision. I don't think that Richard Myers has, or really pretends to, these virtues. The virtues he does have are real and rare enough  but they have to do with some of the potentials of the screen and with the compulsions of a private imagination, and not with the decline of Western Civilization.But there is enough going on in ""Akran"" to command anyone's attention. And much of that is lovely and wonderfully difficult, with a regard for strange nuances that is one of the pleasures of the movies.",1971-01-15T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: From Ear to Ear' Is Without Importance,"""From Ear to Ear,"" the English-dubbed French melodrama that opened yesterday at the Forum Theater, is of such little interest that to compare it with bad movies would give it something akin to identity and status. Although it is unpleasant, it is without importance, like bad breath, greasy food, junk mail or a slight fever.Very early in the movie, which is said to be adapted from a prose work called ""The Night of the Perverted Women,"" there are indications that someone connected with it has heard of Genet's ""The Maids,"" but never bothered to read it. Two disagreeable women, who are cousins as well as lovers, and who appear to be in their late 20's, live with the mother of one, a widow, and the widow's second daughter, a completely paralyzed mute.When the girls aren't making love to each other or to a couple of available men, or when they aren't whipping up little dinners from a cookbook called ""La Cuisine  Eros,"" they torture the third girl, usually by exposing their bodies to her. ""From Ear to Ear"" is a film of failed sex scenes, and very little mystery, except that I never did figure out who plucked the paralytic's eyebrows, or why.On the same bill with the feature is an equally unmemorable short, sponsored by the Fur Information and Fashion Bureau of New York, in which a lot of ghastly, breastless models swish around in various mammalian pelts, all ranch-bred, of course.For the record I should point out that although the ads for the feature show a woman's severed head and ask the question: ""How long does it take a razor sharp knife to slice . . . .?"" ""From Ear to Ear"" contains no decapitations. I suppose that people who really feel the lack of this sort of thing might take their case to Mrs. Bess Myerson Grant.",1971-01-16T05:00:00+0000

The promise of a brighter future comes at a time when the Federal subsidy to public education has actually been shrinking. From its highest point of 8 per cent of the total expenditure 1967, it is expected to decline to just below 7 per cent in the current fiscal year. The National Education Association, in disclosing these estimates, suggests that a fair sharing of school costs would call for equal contributions by local com munities, the states and the Federal Government.

As Nora, Claire Bloom is giving a thrilling performance that has a complexity and depth to it that remind me of the in stinctive doomeager pas sion she brought to her Juliet at the Old Vic many years ago. Donald Mad den's Torvald is also a commanding portrayal and the rest of the cast were excellent. Christopher Hampton's new adaptation has the freshness of a new play about it.

Since then he has divided his time between New York and Paris, meanwhile staying remark ably faithful to his original in spiration, which might be said to owe equal fealties to the vivid decorative effects of French painters including Matisse and Raoul Duly, to the obsessive iconography of Magic Realists like Magritte, and to the bumptious charm of the comic strip.

Because Harriette Arnow's people are not articulate, we are anxious to give their confusion a recognizable order, to contribute to their reality, to complete them with language. They are assimilated into us, and we into them. The Dollmaker deals with human beings to whom language is not a means of changing or even expressing reality, but a means of pitifully recording its effect upon the nerves.

us,"Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western","Although billed as ""the first electric Western,"" George Englund's ""Zachariah,"" which opened yesterday at the Juliet I and the Little Carnegie Theater, is really something a good deal odder. It is, at least in my experience, the first movie to parody the Western with the apparent intention of propagandizing homosexual love. I am aware that male relationships are a stock in trade of most Westerns and that, in Andy Warhol's brilliant ""Lonesome Cowboys,"" there has already been a homosexual parody.But for dead-headed didacticism and sheer perseverence in straining the medium to the message, I can think of nothing to match ""Zachariah.""Of course, ""Zachariah"" tries to be pretty electric, too. Which means that as it opens, in yet another ""2001"" take-off, a giant slab in the desert turns out not to be a giant slab at all, but rather its spiritual analogue, the speaker for an electric guitar. And everywhere there is rock or country and Westernand with it, uncomfortably on the sidelines, an appreciative audience of grooving teenyboppers.This would seem to indicate that ""Zachariah"" has set its sights, its more commercial sights, on whatever has supplanted the audience for the beach blanket movie of the early 1960's. But in keeping with the changing times, it aims to be heavy, so that when near the end young Zach tumbles in the sand with his friend and mentor, the Old Man, the confluence of images suggests less an aspiration to ""How to Stuff a Wild Bikini"" than to ""Zabriskie Point.""The Old Man, always dressed in a pair of overalls of many colors, has dragged Zack off to experience the desertas part of an educational program intended to dissuade him from being number-one gunfighter and to teach him the wisdom of settling back at peace with himself and the earth, contented obscurely to cultivate his own garden of grass. Zack had previously risen from comparable obscurity to such outlaw eminence that he had almost challenged the great Job Cain to a battle and had enjoyed the favors of the great Belle Starrbefore realizing that male dominance and bed with Belle were not, for him, the answer.However, his boyhood buddy Matthew has meanwhile sought glory in earnest. He kills Job Cain and then comes gunning after Zack, merely because he is there. It is during this great confrontation that love defeats death, and the two young fellows, embracing warmly, ride off into slow motion and a gaily colored sunset.John Rubinstein, as Zachariah, and Don Johnson, as Matthew, exhibit the readiest smiles and the whitest teeth in the West. It is difficult to assess their performances because their direction seems to have consisted of the admonition, with appropriate moods for appropriate moments, ""be nice."" William Challee, the Old Man, plays the white man's Chief Dan George, though without a fraction of the feeling. And Elvin Jones, Job Cain, is called upon to be black (he is the only man in ""Zachariah"" afflicted with two symbolic names) and plays the drums. The various specialty rock groups are neither functional nor good.George Englund decorates his wide open spaces with symbolic facadesas if to indicate that he takes his themes, if not his genre, seriously. His scene designer is up on several current styles, Belle Stair's border bordello, for example, hides behind a series of flats painted in the pop-art manner of a Wesselmann lithograph.The only person associated with ""Zachariah"" about whom I very much care, Pat Quinn, as Belle Starr, suffers the most. Admirers of ""Alice's Restaurant"" will remember that she is a woman of extraordinary sensual pressence. But here she is made to bump and grind and to affect a surface sensuality with the result that her performance resembles nothing so much as some untalented drag queen's ritual imitation of Mae West.",1971-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Ken Russell's Study of Tchaikovsky Opens,"Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky was born in Kamsko-Votinsk in 1840 and died in St. Petersburg of cholera in 1893. In between he composed some of the world's loveliest, most romantic music, married unhappily, suffered terrible bouts of depression that were linked to both his genius and his homosexuality (which he hid and referred to in his writings only by means of a hieroglyphic), and was acclaimed at home and abroad.Although such authentic genius defies rational interpretation, except, perhaps, by another genius, Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" sets out to do just that. At least, I assume that's what the film set out to do. Because ""The Music Lovers"" plays rather loosely with some of the facts of Tchaikovsky's life, it can be accepted only as the kind of interpretation that certifies the most baroque speculation.Never, perhaps, has one movie contained so many smashed champagne glasses, so many lyrical fantasies (with so many white swans), so many sordid confrontations, so many clothes torn off in twisted passion, so many references to the joys and terrors of artistic creation, even so much musicbut all to such little ultimate effect.Mr. Russell's ""Women in Love"" was a fairly gaudy movie, but if you put it alongside ""The Music Lovers,"" it would seem, I suspect, as austere as an Army training film. Unfortunately, Mr. Russell's romanticism, though quite brave in its headlong intensity, and in its sincere attempts to find cinematic equivalents to mysteries for which there are no equivalents, is of a far lesser order than Tchaikovsky's.Melvyn Bragg's screenplay more or less takes off from ""Beloved Friend,"" a collection (edited by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara Von Meck) of letters that passed between Tchaikovsky and Nadejda Von Meck, the wealthy patron he never met but who, in one of the sillier sequences in ""The Music Lovers,"" spends some ecstatic hours lying beside his sleeping form.Even though Mme. Von Meck was probably the most important woman in Tchaikovsky's adult life, the film allots much more time (almost, in fact, as much as it allots to Tchaikovsky) to Nina, the neurotic, sluttish girl he married, lived with for several weeks and then left. Even if Tchaikovsky effectively put Nina out of his mind, the movie doesn't.Some of Mr. Russell's most fanciful set-pieces are devoted to Nina's decline and fall into madness, largely at the hands of her mother, who pimps for her and is inclined to introduce a new customer by saying that ""Mr. Rimsky-Korsakoff has come to see you, dear.""However, Mr. Russell's speculations are not as offensive as his frontal  and often absurdattacks on the emotions. Richard Chamberlain, who had to go to England to prove himself an actor, is fine as Tchaikovsky, looking a bit like a haunted faun, and Glenda Jackson is all sinewy nerves as Nina, but they are hard put to match the (what seems in retrospect, anyway) nonstop hysteria of the production that surrounds them.When Tchaikovsky sits down to play a public performance of his Piano Concerto in B flat minor at the Moscow Conservatory (which he never did), the concerto becomes a repository of such fulsome flashbacks (suggesting an incestuous relationship with his sister) that it's impossible to hear the music, and to respond to it, without focusing your eyes slightly off-screen, as you might do when you're seasick and don't want to throw up.If the actors are not moving, the camera is, and sometimes everything is moving, as in an extraordinary honeymoon scene on the train that is taking Tchaikovsky and Nina back to Moscow, Nina, drunk and naked, rolls around on the floor of their compartment as her husband studies her in terrorwhile the camera studies both of them from a vantage point on the ceiling that is probably occupied by a ventilator. It's just a little too spectacular, and too undulant. The effects eventually cancel themselves out.The music, played by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andr Previn, is decent enough, that is, when you can hear it in spite of all the scenic cutaways (which are only a little more interesting than the fjords favored by Andrew Stone in ""The Song of Norway"").I expect many people may look on ""The Music Lovers"" as an advance on the classical musical biographies turned out by Hollywood in the 1940's, but for all of its so-called frankness, there isn't much difference between this kind of sensational, souped-up popularization and the sort of pious, souped-down popularization that cast Cornel Wilde as Chopin and Robert Walker as Brahms.By the time ""The Music Lovers"" and Tchaikovsky end, Mr. Russell has told us a lot less about Tchaikovsky and his music than he has about himself as a filmmaker. Although Tchaikovsky died of cholera, for which a hot bath was prescribed, the implication of ""The Music Lovers"" is that he was simply boiled to death, which is what the movie does to his genius.",1971-01-25T05:00:00+0000

us,David Niven and 'The Statue':Amateau Directs Gags About Nobel Laureate 'Curse of the Vampires' Also Begins Run,"""The Statue"" is about Alex Bolt (David Niven), a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Rhonda Bolt (Virna Lisi), his wife, and an 18-foot statue of Bolt, commissioned for the United States Embassy in London and sculptured by the laureate's wife. The point of the movie is not that Miss Lisi is a dreadful artist, although, from the evidence on display in the film, I doubt that she could obtain a commission to decorate a post office in the Soviet provinces.The point of the film is that the statue is nude. Although the physique looks like some failing art student's copy of Michelangelo's David, we are told that it bears a perfect likeness to thin old David Niven, except for the genitals. This, however, we have to take on blind faith since ""The Statue"" is, after all, a movie that depends on prudery. Like a stereotype spinster, it averts its eyes every time the camera approaches the statue's mid-section.The film has something of a storyNiven's search for the man who posed for the genitalia and who was, he assumes, his wife's lover. Mostly, however, it is just a collection of disagreeable, mainly antihomosexual, antifemininist gags designed to offend not only the members of the Gay Activists Alliance and Women's Lib, but also anyone who cherishes the memory of wit.Although everything about the film is rotten, it is of some historical interest as a desperate attempt to update the kind of prissy sex comedy that used to amuse Broadway matinee audiences with endless complications about ""it.""There is not much point in going into the dialogue, but you'll get the idea from the line spoken by a little girl who is shown gazing in wonderment at the copy of Michelangelo's work in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence. ""Golly,"" she says, ""if that's David, I'd like to see Goliath!""""The Statue"" may have the distinction of being the first adolescent comedy about penis envy. Paradoxically, it is rated R, which will keep out most of the 12-year-olds who might be expected to find it good for a smirk. It opened yesterday at the Astor and Loew's Orpheum Theaters.",1971-01-28T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:'Last Valley' Recalls a Story of Survival,"""The Last Valley"" is a kind of historical movie, a type of adventure drama, a sort of epic, and something of a parable, and it winds up being a bit more boring than is absolutely necessary, considering the possibilities.Experiencing the movie is very much like riding in a big, handsome, old Rolls-Royce that keeps wandering from one side of the road to the other, slipping its gears, speeding up and then suddenly breaking  all because the driver doesn't know where he's going or how fast he wants to get there, although it's apparent he wants to travel in all of the style that money can buy.The driver is James Clavell, the novelist (""King Rat"") and film writer-director (""To Sir, With Love""), who wrote, directed and produced this adaption of J. B. Pick's 1960 novel set against the background of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which was almost an anthology of war.Beginning as a rebellion of Protestant German princes against the Catholic Habsburgs, it evolved, over the decades, into a series of see-saw battles, mixed alliances and desperate power plays involving France, England, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, in addition to Austria and the German states. By the time the Treaty of Westphalia was signed, most of Germany had been devastated and about the only thing that had been accomplished was the irrevocable end of the Holy Roman Empire, which was dead anyway.""The Last Valley"" is a rather dreamlike story of survival set in a magnificent valley protected from the outside world by high mountains. Into this valley comes Vogel (Omar Sharif), a one-time school teacher who has been on the run for years, followed shortly afterwards by a small, exhausted army led by the Captain (Michael Caine), whose men kill and burn and rape on reflex and have long since forgotten what they're fighting for.The Captain, using Vogel as a go-between, effects a truce with the people of the valley, pledging to protect them from invasion in return for food, shelter and women for the winter, at the end of which the Captain goes off to fight another battle and Vogel is evicted, to continue his wanderings. The people of the valley survive, simply by enduring.Like Bertolt Brecht in ""Mother Courage,"" Mr. Clavell, I suspect, sees the incredible horrors of the Thirty Years' War as a metaphor for contemporary horrors, but he seems either incapable ofor uninterested indeveloping a physical drama with any kind of intellectual substructure. Vogel, a pragmatic dreamer, and the Captain, a career soldier whose cynicism is not quite complete, talk quite a lot about war and religion but the quality of their dialogue would not embarrass the folks on ""Gunsmoke."" When, in the spring, the Captain departs to engage in yet another battle, the outcome of which will make no difference to anybody, all he can say is that he must go to the battle ""because it's there.""So much money was obviously spent on the lavish productionon scenery, costumes, occasional battles and extrasthat I suspect Mr. Clavell thought he was making a statement about civilization, and perhaps even Vietnam, that would somehow work as an action melodrama. Although Mr. Clavell, as a writer, has nothing in common with Shaw, ""The Last Valley"" kept reminding me of Guy Hamilton's misguided attempts some years ago to turn ""The Devil's Disciple"" into a popcorn movie.It's difficult to judge Mr. Clavell's effect on his performers, except to remark that Mr. Sharif and Mr. Caine, who've never struck me as especially subtle actors, are quite good, while Per Oscarsson (""Hunger""), who is, I think, a great actor, seems to be acting up a storm in a dramatic vacuum. It may be, however, that in his make-up as a slightly mad Catholic priest he looks just a little too much like Charles Manson.One technical point: the film, which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and Juliet 2 Theaters, favors such slow lap dissolves that you will spend what seems like most of the movie seeing double images.",1971-01-29T05:00:00+0000

After a decade or more of scratching it out on the r & b circuit, Ike and Tina Turner finally are beginning to receive the rewards their talent deserves. The formula they have developed is sim ple enough: keep the soul phrasing and r & b rhythms, add their own versions of pop tunes like Let It Be, Get Back and Proud Mary, and mix it all to gether with a heavy dose of Tina Turner's indescribably rough, driving voice. (The product is so effective that I'm surprised more black groups haven't taken the same route; perhaps they will.) The principal ingredi ent, however, is Ike Turner's impeccable sense of struc ture balance and musical pac ing. He has carefully avoid ed producing black covers of white pop songs. When Tina Turner sings songs by the Beatles and John Fogarty, she finds qualities that al most make them sound like new material. The lyrics to Let It Be, for example, are changed from When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me to When I find myself in times of trouble, evil thoughts they come to me  The alteration quite literally changes the meaning of the tune, giving it an erotic qual ity that is devastatingly ap propriate for Miss Turner's aggressive sexuality.",1971-01-31T05:00:00+0000

us,A crime against the state that incriminates the state,"On the face of it, The Quest for Christa T. bears all the stigmata of the conventionally experimental nov el. But the ambiguities that lurk just beneath the enigmatic ripples of its prose turn out to be authentic, earned rather than fashionable. Like trap doors they open onto unsuspected depths and end in questions that, for never being asked outright, tend to grow all the more insistent. The con tours of silence and the outline of things articulately left unsaid loom large in the muted brilliance of this novel. And since it was written in the realm of King Ulbricht, where raising questions is much like raising the dead, the book becomes an act of necromancy tantamount to trea son. At least it would be difficult otherwise to account for the grim fury which this wholly apolitical work seems to have aroused in East Germany.",1971-01-31T05:00:00+0000
