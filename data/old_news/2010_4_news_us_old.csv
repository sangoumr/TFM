A lifelong collector of one-of-a-kind bikes from around the world, Maharam, of the New York textile company of the same name, recently made friends with a true expert  Sacha White, a master builder who owns Vanilla Bicycles in Portland, Ore. Together, they conceived an exhibition devoted to the work of craftsmen like White, who make a living cutting steel, welding and filing for weeks on end. (You wouldnt want to be their manicurist, Maharam says.) The show, Bespoke: The Handbuilt Bicycle, which opens May 12 at the Museum of Arts and Design, collects 21 of the finest contemporary examples from America and abroad, from charming, Old World road bikes to aggressively styled titanium and steel mountain bikes. On the gallerys back wall, a set of drawings by the design firm 24 explains how bicycles are built. Maharam hopes the exhibition will open up the citys bicycle culture to more people. One reason bicycles have become so popular is because manufacturers are making the well designed and beautiful accessible to the masses, he says. This is the epitome of the well designed and beautiful. ",2010-04-01T08:00:59+0000

Walker, the chief United States district judge of San Francisco, ruled that federal agents had eavesdropped illegally on an Islamic charity based in the United States. Judge Walker said that the Bush administration lacked the authority to act without warrants to intercept phone calls and e-mail messages between Americans and foreigners as part of an effort to prevent terrorist attacks. The ruling delivered a blow to the Bush administrations claims that its surveillance program, which Mr. Bush authorized shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was lawful. The intercepts, Judge Walker ruled, violated a 1978 federal statute requiring court approval for domestic surveillance. The organization monitored by the taps, in this case, was Al Haramain, a now-defunct Islamic charity in Oregon. Two lawyers representing it in 2004 were also tapped. The judge said the plaintiffs had been subjected to unlawful surveillance, and said the government was liable to pay them damages.

Lakshmi Mittal, the chief executive of the steel company ArcelorMittal, is providing about $24 million for the cost of the structure, with the remaining amount coming from the Greater London Authority.

Her line even comes complete with its own fragrance, Maximilia, named after Maximilian Kolbe, the Polish friar who took the place of a condemned man at Auschwitz. Scherrers lavish youth is a roman  clef waiting to happen: Catholic school, a caretaker named Guigui, her fathers boutique on the Avenue Montaigne, which, she notes, was once called LAlle des Veuves or Widows Way. Lately, shes been dabbling in music, and one of the tracks off her forthcoming album is a cover of Schuberts Death and The Maiden. Givenchys Riccardo Tisci digs the six-feet-under-obsessed Scherrer, featuring her in a recent ad campaign. Im completely in love with her, he told Womens Wear Daily.

Titled A Vanished World, the book evoked what many have come to imagine as life in the shtetl: elegiac images of small cities and provincial villages, their hunchback rabbis walking cobblestone streets, Talmud prodigies studying by candlelight, men whispering in courtyards  a vision lighted with authenticity and charged with nostalgia. Through this and other books, Vishniacs body of work has come to be thought of as the last photographic record of a universe on the cusp of being comprehensively and cataclysmically destroyed. His pictures were used in so many influential books about Jewish life before the Holocaust  as illustrations for books by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Irving Howe and later serving as what Janusz Kaminski called the guiding force for his Oscar-winning cinematography of  Schindlers List   that Vishniac, who died in 1990, has virtually become, in the words of Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, the official mortuary photographer of Eastern European Jewry.",2010-04-01T19:53:33+0000

The Things They Carried, OBriens celebrated collection of linked stories about the Vietnam War, has just been reissued in a 20th-anniversary edition, and I was interested in gathering a Vietnamese perspective on OBriens work. But it took me days of calls and e-mail messages to find anyone in Hanoi who had read any of it. Finally the manager of the Bookworm suggested I speak with Tran Ngoc Hieu, a lecturer at Hanois Pedagogical University. I needed a while to track him down, as he is perhaps the only person in the city who does not use a mobile phone. Hieu, 30, looks young for his age, and compensates by wearing a sport jacket and speaking a careful, deliberate English with an exceptionally rich vocabulary, interrupting himself frequently to apologize for not speaking English well.",2010-04-01T23:32:42+0000

For the exhibition The Surreal House, which opens June 10 at Londons Barbican gallery, the curators have worked with the architects Carmody Groarke to bring these dreamscapes to life, constructing a labyrinth of rooms and corridors that immerse visitors in the art, films and furnishings of the movements original and contemporary practitioners. The idea is to radically alter the space so that youre not sure whats up, whats down or where it finishes, says Alona Pardo, an assistant curator at the Barbican. Rather than imagining surreal interiors, the sculptors Claude and Franois-Xavier Lalanne furnished them. Their zoologically inspired pieces are now on view at the Les Arts Dcoratifs in Paris, including hippo-shaped bathtubs and a bed that resembles a can of sardines.

These rich supporting materials by Viennas early-20th-century masters will be on view at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, alongside their delicate three-dimensional counterparts, beginning April 23 as part of Ted Muehling Selects: Lobmeyr Glass From the Permanent Collection. From a baroque, leaf-cut decanter by Ludwig Lobmeyr to the thin, attenuated muslin glass forms that have dominated the past half century, Muehling primarily chose pieces meant for celebration and ritual; the great thing about Lobmeyr, he says, is they may be opulent and insanely expensive, but for the most part the pieces are useful and functional drinking glasses.

As a nod to Good Friday, with apologies to anyone whos off leavened items this week, heres a guide to the Big Apples best buns: sticky, cinnamon, hot cross and otherwise:STICKY BUNSLets start at the very beginning with a small bakery on Madison Avenue at 83rd Street, William Greenberg Jr. Desserts. When I was a child, my father went here for schnecken. The German word for snail, its reference is the spiral shape of the thing. In fact, while I identify schnecken with this particular rich-doughed, cinnamon-filled, raisin-laden, pecan-topped, caramelized breakfast staple, the label is as generic as danish, and can be used to describe any flattened, coiled, cinnamon-raisin pastry. Sadly, William Jr. sold his bakery a number of years ago and the goods dont taste the same. If you want to experience a sticky bun as I knew it, you can go two blocks down to E.A.T., where Eli Zabar has created something that rivals the Greenberg classic. Or else call Scarsdale, where Williams son Seth continues to bake (and sell) his fathers schnecken. Seth uses the same ingredients as his dad and has the original 1930s recipe cards to prove it. You can taste the sour cream and butter in the dough; the perfectly burnt brown sugar in the thick glaze. ",2010-04-02T17:00:31+0000

For its eight performances last week, for instance, Looped grossed $168,351, only 26 percent of the maximum possible amount. At such a low percentage, Looped was probably not covering its weekly running expenses, let alone turning a profit. (The weekly expenses have not been made public.) Moreover, the show was not on an upward trajectory; last weeks gross represented a decline from the previous weeks amount, $176,622. Written by Matthew Lombardo (Tea at Five) and directed by Rob Ruggiero, Looped will have played 27 preview performances and 25 regular performances when it closes. A spokesman for the show did not immediately reply to questions about the total cost for mounting the production and whether it will close at a complete loss for investors. The play is a portrait of Ms. Bankhead at the end of her film career, as she arrives, apparently drunk, at an editing studio to rerecord a line of dialogue for a movie  setting the stage for a colorful showdown between the actress and an uptight film editor.

In Priceless Mr. Wittman writes that French middlemen with ties to a criminal gang in Corsica offered to sell the stolen paintings to him, believing that he was a rich collector. The works were among more than $500 million in art stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston on March 18, 1990, in what is regarded as the biggest art theft in American history and which remains unsolved after two decades. The Globe reported that Mr. Wittman wrote that his efforts were sabotaged by a superior, called Fred in the book, who micromanaged his work and tried to have him thrown off the case. The F.B.I. told The Globe that it was reviewing the manuscript to see if it revealed any secrets that could damage its investigations or national security.

Sundays quake registered 7.2 and centered in a largely unpopulated area of northern Mexico. But a recent study by the California Emergency Management Agency found a majority of the states households failing to meet recommendations for many basic emergency needs, like stockpiling water (a minimum of three gallons per person), reinforcing their homes and making disaster plans.

The number of Americans who believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ has dropped 10 points in the last decade; only 26 percent of Christians believe that they will have bodies in the next life; and almost a third of Americans (including one in five self-identified Christians) now believe in reincarnation. Pondering these trends, Miller argues that some kind of immortality of the soul is simply easier to swallow than a physical resurrection; the latter, she suggests, presents all sorts of credibility problems that the more reasonable belief in purely spiritual afterlife lacks.",2010-04-06T14:13:40+0000

In her lawsuit, Ms. Sheridan, who played Edie Britt on the first five seasons of Desperate Housewives, says that the shows creator, Marc Cherry, hit her during an incident in September 2008. When Ms. Sheridan asked Mr. Cherry about a line in the script, he took her aside and forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head, the suit said, according to The A.P.

Rehearsals in the Schiller Theater, which is contending with its own renovations, are to begin Aug. 19, and the Staatsopers 2010-2011 season will open there on Oct. 3 with the world premiere of Jens Joneleits Metanoia, directed by Christoph Schlingensief. Other conductors who are scheduled to lead the Staatsoper during the season include James Levine and Pierre Boulez. At the news conference, Daniel Barenboim, the music director for the Staatsoper, said, Moving for three years can be seen as a calamity or as a challenge, and we have decided to see it as the latter. Its artistic director, Jrgen Flimm, said it would be difficult for operagoers to follow the company to its new home, adding: I hope there will be sufficient curiosity.

Mr. Lloyd Webber was not available for a telephone interview, a spokesman for the Broadway production said, though he said in a statement that he was extremely frustrated by the limitations on his travel. Two Broadway theater executives who met with Mr. Lloyd Webber in London in March, when Love Never Dies opened there, said that he reported feeling well and did not complain of post-treatment problems. Love Never Dies drew mixed reviews from critics in London, including a tough critique from The New York Timess chief theater critic, Ben Brantley, prompting speculation that the Broadway run would be delayed so Mr. Lloyd Webber could overhaul it. The musical had been scheduled to open in November at the Neil Simon Theater.",2010-04-06T22:07:19+0000
us,More Legal Woes for Annie Leibovitz,"The photographer Annie Leibovitz, below, whose protracted legal troubles had seemed to be behind her, is back in court. Brunswick Capital Partners has filed a suit against her in New York State Supreme Court, saying that she owes the firm several hundred thousand dollars in fees for its role in finding investors who have helped her restructure her debt, Reuters reported. Ms. Leibovitz fell into financial trouble, according to friends, after years of incautious spending and expensive home renovations. Last month she reached an agreement with Colony Capital, a Los Angeles firm: it became her only creditor and agreed to help her concentrate on her career and earnings. She averted a foreclosure last summer after she missed a deadline to repay $24 million in loans to Art Capital Group, a lender that used the rights to her photographs and her real estate as collateral. In the new lawsuit, filed on Friday, Brunswick Capital says that Ms. Leibovitz has failed to pay fees for its services and a 2 percent commission on the $40 million loan that Colony made to consolidate her debt. Representatives for Ms. Leibovitz and Colony declined to comment, saying that they had not had a chance to review the suit.",2010-04-06T22:07:33+0000

Fewer people watched Idol on Tuesday (when the contestant Crystal Bowersox performed with the didgeridoo player Ernie Fields, both left) than watched ABCs Dancing With the Stars on Monday. (Dancing runs performance episodes on Mondays, with results on Tuesdays; Idol generally has performance on Tuesdays with results on Wednesdays.) And for a second consecutive week, in the category Fox cares most about  viewers between the ages of 18 and 49  Idol, if the Tuesday overnight ratings hold, will post its lowest number ever for a two-hour edition of the show. It will also be the lowest-rated Tuesday edition of the show since an hourlong episode on Aug. 13, 2002, in its first season, when the series played in the summer. Idol had a total audience of about 20.4 million on Tuesday, below the 21.2 million that Dancing averaged for its performance show on Monday. (The Dancing results on Tuesday averaged a total audience of 12.3 million.) But the Idol 7.1 rating among viewers 18 to 49 is what will be most noticed. That is down from a 7.7 a week ago and down from the 8.1 the show averaged for the three previous weeks. Of course, Idol is still the dominant show on television with those younger adults advertisers love. And the success of Dancing has to be tempered by its skew toward older viewers. This weeks Dancing results episode, when the astronaut Buzz Aldrin was blasted off the show, faced the Idol performance on Tuesday night and scored a modest 2.4 rating in the 18 to 49 group. More tellingly, almost 70 percent of its audience was over 50.",2010-04-07T22:13:50+0000

Establishing these institutions is the second stage in creating an empire and is often harder than the first stage, particularly when huge conquests have occurred in a short period.

Luckily no one ever asked me to elaborate, because Id have been at a loss for words  except to say that we students got to do lots of drawing and painting, which I loved, but we couldnt skip eurythmy class (yuck). any serious discussions of pedagogic method and what Steiner called his spiritual science, anthroposophy, took place out of earshot in the teachers room. My only mental picture of Steiner (1861-1925) came from a dim black and white photo showing a stern mouth and X-ray eyes that made me glad this guy wasnt our headmaster. Oh, well, I reasoned, as soon as I enter the real world after graduation, its Goodbye, Dr. Steiner.",2010-04-08T13:30:58+0000

Representatives for Actors Equity said that about three to four weeks ago Broadway Entertainment, which produces Tony n Tinas Wedding, posted a closing notice for the show that would end its run at the Edison Hotel. Since then, the association said, the producers have sought a new performance space, violating an Equity rule that producers cannot close and reopen a show within eight weeks without negotiating with the union. (The producers said that on Saturday the show would move to Sweet Carolines on West 45th Street.) Equity said in its complaint to the labor board that Broadway Entertainment had failed to recognize the union and had offered employment to its cast members on the condition they resign from Equity or work without its representation. In November the Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, protested Tony n Tinas Wedding after Broadway Entertainment replaced musicians with recorded music. In a statement Broadway Entertainment said that it was concerned about our cast, adding, We did not intend to violate any rules by Equity but felt we had a responsibility as their employers to offer everyone a fair chance to continue working.",2010-04-08T21:54:21+0000

Its not so much that she gives readers unexpected insights into one of the literary giants of his day  the book does little to dispel the image of Mailer as a narcissistic hothead with redeeming streaks of cuddliness and charm  but rather that, in her own indirect way, she shows exactly what type of woman could tolerate and at least partly subdue such a king-size corkscrew of a man.

The intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, made the charges on Irans English-language satellite channel. Coming as international tension over Irans nuclear program has increased, the remarks seemed to reflect a hardening of the Iranian governments tone in the case of the hikers  Sarah Shourd, 31, and Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, both 27. In November, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran pointed out that the United States was holding several Iranian citizens, raising the possibility that he sought a prisoner swap. Clearly, these unlucky hikers have been caught up in international politics, said Mark Juergensmeyer, director of the global and international studies department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The message is loud and clear: It screams for a prisoners exchange and shows that they are being kept as hostages to be used as negotiating pawns.

The idea was to turn an arcane question of process into a basic issue of fairness in the public mind, and it worked. Now, five years later, Republicans reeling from their health care defeat are trying the same tactic. The health care law was rammed through Congress and rammed down the throats of the American people, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina declared on Face the Nation, echoing a chorus of other Republicans who have used the same metaphor to cast the laws passage  accomplished partly through the technical process known as budget reconciliation  as an act of outright treachery.

In recent years, however, Guinea-Bissau has emerged as a nodal point in three-way cocaine-trafficking operations linking producers in South America with users in Europe; the value of the cocaine that transits this small and heartbreakingly impoverished country dwarfs its gross national product. The Gulfstream arrived unexpectedly from Venezuela on July 12, 2008, and taxied to a hangar at the adjacent military airbase  where soldiers formed a line and unloaded its contents. The contents, reportedly more than a half-ton of cocaine, vanished. The crew was arrested and released. The army permitted the government to impound the plane only after several days. Since then, the plane has sat in the harsh sun, a reminder of Guinea-Bissaus helplessness before forces far more powerful than itself.",2010-04-09T13:37:51+0000

Buruma shows, for instance, that the trendy, anti-imperial multiculturalism favored in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom actually echoes those countries policies of colonial indirect rule, in which native cultures were segregated and preserved so they could be dominated more easily. He suggests that Americas militant Christianity and Europes militant secularism stem from parallel anxieties about the pace of cultural change. And he explains why the jihadist fanaticism taking root among some of Europes Muslim young is more European than Middle Eastern, more modern than traditional, more political than religious.

Clash of the Titans and Date Night, with Steve Carell, right, were running neck and neck in domestic ticket sales, with a clear winner impossible to determine until Mondays totals are released. According to Sundays estimates from Team Screenline, a box-office data service, 20th Century Foxs Date Night earned $27.1 million in its first weekend, putting it just a hair ahead of Warner Brothers Titans, which earned $26.9 million in its second weekend, with a cumulative total of $110.5 million. Weekend projections are fairly solid for Friday and Saturday totals, but some studios claim competitors bloat Sunday estimates, which are based on how similar movies performed in past weekends, The Associated Press reported. Warner Brothers said Titans finished about $1 million over Date Night, according to The A.P. Theyre certainly entitled to their own projection, and well see, said Dan Fellman, president of domestic distribution for Warner. Maybe theyre right, and were wrong. Paramounts How to Train Your Dragon was third in its third weekend, with $23.4 million (just under $134 million total). Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too (Lionsgate) was fourth with only $11 million in its second week ($48.5 million total).

In its weekend editions, LOsservatore Romano, the official newspaper of the Vatican, commemorated the Beatles on the 40th anniversary of that groups breakup, and endorsed the Fab Fours music without quite giving a thumbs-up to the band members lifestyles, The Associated Press reported. Its true, they took drugs; swept up by their success, they lived dissolute and uninhibited lives, LOsservatore Romano wrote. But, the newspaper added, listening to their songs, all of this seems distant and meaningless. Their beautiful melodies, which changed forever pop music and still give us emotions, live on like precious jewels. Giovanni Maria Vian, the editor in chief of LOsservatore Romano, told The A.P. that he is a fan of the Beatles, and he minimized John Lennons notorious 1966 remark that the band at that time was more popular than Jesus.

us,Jersey Boys File Suit Against The Boys,"Oh, what a headache: the producers of Jersey Boys have filed suit against the producers of a touring show called The Boys in Concert, saying that it is trying to confuse audiences into thinking the two musicals are related, Reuters reported. Jersey Boys, which tells the story of Frankie Valli and his rock group, the Four Seasons, has remained a popular and lucrative show since it opened on Broadway in 2005 (and won the Tony Award for best musical), spawning several regional productions and a national tour. The Boys in Concert, whose cast and creators include the Jersey Boys alumni Christian Hoff, Michael Longoria and Daniel Reichard, features the music of several pop acts of the 1960s and 70s, including the Four Seasons. The lawsuit, which The New York Post reported was filed by Mr. Valli, as well as his band mate Bob Gaudio and the playwrights Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, says that The Boys in Concert copies many elements of Jersey Boys and that its promotional materials represent a deliberate and willful attempt to create public confusion and foster the misimpression that the shows are associated or connected. The Jersey Boys producers are seeking damages and an injunction against performances of The Boys in Concert that use copyrighted or similar materials.

Run by Nina Yashar, the gallery-cum-high-end-design-boutique specializes in antique design masterpieces as well as newly commissioned works by young designers. The standout at this years exhibition, however, was a bit old and a bit new. The designer Barnaba Fornasetti, son of the legendary Piero Fornasetti, has made newly commissioned pieces out of some of his fathers classic collaborations with the famed designer Gio Ponti. Instead of making these pieces in the high-gloss lacquer that is a Fornasetti trademark, these new works are covered in the original zinc lithographic plates that papa Fornasetti used to print his famous designs. The matte gray zinc is embellished in a black etched patchwork of flowers, trompe loeil books, faux bois and more. The zinc plates are attached to the wooden construction of the furniture by way of utilitarian yet decorative nail heads. The collection consists of two desks, a tall secretary desk, a chair, a chandelier and a wardrobe (in which Barnaba has even placed some of his own idiosyncratic Fornasetti printed suits, vests and shirts).

The book, still untitled, is planned for release in September 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy presidency, and is being edited by the Kennedys daughter, Caroline.

Xinhua said the earthquake had struck 240 miles southeast of Golmud, a town of about 130,000 on the Tibetan plateau. Golmud is perhaps best known as the site of the worlds largest salt lake. Soldiers have been dispatched to save the people buried in the collapsed houses, Huang Limin, a local official, told Xinhua. He said phone service, briefly cut off by the quake, had been restored. The Geological Survey reported three aftershocks, with magnitudes of up to 5.8. Last August, Golmud was hit by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that destroyed dozens of homes but caused no deaths.

Using birth, death and marriage records, Farr analyzed the relative mortality rates of the three groups at various ages. The work, a groundbreaking study that helped establish the field of medical statistics, showed that the unmarried died from disease in undue proportion to their married counterparts.

So Coach Don Nelson, who recently became the career victories leader, used five players for the rest of the game. ",2010-04-15T14:07:31+0000

The tenor is appropriately prosecutorial: Goldberg builds an extensive, persuasive case that the Owenses much-lauded environmental activism in the Zambian hinterland led to at least one murder, and maybe more. The victim was a poacher; the killers were probably game scouts who were trained by the Owenses as a kind of private army (and encouraged to take the fight to hunters)  and the fatal gunshots, Goldberg plausibly contends, may have been fired by Mark Owens own son, Christopher. (Remarkably, the murder was captured on camera by an ABC documentary crew sometime in 1995; even more remarkably, it was then broadcast, on an episode of the newsmagazine show Turning Point in 1996.)",2010-04-15T14:40:11+0000

Readers and reviewers, pro and con, sought the precise location of the line demarcating smut from smart. Translated into 30 languages, Politics told the story of three young Londoners involved in a mnage  trois. Though few explicit descriptions were spared, the novel was ultimately less concerned with the foibles and fumblings of sexual misadventure than with what they could reveal about human nature that more conventional narratives could not.",2010-04-16T16:06:33+0000

Absent from the discourse, however, is any mention of the simple notion of pleasure or of the more complicated emotions. The animal kingdom at its higher levels is suffused with not only reproductive survival drives but also with pleasure-seeking drives, an area covered by the science of hedonics, a discipline with a name itself suffering the moralistic denunciations engaged to suppress much about sexual behavior. It is interesting to note that there seems little of what we would call prejudice among animal societies toward nonstandard behavior, and yet there was no discussion of this judgmental and too-often-punitive activity that emerges in nominally more advanced human animals. There is much more to this subject; the author barely mentioned things likethe cavorting of dolphins, the pansexuality of bonobos and the same-sex mating behavior seen in deep-sea octopuses.THOMAS W.

The decline was the largest since the Foundation Center, a research group, began collecting such data in 1975. Still, it was not as severe as the center predicted last year, based on the sharp loss in the value of foundation assets. Some foundations pared expenses and reduced staffs. The Ford Foundation, for example, found $40 million in cost savings that it used for grants. Ford and other foundations also increased the portion of assets they gave away in hopes of ameliorating problems caused by the poor economy. While assets at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation declined about 20 percent, the foundation increased the amount it paid out to 7 percent of the lower value of its assets, around $3.8 billion. Without the Gates spending, the decline in spending by foundations would have been 9.4 percent. ",2010-04-17T00:11:41+0000

But Grace Kelly epitomized a time before rebellion was a virtue, and the forthcoming Grace Kelly: Style Icon exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London pays homage to the actress-turned-princesss sartorial legacy, from her rise to stardom in the 50s to her untimely death in 1982. She certainly didnt see herself as a style leader, liking such conservative clothes, says the shows curator, Jenny Lister. But audiences loved her kind of uncontrived, natural beauty. Highlights of the show include Kellys namesake Herms bag, dresses from her films High Society and Rear Window, and items from among the 80 pieces of luggage she carried to Monaco for her wedding to Prince Rainier in 1956. But perhaps more intriguing is what happened in the decades that followed, when Kelly found herself outside her comfort zone  amid all the tiaras and Dior ballgowns are the odd nods to rising hemlines and changing times, like her YSL Mondrian dress.

The group, Revolution Muslim, published its post after a South Park episode last week that depicted the founders of various religions, including Moses, Jesus and Buddha, but declined to show the Prophet Muhammad, instead representing him as wearing a bear costume. The post, written by Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee, said that the episode had outright insulted Muhammad, adding: We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid, and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show. This is not a threat, but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them. Mr. van Gogh was killed in Amsterdam after making a film that discussed the abuse of Muslim women in some Islamic societies.

The Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan said a rare manuscript of the Magna Carta that it started showing on Wednesday would remain on display through May 30 while arrangements were made to transport it home to Britain. The original Magna Carta was sealed by King John of England in 1215 at Runnymede, putting limits on the kings power and laying the groundwork for legal principles like the writ of habeas corpus. The version at the Morgan, which comes from the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, dates to 1217 and is one of 17 surviving originals produced in the 13th century that bear the royal seal. Richard Ovenden, the Bodleians associate director and keeper of special collections, said this Magna Carta made its first visit to New York for a special event for Oxford alumni in the United States held on Saturday at the Waldorf-Astoria.

us,Miracle Worker,"The fountain of youth is legendary in myth and history; some scientists and skin-care experts think it still exists, thanks to an enzyme called telomerase. Dr. Gregory Bays Brown of RVive has created a $1,500 skin cream, Peau Magnifique, containing telomerase. In fact, the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered how chromosomes are protected by the enzyme, and further research could prove telomerase to be a key factor in infinite cell proliferation. No ones promising the death of funerals yet, but hope springs eternal. Heres the CliffsNote: As cells divide, they send copies of themselves to new cells. But that copying process chops off bits of the originals protective tips. As we age, the tips, known as telomeres, get shorter and shorter till the original cells die, and we do too. Cancer cells, stem cells and some rogue cells produce a substance that blocks the snipping process  telomerase. How it can be deconstructed, harnessed and activated remains to be seen: lab-made telomerase would have to penetrate skin, pass through tissue and cell walls, and hook into chromosomal activity in order to be effective. But RVives Brown claims that telomerase can recruit the skins resting stem cells  which exist in case of injury  to manufacture new skin. So far, there are no major peer-review studies or clinical trials. And animal testing isnt possible since only humans produce it. Nevertheless, the party has definitely begun; in addition to RVive, Jan Marinis Age Intervention Regeneration Booster and Goldfadens DNA Telomere Cream boast telomere science. Other beauty products are sure to follow. ",2010-04-22T08:00:04+0000

The gallery owner, Jack Tilton, testified that Marlene Dumas, a South African-born artist whose work is sought by important collectors and whom he represented for many years, has long kept a list that prevents those she views as turning over her works too quickly from buying more by her. Mr. Tilton  who testified as the result of a subpoena by a Miami collector, Craig Robins, the plaintiff in a lawsuit related to the list  said that besides Mr. Robins, other well-known collectors and dealers like Richard Cooper and Daniel Holtz were on the list. In his suit Mr. Robins says that he sold a painting by Ms. Dumas through the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea in 2004 with an agreement that the sale remain confidential. But the Zwirner gallery, which took over representation of Ms. Dumas in 2008, told her about it, Mr. Robins asserts, causing her to add his name to the blacklist, according to his suit. The suit says that Mr. Zwirner promised to help get Mr. Robins off the blacklist and sell him choice paintings from Against the Wall, the current show of Ms. Dumass work at Zwirner, but that this did not happen. Mr. Zwirner  who was also on Ms. Dumass blacklist at one point, Mr. Tilton said  denies both assertions. Ms. Dumas has declined to comment on the suit.",2010-04-22T21:21:28+0000

Since at least his 1984 book Midsummer, Walcott has been publishing what might be described as concatenated lyrics, individual poems numbered consecutively and intended to form a conceptual whole. His long 1990 poem Omeros would be called canonical were that word not so problematic these days. And, like Eliot, Walcott is also a playwright.

us,Surreal Reveal,"Most beauty stories are about the latest makeup trends. For Surreal Reveal, the makeup artist Peter Philips and the photographer Richard Burbridge took a decidedly reductive, and ultimately seductive, route. Using photographs by Man Ray as a springboard, Philips, who is Chanels global creative director of makeup, stripped down the idea of a beauty image to its naked core. He didnt even use foundation on the models skin. After all, great skin is the ultimate luxury, he says. But bare doesnt mean you dont use any makeup at all, he stresses. When you pare it down to such an extent, every element you do wear has to be perfect  the perfect lipstick, the perfect eyeliner, the perfect nail polish. For Philips, the new bare lies somewhere between the overdone maquillage of the late 80s and the raw, unkempt look of the early 90s. I dont think women today feel the need to be so extreme, he says. Working on the shoot, Philips found the contradictions inherent in creating deconstructed beauty images to be both intriguing and modern. The iconic, formal poses in the photos are a reference to old fashion photography, and are completely at odds with how we played with the pristine, expensive objects in the shots, he says. (Its true that a lot of women might shudder at the idea of drawing on a quilted Chanel bag with eyeliner.) I love the fact that you can never see the models eyes, Philips continues. Makeup can be a mask that a woman hides behind. I compare it to a woman who overaccessorizes or wears over-the-top fashion  the accessories and clothes almost act as armor. Whether a woman decides to get away with a mere swipe of mascara or puts on a full face, Philips supports the idea that less can truly be more: You can wear the most dramatic red lipstick, but if you wear it with confidence, as if you own it, it will look completely natural.",2010-04-23T13:30:45+0000

But professional success in music eluded her; for a time she worked as a prison guard at Rikers Island, where the inmates would sometimes make requests. Now, as the leader of the Dap-Kings, the house band of the Brooklyn record label Daptone, Ms. Jones is the epitome of the soul revival. I Learned the Hard Way, the fourth album by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, which entered the Billboard album chart at No. 15 this month, earned praise for staying true to the analog grit of its predecessors. Ms. Jones still lives with her mother in a public housing in Far Rockaway, Queens, a rough area she escapes by going fishing in the Delaware Water Gap. In an interview in the waiting room of her ear, nose and throat doctor  Ms. Jones needed a checkup before a European tour  she and Neal Sugarman, a Dap-King saxophonist and a founder of Daptone, talked about the musicians they draw inspiration from, like Otis Redding and Etta James, and their recently upgraded life on tour.

us,Oz Breakout: Escape to Theater,"Its not an official Oz reunion, but short of the cast members of that HBO prison drama getting thrown into a maximum-security penitentiary together its as close as were likely to get. Primary Stages said that it would end its season with two stage readings of Godfather IV, an original work by Tom Fontana, the Oz creator. It will star Christopher Meloni, Lee Tergesen and Dean Winters, who all appeared on that eye-gougingly violent series. Godfather IV is not a sequel to Francis Ford Coppolas mafia movies, but a piece in which the Oz actors discuss the plausibility of a key scene in The Godfather, and Mr. Tergesen and Mr. Winters resolve to put a horses head in Mr. Melonis bed. The readings, scheduled for May 2 at 59E59 Theaters, are being presented as a benefit for Primary Stages and the Writers Guild of America, East Foundation. They will be directed by Linda Laundra (Homicide: Life on the Street) and will also feature the Oz alumni Mike Doyle, Zeljko Ivanek, Terry Kinney, David Laundra, Kristin Rohde, Eamonn Walker and Catherine Wolf, as well as an appearance by Mr. Fontana.",2010-04-23T22:19:26+0000

The inclusion of the character meets twin goals, one real world and one in-story. Riverdale has to reflect the diversity of the world today, said Jon Goldwater, co-chief executive of Archie Comic Publications. We want to be all inclusive. Mr. Goldwater also said hes not afraid of any repercussions. We think everyone is going to enjoy the story, he said. Its completely in the tradition of your typical Archie comic.

It is one of a handful of commercial plays this season that have recouped the investment spent on mounting the productions on Broadway. All of those plays had star performers in lead roles, a common box office strategy nowadays. Race stars James Spader (Boston Legal) as a lawyer who spars with two colleagues, played by David Alan Grier and Kerry Washington, about defending a white man facing ugly criminal accusations from a black woman. Other star-driven plays that recouped this season are A Steady Rain (with Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig) and the revivals of Hamlet (Jude Law) and A View From the Bridge (Liev Schreiber and Scarlett Johansson). Directed by Mr. Mamet, Race opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Dec. 6, and is scheduled to run through June 13.

The Back-Up Plan, a $30 million romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez and released by CBS Films, came in second place with an estimated $12.3 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. (CBS Films, which aggressively interpreted its films opening as very solid, hopes a shortage of female-oriented pictures will eventually turn the heavily marketed Back-Up Plan into a winner.) The $25 million thriller The Losers became the latest in a string of flops from Joel Silvers Dark Castle Entertainment with about $9.6 million, putting it in fourth place. The No. 1 film was a holdover: DreamWorks Animations How to Train Your Dragon, with positive word of mouth and premium-priced 3-D tickets, brought in about $15 million and a new total of $178 million. The comedy Date Night from 20th Century Fox chugged away in third place with about $10.6 million ($63.5 million total).

More than 4,000 fans, some who camped out overnight, showed up to hear Mr. Bieber sing three songs at Sydney Harbor, but the plug was pulled on the event hours before showtime when attendees started pushing and shoving. I am so sorry that it got out of control, Mr. Bieber said later in an Australian television appearance. We dont want anyone to get hurt. It gets crazy sometimes. Last November, an appearance by Mr. Bieber at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y., resulted in a fan stampede after which the singers manager, Scott Braun, was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and criminal nuisance. The Australian police said that fans atSydney Harborhad sustained only minor injuries and were treated at the scene.",2010-04-26T14:47:25+0000

The tag was quickly removed. More recently, someone punctured the piece, perhaps with a rock or a brick, leaving several small holes and a gaping one through which a previous mural, by the twins known as Os Gemeos, is visible. The piece is a prelude to Mr. Faireys exhibition at Deitch Projects, the gallerys final show before it closes. Andrea Cashman, a spokeswoman for Deitch, said the puncture and tagging were a natural occurrence for any large outdoor project. She said that members of Mr. Faireys team would be filling the punctures soon.

The filmmaker, Joe Berlinger, whose documentaries include Paradise Lost and Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, said he had been served with a request from Chevron for more than 600 hours of unused footage for his 2009 documentary Crude. The movie, seen in a scene above, chronicles Ecuadoreans who sued Texaco, which is now owned by Chevron, saying the companies practices at the Lago Agrio oil field resulted in the contamination of their drinking and bathing water. Mr. Berlinger, who is scheduled to appear in United States District Court in Manhattan on Friday, said Chevrons request violated his First Amendment rights.

us,Alphabet Chic,"In their nearly 20 years together, the graphic artists Michael Amzalag and Mathias Augustyniak  who go by the name M/M (Paris)  have designed more than 50 typefaces, from an alphabet built from the sliced-up photographs of 26 male models to the inky resin letter forms that spell out Medulla on the cover of Bjorks 2004 album. Their latest, the Pradalphabet (above), was originally conceived as a temporary five-letter logotype for the house of Miuccia: Prada-M. (The M stands for Milano and M/M.) But the duos ideographic tendencies got the best of them, and in the end, M/M designed a whole alphabet of ornamented initials, each representing a hazy portrait of the Prada brand. Its like looking at a planet from afar, says Augustyniak, who along with Amzalag spent up to six hours hand-drawing each letter. You can see a continent, but its impossible to say whats inside. Examine the letters closely, however, and youll spot cleaning implements, Italian phrases, strange machines and a picture of two men standing on a balcony. (Theyre inhabitants of the Prada world, Amzalag says.) For now, they live in a collectors edition of T-shirts, each silk-screened with a P, R, A, D or M and packaged in a cloth-bound box with a 64-page album describing the project. Other letters are available on demand at Prada stores worldwide. ",2010-04-27T13:30:31+0000

These weaknesses put us at a disadvantage. We make decisions with partial information. We are forced to steer by guesswork. We go with our gut.,2010-04-28T12:36:23+0000

The plates, which come in an edition of 2,500 in both black and white, are based on photographs of a wall relief that Stingel began in 2008. Fittingly, that project was inspired by the wallpaper in the dining room of his childhood home. Why make tableware? I like to eat, the artist says. And I like to look at my work  two birds, one stone. Its not the artists first excursion into the everyday. In 2004, he famously swathed Grand Central Stations cavernous Vanderbilt Hall in floral carpeting. Impressive, of course. But this is one project hell be able to dine out on for years.

Thats the question the curators at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum wrestled with for nearly three years as they assembled Why Design Now?, the museums fourth National Design Triennial, which opens May 14. Their response, presented through 134 projects from around the world, might be the design equivalent of the Hippocratic oath. Many are high-minded, utilitarian responses to critical problems overseas (cleaner-burning stoves, a land-mine-removal suit) and at home (New York Citys new Hoop bike rack, M.I.T.s prototype for a lightweight electric city car). Theres room for high-style design, but there also needs to be room for the rest of the world, says Matilda McQuaid, the museums deputy curatorial director. But its definition of socially responsible has room for whimsical conceptualism (Interactive Institutes Energy Aware Clock, above), architectural grandiosity (Foster & Partners sustainable city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi) and simple beauty (Heath Ceramics tableware). Even Twitter made the cut. People say the focus on socially responsible design is just because of the Wall Street crisis and isnt going to survive once things are back to normal, McQuaid says.

us,High Gloss," If you are strong enough not to be moved by dolphin console tables and rococo plasterwork, Syrie Maugham is probably nothing more to you than the wife of the sulfurous literary lion W. Somerset Maugham. For the rest of us, its a different story. A domestic-arts arbiter of adventurous originality, Syrie set up shop in London in 1922 and went on to forge a triumphantly theatrical look celebrating glamour and luxury. Some of her ideas were odd, some immensely profitable. She said that by stripping peonies of their leaves, party guests could be fooled into believing they were wax, a look she preferred to fresh. Indifferent antiques were ruthlessly cut down, painted, pickled or otherwise improved until they sang arias of sustained chic. Were dealers already referring to amusing pieces  furniture with little intrinsic worth but a surfeit of charm  before Syrie Maugham came on the scene? I suspect it all began with her. As it happens, were on the verge of a Syrie fest. Two forthcoming books, Selina Hastingss The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham (Random House) and Pauline C. Metcalfs Syrie Maugham: Staging the Glamorous Interior (Acanthus Press), make the point that no pedestal was too high for the woman who popularized the all-white room, an icily moderne cocktail of mirrored screens and fireplaces, geometrically sculptured carpets, shagreen tables, satin slipcovers, towering plaster lamps in the form of palm trees and velvet  velvet!  lampshades. You would have thought that with two books already out there  Syrie Maugham, a rare 1978 monograph, and 1980s The Scandal of Syrie Maugham  to say nothing of Beverley Nicholss 1966 screed A Case of Human Bondage, which was dedicated entirely to her toxic marriage, there was nothing left to say or dig up.

Hyres 2010 will also feature a Walter Pfeiffer retrospective and a new video by Steven Klein depicting his fashion photography from the past ten years.

There are also diary-style entries on Monroes relationship with Arthur Miller, as well as letters to her psychoanalysts and to Lee Strasberg, her friend and acting instructor, written when she was in the locked psychiatric ward of the Payne Whitney Clinic in New York. Shes trying to live the life of an artist and suffering a lot, Ms. Hodell said in a telephone interview.

The motion contends that Mr. Gunsons testimony would prove that an extradition request filed with Switzerland last year included a false depiction of the sentencing plan by Judge Laurence J. Rittenband. The request said that Judge Rittenband sent Mr. Polanski to prison in 1977 for a psychiatric study so he would be in a better position to reach a fair and just decision before sentencing, while Mr. Gunson, according to Mr. Polanskis lawyers, has testified that Mr. Polanskis prison stay was to constitute his entire sentence. Prosecutors have argued in court that the extradition request was an accurate portrayal of events. Mr. Polanskis lawyers said that Swiss officials needed access to the sealed transcripts to fairly determine whether Mr. Polanski should be sent back to the United States, which he fled in 1978 before sentencing for having sex with a minor.

Buildings stand empty. The few people on the property are involved in the continuing cleanup or are among the sculptors, painters and photographers who created an improbable artists colony in some of the shipyard buildings. But a crucial decision is facing the Board of Supervisors in a few weeks. It will open  or close  the door to the Lennar Corporations $7 billion redevelopment plan for the 770-acre site, one that would include 10,500 homes, large amounts of retail and commercial space and even new accommodations for the artists colony. The development project is headed by Kofi Bonner, a vice president at Lennar who spearheaded the redevelopment of Emeryville, which, like Hunters Point, was plagued by toxic waste. Mr. Bonner served as San Franciscos economic development director under Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. during the 1990s.Wine on Tap | At Frances, the restaurant in San Franciscos Castro neighborhood getting all the buzz these days, customers pay by the ounce for the wine they drink. But that is not the only difference from the way most of the citys other eateries handle their drinks. The beverage director, Paul Einbund, blends the house wines creating unconventional blends from the fruits of the Sierra foothills  himself, after they are brought from the wineries in kegs.

We knew his dad, Mustafa, who was our next-door neighbor, but we had never met Mehmet, then away at school. This whirlwind climbed in through our breakfast-room window, was charmingly chatty and challenged my husband, then in his late 30s, to a little hoops in our driveway. While mopping up the driveway with my husband, Mehmet mentioned that he was in University of Pennsylvania medical school and getting an M.B.A. from Wharton at the same time. When my husband said that seemed pretty ambitious, Mehmet just brushed that off, saying that his dad said that to practice medicine today, you have to have an M.B.A. Sounds like he hasnt changed much  hes not just a world-beater, hes becoming a world-changer.JEAN KENNEDY HUNTERHouston",2010-04-30T14:12:33+0000
us,Letter: A Closer Reading of Roman Vishniac,"In Thomas McGoverns letter to the magazine in the April 18 issue, he mistakenly writes that Robert Capa stated he discovered how undiscovered Vishniac was. To begin with, it wasnt Robert Capa who said this (he diedin 1954); it was Cornell Capa who championed Vishniacs work in exhibits, books and lectures at the International Center of Photography, which he, Cornell Capa, founded. I was an assistant to Cornell Capa for 35 years, and what Cornell clearly meant in his statement was his surprise that Vishniacs work, as important as it was, was not more widely known prior to his own efforts after 1966. For McGovern to go on to say that Capa (either Robert or Cornell, take your pick) had a similar impulse to encourage the viewers to believe things that werent really there is a gross misinterpretation of the facts, and unfair conjecture.ANNA WINANDNew York",2010-04-30T14:15:39+0000

We had thought that the Obama administration would be different, a little less likely to want to menace and jail journalists.

He roomed with both Bix Beiderbecke and Bunny Berigan, he hired Billie Holiday to sing with his band and  at least by his own account  he turned down Charlie Parkers bid to join his saxophone section. (I said, Bird, you couldnt play in my band, youre too much of an individualist! ) Superficially, Shaw couldnt have been less like these doom-bound drunks and drug addicts. In Three Chords for Beautys Sake, Tom Nolans absorbing if somewhat sketchy new biography, we see him drunk exactly once  when he was in his teens and a prankish band mate fed him shots of rye with beer chasers  and once, at about 20, half-stoned on weed with Berigan. Thanks to clean living, good luck and, surely, a measure of cussedness, Shaw lived to be 94 and died, in 2004, the way Robert Frost recommended: Better to go down dignified / With boughten friendship at your side / Than none at all. Provide, provide! He even kept his sense of humor, or at least his memory of an old Myron Cohen joke. His personal assistant (who stayed with him for 11 years, sometimes by dint of repeating the word mortgage to himself) and his home-hospice caregiver were changing the old mans bedclothes during his last days and asked if he was comfortable. I make a living, he said. He did, too.

The Florida governor may be a moderate in some sense, but his real loyalties are to cynicism, self-interest (though this time, Im pretty sure that hes misjudged where those interests lie), and the persistent pursuit of the budgetary free lunch. At a time when the country desperately needs politicians who are equipped to make tough choices, Crists record suggests that hes the last person that anyone  conservative or liberal  should want to see in a position of responsibility in Washington D.C.",2010-04-30T16:27:45+0000

us,An Out-of-Office Message for Republican Candidates," Some 30 months from the next presidential election, the field of potential challengers to Barack Obama is like a solar system in its infancy  unformed, gaseous and lacking a dominant star. One characteristic, however, stands out. In a recent CNN poll that tested the strength of possible Republican hopefuls, only one of the seven most likely candidates (that would be Representative Ron Paul) will actually hold an elected office by the end of this year. The two leading candidates as of today, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney, havent held a political job in more than three years. Sarah Palin gave up her governorship when the vast Alaskan frontier became too confining for her ambition, and Newt Gingrich hasnt run for anything since the days before Google was a verb. Tim Pawlenty, Minnesotas governor, is leaving office at the end of the year. Weve certainly had our share of presidents who ran as former officeholders of one kind or another: Jimmy Carter ran as an ex-governor in 1976, and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were out of office by the time they finally won the presidency. Still, you have to go back almost three decades  to the former vice president Walter Mondale in 1984  to find a major-party candidate who didnt hold an office on the day he clinched the nomination. Which makes it strange that a number of Republican aspirants seem to be hoping for their own version of a jobless recovery.",2010-04-30T16:43:38+0000

This was the latest swing in the fortunes of Mr. Fletcher, who was fired by the executive committee of the board of trustees in October only to be rehired by the full board in November. The vote has no binding effect on the board, which controls hiring and firing. We will only know what the practical effects are later, Rob LeBuhn, the board chairman, said.

On Thursday Mr. Polanskis American lawyers filed a motion in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking the sealed testimony of Roger Gunson, a retired deputy district attorney, about a sentencing plan devised by Judge Laurence J. Rittenband. Mr. Polanski pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl but fled the United States in 1978 before he could be sentenced by Judge Rittenband, who died in 1993. Mr. Polanskis lawyers said the testimony would show that the United States request for his extradition was based on false and incomplete information. But Folco Galli, a Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman, told The Associated Press that the sealed testimony was irrelevant because the United States and Switzerland have to work on the assumption that the facts in the extradition request are represented correctly.",2010-04-30T23:08:06+0000

us,Enron and fences Scores Are Eligible for Tonys,"While many theatergoers associate composers scores with musicals, the years Tony Award for best score could go to a play, with productions of Enron (with Norbert Leo Butz, right), Fences and The Royal Family all eligible for nominations in that category. The Tony Administration Committee voted on Friday that the score of Enron, with music by Adam Cork and lyrics by Lucy Prebble, was eligible for best score, a category that has long been defined as music and/or lyrics created for theater, as opposed to another medium. That concept rules out the scores for the new Green Day musical, American Idiot, and the Afrobeat musical Fela! The committee decided that Idiot was not eligible because less than 50 percent of it was written for the Broadway production. The score for Fela! was ruled ineligible because much of its music is drawn from songs by its real-life main character, Fela Anikulapo Kuti. However, the original scores by Branford Marsalis for Fences and Maury Yeston for The Royal Family will be eligible for the best-score award, though both plays are revivals. Neither required votes by the committee because Mr. Marsalis and Mr. Yeston were listed in the shows opening-night credits.",2010-04-30T23:10:31+0000
us,Re-evaluation Ordered In rye Sequel Ruling,"A United States appeals court on Friday vacated a lower courts order to enjoin the publication of a novel described as a sequel to J. D. Salingers Catcher in the Rye. The appeals court agreed with a district courts judgment that Salingers lawyers would probably prevail on the merits but told that lower court to re-evaluate whether the injunction should be ordered. Last year lawyers for Salinger successfully argued that the sequel  60 Years Later by the Swedish writer Fredrik Colting, using the pseudonym J. D. California  represented an illegal violation of Salingers copyrights. (Salinger died in January at 91.) In arguments presented to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, lawyers for Mr. Colting said that the injunction was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and conflicted with a unanimous 2006 Supreme Court decision that said a four-part test must be employed to determine if a patent has been violated before an injunction can be issued. In its decision, the appeals court did not rule on the prior restraint question and remanded the district courts injunction so that court could apply the four-part test.",2010-04-30T23:11:09+0000

Based on ancient Greek models, which had been widely copied in the 18th and 19th centuries, Robsjohn-Gibbingss version made the klismos shape famous again in the 20th. Obsessed with its elegant lines, he designed versions of the chair throughout his career, but the most recent examples have been made by Saridis in Athens since the early 1960s, when the designer met the companys owners and settled in the Greek capital. Its simple but opulent curves hint at sleek penthouses with butlers who serve cocktails on the terrace at sunset. (Indeed, Robsjohn-Gibbingss Saridis pieces have been collected by practitioners of the luxe life from Aristotle Onassis to Karl Lagerfeld.)
