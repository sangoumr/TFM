""There are about a thousand residents within two miles of the festival location, and it's important to keep noise down, but first and foremost, it's a fun thing to do -- the first time its been tried in the U.K.,"" explained Emily Eavis, co-organizer of the festival. Attracting as many as 2,000 visitors, the event says on its Web site, glastonburyfestivals.co.uk, that it is the ""largest greenfield music and performing arts festival in the world,"" and is held to coincide with the summer solstice in this village near Stonehenge. A spokesman for the festival said that the Mendip District Council, the local authority for Glastonbury, agreed in January that the festival could proceed as long as organizers met new restrictions, including monitors who will patrol to ensure that noise is kept to an acceptable level.

The American Civil Liberties Union, its officers, Board of Directors and staff deeply mourn the passing of a courageous fighter for civil liberties. Following Japan's December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, America rounded up in its very own internment camps fellow citizens just because of their Japanese ancestry. Korematsu, born to Japanese immigrants, was a 23-year-old welder in Oakland, CA when military officials ordered all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast into internment camps. Korematsu's family and friends complied and urged him to do so, too. He refused, was arrested, convicted and sent to an internment camp in Utah. The ACLU fought to reverse President Roosevelt's executive order instituting the internment. The ACLU--with the leadership of its West Coast offices--represented Korematsu before the United States Supreme Court, which sided with the government. Scholars now acknowledge this ruling as one of the worst in the court's history. A U.S. District Court in 1983 overturned Korematsu's conviction. ""I thought what the military was doing was unconstitutional,"" Korematsu later said. ""I was really upset because I was branded as an enemy alien when I'm an American."" Korematsu helped win a national apology and reparations for internment camp survivors and their families in 1988. President Bill Clinton awarded him the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten years later. In 2001, the ACLU bestowed its prestigious Roger N. Baldwin Medal of Liberty award--named for ACLU's founder--on Korematsu, who continued campaigning for civil liberties. He opposed the USA Patriot Act and the U.S. government denial of due process to suspected terror detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The ACLU extends its deepest sympathy to the Korematsu family for the loss of one of America's greatest patriots.",2005-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,New Faces of Swedish Cinema,"Rarely has a cinematic assessment of middle-class teenage life divested itself of its sensual glamour as relentlessly as Lukas Moodysson's 1998 film, ""Show Me Love,"" a sweet comedy with a bitter aftertaste that stars Alexandra Dahlstrom and Rebecca Liljeberg (above). The clueless young people in the Swedish backwater town in which its youthful dramas erupt are so desperate for the trappings of sophistication that they raid their parents' medicine cabinets in search of drugs and guzzle cheap wine until they vomit. When they have sex, they don't know what they're doing or why they're doing it. Peer pressure is so omnipotent that assurances by their parents that the high school pecking order is no indication of their future status don't help. ""Show Me Love,"" which has two screenings on Monday, is the earliest of the four films directed by Mr. Moodysson to be shown in ""New Faces of Swedish Cinema,"" a seven-day series of 9 feature films and 10 shorts that begins today at the Walter Reade Theater. Mr. Moodysson is the leading light among the younger filmmakers in a national cinema that is still quaking under the shadow of Ingmar Bergman. Unlike Bergman films, whose characters are in the grip of metaphysical and psychological crisis, Mr. Moodysson's are the prisoners of social forces beyond their control. His comedy ""Together"" explores the tensions inside a 1970's commune in Stockholm with an easygoing intimacy. His masterpiece, ""Lilya 4-Ever,"" observes the struggle for survival of a 13-year-old girl, abandoned by her mother in a rotting city, who is tricked into a life of enforced prostitution in Sweden. ""A Hole in My Heart,"" which has its United States premiere tomorrow, is the most experimental of the four and observes the making of an amateur pornographic film by two men and a woman in a grimy suburban apartment. In surreal flashes, it suggests the chaos and violence that can result when social restraints are discarded.(""New Faces of Swedish Cinema"" opens today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center, (212)875-5600; www.filmlinc.com.

No one quite believed Ms. Tcherkassky, a leading ballerina with the company and Mr. Orr's wife, when she commented with her characteristic gentleness that now she could have a garden. But this week we have them back in spirit with performances by the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, which Mr. Orr has directed since 1997. Ms. Tcherkassky is growing dancers as the company's ballet mistress. The 36-year-old company was known for performances of ballets by George Balanchine, the backbone of its repertory. But Mr. Orr decided to branch out with newer choreographers. And so the Pittsburgh dancers will perform ballets by Kevin O'Day, Derek Deane and New York's own Dwight Rhoden. Mr. O'Day's new ""Sting/ING Situations"" (above, with Jennifer Langenstein and Richard Brown) is set to hit songs by the rock singer, including ""Walking on the Moon,"" ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" and ""Roxanne."" The choreographer, who has performed with the Joffrey Ballet, Frankfurt Ballet and Twyla Tharp, has set the timing, patterns and spacing, but the rest is left for the dancers to decide. Mr. Deane, a former Royal Ballet principal, has set his ""Hungry Heart ... 'we all have one'!!"" to music by Bruce Springsteen. In the ballet, he tells the stories of the everyday people who frequent a diner in the 1950's and 60's. And Mr. Rhoden takes on Beethoven and Bach in his new ""7th Heaven.""

The median sales price was $695,000, up 27 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Another study, prepared for Prudential Douglas Elliman by Miller Samuel, reported that while sales were brisk, the low inventory of apartments led to a 6 percent quarterly drop in the number of completed sales, to 2,028 units.

Add a turnstyle, third rail and a raunchy smell, and you've got a ghost limb of the L line. It helps that the Bohen Foundation space, designed by LoTek, already had a wide band of sidewalk-style grating on its ground floor and a basement reached by a heavy metal staircase (the banister temporarily severed to enhance the illusion), with I-beam columns all but identical to those in the New York underground. The fact that the whole thing looks real while also feeling fake -- too hollow, unused and clean means that the often poetic solitude of an empty subway station becomes simultaneously funny and unfunny, like the Venetian canals of Las Vegas. ""End Station"" funnels 1970's site-specific installation art through the current obsession with meticulous replication. A result is Photo Realism in the round, the environmental equivalent of one of Duane Hanson's trompe l'oeil sculptures of construction workers or tourists. Other antecedents include Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes, Robert Gober's sinks and drains and, more recently, Gregor Schneider's bleak, dead-end alleyway cut into the Gladstone Gallery two years ago. Finally, ""End Station"" is also the latest, super-sized instance of the thousands of spawn of that Surrealist one-liner -- Meret Oppenheim's fur-lined tea-cup. With such an easily traced pedigree, the installation's bang does not quite equal the bucks, logistical planning and stagecraft that went into it. But as a panorama for an imaginary museum of New York's natural history, with us playing the native cave dwellers, ""End Station"" is not to be missed. It's the New York subway for visitors from Las Vegas. (Noon to 6 p.m., Tuesdays through Fridays, Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)414-4575. Through July 1; free.)

us,The Listings; DAVID HARBOUR,"The last time David Harbour appeared on Broadway, in Tom Stoppard's ""Invention of Love,"" he portrayed the stolid object of desire of an inhibited university professor. In the exciting new revival of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" Mr. Harbour (above, with Kathleen Turner) is again a stolid object of desire, though this time it's a very uninhibited professor's wife who has focused her lustful attentions upon him. Now, you might think there's nothing to being stolid and desirable when you're the owner of a sharp square jaw and shoulders to match. But in Anthony Page's beautifully balanced production of ""Woolf,"" which stars Ms. Turner and Bill Irwin, Mr. Harbour demonstrates that there can be all sorts of lively and arresting angles within manly squareness. Mr. Harbour plays Nick, the ambitious young academic and late-night party guest who is perfectly willing to bed his much older hostess (Ms. Turner) in the name of career advancement. And while Nick may be ""a flop in some departments,"" as Ms. Turner's disappointed character snarls, Mr. Harbour seems more than likely to advance his own career with this unflinching, surprisingly varied portrait of a hungry all-American cad.

The deaths occurred during clinical studies to test the drug's effectiveness in treating mild cognitive impairment, a form of memory loss. The drug has been used to treat two million people for Alzheimer's since it was approved in 2001. The company said it had mailed letters to thousands of doctors after negotiations with the Food and Drug Administration. Johnson & Johnson has also amended its packaging insert to disclose the deaths. During the two-year studies, 13 participants taking Reminyl died while one patient who received a placebo died. The clinical trials involved about 2,000 patients in 16 countries. Stephanie Saul (NYT)",2005-04-02T05:00:00+0000

The question of whether to take out the tube divides the other three friends, as two want him to live and one wants him to die so he can get the portable Sony PlayStation Kenny left him in his will. According to Matt Stone, who created the series with Trey Parker, ""South Park"" was able to parody the politics of the Terri Schiavo legal battle so quickly because they began the episode from scratch the Thursday before it was telecast. ""There's kind of nothing funny about the Terri Schiavo thing,"" Mr. Stone said on the telephone from Los Angeles, ""so that's why we did it."" He added: ""We, like everyone else, found that whole thing fascinating. That show, and humor in general, is how we work it out."" For each episode, Mr. Stone, Mr. Parker and their staff write, animate and give voice to the show scene by scene, delivering the final version to Comedy Central on Wednesday for its broadcast that night.

Two years later, Mr. Abbott's workphobic, alcoholic father followed suit. At this point, the Abbott children felt ready to take charge of their crowded, bathroomless household in a rough part of a depressed industrial city in England. ""There was a real sense of liberation; I thought we could do anything,"" Mr. Abbott said. ""It was grim by fact and by certain events, but it wasn't grim.""",2005-04-02T05:00:00+0000

The gatehouse, designed by Frederick S. Cook in a Romanesque Revival style, was completed in 1890 as part of the New Croton Aqueduct system. The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1981 and added to National Register of Historic Places two years later. The city took it out of service in 1989, and it is now under the jurisdiction of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which is to cover the $13 million cost of restoring it. Aaron Davis Hall, across Convent Avenue on the campus of the City College of New York, is seeking more space for performance programs and administrative offices. The hall develops new work by emerging artists of color and provides a youth educational performance series. Currently under construction, the Gatehouse is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2006.

In 1922 the poet Andr Breton, a co-founder of the Surrealist movement, wrote an influential article titled ""Lchez Tout"" (""Drop Everything"") in which he advised his colleagues to quit their jobs, their daily routines, even their families and head out. Travel would offer a fresh start, and maybe even a cure for the ills and ennui inflicted by World War I.

His curvaceous Lady chair, designed in 1951 for Arflex, celebrated that newfangled material foam rubber. His boxy plastic scale for Terraillon was a kitchen staple in the 1970's. With another design giant, Richard Sapper, Zanuso came up with innovations like the molded plastic child's chair for Kartell, the folding Grillo telephone for Siemens and the clamshell-cube radio for Brionvega. But my favorite Zanuso product is the Marcuso dining table, designed for Zanotta in 1969. Its square glass top has rounded corners -- very mod -- and its legs attach to the top by screwing into stainless-steel discs that are electrostatically welded to the underside of the glass. It was this last detail that stopped me in my tracks when I first saw the table, at the late, lamented Design Research. At that moment, I understood the relationship between technology and aesthetics in modern design, and I was hooked. A few years ago, I might have said that the Marcuso table seemed a little dated, but today it looks fresh again. Its lines are as taut as -- though more sensual than -- its International-style and Minimalist counterparts.

Designed by the Czech-born architect Thomas Bitnar, the Avis outlet is perched in the lonely Gallatin Valley like a luminous toolshed. It is bold architecture, given the local preference for tradition. ""It's not easy to sell the 21st century in Montana,"" Bitnar says. ""Here, people prefer cowboy architecture, which means taking beautiful materials like stone and wood and leading them in the wrong direction."" While Avis is pleased with the structure, some neighbors are not, though some of the farm kids in the area seem to approve. That's no coincidence, since the design was inspired by the farm outbuildings that dot the Montana landscape. ""When I moved here,"" Bitnar continues, ""I noticed these amazing farm structures, like silos and horse stalls."" For the Avis building, he extracted the basic contour of these simple sheds -- the gridded box and the sloped roof -- and clad it in glossy metal and glass to create a glowing billboard for passing traffic. ""Around here we have so many sunny days. And when the sun is out, the building really shines. That might help the locals get used to it. But it's hard. People here dream about cowboys.""

Coffee makes for crazy shopping, wine wreaks havoc on the ability to discriminate and a half-pint of Guinness makes you smell like a half-pint of Guinness. This week, teatime coincides with Samurai shopping, since teapots are the coveted prize. If a pot pops up befitting budget and sensibility comparable to, say, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle's, pouncing will ensue. The trick is to find a pot that functions efficiently, balancing impeccable taste and flaming eccentricity. Samurai shopping is electromagnetic: a current of desire passes through a live wire -- like me -- creating fields in which all fabulous objects gravitate in one's direction.

The Loftcube, a modular dwelling by the Berlin-based designer Werner Aisslinger, is just large enough, at 390 square feet, for one nomad and mate. Its exterior shell is made of steel coated in white Corian, with a menu of choices -- solid or glass, wooden louvers or doors -- for the side walls. The inside is as practical as it is cool. A hinged faucet is carved into a Corian panel dividing kitchen from bath so that it can swing in both directions. But the kitchen can just as easily be a home office: it's all customizable. Heating, plumbing and electricity are all built-in or integrated with connected buildings. And there is no messy foundation work required, because the whole thing sits on steel-and-fiberglass legs. ""I wanted it to look more like a product than a house -- small, lightweight and mobile,"" Aisslinger says.

Silverstein, the much loved poet and author of idiosyncratic and often bittersweet books like ""The Giving Tree,"" ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" and other children's classics of the past four decades, worked on ""Runny Babbit"" on and off for 20 years, before his death in 1999. Silverstein was a constant reviser. ""He had mountains of poems and stories, in bits and pieces, and in different versions, written on stray pieces of paper,"" his friend and former editor, Joan Robins, told Publishers Weekly. Robins and Toni Markiet, the executive editor of HarperCollins Children's Books, both helped shepherd ""Runny Babbit"" into print. Written in jolly inverse verse, the book recounts the adventures of a kindhearted, rather hapless rabbit, from restaurant to bath to library (""A bience scook? A boetry pook? / Oh, no -- a bomic cook!""). HarperCollins has done a first printing of 500,000 copies, betting that deprived Silverstein fans will be eager to snap it up.

""Jorge sees his textiles as his buildings, only in different materials,"" says Cristina Grajales, a decorative-arts consultant who is their New York representative. The two have been using a combination of natural materials to create carpets, fabrics and panels since 2002. Cumare, agave, yare reed and fique, a hand-hewn, biodegradable fiber from the Andes, are woven by Bogot artisans with tin, glass, aluminum and nonharmful copper. The result is decidedly modern. Metal panels that can be fashioned as wallcoverings, table mats or room dividers are their most experimental offering. Grajales uses agave panels as curtains; they create unusual light. ""You have transparency and opacity,"" she says. ""There's a very warm feeling."" ALEXANDRA ZISSU",2005-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Remix; Back to the Future,"In 1929, a 27-year-old Danish architect named Arne Jacobsen was struck with a vision of utopia. In his revelation, the citizens of tomorrow would inhabit dwellings reflecting an accelerated pace of life: homes with helipads, boating docks in the basement and doormats that doubled as vacuum cleaners. A life-size model of this ""House of the Future"" (executed by Jacobsen and his partner, Flemming Lassen) was temporarily erected that year at the Housing and Building Exhibition in Copenhagen. Audiences marveled at wall panels that beamed in paintings from remote art collections, a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals and a conveyor tube that dropped mail directly into the home. The exhibition, which established Jacobsen as a master of Danish Modernism, was eventually dismantled, and the ""House of the Future"" faded into the past. Now a group of Danish architects is reconstructing the house in Bellevue, located just north of Copenhagen and home to several other Jacobsen buildings. The new structure, to open next year, is a wrinkle in time: once futuristic, it's now historical. But despite certain retrograde elements -- windows that are rolled down like car windows -- it's still cutting edge. You can also tour the rest of Jacobsen's local legacy, including his beachfront house, the Bellevue Theatre and Jacobsen, a restaurant featuring his modern-primitive silverware (made famous as the astronauts' cutlery in ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). Jacobsen's seaside shrine remains ahead of the curve. ADAM GOLLNER",2005-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Daughter of the Enlightenment,"Last spring, Ayaan Hirsi Ali took her ""Dutch mother"" -- the woman who taught her the language and cared for her after she arrived in the Netherlands as a refugee in 1992 -- to lunch at the Dudok brasserie, near the Parliament in The Hague. As always, Hirsi Ali's armed security detail was there. They have been her companions since she started receiving death threats in September 2002. Hirsi Ali, who was born in Somalia and has been a member of the Dutch Parliament since January 2003, had endorsed the view that Islam is a backward religion, condemned the way women live under it and said that by today's standards, the prophet Muhammad would be considered a perverse tyrant. She had also announced that she was no longer a believing Muslim. The punishment for such apostasy is, according to strict interpretations of Islam, death. That day at the Dudok, several dozen vocational students were taking up the main restaurant, so she and her guards parked at two tables near the bar. Hirsi Ali had her back to the restaurant when one of the students, apparently a Dutch convert to Islam, tapped her on the shoulder. ""I turned around,"" she recalls in her elegant English, ""and saw this sweet, young Dutch guy, about 24 years old. With freckles! And he was like, 'Madam, I hope the mujahedeen get you and kill you.' "" Hirsi Ali handed him her knife and told him, ""Why don't you do it yourself?""",2005-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,The Remix; Let There Be L.E.D.,"Silicon Valley has moved from laptops to lamps. The Palo Alto-New York start-up Lucesco has introduced Halley, a supersleek task lamp that snubs bulbs in favor of L.E.D.'s (light-emitting diodes), which are smaller and more ecofriendly, with a life span of up to 20 years. To create an iconic design, the company turned to Richard Sapper, who put halogen lights on the map in the 80's with the Tizio lamp. Sapper didn't exactly jump at the prospect. ""The L.E.D. lighting fixtures I'd seen gave off a light that was much too cold -- inhuman, really,"" he says. Only after being convinced that Lucesco had diodes capable of emitting a warm light did he sign on. The biggest challenge was the intense heat that the L.E.D.'s generate. Sapper dealt with it the same way he had when designing the IBM ThinkPad -- with a tiny fan. Springs and wires were something else he wanted to avoid, but L.E.D.'s require cables. So he took another page from computer technology, employing the tiny wire hinges used in laptops to conduct electricity to channel energy through Halley's base. To balance the arms, which allow the lamp to move in three dimensions, Sapper connected them with a metal ball. The light revolves around this ball like a comet; hence its name. Having seen the light source, Sapper is an L.E.D. convert: he's already at work on two more lamps for Lucesco. Go to www.lucesco.com. MARISA BARTOLUCCI",2005-04-03T05:00:00+0000

He is also a regular contributor to these pages; he weighs in this week on Jonathan Safran Foer's much-anticipated second novel, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close."" For Kirn, criticism and fiction writing have always been closely linked. ""When you're writing fiction, there are two voices in your head -- the one doing the storytelling and the one who is reviewing that story and second-guessing it,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""On some level you can't be a novelist without being a critic, even if you never turn that critical ability into essays and publish them."" Kirn, who was New York magazine's book critic in the mid-1990's and who was also the literary editor of GQ for several years, said that reviewing books is vastly different from reviewing, say, movies. ""Roger Ebert knows people will go see the films he writes about. But when you write about books, you can't depend on people agreeing or disagreeing with your opinion -- no matter how much you rave, you can count on maybe 5 percent of your readers actually buying the book. It becomes more important to write something that's worth reading in and of itself.""

Prior to his retirement in l991, he was Chairman of Brecker & Merryman, Inc., an international consulting firm headquartered in New York which he co-founded with Andrew Merryman in 1973. The firm was subsequently acquired by Manpower, Inc. Born in New York, he attended the Pawling School and graduated with honors with exceptional distinction from Yale in December, 1942. While at Yale he was an editor of the Yale Daily News and wrote music and lyrics for two Yale Dramat shows which toured the country. During World War II he served for two years in the U.S. Marine Corps attached to the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). He then spent eight years here and abroad as a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, including tours as Vice Consul and U.S. Information Officer in India, Chief of the USIS Exhibits Branch, Officer in Charge of the official U.S. exhibition at the International ""Atoms for Peace"" conference in Geneva in 1954, and Briefing Officer for the Secretary of State. While in Geneva, on loan to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, he escorted President Eisenhower through the live atomic reactor which was part of the U.S. exhibition. Before establishing his own firm, he spent a number of years with several leading advertising agencies in New York and as a co-owner of a flag manufacturing company in Clifton, NJ. Active in various civic and community affairs, he was a member of the New York City Youth Board, a member of the New York Republican County Committee, and a Director of the New York Young Republican Club. He was also Vice Chairman of the YMCA of Greater New York, a member of the YMCA's National Board, a Board member of the Professional Children's School, and Vice President and for fifteen years a member of the Council of the University Club in New York. From 1979 to 1994 he served on the Board of Visitors of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. Music played a big part in his life from his earliest years, and while at college he briefly considered making a career out of it. He was an accomplished pianist, playing popular music largely by ear. Two of the numerous songs he wrote were published and one was recorded by Carmen Cavallero. When the Yale Dramat staged a retrospective musical in 1980 called ""Deja Review"", the pre-opening announcement said the show would ""pay tribute to Yale composers from Cole Porter to Maltby and Shire and Richard Brecker"". At his death he was a Trustee of the Naval War College Foundation in Newport, RI, President emeritus of the Yale Club of the Treasure Coast, and a Director of the Indian River Land Trust Association. Having traveled widely, including a mule-back trip to Tibet the year before the Chinese took over that country, he was also an Honorary Fellow of the Explorers Club.

A sequence of galleries exhibiting luggage and handbags proceeded to a large advertising photograph of the actress Uma Thurman and smaller shots of runway models, all wearing Vuitton fashions.

He had greater strength, courage and dignity than any man. Damon was born in Brooklyn on August 8, 1988 and lived a full, active and creative life despite severe congenital heart disease. He was fearless and determined and full of love and never felt sorry for himself. He had many passions, but acting was his first love. He made his television debut on the hit HBO series Deadwood 10 days before he died. Previously he appeared on stage in The Great Kapock Tree, Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, The King and I, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Guys and Dolls, Frog Prince and Cindafella. He also performed at the Provincetown Playhouse in Cymbeline, Pericles and Romeo and Juliet. At Brooklyn Technical High School, Damon appeared in The Importance of Being Ernest, Picasso at the Lapin Agile and Tommy. As vice president of the drama club he made a brilliant directorial debut with The Man Who Came to Dinner. A gifted student and avid reader, Damon attended the Rockefeller Children's School, P.S. 29 where he graduated with highest honors and the Salk School of Science where he won the Literature prize, the Science Prize and the prize for Outstanding Student. He wrote beautifully (though his spelling needed work). He planned to graduate Brooklyn Tech next year and go on to a career in acting and international relations. A born diplomat, Damon attended special events at the Council of Foreign Relations and hoped to intern there. Damon was a natural leader and explorer and enjoyed summers in the Adirondacks, Truro, Martha's Vineyard and family homes in the Catskills and the Isle of Skye. He led his younger siblings, Sam and Miranda, on many exiting adventures. He also read out loud to them for hours, made up his own spellbinding strories and created magical home theatricals and puppet shows. He liked sailing, kayaking and horseback riding. Perhaps Damon's greatest gift was for friendship. He had many close, dear friends and tended each one with love and care. He kept his friends, who ranged in age from the very young to the old. He had deep wells of empathy and kindness and sensitivity, even for strangers. He also possessed insight and wisdom beyond his years. He was gregarious and hosted many large parties and sleepovers at his house, where everyone was always welcome. And he could be wickedly funny, with impeccable mimicry and timing. Damon had striking red hair, blue eyes and pale skin. He was beautiful, iside and out. He had a powerful moral force, purity of character and integrity rare in this world. He will be mourned every moment of every day by his heartbroken father, Doron Weber, who tried desperately to save his adored, firstborn son and flesh of his flexh, and by his grieving mother, Shealagh Weber, who poured all her brave love and generous spirit into this amazing child. His brother Sam and his sister Miranda will never forget their extraordinary sibling. His grandparents Robert and Helga Weber cared for Damon with all their hearts. He was loved by many aunts, uncles, cousins, grandmother, and friends. Funeral services on Monday, April 4, at Temple Beth Emeth in Brooklyn and burial at The Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. In lieu of flowers donations can be sent to The Damon Weber Prize for Acting and Directing at Brooklyn Tech, c/o Temple Beth Emeth, 83 Marlborough Road, Brooklyn, NY 11226.",2005-04-04T05:00:00+0000

Law), is scheduled to have its premiere on the premium cable channel on May 21. While that date apparently still stands, Showtime decided over the weekend to postpone a screening it had planned in Boston, at Faneuil Hall, on April 12. The screening was to have been followed by a panel discussion that would have included several men who have come forward to say they were abused as boys by their priests. In a telephone interview yesterday, Robert Greenblatt, president of Showtime, said: ""We just thought that in this transition time between now and the election of a new pope, it wasn't appropriate to do a screening of this movie, especially in Boston, which has a very big and thriving Catholic community.""

A three-judge panel of the Third District Court of Appeal unanimously rejected a challenge by the Campaign for California Families, an advocacy group. The group argued that the new law violated Proposition 22, a state law approved by voters in 2000 that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The court action upholds the Domestic Partners Rights and Responsibilities Act, which took effect Jan. 1. It found that Proposition 22 addressed the definition of marriage but not the rights and responsibilities of registered domestic partners and that the two laws were therefore not in conflict. Officials at the Campaign for California Families said they planned to appeal. Carolyn Marshall (NYT)",2005-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The modified playlist will now feature acts from the 1980's and 90's like Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, AC/DC, Green Day (lead singer, Billie Joe Armstrong, below) and Audioslave, with bands from the 70's like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd also in the mix. The station, which broadcasts Howard Stern's morning show, said it would start a separate online stream devoted to playing new music from alternative acts like the Killers, Mars Volta, Arcade Fire and Taking Back Sunday. The move comes as Infinity faces the loss of Mr. Stern at the end of the year, when he is to begin a program on Sirius satellite radio. It also comes as other alternative rock stations have been suffering. In January Infinity flipped its Washington alternative station WHFS-FM (99.1) to Spanish, citing poor ratings. After an outcry from local listeners, Infinity began broadcasting alternative rock on weeknights on another Washington-area station and created an online version of the defunct station.

After the October 2003 crash, which killed 11 people, the ex-director, Patrick Ryan, was charged with making false statements and what is known as seaman's manslaughter. Federal prosecutors had accused the city of planning coercive interviews to gather information that would help Mr. Ryan. A conviction in the trial, scheduled to begin May 2, could make it harder for the city to defend more than $1 billion in civil suits stemming from the crash. Under yesterday's agreement, the prosecutors are to give city lawyers reports prepared by their investigators about potential witnesses who are city employees.

But there is no single Catholic tradition; there are rather Catholic traditions, which range from the voluntary poverty of St. Francis of Assisi to the boundless greed of the Avignon popes, from the genial tolerance for diversity of Pope Gregory the Great in the sixth century to the egomaniacal self-importance of Pope Pius IX in the 19th century, from the secrecy and plotting of Opus Dei to the openness and humane service of the Community of Sant'Egidio.

The House of Steinway & Sons notes with profound sadness the passing of the distinguished American pianist Grant Johannesen on March 27, near Munich, Germany at the age of 83. A deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 54 years, Mr. Johannesen won acclaim throughout the world for his performances of Poulenc, Faure, Milhaud, and SaintSaens. He was an elegant exponent of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin as well as American composers including Barber, Bowles, Copland, MacDowell, and Sessions. A native of Salt Lake City, Mr. Johannesen studied with Robert Casadesus, Egon Petri and Nadia Boulanger. He was a frequent soloist on television's ""Bell Telephone Hour"", and he appeared in every music capital of the world and with the most illustrious conductors of his time. Mr. Johannesen's discography is highlighted by the fact that he was the first pianist to record the complete works of Faure. He led the Cleveland Institute of Music with great distinction from 1974 to 1985, and he was named to the rank of Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the French government for his vast contribution to French music. He was a cherished friend to us, and his dedication to our piano was a perpetual source of inspiration.

It was the largest of a handful of sporadic protests since Mr. Mugabe's party swept the elections. Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, said through a spokesman that he had ruled out a court challenge, which in the past proved fruitless. The question of whether to call for national demonstrations is a difficult one for the opposition. The last time Mr. Tsvangirai called for major protests, in 2002, they fizzled, and he was charged with treason. This time, Mr. Mugabe has promised to crush any demonstrations, and it is not clear that Zimbabweans, who depend on the government for food, would risk their stipends.

Mike Mesisca, the deputy chief of the Fairview Fire Department, said that the first fire started about 8 p.m., when a resident, whose name was not released, fell asleep with a lighted cigarette in her seventh-floor apartment. She suffered severe burns to her face and chest and was taken to Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck. Chief Mesisca said that firefighters doused the blaze and used a heat-seeking device, called a thermal imaging camera, to search behind the walls for more fire before they left. About 45 minutes later, a fire began in another part of bedroom, he said, spreading to two alarms and causing the evacuation of two floors. Last month, four children died in Teaneck in a fire that was not detected by the fire crew, which did not use its thermal imaging camera. Michelle O'Donnell (NYT)",2005-04-06T05:00:00+0000

""Everyone knows that the surface features of the news are being reported faster all the time, in smaller and smaller bits,"" the editors write in their usual monthly letter to readers, titled ""77 North Washington Street,"" signifying the Boston address of the magazine's editorial offices. ""But explaining the deeper features of the world requires a different and more expansive kind of reporting -- one that has increasingly become the Atlantic's signature. That reporting consumes a lot of space."" The change is part of a multiyear trend of general-interest magazines publishing fewer works of fiction. C. Michael Curtis, fiction editor of The Atlantic Monthly, said in an interview that the staff was informed of the change in an e-mail message within the last two weeks. Mr. Curtis said that with the fiction issue the magazine hopes to publish about as much fiction as it had done throughout the year.",2005-04-06T05:00:00+0000

The winner, Rouge et Noir Brie from Marin French Cheese in Petaluma, beat out the French cheeses even though it is very small -- a mere eight ounces -- compared with classic wheels of Brie, which are a foot across and weigh about five pounds. Rouge et Noir also has more butterfat than the French cheese. But its mushroomy aroma is on the money, and when ripe, the cheese is nicely satiny and nutty tasting. It can be ordered from www.marinfrenchcheese.com at $37 for three wheels, including shipping. And for serving, this clever beechwood cheese board will gladly show off whatever cheese you have, though it begs for Emmenthal.

The commission rejected a recommendation that she be removed from the bench. Deborah A. Scalise, the judge's lawyer, said her client was grateful that the commission recognized that her motive was ""sympathy for her friends and a strong belief in them as parents."" In one case, Judge Morales Horowitz tried to get a family court judge whom a friend did not like to recuse himself from her case.

Schumer called on federal safety officials yesterday to reopen their investigation into the fatal crash of a passenger jet in Belle Harbor, Queens, because equipment failure, not pilot error, might have been the cause. In November 2001, the jet's tail fell off shortly after takeoff from Kennedy International Airport. Last month, a similar plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean lost its rudder, prompting federal regulators to require rudder inspections. But even though the planes had the same manufacturer, safety experts do not believe the circumstances in the two cases were sufficiently similar to make comparisons. The National Transportation Safety Board said that in the Belle Harbor crash, which killed 265 people, the pilot swung the rudder from side to side, straining the tail, which eventually broke off. On March 6 of this year, an Airbus A310, similar to the A300 in the Belle Harbor crash, lost a rudder but landed safely. Both the rudder in the March crash and the tail in the harbor crash were made of composite materials. But the rudder apparently went through routine operations and stress, while the Belle Harbor tail, the safety board said, went through abnormal stress in an unusual operation. Matthew L.

A deeply valued member of our Steinway Artist family for 54 years, Mr. Johannesen won acclaim throughout the world for his performances of Poulenc, Faure, Milhaud, and SaintSaens. He was an elegant exponent of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin as well as American composers including Barber, Bowles, Copland, MacDowell, and Sessions. A native of Salt Lake City, Mr. Johannesen studied with Robert Casadesus, Egon Petri and Nadia Boulanger. He was a frequent soloist on television's ""Bell Telephone Hour"", and he appeared in every music capital of the world and with the most illustrious conductors of his time. Mr. Johannesen's discography is highlighted by the fact that he was the first pianist to record the complete works of Faure. He led the Cleveland Institute of Music with great distinction from 1974 to 1985, and he was named to the rank of Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the French government for his vast contribution to French music. He was a cherished friend to us, and his dedication to our piano was a perpetual source of inspiration.

Founder of the real estate company bearing his family name and headquartered in Elmhurst, Queens, died Saturday morning, April 2, 2005, at his home in Roslyn following a short illness. Mr. Katz, who was a Holocaust survivor, came to New York City in 1951, broke and not knowing a word of English. A decade later, he had begun a long steady climb in the residential real estate business. With enterprise, hard work and skillful management, Mr. Katz, over the decades, built one of the leading residential real estate and management companies that remain independently owned in the area. He worked every day alongside his daughter, Rita Levy, and sons-in-law, Marvin Katz and David Levy. Mr. Levy, the company's Chief Executive Officer, said that Mr. Katz was a true entrepreneur. ""He was our mentor and our leader and one of the most unique individuals I have ever met,"" Levy said. ""This was a man with a vision who started with nothing and who, through hard work and enterprise, built a family owned company that today is something to behold."" Mr. Katz was born in Lithuania in 1919. He was educated there with a traditional Jewish education and later trained as a butcher. When Lithuania was invaded by the Nazis, Mr. Katz and his family fled their home town but could not get out of the country in time. They were captured and sent to Latvia, to a slave labor camp. They escaped their bondage in Latvia and returned to Shavel, Lithuania, only to find that the entire population was about to be sent to Auschwitz. Mr. Katz and his new bride, Sima, who wed in The Shavel Ghetto, fled into the neighboring forest where they lived hidden by Righteous Gentiles until the Russians liberated Lithuania. They then fled the Russians and with falsified papers, passed through Poland, into Germany and finally to the United States in March 1951. He published a book about his life experiences entitled: ""Teach Us To Count Our Days.""

The agreement, brokered in Pretoria by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, is similar to past deals, including a French-sponsored accord that led to a cease-fire in January 2003. That cease-fire was shattered in November when government forces attacked the rebels in their northern stronghold, setting off a crisis that led thousands of French citizens and African emigrants to flee. The new accord seeks to bring to an end an often brutal conflict that took on xenophobic overtones and pitted the wealthy Christian south against the north, which is made up mostly of Muslim immigrants from other African countries. Under the agreement, militias on both sides are to disarm and elections are to be held in October, said Bheki Khumalo, a spokesman for Mr. Mbeki. Lydia Polgreen (NYT)",2005-04-07T05:00:00+0000

The continuing strike severely disrupted rehearsals of the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. The orchestra itself is not on strike, but the staff that transports its instruments is. The situation prompted the Thtre du Chtelet to replace the Philharmonique with the Orchestre Lamoureux, Paris's oldest orchestra. ""In France, the right to strike is established,"" said Franois Boudeau, a Thtre du Chtelet press officer. ""Radio France employees have their claims, and that's normal. At the same time, this situation shows how dynamic our theater is. We found a solution within 24 hours."" Performances on April 17, 21 and 23 remain on the schedule. ""The Bassarids,"" composed in 1966, is based on a script by W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman. Produced by Yannis Kokkos and conducted by Kazushi Ono, it stars the soprano June Anderson and the tenor Kim Begley.

According to Nielsen's estimates, ABC had the most total viewers, but it tied with NBC in households. And among 18-to-49-year-olds, Fox was No. 1, buoyed by an ""American Idol"" show during which another of the contestants liked by the judges garnered the fewest votes. ""Idol"" was the most-watched show of the night, as an audience of 23.2 million saw Nikko Smith, above, the son of the former St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith, eliminated, leaving the other contestant in the bottom two, Scott Savol, safe for another week. (Mr. Savol had a reason to be nervous: late last week, the Smoking Gun Web site reported that he had been charged with felony domestic violence in 2001 for hitting his girlfriend and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct.) On ABC, ""Lost"" (16.49 million viewers) killed off a major character for the first time, as Boone (Ian Somerhalder) met his maker. NBC made it into the Wednesday winners' circle because the ""West Wing"" season finale turned in stronger numbers than usual: 11.5 million viewers saw Jimmy Smits's character win the Democratic presidential nomination after a convention floor fight among four candidates.

us,"Arts, Briefly; Soccer Satire Scores","After a two-month run during which it played to more than 40,000 people, a spoof musical about Ireland's national soccer team will return to Dublin at the end of April for four weeks, its producers said. The show lampoons Roy Keane, below, the brash Irish-born soccer star who plays for Britain's Manchester United, and the former coach Mick McCarthy, for their acrimonious falling-out during the 2002 soccer World Cup in Japan and Korea. The row caused Mr. Keane to quit the Irish team on the eve of the tournament and set off a divisive national debate in which even nonsports fans took sides. The musical, ""I, Keano,"" casts those figures in Roman gladiator-style roles, singing songs set to the tune of rock anthems like Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Barring any further extensions, the show will close on May 28 in the Victorian-era Olympia Theater. BRIAN LAVERY",2005-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings; NATIONAL BALLET OF CANADA,"James Kudelka has been credited with shaking up the sometimes stodgy National Ballet of Canada, a group that he performed with early in his career and returned to in 1996 as artistic director. The Toronto-based company, now celebrating its 50th anniversary, was known for an impeccable classicism and for faithfully following tradition in repertorial matters. Mr. Kudelka -- a choreographer who has sometimes seemed a blend of the fluid Jiri Kylian and the darkly psychological Antony Tudor -- gave the National Ballet a ""Swan Lake"" with a gang rape and a ""Firebird"" with lizards and a killer egg. So it would be foolhardy to have expected a ""Pied Piper"" from Mr. Kudelka that featured Robert Browning's lad with a pipe leading a line of a town's ratlike children into oblivion after not being paid for his exterminating services. Instead, the choreographer who once named a ballet ""Sin and Tonic"" has brought the National Ballet to the Brooklyn Academy of Music with a version of that old story, here called ""The Contract (The Pied Piper),"" in which the piper is modeled on the glamorous Ontario-born evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The enchanted youngsters are children of rigidly moralistic parents who have come down with a mysterious movement disorder. Eva (Martine Lamy, above, with Guillaume Cote), as the McPherson character is called, has an affair with an engaged man and the townspeople cancel her contract. There go the children. Critics have had reservations. But ""The Contract,"" set to live music by Michael Torke and performed by a cast of 36 adults and 18 child performers, addresses such weighty (and timely) themes as the struggles between right and wrong and tradition and the modern. (The National Ballet of Canada will perform ""The Contract"" tonight at 7:30 and tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m. at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100 or BAM.org.

And yet all this hasn't helped Andrew Litton, above, to build up real career momentum. At the end of the 2005-6 season, he steps down after 12 years as music director of the Dallas Symphony and heads off, not to a bigger post, but to the joys of freelancing. The group's concerts this weekend at Carnegie, its swan song here under Mr. Litton, are geared to the strengths of both conductor and players: ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""Carmina Burana"" play to Mr. Litton's penchant for big impressive works while showing off both the orchestra and the fine Dallas Symphony Chorus. A children's concert tomorrow afternoon flags another of Mr. Litton's strong suits -- he's done great work in the area of children's programming -- while offering almost more music than tonight's concert, for a fraction price. For some listeners, though, the real drama lies in the Dallas Symphony's search for a new music director who will truly take the orchestra to the next level. Stay tuned.

us,The Listings; LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO/VUSI MAHLASELA,"Apartheid in South Africa ended with elections in 1994, and music was one of the things that rallied the forces of democracy, even as it stayed gentle. This double bill features two of South Africa's household names. In South African music, native traditions merged with imported colonial elements to yield songs that can sound familiar to Western ears yet thoroughly South African. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the unaccompanied male choir led by Joseph Shabalala, merges traditional Zulu harmonies with the contours of gospel hymns, and goes on to add some synchronized dance steps. In the group's dynamic ""stalking style,"" Mr. Shabalala's companionable tenor voice hovers above resonant, bass-heavy harmonies, which build from a cavernous hush to fervent, driving peaks. Vusi Mahlasela, above, was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement, not just for his political courage but for his sterling voice and for three-chord tunes that make earnest sentiments bounce. On his American debut album, ""The Voice"" (ATO), he sings in six languages from South Africa, including English. His music encompasses protest without turning strident. ""Should I now stop singing of love, now that my memory is surrounded by blood?,"" his ""Red Song"" song asks before rejecting the idea. In the way Mr. Mahlasela's voice leaps between registers as he plucks guitar syncopations, there's as much playfulness as righteousness.

Mr. Letts is best known hereabouts, after all, as the author of the psycho-thriller ""Bug"" and the white-trash gorefest ""Killer Joe,"" popular shows that kept the city's stock of stage blood depleted for months on end. But Mr. Letts is an actor as well as a playwright, and in ""Orson's Shadow,"" Austin Pendleton's tart valentine to a handful of theater greats of the last century, he's playing the British theater critic Kenneth Tynan, whose weapons were mere words. Tynan is the primary narrator in the play, the uneasy ringmaster in Mr. Pendleton's fanciful look at a 1960 production of ""Rhinoceros"" starring Laurence Olivier and directed by Orson Welles. Mr. Letts (above right, with Ian Westerfer) turns in a quiet gem of a performance as the anxious critic-turned-dramaturge, who is kept busy taming egos and soothing tempers even as he struggles with his own flagrant neuroses. Mr. Letts's gift for writing pungent characters may in part explain the wit and authority with which he channels the voice of one of the 20th-century theater's most famous wordsmiths.

It is studded with landmarks from a Revolutionary War battlefield to Albert Einstein's workplace, but nevertheless lives firmly in the present -- traditional but not stuffy, charming but not quaint. A backpack-toting student walking a sheepdog with dreadlocks (that's right, the dreadlocks were on the dog) shares the sidewalk with chattering 10-year-olds and tweedy luminaries in town for one conference or another. In the tree-shaded downtown, Colonial-era buildings and high-end spots coexist with a used-record store, jeans-and-corduroy vegetarian hangouts and ice cream shops.

After intense lobbying by the New Jersey State Bar Association, the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers and United States Representative Steve Rothman, among others, the coalition of state bar associations sponsoring the championship agreed to a compromise solution that will allow Torah Academy's aspiring attorneys to make their closing arguments, if necessary, after sundown.

The latest ruling, initially sought by the Barnes but applauded by both sides, expedites the long-running case by bypassing Superior Court review. Speeding up the appeals process ""was important given the financial strains of the Barnes Foundation,"" said Ralph G. Wellington, a lawyer for the Barnes. Mr. Wellington said it was still unclear whether the court would dismiss the appeal by the student, Jay Raymond, or review it. Mr. Raymond has argued both that the Montgomery County Orphans' Court judge, Stanley R. Ott, unfairly denied him standing to intervene in the case, and that Judge Ott's decision in December, which overturned Albert C. Barnes's written wishes that his art collection remain in Merion, was incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling is ""excellent news, because if we are to succeed in overturning the Orphans' Court approval of the move, we would have to prevail ultimately in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,"" said Howard J.

""It's a big project,"" Mr. Seltzer said of the series, in which Bill Pullman and Natascha McElhone track clues that suggest Armageddon is at hand. That meant filming in far-flung locations. ""If one wants to talk about the end of the world, the apocalypse, you're talking about the world itself,"" said Mr. Seltzer, who is also executive producer along with Gavin Polone. ""It's not Southern California breaking into the sea. The story is global, and it requires that kind of approach."" The sprawling tale involves a child struck by lightning in Florida, a miracle baby in Greece, an intrepid nun played by Ms. McElhone, a skeptical astrophysicist played by Mr. Pullman, and a satanic murderer. Pegged to the prophesies of the Bible, ""Revelations"" is working an area of intense public interest, as shown by the popularity of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The Passion of the Christ."" For Mr. Seltzer, whose eclectic rsum includes screenwriting credits on both ""The Omen"" and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" the challenges have included shooting a project with the ambitions of a film on the accelerated schedule of a weekly television series.

McEwan's icily gripping novels have long been best sellers in his native England, but it has taken American readers a while to warm up to him -- this is only his third novel to make the Times list. (His Booker Prize-winning novel, ""Amsterdam,"" had an eight-week run in 1999, rising as high as No. 9, and ""Atonement,"" published in 2002, hung on for 14 weeks, rising as high as No. 4.) The consensus opinion about ""Saturday"" seems to be, as Michael Dirda put it in The Washington Post Book World, that while the novel is ""just a smidgen overcontrived,"" it reads like a rocket. McEwan's novel, as Jesse Kornbluth writes on Bookreporter.com, takes over your life: ""You wish you didn't have to eat, you despise the ringing phone, you wouldn't mind if you had a catheter."" McEwan has been hard to avoid in recent weeks -- he's been interviewed by Scott Simon of NPR and by Entertainment Weekly, among many others, and has been profiled in Time and Vanity Fair. McEwan prefers dealing with American journalists rather than those in Britain, where gossip about novelists is more prized than it is here. ""I would say that American journalism is far less intrusive,"" he said in an interview in Publishers Weekly. ""If I'm going to meet an American journalist in London, I'd quite happily have him come to my home, because he isn't going to focus on my private life. I wouldn't let a British journalist through the door.""",2005-04-10T05:00:00+0000

I hope religious leaders of all faiths will take a long look at what this former computer nerd has created, to learn what they can emulate to reinvigorate their own religious messages. The ultimate paradox to me is that mainline Protestant churches, which are quite liberal in many ways, seem unable to adapt to the way we live in a modern and quite liberal society, in terms of use of media and integration of the trappings of modern life into the religious messages they convey.

On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts began applying the nation's first gender-neutral civil-marriage law, a gay rights breakthrough that launched a flotilla of giddy weddings. Since then, pundits have been warning of an imminent showdown between Massachusetts marriages and the national government's 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton, DOMA defined marriage for federal purposes as being between one man and one woman. As a result, Massachusetts couples face a peculiar double reality: they are married in Massachusetts and single in the United States.",2005-04-10T05:00:00+0000

His fur is a mlange of black, yellow and olive, with white underparts and a coal-black face. Until his operation, two days before I met him, he was skittering about an open-air enclosure on the grounds of a biomedical facility on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Afterward, he was caged in a hut shared with half a dozen other experimental monkeys, all of whom bore identical incisions in their scalps. Judging from the results of previous experiments, the human neural stem cells inserted into their brains would soon take hold and begin to grow, their fibers reaching out to shake hands with their monkey counterparts. The green vervets' behavior was, and will remain, all monkey. To a vervet, eye contact signals aggression, and when I peered into X047's cage, he took umbrage, vigorously bobbing his head in a stereotypical threat display.

And if it wasn't entirely representative of the rest, just as ""Tale"" is not, that was in this case actually a virtue. ""Caesar"" isn't sexy (unlike ""Romeo and Juliet,"" the other play often assigned to ninth graders); it's not weighed down by a subplot; and it's set in ancient Rome, which to many Americans is a far more familiar place than Tudor London.

He is also among the most puzzling. His work, the subject of retrospectives starting this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, is always challenging, sometimes elusive and often difficult to categorize. Is he a moderate or an extremist? An exponent of civilization or an avatar of savagery? Are his movies meant to be brutally naturalistic or elaborately artificial? Comedies or catastrophes?

The conference, which begins in Oslo today, is intended to provide money to support a peace agreement in January between rebels in the south of Sudan and the government in Khartoum. The conflict in Darfur, in the west, broke out while negotiations between the north and south were under way. Previously, the administration's position had been to separate the financing for the south from the problem in Darfur. Just $853 million of the $1.4 billion American pledge for projects in southern Sudan has been appropriated by Congress.

Travelers can also continue to use the company's ""name-your-own"" price offering, in which consumers bid on discounted travel without being told which airline, flight times or hotels they booked until the bid is accepted. Priceline.com chief executive, Jeffery H. Boyd, is increasing sales by adding traditional travel agency services. The company said it decided to add the search engine after allowing travelers to comparison shop for airline fares on the site increased the dollar amount of all travel booked on Priceline.com 52 percent last year.

us,Switching Seats,"SWITCHING SEATS -- In one of the most significant trends in air travel, major airlines in the United States are shifting large numbers of their seats to more lucrative international routes. Some examples from March traffic data: American Airlines' international seat capacity grew 14.1 percent over March 2004, while domestic capacity fell 3.1 percent; seating at United Airlines was up 14 percent overseas, down 9.2 percent at home; at Delta, it rose 23.1 percent abroad and 4.2 percent in the United States; at Continental, it increased 17.3 percent on international routes and 10.8 on domestic flights; and at Northwest, it was up 9.4 outside the United States and 7.8 percent at home. US Airways was the only major carrier to log a decrease -- 0.6 percent -- in international capacity, with a 7.1 percent rise in domestic seating. International travel, where domestic carriers are free from competition from low-fare United States airlines, is surging across the board, led by sharp growth in business travel to the Asia Pacific region. For example, Glenn F. Tilton, chief executive of UAL, United's parent, told the Asia Society last week that nearly 25 percent of United's capacity was dedicated to Asian Pacific routes.

Richard Pulford, the chief executive of the society, said: ""The agreement provides a settled basis for planning Sunday performances, something we've never had before. It means we don't have to negotiate specific terms for that particular performance."" He said that the new agreement was applicable to shows entering the West End but would not apply to current productions.

us,World Briefing | Europe: The Netherlands: Blocked-Flight Concerns,"The refusal by American authorities on Friday to allow a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight with 278 passengers on board to fly over the United States on a nonstop trip from Amsterdam to Mexico City has raised concerns here. The plane turned around near the Canadian border and headed back to Amsterdam after United States officials said two passengers would not be allowed to enter American airspace. Dutch politicians want to know how American authorities obtained a copy of the passenger manifest and why the passengers' names had not turned up on a KLM no-fly list. And some lawmakers want to know why Dutch officials did not detain the two passengers when the flight returned to Amsterdam. In Washington, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, Christiana Halsey, said that Mexico and Canada routinely provide passenger manifests to the United States for flights that go over American territory. There is no requirement for airlines to check passenger names against a no-fly list for flights not bound for the United States, she said, and thus no routine way for airlines to know before takeoff if they will be denied entry to American airspace, as the KLM plane was. The Bush administration is considering a requirement that names be checked for overflights, but some officials said this would raise privacy issues. Gregory Crouch (NYT)",2005-04-12T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Petrek, a breast surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, was Director of the Surgical Program at the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center. Dr. Petrek first came to MSKCC as a surgical oncology fellow in 1978 and joined the medical staff in 1984, after a brief time at Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Petrek was widely known for the care she provided to breast cancer patients, with particular focus on young women with the disease. Devoting her research efforts to the study of patient quality of life issues, she became an extraordinary advocate on their behalf. The leading expert in the United States on both lymphedema and pregnancy - associated breast cancer, recognized nationally for her skills as a physician and a researcher, Jeanne Petrek was a valued and respected friend and colleague who was beloved by her many patients. She played a major role in many aspects of our organization as clinician, scientist, institutional leader, and mentor during her 23 years with the Center. Her warmth, enthusiasm, expertise, and tireless dedication to the improvement of treatment for breast cancer will be profoundly missed. We extend our sincere condolences to her husband, children, and the rest of her family. Douglas A. Warner III, Chairman Boards of Overseers and Managers Richard I. Beattie, Vice Chairman Harold Varmus, President John R. Gunn, Executive Vice President Robert E. Wittes, Physician-in-Chief Memorial Hospital PETREK--Jeanne. The staff of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center and the members of the Breast Diseases Management Team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center mourn with the deepest sadness the sudden, tragic loss of our beloved colleague and friend Jeanne A. Petrek. Her presence in our lives was, and remains, a constant reminder of the highest aspirations of medicine, a calling to restore and preserve health in spirit as well as body. She was not only a superb surgeon who helped refine the current management of breast disease, but she was a tireless advocate for the quality of life of breast cancer patients, a leading researcher in topics such as lymphedema after breast surgery, pregnancy-associated breast cancer, and the preservation of fertility after treatment. Despite her international renown, she made every patient feel that she was the most important person in the world to her. She was not only a trusted colleague and valuable scientific collaborator, but a warm, cheerful, encouraging influence in our lives. We, and the thousands of patients whom she helped in her career, miss her and honor her. We extend our heartfelt condolences to her devoted family. Patrick Borgen, MD, Clifford Hudis, MD, Larry Norton, MD PETREK--Jeanne, M.D. The New York Metropolitan Breast Cancer Group, Inc., mourns the sudden and tragic loss of our long-time member, friend, colleague and teacher, Jeanne A. Petrek.

The promised amount was almost $2 billion more than aid officials had said Sudan needed. The United States pledged from $1 billion to $2 billion; the range is a result of uncertainty over how much Congress will approve. ""This is a time of choosing for Sudan,"" Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, said at the conference. ""The leaders of Sudan must realize that the eyes of the world are on Sudan."" German and Norwegian officials, among others, echoed the sentiment.

Most of the changes in the Senate bill apply to state agencies and local governments, not to the legislative branch. The proposed process sets a standard of ""reasonable under the circumstances,"" which does not exist now. The standard, the bill's advocates say, will have the effect of speeding the release of information or uncovering reasons that documents are being withheld or delayed.

Mr. Confalonieri is the president of Mediaset, a broadcasting company. His office there issued a statement yesterday confirming his resignation without further comment.

The advertisements also warn parents not to shake their babies or have infants sleep with them in their beds. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said that 15 children died in 2004 when parents crushed or suffocated their babies while tossing and turning in bed. That was double the number in 2003.

Community groups and preservationists have protested the proposed construction because the altar and its 9-foot-high bronze statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess, was intended as a counterpart monument to the Statue of Liberty.

He was County Clerk and Clerk of the Supreme Court and Commissioner of Jurors, Kings County, and former President, CEO and Chairman of Independence Savings Bank, and President of Martin's Department Store. Bill was a long-time board member of many institutions, including Brooklyn Law School, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Hospital Center, Prospect Park Alliance and the New York Organ Donor Network. He was a graduate of the Boston Latin School and Yale College ('41), and a First Lieutenant in the Army (1942-1946). In addition to his dedicated public service, Bill will long be remembered for the sense of humor and sound advice that guided his family and many friends through life, as well as for the candy and silver dollars he found in their ears. He is survived by his wife Phyllis; their four children: John Levin (and Louisa Swift), Peter (and Anna) Levin, Emme (and Jonathan) Deland, and Kate Levin (and Mark di Suvero); seven grandchildren: Dylan, Mariah, Rawle, Will, Ned, Kate and Veri; and his sister Jean Brenner. Memorial service Friday, April 15, 11 AM in the Palm House at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue. In lieu of flowers, please donate to any of the above charities. LEVIN--Wilbur A. All of us at Independence Community Bank mourn the death of Wilbur A. Levin, 84, a friend, business leader, and generous public citizen. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Phyllis, his children, grandchildren and the entire family for their loss. ""Bill"" Levin joined the Bank's Board of Trustees in 1965, was elected Executive Vice President in 1972 and became our 10th President in 1973, a post he held until 1985 when he became Chairman of the Board, retiring in 1995. During his tenure Mr. Levin had a pivotal role in creating a strong bank despite the deregulation of interest rates that led to economic upheaval in the banking industry. He also played an industry leadership role with the Community Bankers Association of NY State, frequently representing the Bank and the industry in Washington and Albany on regulatory issues and other challenges. Bill Levin set a high personal standard for community service and made it part of the Bank's business philosophy. In addition to many other civic activities that have enriched the life of the city and its people, Bill Levin was instrumental in the renaissance of the Downtown Brooklyn commercial district and the revival of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Prospect Park. He continues to be the inspiration for the active involvement of Independence and its executives in the civic and economic life of the communities where we live and work. Bill Levin also brought a high moral tone to everything he did which stands as an example to everyone in business. As a friend, a business leader and an extraordinary public citizen, all of us will miss him. Charles J. Hamm, Chairman Alan H. Fishman, President & CEO and The Board of Directors of Independence Community Bank LEVIN--Wilbur A. The Brooklyn Hospital Center is profoundly saddened by the passing of its esteemed Trustee, Wilbur A. Levin. Bill Levin has been a Trustee of The Brooklyn Hospital Center since June of 1964. Over his tenure of forty-one years, he served as Chairman of The Governance Committee (formerly Nominating Committee), the Development and Community Relations Committee, and the Joint Conference Committee. He was currently a member of the Executive Committee, and had previously served on the Operations Committee, and Financial Development Committee. In 1986, he was the first Trustee to receive the Hospital's Founder's Medal at the First Founders Ball event, and in 1999, he was recognized as the Hospital's Distinguished Trustee at the United Hospital Fund Annual Distinguished Trustee Luncheon. His integrity, thoughtfulness, and sense of humor will be greatly missed. The Board of Trustees, and the entire Brooklyn Hospital family extend deepest sympathy to the Levin family. LEVIN--Wilbur A.

His grandparents, Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky, were legendary pioneers of New York's once-booming Yiddish stage. As celebrity actors, producers and entrepreneurs, they helped create the famed Second Avenue milieu that reflected and refracted the fears, anxieties and longings of the newly arrived. But while the impact of this theater on Tin Pan Alley and the American musical is readily acknowledged, few theatergoers today have had direct contact with the original materials of the early Yiddish stage. Enter Mr. Thomas (above), who for the last seven years has been assembling scores, scripts and memories in an attempt to preserve his grandparents' history and the broader impact of their immigrant theatrical world. This weekend at Zankel Hall, he will present the fruits of his foraging in ""The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater,"" directed by Patricia Birch. The semistaged program promises readings from memoirs, restored musical numbers and, one can hope, a sensibility that moves beyond nostalgia to recover a cultural moment often evoked but seldom appreciated on its own terms.

us,The Listings; JULIO SARMENTO: 'SOME LIMITS OF REASON',"Over the last two decades, this Portuguese painter has stayed true -- obsessively, some might say -- to his signature image of a sexy woman in a simple black dress, her head cropped at the chin like that of a store window mannequin. In his latest paintings Mr. Sarmento enlists this enigmatic figure in the service of an oddly academic exercise. Drawn on expanses of loosely applied white paint in a schematic, sometimes smudgy black line, the woman appears sitting on, standing among or kneeling under various pieces of furniture. Lines about sexuality and transgression from an essay about Georges Bataille by Michele Foucault have been silk-screened onto the surfaces along with titles like ""Kiss Me"" and ""I Love You."" One typically portentous and grammatically doubtful caption reads, ""Sexuality points to nothing beyond itself, except in a frenzy which disrupts it."" Mr. Sarmento has also translated his headless woman into three dimensions in the form of life-size sculptures -- translucent shells of flesh-colored cast resin. She crouches under a table naked, stands in a real black dress among rows of antique chairs (above) and otherwise enacts the role of an alluring but inaccessible love object. Mr. Sarmento's art exudes a certain poignant yearning but it is frozen by its own icy elegance. Might the headless woman be an unconscious symbol of arrested creative development? Maybe she needs a little sexual frenzy to warm her up and get her moving. (Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-1181, through April 23.) KEN JOHNSON",2005-04-15T05:00:00+0000

An hourlong ""American Idol"" brought in 24.09 million viewers, enough to put Fox in first place for the night in the 18-to-49 demographic and total viewers. Also on Fox was the series premiere of the Pamela Anderson comedy, ""Stacked,"" below. Though it nearly tied NBC's ""Dateline"" for first place among adults 18 to 49, it drew a middling 8.1 million viewers even though its main competition for a male audience, ABC's ""Lost,"" was a repeat. NBC won Wednesday in households. Its entire lineup -- a ""Dateline"" special (yet another exploration of the mythology of ""The Da Vinci Code""), the premiere of ""Revelations"" and ""Law & Order"" -- performed well. In the time period usually occupied by ""The West Wing,"" which concluded its season last week, ""Revelations"" scored better ratings than any ""West Wing"" episode this season: an audience of 15.35 million. With that strong lead-in, ""Law & Order"" (16.72 million) easily beat ""CSI: NY"" (10.64 million) at 10 p.m. in an episode in which Jesse L.

But the judge said the pair's digital camera held no incriminating photographs, and their shorthand notes were indecipherable to prosecutors. Their lawyer had argued that they were in Zimbabwe on a vacation. They still face charges of overstaying their seven-day visa, an offense punishable by a year in jail.

The whale was spotted in the late afternoon near Bordentown heading north again. The whale, which is estimated to be 8 to 15 feet long, appeared to be healthy, officials said. Belugas often migrate into estuaries and rivers, though marine mammal rescuers could not recall ever spotting one so far up the Delaware. Biologists generally hesitate to interfere with the behavior of healthy animals, but state officials said they might intervene if it appeared the whale was ill or otherwise impaired. Meanwhile, the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals, which is based in Quebec, said the whale might be from a group identified near the St. Lawrence River in Canada in 1986.

us,The Listings; DAVID KORINS,"A theatrical set designer who doesn't stop at the footlights, David Korins, 28, likes to create total environments that start at the point where the audience walks in. He did this most recently with an empty space at Theater for the New City in the East Village (above), where he has built a pristine wood-paneled theater for Craig Wright's drama ""Orange Flower Water,"" directed by Mr. Korins's wife, Carolyn Cantor. In 2001 the couple founded the Edge Theater Company, which is presenting the play, about two marriages coming apart. The designer said recently that he had envisioned ""a warm and welcoming place, a wooden womb -- so we could rip your heart out."" The story unfolds like a boxing match: when any of the four actors portraying the spouses are not in a scene, they sit on wooden chairs at the four corners of the performing space and watch. It's both intimate and public, like life in the fictional small town of Pine City, Minn., where the play is set. Benches for the audience surround the performers on three sides to emphasize ""the communal experience of the bench rather than the separateness of the chair,"" Mr. Korins said. It is part of his plan: the whole room is a set and the audience the townspeople. In his free time, Mr. Korins, who also designs furniture and lofts, has done the production designs for the forthcoming Ed Harris/Will Farrell film by Adam Rapp, ""Winter Passing,"" and 13 episodes of HBO's ""Family Bonds."" Last year, for his environmental set for Mr. Rapp's play ""Blackbird,"" an Edge production Off Broadway that took place in a squalid apartment, Mr. Korins won the Henry Hewes Award for best scenic design from the American Theater Wing, beating out several Broadway designers. Before and after shots of the dingy Canal Street digs are on his Web site: www.davidkorinsdesign.com. Asked if he was hands-on for ""Orange Flower Water,"" Mr. Korins said: ""I have so many splinters, I can't even tell you.""

The civil suit filed under the racketeering law known as RICO seeks tens of millions of dollars in damages. Apartments at the building at 188 East 78th Street, known as the Empire, sold for as much as $4.5 million. The board of managers of the Empire say that apartments are often sweltering in summer and freezing in winter. They said that the 31-story building has suffered extensive water damage since it opened in 2000 and that owners of the approximately 70 condos have had to contend with buckling floorboards and ill-fitting windows. In 2003, a settlement brokered by the state attorney general's office called for the builders to make repairs. The suit filed yesterday claims the work was not done. One of the developers, Aby Rosen of RFR Holding, who said he had not seen the suit, said that the dispute was settled and ""the work has been in progress.""

Tracking his life from Krakow in 1939 and the Nazi invasion of Poland to his election as pope in 1978, ""Karol, the Man Who Became Pope"" is fiction and not a documentary, the director, Giacomo Battiato, told the ANSA news agency, though he said it was based on historically accurate events. The young Karol Wojtyla, portrayed by Piotr Adamczyk, right, is presented as a patriot in occupied Poland, and as a committed priest. The series apparently skirts any suggestion of romantic entanglements. The screenplay was reportedly vetted by the Holy See, the daily newspaper La Repubblica said. The newspaper also wrote that when the producer, Pietro Valsecchi, informed the pope of plans for a film about his life, John Paul warned him: ""Careful not to make mistakes."" A second series, tracking the years of John Paul's papacy, is to be filmed in the fall. The $14.2 million project was previewed at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome on Thursday, and ANSA reported that many tears were shed. ELISABETTA POVOLEDO",2005-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"GETTING HER YA-YAS OUT: It's not uncommon for a pop novelist -- Patricia Cornwell is a good example -- to have the No. 1 books on both the hardcover and paperback fiction best-seller lists at the same time. For nonfiction writers, however, this kind of domination is practically unheard of. Malcolm Gladwell has pulled it off -- his new book, ""Blink,"" is No. 1 on the hardcover list again this week, and his previous book, ""The Tipping Point,"" sits atop the paperback side. ""The Tipping Point"" was about ""social epidemics,"" about how ideas and trends spread the way viruses do. Interestingly, one of the word-of-mouth ""epidemics"" Gladwell explored in his book was the slow, up-from-the-bottom success of Rebecca Wells's 1996 novel, ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."" Wells's book sold modestly for a year or two before it ""tipped"" in 1998, becoming a paperback best seller for 84 weeks and spawning a Sandra Bullock movie. For Wells's fans, it's been a long, lonely wait for a follow-up, but nine years later that book is finally here: ""Ya-Yas in Bloom"" (HarperCollins) makes its debut on the hardcover fiction list this week at No. 3. What took her so long? According to her Web site, Wells has been ill with a variety of mysterious and increasingly dire symptoms; she was finally told she had advanced Lyme disease. At times she was so weak she was forced to dictate portions of ""Ya-Yas in Bloom"" into a tape recorder. Wells, a former actress, is said to be a sprightly reader of her work at bookstore appearances, but this time around she has nixed a potential book tour. She is getting better, she writes, but will sorely miss ""dressing up and prissing across the stage.""",2005-04-17T05:00:00+0000

Best known as the Musical Director for Jack Paar's Tonight Show, Jose was born in Havana, Cuba on February 27th, 1920. A child prodigy, he began studying piano when he was three years old, with his first performance at the age of four. He was a professor of Solfeggio and Theory at eight years old and graduated from the Havana Conservatory of Music when he was ten. In Paris, he studied with the eminent Alfred Cortot under a Cuban government scholarship. Jose arrived in the U.S. at the age of 16 to study under the tutelage of the distinguished Erwin Bodky in Cambridge, MA, where he graduated from the Longy School of Music. From there he went to New York to study at the Julliard School of Music when, in 1943, he was drafted. Jose served in the US Army and was stationed in Corpus Christi where he met the love of his life, Sue Renfrow. In 1944, he married Sue in a civil ceremony in Nashville, TN while on tour with the USO, at which time he served as conductor and musical arranger of a 40 piece band. While in the army, Jose met Jack Paar and joined him through the run of the CBS Morning Show, the CBS Afternoon Show and, finally, the Tonight Show, for which he wrote the theme song ""I-M-4-U"". He cut many records under contract with SEECO and Mercury Records, and performed with or conducted for numerous artists, from Frank Sinatra to Clark Terry to Tito Puente. He has been feature performer for the Boston Pops, and the Saint Louis, Rochester, and Miami Symphonies, to name a few. In later years, though blind and almost completely deaf, he performed benefits for various civic organizations and institutions. Jose lived less than two years after his beloved wife died. He leaves his daughter and son-in-law, Suzanne and John Golembieski, his son and daughter-in-law, Michael Melis and Carmen, as well as seven grandchildren, with an eighth predeceased, and three great - grandchildren. Surviving as well is his brother, Rafael Guiu; a sister, Rosita Dinsmore died not long ago. Jose Melis was a fine husband and father, a great talent, and an honorable man.

He was preceded in death by his wife, Elizabeth (nee Parker) of 45 years who died on December 14, 2004. Mr. Fisler is survived by his children and extended family including Barbara and her husband Charles Sturtevant (RI), Janet Dutton (CA), Helen Fisler (TX), Peter Fisler (CA), Parke Fisler and his wife, Christine Fisler (MA), and a loyal troupe of grandchildren and step-grandchildren. He was born and reared in Brooklyn, NY and graduated from Peekskill Military Academy. A defiant cadet, he ultimately learned how to harness his fierce energy and intellect. He became a voracious reader (of history, in particular), an agile lacrosse and soccer player as well as an astute student. He went on to Brown University (and remained a vocal fan and supporter). His academic career was interrupted by WWII as he joined the Army and flew the Burma India hump. Post War, he initially worked at St. John Associates, a direct mail advertising firm started by his aunt, Helen V. Fisler, but he soon moved forth to his Camelot--Time, Inc. This, he repeatedly proclaimed, was the luckiest move of his life for it provided him the perfect fit and forum for his multiple talents. ""Time, Inc"", he always said, was a ""great club""--an amazing group of people who were bright, verbal, energetic, spirited, curious, and creative. Informed and informative, he adored Time Inc, and the cerebral challenges that arrived daily. Over a period of some 35 years, he played a pivotal role in nurturing the eclectic, and rather formidable, magazine group: Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, People, Fortune, and Money. His title was VP and his domain was Circulation and Promotion. He was a wordsmith who spun wellcrafted letters that invariably hooked casual readers and turned them into committed subscribers. In addition to his pithy direct mail pieces, he was often the ""house"" orator/ emcee as he had a talent for writing his signature incisive and memorable odes, poems, songs, and speeches. He was awarded the ""Brown Bear Award"" for his lifelong contributions to Brown University and numerous professional recognitions throughout his career including the Irving Wundermann and Silver Apple Awards. After retirement, Mr. Fisler received his Master's Degree in American History from Manhattanville College. A diverse mind, he also reveled in numerous diversions. He was an avid golfer, an enthusiastic curler, a formidable and competitive gin player, and later in life, a renewed aviator. His most treasured pleasure was sweeping across a dance floor with elegance and with, of course, his beloved graceful Betsy. He enjoyed good cigars, fine wines, aged scotch, and most importantly, loyal friends and family. He will be missed by them all.",2005-04-17T05:00:00+0000

This is Brite's third novel about the gay New Orleans chefs Rickey and G-man -- partners in business and love -- and we are told that she is at work on a fourth. Can the franchise sustain itself? The answer is yes. To begin with, a high-end restaurant is -- for any competent novelist -- a gift that keeps on giving. The heat, the bickerings and intrigue, the pursuit of perfection, the dodgy money keeping it all afloat: the setting spawns plots. Further, the gentle G-man and his more highly strung partner, Rickey, are distinct but mutually dependent characters, fervently monogamous but with a restlessness in their relationship that keeps things moving. Here, the boys are knocked off balance when their restaurant, Liquor, is given a terrible review, then maintained in their disequilibrium by a curious invitation for Rickey to go to to Dallas and help organize the menu of a troubled fellow chef named Cooper. A decayed charmer and sexual predator, Cooper is a figure of some interest; his palate may still be acute, but his taste for life has coarsened. His rueful but too forgiving sense of himself and his collapsible morals are well caught by Brite.",2005-04-17T05:00:00+0000

And three months later, I left again for Niger -- this time to Tner, the great desert, which is really, for me, a type of garden where everything is immense and without end.

The officials fear that their well of money for improvements will run dry next year because lawmakers have not settled on a way to replenish the state Transportation Trust Fund. The fund, fed by a 14.5-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, is expected to be drained by June 2006. Without a gasoline-tax increase or a new source of revenue, the fund will barely cover its hefty debt payments, leaving nothing for road paving or bridge building. A lack of state contributions would be compounded by a loss of $1 billion in federal matching funds. Jack Lettiere, the state commissioner of transportation, said he could not predict whether the entire program will stop at the end of the next fiscal year, June 2006.

us,On the Cover; Out of the Shadows Slowly,"BOXERS know the importance of pacing themselves, not spending all their energy in the first round, and so apparently do Dan Klores and Ron Berger, whose documentary, ""Ring of Fire,"" about the welterweight and middleweight champion Emile Griffith (shown on cover), unfolds with great patience. The film, which has its television premiere Wednesday at 9 p.m. on USA, builds gently to its pivotal event, a televised fight in March 1962 at Madison Square Garden in which Mr. Griffith administered a beating to Benny (Kid) Paret that turned out to be fatal. But it is just as restrained in following the threads that extended from that grisly event, one that stunned the country and, more than a year before Lee Harvey Oswald was shot on camera, showed the frightening powers of live television. Perhaps that pacing reflects the film's long gestation period. ""I was always interested in this, way before I even knew how to make a film,"" said Mr. Klores (near right, with Mr. Berger), who remembers watching the fight on television as a 12-year-old. ""What stayed with me was more than what happened,"" he said. ""What effects did this have on Emile and the Paret family?"" His exploration of that led in surprising directions -- to a subtheme of homophobia; to people who had not been interviewed about the fight in four decades; to vignettes of regret and reconciliation.

Madame Kuony was the proprietor of the Postilion Restaurant, School of Culinary Arts and Studio of Interior Design. She was renowned for her unwavering high standards, sense of style, and her ever present hat. Madame Kuony's energetic spirit and passion for life, coupled with heartfelt appreciation for family, friends, students, artisans, nature, and animals are how she will be most remembered. The pioneer of organic cooking, her commitment to educate all on the necessity of using only organic/unadulterated ingredients was her life-long mission. Madame Kuony's dedication to assist the disadvantaged was evident through her contributions to the Broken Bread program, Salvation Army, and the Fond du Lac Humane Society. A cherished mother, grandmother, teacher and friend to the community, this Wisconsin icon's sense of purpose will live on in the many lives she has touched. Madame Kuony was born in Antwerp, Belgium. Having completed her schooling in Switzerland, where she majored in interior decorating and the culinary arts, she made her way to the United States in 1937. A merchandising position brought her to Milwaukee, where she met and married her late husband, John H. Kuony, Jr. Appropriately, Madame Kuony fell in love with Fond du Lac, as it was reminiscent of the French countryside of her youth. She and her husband moved to the area in 1947 and opened an antique shop on Merrill Avenue, bringing a European flavor to the community. Upon the purchase of the Darling home at South Park Avenue in 1949, Madame Kuony set her sights on and was successful in bringing unique dining experiences to the people of the community through the opening of the Postilion Restaurant. Other business ventures over the years included the Postilion line of gourmet prepared foods, condiments, and compotes, in addition to the Four Winds restaurant in Greenbush, WI. Between 1980 and 1984, the Postilion expanded to include the Postilion II School of Culinary Art and supply shop along with the Great House Restaurant in Milwaukee, WI. Madame Kuony is survived by her two children: daughter, Suzanne (Hilton) Smack of Santa Ana, CA and John (Jeanine) Kuony of Pleasanton, CA; grandchildren Jennifer (Jonathan) Senften of Santa Ana, CA, Stephen Casey of Tustin, CA, and brother-in-law Frank (Mary Jane) Kuony of Pleasanton, CA. She was preceded in death by her husband, John H. Kuony, Jr. A private family service is being planned.

After France was liberated, the S.N.C.F. charged the French government, and received payment, the appeal contended.

Microsoft settled a California consumer suit that made similar legal claims. Government entities were excluded from that $1.1 billion settlement.

The asteroid belt, the first to be discovered around a star the same age and brightness as the Sun, is 25 times as large as the solar system's asteroid belt and hugs its star more tightly. The resulting constant bombardment of asteroids would discourage the evolution of life on any nearby planets, the astronomers said. The team leader, Dr. Charles Beichman of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said it was also possible, though unlikely, that the dust was left by a giant comet orbiting the star. The spectrum of the dust, he said, was a perfect match to Comet Hale-Bopp, which passed spectacularly by Earth in 1997. Both are made of a magnesium-rich silicate called Forsterite, also found on the Green Sand Beach on Hawaii. Dennis Overbye (NYT)",2005-04-21T05:00:00+0000

He was 77. In 1958, Dr. Tregoe and Dr. Charles H. Kepner left the RAND Corporation, where they worked as systems researchers, to found KepnerTregoe and Associates, Inc. Innovative pioneers, the two social scientists conducted original research with major corporations and discovered a core set of analytical problem-solving and decisionmaking processes that continue to be recognized as universally valid. Today, 400 of the 1,000 largest corporations worldwide use Kepner-Tregoe management methods. Their company, which later became Kepner-Tregoe, Inc., is headquartered in Princeton, NJ and conducts business in over 50 countries and 20 languages. Since its inception, Kepner-Tregoe has transferred its problem-solving, decision-making, and planning approaches to millions of managers. Dr. Tregoe and his colleague, John W. Zimmerman, also developed a process for strategic decision making that has helped many top management teams set and implement strategy. Dr. Tregoe provided the inspiration and leadership for Kepner-Tregoe over many years. He held a firm belief in the quality and depth of development for every associate as they delivered Kepner Tregoe's services to clients. He was conceptionally brilliant, a tough questioner, and a sensitive counselor. Dr. Tregoe and his company have been a significant force in organization development, pioneering both the train-thetrainer approach and process consulting, both of which have become common practice. He was elected to the Human Resource Development Hall of Fame. Dr. Tregoe was a leading lecturer and published extensively in journals throughout the world. His first book, The Rational Manager, which was co-authored with Dr. Kepner in 1965, is recognized as a landmark publication in the field of management methodology. He also co-authored The New Rational Manager: An Updated Edition for a New World (1997); Top Management Strategy: What It Is and How to Make It Work (1980); Vision in Action: Putting a Winning Strategy to Work (1989); The Culture of Success: Building a Sustained Competitive Advantage by Living Your Corporate Beliefs (1997); and Analytic Processes for School Leaders (2001). In 1993, Dr. Tregoe realized a long-held dream when he established the Tregoe Education Forum. This nonprofit organization provides students in middle and high schools with the critical-thinking skills needed to effectively solve problems, make decisions, and work together. Dr. Tregoe was born in San Francisco on December 23, 1927. He graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California in 1945. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, he received his bachelor's degree from Whittier College and a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard University. He also received an honorary LL.D. from Whittier College, where he served as a trustee and a board member. He was a member of the board of directors of The J.M. Smucker Company, the National Alliance of Business, The World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, and the Princeton Day School. He served as chairman of an advisory committee to the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. He is a past member of the Young Presidents' Organization, where he served as international education chairman and a member of the board, and a member of the Chief Executives' Organization. Dr. Tregoe is survived by his wife, Jeannette Tregoe; two daughters, Cynthia Richetti and Elizabeth Gonzalez; one son, Benjamin B. Tregoe III; and two grandchildren, Kaleigh and Gavin Richetti.

Yesterday he went with supporters -- and a throng of reporters -- to the courthouse where the federal case against him on contempt-of-court charges is being heard and demanded that his bail be revoked so he could be imprisoned. A judge refused. On Wednesday, federal prosecutors presented the charges -- that he ignored a court order in 2001 -- but robbed him of the chance to look like a martyr for democracy by having two allies of President Vicente Fox pay his bail. Mr. Lpez Obrador says the charges are trumped up and intended to knock him off the presidential ballot next year. He has vowed to run from jail if necessary. Meanwhile, he seems to be holding his own in polls. A poll by the newspaper El Universal indicated that his lead over candidates from the other two major parties had grown by three percentage points, to 38 percent over all, from 35 percent in February, which was before the government announced it would prosecute him and possibly push him out of the presidential race next year.

For weeks, La Scala's workers had been walking out of performances to express their dissatisfaction with Mr. Meli, who was perceived as not being up to the task of managing the famous opera house. The unrest at the theater led to the resignation of the conductor Riccardo Muti this month after 19 years on La Scala's podium. Mr. Lissner will take up his new job, which runs five months short of five years, in May. ""My absolute priority will be music,"" he told reporters. La Scala union representatives said they were pleased with the turn of events.

The minister of mines, Kaunda Lembalemba, said that the owners of the Bgrimm explosives plant had not provided a list of workers at the factory, apparently because many were casual workers with no records. He accused the owners of ""treating workers like pigs"" and urged families in the area, 180 miles north of Lusaka, to notify the government if loved ones did not come home. Zambia's economy has struggled since copper prices crashed in the 1970's, and Indian and Chinese companies have snatched up many of the area's mines.

The commission said the finding, based on federal labor statistics, undermined an argument by public-sector workers that they deserved generous benefit packages to compensate for higher private-sector pay.

us,The Listings; THE SHINS,"Nearly four years ago, an unknown indie-rock band called the Shins (above) released ""Oh, Inverted World"" (Sub Pop), a beguiling but confounding little album that wasn't as little as it first seemed. The summery tunes and close vocal harmonies made the music seem somehow slight, and yet the singer-songwriter James Mercer packed each song with sharp turns and sharper lyrics: this was an album that stayed mysterious long after you memorized the words. In the years since then, the album's sweetly melancholy single ""New Slang"" became a sort of secret hit single, infiltrating pop culture through commercials and soundtracks. And in 2003, the group released the successful follow-up, ""Chutes Too Narrow"" (Sub Pop), by which point the Shins looked less like an anomaly and more part of a booming indie scene that also included Death Cab for Cutie and the Postal Service. ""Chutes Too Narrow"" is another unlikely delight, a half-hour album so breezy you almost forget it's overstuffed with words. The album ends with ""Those to Come,"" a hushed acoustic love song so lovely you might almost miss the rather unsentimental biological refrain: ""They are cold, still/Waiting in the ether to form, feel, kill/Propagate only to die."" At these two concerts, expect the Shins to put on a casual but thoroughly engrossing show -- and here's hoping Mr. Mercer has had enough time to write some more deceptively slight songs.

Coleman Hamilton Benedict, 93, Professor Emeritus of Columbia University, where he taught generations of undergraduates and graduate students for three decades, died of complications from pneumonia at New York University Hospital on April 20, 2005. He was the only child of Cleland and Florence Righter Benedict and a descendant of an illustrious old New York and New England family, which included his ancestor, the second president of Harvard University, Charles Chauncey, and the first mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, Lemuel Coleman. His grandfather, Coleman Benedict, entered Wall Street in 1864, and joined the New York Stock Exchange a year later. in 1890 he founded Benedict, Drysdale and Company and transferred his seat on the Exchange to Coleman's father Cleland. His uncle Lemuel, who also became a member of the Exchange, is incidentally renowned as the eponymous creator of ""Eggs Benedict"" for his breakfast order at the Waldorf Hotel in 1894, which the famous chef, ""Oscar of the Waldorf,"" prepared at his request, and named in his honor. Enrolled in Riverdale Country School in 1918, his love for the ancient classics and for teaching was imbibed from his Latin teacher, Marc M. Baldwin. Coleman matriculated at Princeton University in 1930, where he earned AB (cum laude) and MA degrees in Classics, and a Ph.D. in 1939. He began his teaching career as a Teaching Fellow at Western Reserve University in 1940, and was teaching Greek and Latin at the University of Vermont when he was called up for military service in 1942. Enlisted in the US Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC), he rose to the rank of Technical Sergeant, received a battlefield commission as Second Lieutenant in November 1944, was promoted to First Lieutenant in September 1945, and was honorably discharged in January 1946. During this tour of duty, he made security checks of Army installations in the United States, and conducted investigations of suspected subversion, sabotage and espionage, in Britain, Wales, Belgium, France and Germany. His war journals include memorable accounts of his experiences in the landing at Normandy, in the Battle of St. Lo, the Battle of the Bulge, and with the first contingent of the US Army to enter Soviet-controlled Berlin. His CIC team was assigned to debug the villa occupied by President Truman and to protect him during his Potsdam conferences with Stalin and Churchill. In an early letter to his mother, he wrote ""The practical benefits of true education are going to show in the months to come. Moderation, self-control, and thinking are going to stand us in good stead. It will not be pleasant to watch the world go mad, but we shall, at least, have the satisfaction of not following it. We can't have Socrates' keen mind, but we can have his courage. He, too, lived in a world that fell apart."" Dr. Benedict resumed his academic career at New York University during 1946-50, and continued at Columbia University for three decades from 1950 to 1980, retiring as Professor Emeritus. During most of those years from 1953 to 1975, he was the Departmental Representative of Columbia College and its School of General Studies, and its Chairman during several years in the 1970's. In that capacity, but especially in the classroom, his self-deprecating wit, enthusiasm, and astonishing breadth of knowledge, endeared him to and often motivated countless Columbia undergraduates, whose development was his priority as an educator, while depth of knowledge about all languages, literatures, and cultures was his prime personal goal. His early interest in the Romans in Southern Gaul resulted in several publications, including A History of Narbo (Lancaster Press). His insatiable search for knowledge led to articles ranging from Herodotus to Demosthenes, ancient coins in the Columbia University Library, and the ability to read in at least 14 foreign languages, including Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Sanskrit, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, and of course all the Classical and Romance languages. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Ethyle R. Wolfe Benedict, Emeritus Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, former Dean of Humanities, and longtime Chairman and former Professor of Classics at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York.

Also on the block will be a 1701 Gofriller cello, several guitars, a harp and a 1795 flute. The Strad's first recorded owner was the French violinist Charles Philippe Lafont, an archrival of Nicolo Paganini and the owner of two other Strads. It got its name in 1900 when a Scottish industrialist, Sir Charles Tennant, bought it for his wife, an amateur violinist. ""Such violins never come into the sale room,"" wrote the London dealer who handled that sale. But Christie's, which says that since 1981 the Lady Tennant has been in the hands of a collector it did not identify, estimates that it will go for $800,000 to $1.2 million.

An investigation commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery in London subjected the so-called Flower portrait, right, frequently used to illustrate his plays, to examination by curators, conservators and scientists. Their tests included X-rays, ultraviolet examination, macro and micro photography, and the examination of microscopic paint samples. These, the gallery said, revealed that although the portrait is dated 1609, a pigment, chrome yellow, which became available only in the early 19th century, was well integrated into the paint layers. As a result, the National Portrait Gallery concluded, ""It can be categorically stated that Flower portrait of Shakespeare is a 19th-century painting."" The painting, which hangs at the Royal Shakespeare Company, based in Stratford-on-Avon, is named for the Flowers family, who donated it to the troupe. Research on it and two other images of Shakespeare, the Chandos painting and the Grafton portrait, was undertaken in preparation for an exhibition next year, ""Searching for Shakespeare,"" to celebrate the National Portrait Gallery's 150th anniversary. It says the results of new technical analysis and research ""will cast new light on the search for Shakespeare's authentic appearance."" PAM KENT",2005-04-23T05:00:00+0000

In a 6-to-1 decision, the high court said that Warner Brothers did not use the name of the families of Capt. Billy Tyne, played by George Clooney, left, and the crewman Dale Murphy Sr., known as Murph (John C. Reilly), to promote the film; therefore it concluded that the law that prohibits commercial use of someone's name or likeness without his consent was not violated. The suit was filed by relatives of Mr. Tyne and Mr. Murphy, who are Florida residents. They argued that not only did the studio not obtain permission but that Warner Brothers also fictionalized the events to help boost the film's profits. Viewers are told that the film is based on a true story, but it carries a disclaimer saying, ""Dialogue and certain events and characters in the film were created for the purpose of fictionalization.""

The 1970's glass-and-steel structure, which housed not only the East German Parliament but also a concert hall, several restaurants and spaces for leisure, was closed for asbestos removal shortly after the Communist government collapsed in 1989. Since August 2004, when the palace reopened as a cultural complex, offering theater, modern dance, concerts and art installations, many Berliners have been fighting against removal of the historic building. Others favor demolition because they want to reconstruct the Prussian Palace of the Hohenzollern, which occupied the same site for 300 years before it was damaged in World War II and was blown up by the Communists in 1950.

More than $15 million worth. Mr. Snipes, who portrayed Blade, the Vampire Slayer, in three films based on the Marvel Comics series by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan, is suing the distributor of ""Blade: Trinity,"" New Line Cinema Corporation, and others for breaches of contract. The suit, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, states that the defendants blocked Mr. Snipes from active preproduction involvement, including the choice of director and principal casting, acts that he contends led to the film's critical and commercial failure. In court papers, he complains of racially motivated treatment and also says he was not consulted on the casting of the actress Jessica Biel, whom he considered too young, or Kris Kristofferson, who appeared to him too old, choices that he says led to plot inconsistencies. The reduced screen presence of the Blade character, the pumping up of juvenile-level humor and the inexperience of the director, David S. Goyer (also named as a defendant), in filming action scenes also led to the film's commercial failure and the undermining of Mr. Snipes's reputation, the suit says.

Directed by Alfred E. Green and starring the 25-year-old Barbara Stanwyck, the film tracks the rise of a hard-drinking, tough-talking, low-rent schemer into high society. What principally inflamed the New York Censor Board that rejected the original cut, forcing cuts and re-shoots, was that Stanwyck's aptly named Lily Powers sleeps her way to the top. The bluenoses also didn't like that the engine driving Lily's ferocious will to power is none other than Nietzsche. The German philosopher didn't make it past the censors and neither did the film's more salacious ""postures and gestures."" Preserved by the Library of Congress from an uncut negative, the version screening at Film Forum on Tuesday in an encore presentation includes a number of crucial, forbidden moments, among them an image of Lily's father pocketing cash in exchange for her sexual services and a scene in which she thumbs through Nietzsche's ""Thoughts Out of Season."" Although most famous for their unabashedly adult attitude to sex (everyone seems to be having a very good time after hours), what is most shocking about both ""Baby Face"" and ""The Sin of Nora Moran,"" the second feature on this racy double bill, is their unblinking attitude to class. Both Lily and the Nora Moran, an orphan turned adulteress played by Zita Johann, are forced into extenuating circumstances not because they are born bad, but because they scramble out of poverty -- on their backs.

us,On the Cover; Swimming With F.D.R.,"THE respected actor Kenneth Branagh spends a lot of time being slung ignominiously over other actors' shoulders in ""Warm Springs,"" a new HBO film in which he portrays Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the pre-presidential years when F.D.R. came to grips with his polio. Was that really Mr. Branagh being unflatteringly upended, or was some double brought in to endure the manhandling? ""Oh, I was definitely the sack of potatoes,"" Mr. Branagh said with a laugh. Giving a convincing portrayal of a man who has no use of his legs required a good bit of learning on Mr. Branagh's part, some of it done at Warm Springs, the natural wonder in Georgia that, in Roosevelt's time and now, drew people seeking some measure of healing from the mineral-rich water. Staff members and clients schooled him in things like how a person with no abdominal muscle strength would swim. ""People were unbelievably generous as I was in there trying to pretend how to walk with leg braces and they were there with their leg braces and having to deal with very practical issues,"" he said. ""People seemed very keen that we get it right."" The film, which has its premiere Saturday at 8 p.m., depicts Roosevelt's struggle to regain his sense of purpose after he was stricken by polio in 1921, just as his political career was about to hit high gear. Cynthia Nixon (above, with Mr. Branagh) plays Eleanor Roosevelt, who had adjustments of her own to make. Mr. Branagh, who is Irish, said he had some trepidation about portraying an American political giant. ""What made it seem more doable,"" he said, ""was the idea that this was a sort of secret part of F.D.R.'s life and that in fact I wasn't playing the great American icon, I was playing the man who then developed into the great American icon.""

(The widely anthologized ""My Mother's Clothes: The School of Beauty and Shame"" first appeared in 1986.) These lushly detailed linked stories -- which traverse post-World War II, middle-class America -- have a complexity that feels expertly distilled. The narrator, gay and H.I.V. positive, recalls a youth of misapprehensions, secret pleasures and frequent humiliations in the suburbs of Washington, as well as a fraught, yearning-filled trip to Morocco, an AIDS-decimated circle of friends and, most memorably, his narcissistic mother and dissolute, provocative brother. McCann's pointillist approach -- his stories tend to accumulate incidents rather than depict sustained events -- has surprising momentum, and together the stories acquire a rare thematic richness. Thus the perfectly engineered payoff to ""My Brother in the Basement,"" in which the narrator's hidden sexuality is contrasted with his brother's tormented openness, reverberates in the next and final story, ""The Universe, Concealed,"" about the narrator's ostensibly invisible illness.",2005-04-24T05:00:00+0000

The larger debate is not just whether it is ethical to create a human chimera but also whether it is ethical to experiment on the chimera. Is it acceptable to experiment on a monkey with a human foot? If so, do we draw the line at a monkey with a human cell that allows it to sob in its cage? Why should the ""humanness"" of an animal species determine its appropriateness for invasive medical experimentation? Nonhuman species feel physical pain, loneliness and anxiety; they have consciousness, memory, maternal feelings and social hierarchies.

He had no talent with a pen, and he wanted badly to be understood, so he asked his wife, Brooke, to put what he had to say into words. He wanted to thank the president, whom he admired, for mentioning steroids in his State of the Union address, but he was also hoping to use his own case to advance the discussion. He was a small-boned, 5-foot-7, 155-pound center fielder who, even as he wrote, was succeeding in baseball because of his speed and his abilities to play defense and get on base. Even so, just over a year into his pro career, he was beginning to feel like a freak. He could live with being the least likely player on the field to hit the ball over the wall; what drove him nuts was the thought of bigger players using drugs to widen the power gap even further between him and them. The season before, he'd actually watched some hulking bomber taking batting practice hit a high fly ball to the warning track, turn to a teammate and, referring to a steroid, say, ""One cycle of Deca and that's out.""

For a stretch of almost 30 years -- from the publication of ""Henderson the Rain King"" in 1959 through the release of ""More Die of Heartbreak"" in 1987 -- nearly everything Bellow wrote appeared for two months or so on the hardcover fiction or nonfiction list. It took the public time to pick up on Bellow's busy, rueful, comic charms. None of his first four novels -- ""Dangling Man"" (1944), ""The Victim"" (1947), ""The Adventures of Augie March"" (1953) or ""Seize the Day"" (1956) -- made this page. Bellow's real breakthrough came in 1964 with ""Herzog,"" a novel about a failed academic whose wife leaves him for his best friend. The book was praised on the cover of the Book Review and held on at No. 1 for more than seven months. (The book it bumped out of the top slot: John le Carr's ""Spy Who Came In From the Cold."") Twenty years after the publication of his first novel, Bellow was financially secure. In his biography of Bellow, James Atlas writes that female readers were particularly taken with ""Herzog,"" and with its dashing author. Women would write to him, Bellow said in a television interview, ""to ask me how they should behave with intellectuals, for recipes of dishes mentioned in the book. They make me feel like an editor of Vogue.""",2005-04-24T05:00:00+0000

(The presale estimate was $19,600 to $26,000. The buyer was an unidentified Swiss collector.) Doisneau spotted Mrs. Bornet and her then boyfriend on the streets of Paris in 1950, and they agreed to pose. A few days later, Doisneau sent her an original copy, part of a series on Paris lovers assigned by Life magazine. Mrs. Bornet, a former actress, emerged from anonymity in 1993 when she sued Doisneau for $18,000 compensation and a share of the royalties. The case was dismissed, but during it Doisneau revealed that the scene had been staged. Since 1986, when the photograph was first printed as poster, the image has been widely reproduced.

That was the impression coming out of San Francisco yesterday, when producers of the Broadway-bound musical ""Lennon"" announced that they were canceling a planned tryout run in Boston in favor of returning to New York for more rehearsals. Allan McKeown, the lead producer, said the Boston run (scheduled at the Colonial Theater from May 31 through June 25) was being sacrificed for ""changes that will be beneficial to our show,"" but he said the Broadway opening remained set for July 28. It is not the production's first sign of turmoil; reviews in San Francisco, where it plays until May 14, were mostly unfriendly, and sales in Boston not particularly strong.

""The ticket can still be used for a year, it's just that the actual change has to be made within 90 days,"" said Kurt Ebenhoch, a Northwest spokesman. The new policy, which he said was adopted for better inventory control, applies to all tickets issued on or after April 15. Terry Trippler, the chief executive of Farefacts.com, a travel adviser based in Minneapolis, said, ""It's a big change."" As of yesterday, he said, no other airline had followed Northwest's lead. Typically, major airlines allow passengers who cancel an original flight on a nonrefundable ticket to rebook the ticket anytime within a year for a $100 change fee. Over the last five years, business travelers have been rebelling against high walk-up fares by switching to the nonrefundable tickets favored by tourists. Because business travelers change their plans so often, many corporate travel managers use procedures, like American Express's TicketTrax service, to keep track of unused tickets and flag them for rebooking.",2005-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Faheem's brothers and their mother, Melinda Williams, are also plaintiffs in the suit. The brothers were severely emaciated when they were found. They have since been placed in foster care elsewhere. Foster-care authorities had received 11 complaints of abuse and neglect about the children, but the case was closed after a division worker was unable to locate them.

In a yearly report based on government data and released this week, the trade group found that the technology industry lost 25,000 jobs in 2004, declining to 5.6 million. That represented a far slower decline than in 2003, when 333,000 jobs were lost, and 2002, when employment in the technology business dropped 612,000. ""The severe hemorrhaging has stopped,"" said William T. Archey, chief executive of the trade association. Employment fell in manufacturing and communications services, which continue to shed jobs as the telecommunications industry consolidates. But jobs were added in software services and engineering and technology services.

""CSI: Miami"" was Monday's most-watched show, bringing in an estimated audience of 15.54 million. NBC's lineup featured original episodes of ""Fear Factor,"" ""Las Vegas"" and ""Medium,"" and the combination was No. 1 among adults 18 to 49. ""Medium,"" with a guest appearance by Chad Lowe as a murderous airline pilot, was NBC's biggest draw: 14.23 million viewers watched the show, starring Patricia Arquette. CBS's Monday loss among viewers 18 to 49 aside, the network, which used to skew older, continues to do well in that demographic. It was first among those viewers for the week that ended on April 24. That victory, its fourth in five weeks, put CBS back into a tie with Fox for the season in that age group, which advertisers care about the most. KATE AURTHUR",2005-04-27T05:00:00+0000

Dr. Bolin is accused of pocketing instead of returning money that was refunded after some students canceled their reservations to Russia. Dr. Bolin's lawyer, William T.

A lawyer for the foundation, which is financially troubled and has long sought the move to save itself from bankruptcy, said the decision had removed the final hurdle to moving the collection, which contains dozens of works by Renoir, Czanne and Picasso. ""This should end the legal dispute so the Barnes should be able now to go forward with building its new facility,"" said Ralph G. Wellington, the lawyer. Many art scholars have opposed the move, saying that the collection should remain true to the vision of Albert C. Barnes, a patent-medicine millionaire who stipulated that no picture in his collection could be lent, sold or even moved on the walls of the quirky neo-Classical galleries that he had built for it in the mid-1920's.

This small show of five pop-oriented artists from different generations makes the point with Yayoi Kusama's silver-painted stool covered with pop-up phalluses. And -- more orderly if not as pretty -- Tom Sachs's ""Bong Station,"" a rough-hewn console organized in compartments to contain the licit and illicit: a mirror, an electric clock, a machete, a remote-controlled toy racing car, cigarettes, a beer can, a water bottle and a bong (for marijuana). But there are more decorous works, too, like Roy Lichtenstein's dashing chair and ottoman of painted bronze (above), formed from several heroic blue and black brushstrokes, and Ed Ruscha's highly lacquered five-panel wood screen, painted on both sides with dreamy atmospheric cloud drifts. They carry lines in block lettering from an Elvis ballad: ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget"" on one side, ""I Remembered to Forget to Remember"" on the other. Jeff Koons is seen here at his most minimal, with a trio of simplified wall-mounted floral cut-outs of mirror-finish stainless steel, each having a different-colored center, cutesy but not very Koons-y. Artists doing furniture is by no means a new phenomenon, and given more room, the gallery could undoubtedly have provided many other examples. But in this case, the show's intimacy adds to its punch.

""This is the first product H.P. is bringing to market with wobulation,"" said Matt Schulz, product manager for the company's microdisplay TV's.

The legal wrangling began last summer when Intermec sued Matrics, a start-up manufacturer of radio tags and scanners that balked at paying licensing fees to Intermec. Symbol acquired Matrics last July and in March, when efforts to negotiate a settlement broke down, filed a suit charging Intermec with violating Symbol's Wi-Fi patents. Intermec responded with further patent infringement claims against Symbol. The battle is the first major intellectual property dispute in the field of radio frequency identification, or RFID. Specialists say the outcome could affect how fast the field develops and who profits from it. Barnaby J. Feder (NYT)",2005-04-29T05:00:00+0000

But at night in his crowded one-room apartment, he created his own fantasy realm in the form of a lavishly illustrated 15,000-page novel and 300 paintings. Darger's writings and artworks chronicle the turbulent battles of the innocent Vivian sisters against an evil male empire. The images are often as disturbing as they are fantastic, for they abound with psychological implications of cruelty and enslavement. Pat Graney, a choreographer who often takes the visual arts as a point of departure, will have reproductions of some of Darger's imagery projected during her work for five dancers, costumed like characters from the paintings and novel. For instance, the Vivian girls are in brunette wigs and white dresses, while butterfly-like creatures wear colorful wings and dance en pointe. And all the adventures take place on a stage cluttered with giant books.

Mr. Kennedy was with Channel 13 for many years, most recently the creator of Cabaret Thirteen, featuring a variety of singers performing selections and then discussing their careers and outlook. He was also featured in a TV tribute to Jack Paar, recalling the late host's remarkable personality and creative late show format of the '50s and 60's which still sets the style today. Joining NBC as a page in the mid-50's, Mr. Kennedy always had his heart in Manhattan. He was involved in buying rights to older movies for Corinthian Broadcasting, a network of CBS stations, anticipating TV's great demand for classic and run-of-the-mill cinema. Summers of watching movies in Maine gave him a competitive resource. He later helped develop Time Life Films, a division of Time Life, introducing BBC films to American TV audiences--series such as ""Civilization"" and Alistair Cooke's ""America."" It was Mr. Kennedy's devotion to the theater that began with a childhood of watching Gilbert & Sullivan operettas and local theater in suburban Philadelphia and Maine Summer Theater. He was permanently hooked. A graduate of The Episcopal Academy, Merion Station, Pa., and Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, he was active in theater groups, and president of Bowdoin's Masque and Gown. Mr. Kennedy is survived by two brothers, Anthony Kennedy III, Rose Valley, Pa., and Jackson W. T. Kennedy, Toms River, N.J.; six nephews and nieces and eight grandnephews and nieces, including an identical birthday grandnephew, Bentley Kennedy-Stone, Baton Rouge, LA.; and an uncle, The Rev.

Spiritual teachers, gurus and Hollywood celebrities are drawn to the beauty of Ojai, with its clean white Spanish architecture and oak and citrus trees framed by the Coastal Range. More Telluride than Aspen, more Sonoma than Napa, it's a wealthy community that seems to pride itself on playing down its affluence.

Not surprisingly, Shostakovich is the drawing card here, not least because Mr. Temirkanov is to be joined by the violinist Gidon Kremer in what promises to be a searing account of the composer's Violin Concerto No. 1. Also notable, if somewhat briefer, is ""Lonesome,"" a recent work by Giya Kancheli, an idiosyncratic Georgian composer whose music leaves room for silence and calls for the most carefully hushed tones, as well as quadruple forte explosions of sound.

us,MICHAEL STUHLBARG,"Simple-minded is the customary euphemism for people like Michal, the hulking, childlike man being held prisoner in ""The Pillowman,"" Martin McDonagh's dazzlingly dark new play. But there is nothing remotely simple about Michael Stuhlbarg's portrait of this character, which finds embers of a scorching slyness within a brain made dim by torture. Mr. Stuhlbarg, above, an exotically artificial Richard II for Steven Berkoff at the Public Theater, turns bruisingly human with his haunted and haunting portrayal of Michal, the brother of the play's storytelling hero, Katurian (Billy Crudup). Michal loves his brother's scary bedtime tales, an affection he conveys with infectious ingenuousness. But in a play that has more twists than a hangman's rope, Michal emerges as a master of his own kind of fiction. Mr. Stuhlbarg expertly demonstrates that in the world of Mr. McDonagh even the infantile can be artful double dealers. (Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200.)

He was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on March 1, 1920, and came to the U.S.A. in 1930, moving to Akron, Ohio in 1944 where he lived most of his life. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Yale University in 1941, and did post-graduate work at Harvard Business School. His professional career spanned several years in the private industrial sector with Sargent & Co. in New Haven, CT; the Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. in Akron; and Mohawk Rubber Co. of New York. In 1959, he founded his own consulting firm Hochschwender & Associates and, in 1972, acquired Smithers Laboratories to form Smithers Scientific Services Inc. in Akron where he served as chief executive officer and later chairman of the board until his death. He was a member of several professional organizations - the International Laboratory Assurance Co.

He served as a trustee of the Akron Regional Development Board (ARDB), Akron General Medical Center, Children's Hospital Medical Center of Akron, and the Summit County Chapter of the American Red Cross. In 1976, he participated in a trade mission to China and served as an advisor to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on international affairs. A year later, he was appointed by Ohio Governor James Rhodes an Ohio Commodore. In 1989, he was recognized for Smithers' commitment to growth and dedication to the Akron, Ohio area and received the coveted Eagle Award for Business Heritage. In 1994, he was inducted into the Tire Industry Hall of Fame. He was also a member of the Yale University Alumni Association, the Yale Club of New York, the Yale Club of Southwest Florida, the Akron City Club, the Portage Country Club in Akron, the Naples (FL.)
