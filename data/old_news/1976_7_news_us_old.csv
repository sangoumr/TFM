us,'Silent Movie' With Golden Subtitles,"You might suspect that Mel Brooks's decision to make a contemporary silent movie titled ""Silent Movie,"" starring himself as a director trying to make a silent movie today, was not the wisest thing he'd ever done, and you'd be right. But having recognized that fact immediately, you can relax and enjoy ""Silent Movie"" as a virtually uninterrupted series of smiles.The film, which opened yesterday at the Cinema 1 and 2, doesn't contain a single moment that ever seriously threatens to split the sides, which, I suppose, will strike fanatical Brooks watchers-and-weighers as a statement of dismissal. To the rest of us it's to admit that Mr. Brooks, having given us the lunatic highs of ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein,"" should be allowed to fool around as he sees fit, possibly to extend his talent while discovering its limitations.Actually ""Silent Movie"" is not silent at all. It has a very busy soundtrack, full of music and of exaggerated noises that accompany such sights as those of a foot crushed in a door, a head bashed against a wall or the collapsing of a Murphy bed.The only element missing is spoken dialogue, and the written titles, which often adopt a genteel tone as if to spare us the crude reality of the true dialogue, are among the funniest things in the film. I particularly like: ""That poor woman is incredibly pregnant. Let's give her a lift."" Also the title that appears when a man 15 feet tall rings a stranger's doorbell. ""Hi,"" he says. ""I have a glandular condition. May I use your phone?""Politeness is, ultimately, one of the film's problems, especially in the personality of Mel Funn (Mr. Brooks), the reformed boozer who dreams of making his Hollywood comeback by directing a silent film in 1976. Mel Funn is polite, sweet and vulnerable, qualities one associates with some of the old silent film comedians and that fit Mr. Brooks less well than a nun's habit.The lack of spoken dialogue doesn't disable the character. It's the concept. When you have a Mel Brooks who doesn't allow himself to be rude, testy and master of the low leer, you don't have a funny man. You have an affable floorwalker. He's a suprise and sort of pleasant but not what you were expecting. By being thus prepared, you should be able to appreciate the good things that Mr. Brooks has brought off.These are the sight gags involving Mel Funn and his two staunch associates, Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman) and Dom Bell (Dom DeLuise), as they tootle around Hollywood (identified as ""the film capital of Greater Los Angeles"") stuffed into a minuscule sports car, signing up real life stars (James Caan, Anne Bancroft, Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds) for the film within the film.Between the set routines with these stars, who are very funny (particularly Mr. Reynolds and Miss Bancroft), the three indomitable heroes must buck up the failing health of their harried studio chief, played with surprisingly humorless intensity by Sid Caesar. They also have to outwit the corporate and criminal machinations of the New York-based conglomerate. Engulf and Devour (""our fingers are in everything""), which wants to take over the studio.To this end, Engulf and Devour hires Vilma Kaplan (Bernadette Peters), a nightclub performer billed as ""a bundle of lust,"" to lure poor Mel Funn back to his dependency on the bottle.Everything turns out gloriously, and in something less than 90 minutes, so there's not much time to become impatient with a gag that doesn't build to a boff. As in any good slapstick comedy, some of the most inspired moments are those that have no point whatsoever, such as the ""rushes"" we are shown of a low-budget picture the studio is then shooting in India.""Silent Movie"" is not the greatest movie Mr. Brooks has made, but if you adjust your expectations, it could be one of the nicest things you'll see all summer.The film, which has been rated PG, contains some visual vulgarisms of the sort that small children find price-lessly funnysuch as the sight of a wooden merry-go-round horse doing what live horses do naturally.",1976-07-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film: Drawn-Out Disney:'No Deposit, No Return' Is No 'Dumbo'","""No Deposit, No Return,"" a new Walt Disney live-action comedy, runs just eight minutes short of two hours, which is lunacy, considering that the members of the audience for whom it is intended can't even concentrate on Donald Duck that long. The film is about two children who blackmail a couple of innocent safecrackers into giving them shelter and attempt to extort $100,000 from their rich grandfather.According to the brainless plot, the children, played by Kim Richards and Brad Savage, are motivated by loneliness for their widowed mother, who's in Hong Kong and too busy with her career as a roving magazine editor to pay them any attention. A closer reading of their characters suggests that they're plain spoiled.That the movie goes on so long is no indication that it is especially full of incident, but rather that the director, Norman Tokar, doesn't know when to say cut.

us,Screen: 'Le Magnifique',"The talent of Philippe De Broca, the French director of ""The Love Game,"" ""The Five-Day Lover"" and ""That Man From Rio,"" began to melt in the mid-1960's. His last respectable comedy was ""King of Hearts"" (1967), and that was pretty soft. Mr. De Broca's ""Le Magnifique,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts, is so soft it just sort of sloshes around the ankles like a lukewarm footbath. It's not unpleasant, but it's not much of anything.The movie is a dual comedy about an impoverished, alimony-ridden writer who turns out pulp novels, and about a glamorous James Bond-type of hero created by the writer. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays both roles with as much verve and style as Mr. De Broca's inspirations allow. Jaqueline Bisset is cast as the spy's sultry assistant as well as the writer's upstairs neighbor, a scholarly young sociology major, while Vittorio Capriolo plays both the writer's stingy publisher and the spy's archenemy.There is a lot of not very witty cross-cutting between the writer's drab problems in rainy Paris and the spy's extraordinary adventures in sun-drenched Acapulco, and because the scenery is very pretty, the Acapulco footage is more fun. At this point, though, it's impossible to parody the work of Ian Fleming with real enthusiasm, as Mr. De Broca here demonstrates. The good humor that one takes away from ""Le Magnifique"" will depend entirely on the good humor one takes to it.",1976-07-08T05:00:00+0000

It stars Timothy Bottoms as a fellow who comes home after several years in the slammer (apparently for smoking pot, which is an excessive sentence even in Texas) to pick up his girl, played by Susan George, who is the mother of his illegitimate son. Before they can get out of town there is one political assassination (never explained) and two extended chases in which a lot of police cars are wrecked. Bo Hopkins, who can be a good actor, plays the nasty sheriff.The film has been rated PG, which is a very lenient rating for a film containing so much violence, but perhaps the violence appears to be excessive because none of it seems to be motivated by anything more reasonable than the producers' greed.",1976-07-10T05:00:00+0000

Kent's Philadelphia chum, E. T. Stotesbury, built Wingwood House nearby at a cost of more than $1 million. Today Bar Harbor's palatial mansions and manicured gardens are reminders of this opulent era whose demise was hastened by a disastrous fire in 1947 that destroyed 40 estates, 280 homes and cottages and three summer hotels.

Not many of the others could understand this, and it embarrassed them. When they were counting their money or posing for television cameras, Yawkey would be off somewhere fishing or hunting with a couple of his players, or in the summer when the game was over and the crowds had left Fenway Park he would put on spikes and baseball pants and a sweat shirt and get Johnny Orlando, the maitre de clubhouse, to pitch to him he could bit line drives off that leftfield wall. His feeling for the game was rooted in his boyhood. When he was 3 years old his father died and he was adopted by an uncle, William Hoover Yawkey, who owned the Detroit Tigers from 1904 through 1907. Bill Yawkey, who was to die in Ty Cobb's arms at the age of 43, entertained some of the most famous players of his time on his estate near Detroit, and young Tom grew up in these surroundings.",1976-07-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"To have a reason to get up in the morning, it is necessary to possess a guiding principle. A belief of some kind. A bumper sticker, if you will. So read the opening three sentences of Judith Guest's quiet but intensely felt first novel, Ordinary Peopleabout a young man recovering from a nervous breakdown. They are typical of the way Mrs. Guest scales down the experience of madness and makes it seem of a piece with the familiar strains of quotidian living. To be crazy is not necessarily to writhe in snake pits or converse with imaginary gods. It can sometimes be not knowing what to do in the morning. Too many details crowd [his] mind. Brush his teeth first? Wash his face? What pants should he wear? What shirt? The small seed of despair cracks open and sends experimental tendrils upward to the fragile skin of calm holding him together. To be crazy is something that happens to the order of things. And to ordinary people. It is something that has happened to Conrad Jarrett, the 17yearold son of an affluent Midwestern tax attorney and his efficient BetterHomesandGardens wife. True, Conrad has had his share of pits and savage gods. Eight months before the opening of Ordinary People, he has attempted suicide by literally attacking himself with a razor blade, and he has spent the interim confined in a mental institution. But all that is past, the stuff of nightmares. What Mrs. Guest's novel focuses on is Conrad's attempts to knit himself back into the fabric of suburban middleAmerican life. And to judge from what Conrad goes through in the process, we might as well all of us have been mad at once time or another.",1976-07-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Film on Black Baseball Is a 'Bingo',"The time is 1939. Hitler is moving into Czechoslovakia and making plans to invade Poland. A man in a contemporary newsreel amuses us by eating razor blades. The same newsreel takes us to Yankee Stadium to watch an all-star Negro baseball game.This is the preface to the genial, slapdash, high-spirited and occasionally moving comedy called ""The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings,"" about a barnstorming black baseball team in those long-ago, pre-Jackie Robinson days before the major-league ball clubs admitted black players.The film, which opened yesterday at five theaters in New York, stars Billy Dee Williams as Bingo Long, the flashiest pitcher in the entire Negro National League, and James Earl Jones as Leon Carter, the catcher with whom Bingo forms his own ball club when it becomes apparent that the owners (black) of the Negro teams are the new slave masters.For a comedy whose principal mission is to entertain, ""The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars"" also manages to provoke a lot of more sober, subsidiary responses that, happily, never get in the way of the show. The film was written by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins (who wrote ""Sugarland Express""), based on a novel by William Brashler and directed by John Badham, whose earlier credits are in television. It moves in fits and starts of exposition and action, dipping into melodrama from time to time as well as into farce, as it traces the rise and fall and rise of the Bingo Long All-Stars on their travels through the Middle West and South.The team is a smashing success until the owners of the Negro National League teams put pressure on the owners of the local stadiums not to book the Bingo Long group. This forces the All-Stars to seek games with white teams, which, in turn, makes it necessary for the black barnstormers to adapt themselves to the fantasies of the predominantly white audiences.The All-Stars are required to ""shine,"" to become clowns, in order to reassure the white audiences that they know their places. Bingo at one point pitches a game wearing a gorilla suit. At the same time, though, the black players are dazzling their audiences with extraordinary skills that laughter cannot obscure.Shining, Bingo says in effect, is simply performance, or theater, or show business. It's a mask. Where Robert Altman's ""Buffalo Bill and The Indians"" uses show business as a metaphor for American life, ""The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars"" acknowledges show business to have been one of the practical means of black survival.The large, virtually all-black cast is fine, particularly Mr. Williams, Mr. Jones and Richard Pryor, who plays a ballplayer who schemes to get into the major leagues, first as a Cuban, then as an American Indian. Ted Ross, who won a ""Tony"" for his performance in ""The Wiz"" on Broadway, is very funny as the most villainous of the ball-club owners, and Stan Shaw is winning, literally, as the Bingo Long rookie, who, at long last, breaks the color barrier in the white leagues.""The Bingo Long All-Stars"" has been rated PG. The film includes one razor-cutting scene, which is not funny at all, and a riotous sequence in a whorehouse, which is.",1976-07-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen:Huge Creatures Roam in 'Food of the Gods',"On a remote island in Puget Sound, a substance that looks like pancake batter begins to ooze from the earth and not long afterward local animals and insects are growing as big as all outdoors. Chickens stand six-feet tall in their bare claws. Bees grow to the size of turkey buzzards, while rats as large as lions roam the woods, eating everything in sight, including farmers and Volkswagens.What all this has to do with ecology is never made clear, but the ads for ""The Food of the Gods,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama 1 and other theaters, ask ominously, ""Has nature finally rebelled?"" The answer, I think, is no, but it may be putting us on. Certainly the movie is.""The Food of the Gods"" is a stunningly ridiculous mixture of science-fiction and horror-film clichs, and it's said to be ""based on a portion of the H. G. Wells novel"" which I've never read. It prattles pieties about clean environment (which would seem to be no big problem in the film's island setting), but it's devoted mostly to showing us Man in the siege of Hollywood Special Effects, though not very good ones.When the giant rats attack a farmhouse, it's a teeny-tiny miniature farmhouse, and when Marjoe Gortner, the hero of the film, meets them face to face, it's via a split screen, or dummy-rats. There's very little excitement, but quite a few laughs, all provided by the dialogue contributed by Bert I. Gordon, who wrote the screenplay and then produced and directed it. Ida Lupino and Ralph Meeker are among those he conned into appearing in it.The film has been rated PG, which may be just as well, though it gives the film credit for being scarier than it ever succeeds in being.",1976-07-17T05:00:00+0000

It's the medium.The messageor messages, reallyare suitable for the young audiences that can be expected to turn out for ""Ride a Wild Pony"": respect for the law; facing up, rather than running off.But the medium turns out to be a fundamentally uneventful and somewhat padded story, set in a small Australian community in the days between world wars, that leads up to a legal contest between a poor boy and a rich but handicapped girl over ownership of a pony.It may be to the credit of the film makers that neither of the children is sugarcoated. In fact, neither is especially likable. Some children are like that.But, as a result, it is difficult to care which of the two winds up with the pony and even more difficult to find much suspense in the film's climax. In fact, toward the end some adults might find themseves hoping the horse will declare a pox on both youngsters.Determined editing might reduce this film to a length appropriate to television, where its essential dullness might be less noticeable. Otherwise, only those youngsters afflicted with rapture at the merest glimpse of horseflesh are likely to mistake ""Ride a Wild Pony"" for an absorbing movie.",1976-07-17T05:00:00+0000

The Horatio Hornblower novels of C. S.

That these stories are all pretty much the same hardly matters to those of us who love them. The first Forester novel I read was Ship of the Line.

The treatment can be made only during a very few days in early April when the buds are just opening.

In a commendably straightforward prose, the authors lay out the verified facts concerning one of the greatest unexplained mysteries known to science: the awesome explosion that took place over the basin of the Stony Tunguska River in the desolate wastes of Central Siberia at approximately 7:17 A.M. local time on June 30, 1903. Although the site of the explosion was (fortunately) sparsely inhabited, there were numerous witnesses to its impact. A gigantic pillar of fire was visible to startled Siberians in towns several hundred miles away; the heat was so intense that people shielded their faces from the blast 40 miles away; seismographs around the world trembled; and a few hours later weather stations in England registered unusual fluctuations in barometric pressure. At the site itself, enormous trees were either uprooted or stripped bare of branches and left standing like so many forlorn telegraph poles. Almost as remarkable as the blast itself is the fact that Russian scientists did not visit the remote site until 1927. For many years thereafter, it was assumed that the destruction was caused by a giant meteorite; but no fragments were ever found and there is not the slightest sign of an impact crater. (The famous Meteor Crater in the Arizona desert, known to have been formed 10,000 years ago, is threequarters of a mile wide and 570 feet deep.)",1976-07-18T05:00:00+0000

But, far from getting high on success, the 53yearold Catalonian musician finds it all puzzling, even a little frightening. A small, neat person, outwardly prim and serene, she reveals herself on longer acquaintance to be a turbulent woman given to wide swings in mood, going from girlish gaiety at one meeting to brooding introspection at the next. And, in the latter mood. Miss de Larrocha can turn almost melancholy in contemplating the music world's current Alicia craze.

When his books made money, he gave a lot of it away. He lived for 47 of his 66 years in one of the grandest and most beautiful of Oxford colleges. As a professional logician and mathematician, he was good enough to earn praise from Bertrand Russell. He had firm friends among the best English painters and writers of his day, and he adored acting, actors and actresses: few men can have seen so many bad plays for pleasure. He was a pioneer photographer in the days when it seems to have been almost impossible to take a bad photograph, so rich was the potential of the medium. With almost no apparent effort he wrote, under the name of Lewis Carroll, two booksAlice's Adventures in Wonderland and Alice Through the LookingGlasswhich have given innocent and lifelong pleasure to millions of people in a total of 48 languages.

us,"Screen: 'My Friends,' Italian Comedy:4 Middle-Aged Men in the Provinces Outrageous Practical Jokes in a Parable","Their lives are going nowhere except into loveless middle age. Mascetti (Ugo Tognazzi) has gone through two fortunes (his wife's and his own) and makes a living of sorts in the door-to-door selling of encyclopedias. Melandri (Gastone Moshin) is an architect of no great promise. Perozzi (Philippe Noiret), separated from his wife and father of a maddeningly fastidious son (the sort of fellow who puts a tarpaulin over his car at night), is a crime reporter, a job he's had too long, and Necchi (Duilio Del Prete) runs the local bar where the friends hang out.Their lives are going nowhere but does it really matter? That's the question that is answered in sometimes uproariously funny terms in ""My Friends,"" a new Italian comedy that was directed by Mario Monicelli (""Big Deal on Madonna Street"") after the death of Pietro Germi (""DivorceItalian Style."" ""Seduced and Abandoned""), who had collaborated on the screenplay and prepared the production for filming.""My Friends,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Playhouse, is a cross between Claude Sautet's ""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others"" and Federico Fellini's ""I Vitelloni."" It's a film about supportive male friendship, set in the Italian provinces, and though the milieu is bleak, the comedy is blithe.Singly, each of the men is a failure, with the possible exception of the bar owner, whose life is simply boring. Together, on their occasional ""gypsy"" outings, they discover a sense of camaraderie that becomes purpose. The friends, who've grown up together and know each other so well they can communicate virtually without talking, devote themselves to the outrageous practical joke.Sometimes the joke is not elaborate, only a trip to the station where they have a high old time with the passengers on a train just as it's pulling out. The passengers can't respondthe train is carrying them off at mounting speedand though it's never stated, it may be that in this particular joke, the four friends are doing to strangers what life has done to them. It's as if each man were trying to deal with a mysterious, totally inexplicable slap in the face.Sometimes the jokes are terribly elaborate, as when they execute a series of complex charades for the benefit of a stingy old pensioner (Bernard Blier), who believes that the four friends are members of a Mafia drug-selling ring. At least once the joke backfires with curious results.When Melandri, the architect, thinks he has fallen madly in love with the wife of a local doctor, the friends court her for him with obscene telephone calls that are enormously successful. Melandri wins the wife, as well as her two children, the governess and a giant dog, while the doctor (Adolfo Celi) does not lose a wife, he gains four lunatic friends. It turns out that he is their soul brother.Before someone writes in to note that ""My Friends"" appears to take a pretty dim view of women, I should say that may be true, except that isn't the point of the film, which, if I understand it correctly, uses provincial Italian manners to illustrate a parable about self-realization.The four friends of ""My Friends"" achieve this only in the company of one another, and always in the performance of the practical joke that is the metaphor of the movie. Having said this, I'm afraid that I've made ""My Friends"" sound lugubrious. It isn't. Its method is marvelously comic and the mood gallant.In addition to the actors, who are superb, the film features several performances of equal exuberance by actresses, especially by Angela Goodwin, who plays Mascetti's pretty young mistress, who uses him as he uses her, and Olga Karlatos, as the beauty who is so successfully wooed by telephone.""My Friends,"" which carries a PG rating, contains one quick scene of female nudity and a scatological joke that is among the funniest things in the film.",1976-07-19T05:00:00+0000

What, it asks, would you do if you were a fine, strong, healthy, handsome Santa Monica lifeguard who finds himself over the hill at the age of 32? Take a job selling Porsches? Stay on with the Parks Department? Shoot yourself?Only people bred in California could examine this problem in such solemn detail without cracking up, which may be one of the reasons why California fascinates us, and why we sit through a movie as witless as ""Lifeguard"" experiencing both helpless laughter and undisguised envy. California weather really is great. The beaches are spectacular, the people apparently all beautiful, and sex is everywhere.The only problem is age, an issue that ""Lifeguard"" faces unflinchingly. Aging lifeguards are suspectto themselves as well as to other peoplein the California youth culture. Should they be put to sleep? Should they be sent to rehabilitation camps in Nebraska to learn a new trade? Should they be allowed to stay on the job as long as they can perform their duties? Should they be treated with the same respect given 22-year-olds?The movie that opened yesterday at Loews State I and other theaters doesn't mince words. It is the most prolifeguard film ever made.""Lifeguard"" looks to be two different movies at the same time. The one directed by Daniel Petrie means to be about freedom and self-realization, while the one written by Ron Koslow and acted by Sam Elliott is about vanity, narcissism.Quite early in the film, which spends one summer on the Santa Monica sands, Rick Carlson (Mr. Elliott), the lifeguard of the title, is told by one of the young women in his life that though he is great in bed ""technically,"" he doesn't feel anything. This bit of analysis is confirmed by the lifeguard's mannerisms and decisions during the rest of the movie, and explains the unintentional laugh that greets his statement that he likes winter duty at the beach best because it gives him time to think.Thinking would be a totally alien activity to the character written by Mr. Koslow and acted by Mr. Elliott who, consciously or not, moves through the moviethrough affairs with a sweet beach-groupie (Kathleen Quinlan) and with a former highschool sweetheart (Anne Archer)with all of the intellectual and emotional sensitivity of a man holding up a pack of cigarettes in a Marlboro ad.That Mr. Elliott looks like a successful male model also has the effect of undermining any urgency we may be expected to feel on behalf of the character. After all, if he can't cut it on the beach any longer, he can always go out and make television commercials.As a film, ""Lifeguard"" is romantic twaddle, but as sociology it's a spontaneous assault on a very American way of life. People smile a lot, even when they have nothing to smile about. Characters drive to places to commit suicide in expensive sports cars. The interior decoration is the sort that makes every house and apartment look like a motel room. If people read, you know it's TV Guide.Since I doubt that ""Lifeguard"" was intended as sociology, one must consider it as entertainment, and as entertainment it ranks somewhat above ""Bikini Beach"" but below ""Godzilla Versus Megalon.""The film has been rated PG. It hasn't a thought in its head, but there are some nudity and rough language, as well as one very ornate love scene photographed in such close-ups that the audience must guess whether a mound of flesh is an elbow, a hip, a nose or a breast. I still don't know.",1976-07-24T05:00:00+0000

So, of course, was the designated President, Jimthy Carter. And there was a silly 16 minutes of Edward Asher impersonating Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley. That the quality of the movies left almost everything to be deairedthey were really commercials for the self, and not very, adroit onesis beside the point. The point is that when they came on the lights in Madison Square Garden were turned off, and the networks were helpless. All those electronic floor reporters; those space cadets with their Captain Video headsets, trying to storm the Winter Palace of Amy Carter's ennui, were blotted out, disenfranchised, unplugged and debugged. They needed light in order to interrupt the business of the convention, and for as long as the movies chose to run, there would he no light. Imagine the frustration, the panic, in Kansas City if the Republicans learn this lesson and act accordingly: w,hy not film the nominating and seconding speeches in advance, and the platform debate? Why not a visual essay on Ronald Reagan's pomade; clips of an unflinching President Ford, the height of the Mayaguez crisis, facing down the armed might of Cambodia; home movies of Julie Eisenhower tapdancing and John Connally being acquitted and Nelson RoCkefeller higuying ten thousands of his most faithful retainers, his Fido Ronans, in a bomb shelter underneath the Albany Mall?

He conquers women (bus drivers, receptionists, sales clerks, family guidance counselors) not because he's especially drawn to them, but because something will have been left unproven if he doesn't.Jean-Charles Tacchella's completely approving new French comedy, ""Cousin, Cousine,"" which opened yesterday at the Paris Theater, is the story of the growth of the love between Ludovic and Marthe, who are first thrown together at a wedding when Pascal, who can't stop himself, and Karine, who is bored, go off for a quick assignation in the bushes. Ludovic accepts his wife's behavior without panic. Marthe locks up her feeling.Some weeks later, long after Pascal and Karine have forgotten their brief affair, Ludovic and Marthe meet again at a family funeral. On the way to the cemetery, Ludovic and Marthe establish their first intimacy. While the new widow sits in the front of the bus weeping and the other members of the funeral party stifle yawns, Ludovic and Marthe sit together in the rear, humming cheerfully and making tentative gestures toward an understanding that will eventually split their two marriages.""Cousin, Cousine,"" which I believe is the first film by Mr. Tacchella to be released in this country, and which was awarded the Prix Delluc in France, is an exceptionally winning, wittily detailed comedy that is as much about family relationships as it is about love.Both Marthe and Ludovic belong to large, affectionate families that are infinitely patient and flexible in coping with temporary lapses in behavior, be it a loss of temper, a fit of falling-down drunkenness or blatant adultery.At first Ludovic and Marthe meet in secret, being amused by the thought that although their relationship is platonic, no one would believe it. Their mates become worried. Pascal, for whom infidelity is serious self-expression, makes a big point in renouncing all his mistresses. When he breaks with the bus driver, she insults him in the worst way she knowsshe makes him get off the bus between designated stops. Karine firmly decides that she will again be amusing.But it's too late, and since everyone believes them to be lovers already, Ludovic and Marthe oblige.In a rather startling way, no one seems to get seriously hurt in this film, even though there are deaths and profound disappointments, not because Mr. Tacchella takes a superficially rosy view of things, but because, with the help of his actors, he creates a group of characters who appear either to have inner resources or, like Karine, to be too self-absorbed to feel anything too deeply.Miss Barrault, who is the niece of Jean-Louis; Miss Pisier, Mr. Lanoux and Mr. Marchand are very good company, especially when they are misbehaving.

What he didn't mention, of course, is that if he were an Olympic athlete from some other countries, he presumably would not have dared to talk like that.

us,Daughters of Eve at the Oars,"MONTREAL, July 26The ancient Greeks held the body beautiful in high esteem, yet a curious Puritan ethic prevailed at Olympia. Because athletes in the Olympic Games wore only the uniform they were born in, women were barred as spectators and if one of the sisterhood was caught peeking she was dropped off the nearest cliff. There was one notable exception in 404 B.C. A wealthy widow from Rhodes disguised herself as a trainer to watch her son box, and when the kid won she went into such transports of delight that somebody recognized her. Out of respect for her father, brothers and son, all Olympic winners, she was allowed to live, but thereafter trainers were required to work naked like the competitors. It is no news to Gloria Steinem or Elizabeth Ray that things have changed for the daughters of Eve. Not only do the likes of Nadia Comaneci, Princess Anne and Shirley Babashoff ornament the Olympics these days, but for the first time since Helen of Troy strayed from the fireside, women competed here in basketball and rowing.

His unselfish style is almost invisible, but when the 9574 victory over Yugoslavia was completed last night, Quinn Buckner was more visible as he smiled and danced a hugaloo near midcourt with the basketball his arms. In each of the six victories, his initials identified his role. He didn't score that many points but he directed the offense. And when the United States needed points, he often supplied them. He played tough defense. He did the small things that a leader doespatting a teammate on the rump, extending hand to help a teammate up from the floor. When not the game, unaccustomed as he is to heing on the bench, he preferred to stand and exhort his teammates. He was called an amazing player by Dean Smith, the American coach.

us,"Screen: Beached 'Swashbuckler""","THE time is 1718. The place is the island of Jamaica. It is a day of incredible, luminous clarity. In the courtyards of the British fort overlooking the sea an execution by hanging is being prepared. A junior officer sees an ominous spar on the horizon, but his commander won't hear of interruptions. The chaplain coughs. ""I find no prayer for a pirate,"" he says mildly. ""The closest I came is something by Peter for fishermen. . . .""Before the hanging can take place, the ominous spar on the horizon turns out to be the pirate ship Blarney Cock, under the command of Capt. Ned Lynch who has come to cheat the noose of the life of his associate, Nick Debrett. There is a pitched battle, Nick escapes, and the new pirate adventure, ""Swashbuckler,"" should be off and running. It's not. It's off and sinking.The film, which opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, has hardly anything to recommend it unless, like me, you'll put up with all sorts of gaffes for even the dimmest recollection of a kind of fiction that once made childhood tolerable.""Swashbuckler,"" which was directed by James Goldstone and written by Jeffrey Bloom, was photographed largely around Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on land and seascapes of storybook beauty. Doubling as the Blarney Cock is an exquisitely lovely reproduction of Sir Francis Drake's ship, the Golden Hind, and the cast includes Robert Shaw, James Earl Jones, Genevieve Bujold, Beau Bridges and Peter Boyle, all people of proven talents. Yet the movie is such a mess you might suspect it was tacked together by nearsighted seamstresses.The screenplay is full of lines that either are arch (""A pirate in love is like a fish out of water"") or are failed anachronisms (""We're pirates, Ned, not revolutionaries."" ""Pirates  revolutionarieswe're all men""). Worse, though, is a plot that is skimpy on incident, acted by people who have been mostly miscast.As the pirate captain, Mr. Shaw, a good character actor, works extremely hard to create a figure of romantic dash but produces only sweat. He'd have been much better as the wicked governor, a role played by Peter Boyle, who might possibly have been more convincing as an eccentric deckhand than as an effete fellow who takes hot tubs with his lute player (male).Genevieve Bujold is charming as the swordswomandaughter of a man wrongly imprisoned by the governor, but it's a very, very silly role. Mr. Jones is also wasted as Captain Lynch's best pal. Mr. Jones is a star and looks foolish in what is essentially the Alan Hale part. But then Beau Bridges is also a star, and he's on screen for less time than the opening credits.A strong director might have imposed some order on the project, but Mr. Goldstone is not such a person. ""Swashbuckler"" seems to want to be high adventure, but it has no cohesive style, no exuberance. It looks like slogging, joyless hard work.""Swashbuckler"" has been rated PG, in recognition, I suppose, of a couple of scenes in a busy whorehouse and the dopey reference to the governor's homosexuality, which this mindless film equates with political corruption.",1976-07-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Movie:'Drum' Opens at Loew's State 1,"There's more hot air than steam in the overwrought melodrama of ""Drum,"" the sequel to the financially successful ""Mandingo"" that opened yesterday at the Loew's State 1 and Orpheum Theaters. Life at Falconhurst, the Louisiana slave-breeding plantation introduced in the first film, is just as riotously unpredictable as it was when ""Mandingo"" ended with the plantation master being shot and his best slave being boiled in oil.Some years have now passed and the late master's son, Hammond Maxwell (Warren Oates), is running the business as usual, sleeping with pretty slave girls, while his teenage daughter skips through the honeysuckle making indecent proposals to the male slaves, including Drum, played by Ken Norton, who appeared in ""Mandingo"" as a different character.Mr. Norton is a fine figure of a man, but no actor. He walks through the film with the gait of a football star coming off the field after a very long game. He can hear the roar of the crowd that we can't. This seeming lack of interest in anyone except himself doesn't help the melodrama, in which Drum is supposed to be a sort of black Joseph Andrews, a young man of such perfection that both men and women (including his white mom) can't keep their hands off him. Vanity is a far cry from innocence  a small point that isn't understood by people who make exploitation junk like this.Kyle Onstott's original novel was adapted for the screen by Norman Wexler and directed by Steve Carver, who may be a bad director or may simply be defeated by material that could only be contained in grand opera. Life on the old plantation was horrendous, I agree, but movies like this are less interested in information than titillation, which, in turn, reflects contemorary obsessions rather more than historical truths.Not since ""Mandingo"" have I seen a film so concerned with such methods of humiliation as beating, shooting and castration.Among the people in the film who don't look totally ridiculous are Mr. Oates; Fiona Lewis, who plays the fiancee he found in a whorehouse, and Pam Grier, who plays a stunningly beautiful slave woman.",1976-07-31T05:00:00+0000

The electricity pouring into the ground stirs up the local worms, who, shocked and angry, come forth by the millions to eat people. The question asked by ""Squirm"" is not who will survive, but will anyone?The film, written and directed by Jeff Lieberman, has two decent performances by John Scardino and Patricia Pearcy and some effectively revolting moments when it deals with real worms photographed in close-up. It sort of goes to pieces, though, in its spectacle scenes.
