Some of the Star-K certified beef is U.S.D.A. Prime grade. The companys founder, Elliot Moskowitz, a financier, saw that for kosher meat there was no equivalent to high-end companies like Snake River Farms or Pat LaFrieda selling directly to consumers. So he stepped in. The prime tomahawk steak ($130), once seared, then finished in a slow oven, was quite tender and had rich flavor. At around 40 ounces, it serves two to four. The choice grade tomahawk is $100. There are also short ribs, rib steaks and roasts, prime or choice, as well as lamb and veal. The meats are shipped frozen. ",2022-04-04T16:21:39+0000

He chops one down and carries it back to the clearing. He repeats this action until he has assembled a pile of timber. We watch as he demolishes his old, thatched workshop and builds a new one, twice the size. The man does not explain what he is doing as he frames the structure or as he thatches the roof with palm fronds and vines; in fact, he doesnt talk at all. If you turn on the closed captioning, you can see descriptions of his actions, but only very general ones: lashing rafters, putting rafters in place, etc. There is no music.

A decade or so ago, three political scientists at Northwestern University, Benjamin Page, Jason Seawright and Matthew Lacombe, set out to determine the impact that superrich Americans have on congressional and presidential policies. They werent starting from scratch; previous work done by another political scientist, Martin Gilens, used years of surveys of thousands of poor, middle-income and affluent Americans to show that policymakers responded almost exclusively to the preferences of that last group.

The lease I signed stated that base rent was $4,800, but I was being given a concession. Worried that rents might rise, I negotiated a rider limiting my rent increase to $200, and when my lease ended, my landlord offered me a new one for $4,000 a month. But after I did some research, I learned that the apartment is actually rent stabilized, so rent increases should be limited to the amount set by the city. But the landlord says that my base rent is $4,800, describing my lower payment as a concession. Is this correct or can I challenge it?",2022-04-09T14:00:05+0000

In theory, such so-called brain-wide association studies could yield incredibly valuable insights. Knowing that a particular neurological feature makes someone more vulnerable to autism, Alzheimers or another disorder, for example, could help predict, prevent or treat that condition. Likewise, if we can link certain features to desirable traits, like academic achievement, it might be possible to take advantage of that knowledge.",2022-04-19T09:00:18+0000

us,"KYU, an Eclectic Miami Transplant, Opens in NoHo","Reversing a trend, a Miami restaurant is opening in New York. Since 2016, KYU (pronounced cue), in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami, has been a destination, offering an eclectic, strongly Asian-leaning menu of often wood-fired specialties served in a high-decibel industrial setting. Appetites are vigorously satisfied; creature comforts less so. In New York, there are touches of luxury in the generous space that housed Bobby Flays Gato, with dramatic lighting and a glittering sweep of brass mesh to set off the lounge area. Alan Omsky and Jordan Sayfie, the founders, have joined with an English hospitality company, Reuben Brothers, for this expansion of the brand. (Theres already an offshoot in Mexico City, and other locations are in the pipeline.) Its signature is Japanese yakiniku grilling, which will be handled in an open kitchen with a chefs table by Chris Arellanes, who worked at Per Se and Eleven Madison Park. Smoked Wagyu brisket, whole roasted cauliflower, six-hour smoked short ribs and a towering coconut cake are coming to New York, along with a newly conceived wood-fired bass with fermented brussels sprouts and dashi, and charred sunchokes with Parmesan cream and togarashi lime. The restaurants Miami cocktails, like the Wynwood Mule made with house-smoked pineapple, and the spicy shiso sour fueled with Thai chile tincture, are also traveling north.

One is a matter of carriage. Carmichael is a stand-up comedian. But all he does in this new show is sit. The opening long shot follows him in the snow, headed toward the Blue Note, where he removes his coat and hat and promptly takes a seat upon the stage before a modest, expectant, engaged gathering of what Carmichael wants to feel is a family and what I can only call community support, because winter isnt all he braves.

That Fuels the Lefts Cancel Culture.,"Growing up in the 1970s, one got a good snootful of what today might be wrongly described as critical race theory: The film Sounder, in the wake of a prominent novel, offered a searing depiction of sharecropping. The made-for-TV epic The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman, also based on a novel, took us through a sweep of history from slavery to segregation. The Roots mini-series, watched by millions (all at the same time, in a way thats probably hard to imagine for those too young to remember life before D.V.R.s), portrayed the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation barbarity in a way American audiences hadnt seen. As Charlayne Hunter-Gault reported for The Times in 1977, a Black economist in Philadelphia said, It has made the brutality of slavery more vivid for me than anything Ive seen or read. To refresh a sense of what an event Roots was at the time, recall that the cast included some of the biggest names of the day, including John Amos, Lloyd Bridges and Sandy Duncan.

us,Poem: Going Going Gone,"This poem in translation is surreal in its depiction of grief. It has a recurring image of a bird thats a figure for death and grief after the loss of the poets father. Don Mee Chois translation of the poem captures the eternal void of grief. Repetition mimics griefs insistence: Bird cuts me out in the first and third stanzas, I exit throughout and I take a step toward where I dont exist, which is repeated twice near the end of the poem. The poems form shows how grief changes within stasis. The second and fourth stanzas echo but swerve, until we get the callback and negation in the final stanza: Bird doesnt cut me out. The final line, Behind the wall Im on standby forever, channels the energy of a lyric poem, a sense of running in place. Selected by Victoria Chang",2022-04-21T09:00:26+0000

I couldnt get my moms hopes up like that. So I just didnt tell anybody. The only person who knew was Liz Caplan, whos been my voice teacher for nearly a decade.

When I was in grad school at Yale, I focused primarily on printmaking. And Id gotten a lot of success out of that, but there were also limitations.

It was all about speed, touch, timing. Its difficult to be precise. When I first started doing these one-brushstroke paintings, if I didnt like what Id done, Id get down on my hands and knees with a can of mineral spirits and a bunch of rags and wipe it off.
