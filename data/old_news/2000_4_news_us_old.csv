Even with only piano, bass and drums, his arranger's hand was heavy, and listening to his small output on the Blue Note and Bethlehem labels you feel that a superior talent wasn't properly used: he could have found his Xanadu with a five- or six-man group.",2000-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; The Treatment,"Richard Rushfield's scabrously funny first novel, ON SPEC (St. Martin's, $21.95), is a cautionary tale about Hollywood and a contemporary take on a morality play, or rather, script. ''Don't Put Your Daughter on the Stage, Mrs. Worthington,'' and if she dreams of using an Ivy League degree to become a development girl on the way to producing films, read this first. Rushfield's book is not much longer than a script, and it is structured as entries from the diaries, letters and memos of six characters -- a D-girl, an agent, a writer, a studio head, a producer and a bimbo. The story begins, as all such tales do, with a high-concept film proposal. Stu Bluminvitz, a Reed College grad and all around schlep who lives with his parents in Hollywood, is looking for a buyer for ''Kennel Break,'' his ''Tarantino meets 'Turner and Hooch' spec'' in which he tries to ''take a reverential approach toward kitsch.'' Deana Cohen (who went to Brown) shares her dreams of power and marriage in a ''nightly development-support group conference call,'' except when she gets a better offer. Todd Hirtley (who attended Penn) is by his own dictated account a member of a ''party-boy agenting juggernaut.'' He tells his assistant that ''history will want to study'' the way he sells a script. At a communications workshop at the Celebrity Center, Chelsea Starlot remembers ''being the sole object of lust for a tiny Indiana town'' and latches onto something like Scientology, more coke and an aging producer -- a winning combination. Eric Whitfield is the energetic if dimwitted producer who dreams of putting it all together with Jerry, who runs the Japanese-owned Hotatsi Studios. Rushfield, who writes the ''Intelligence Report'' column in Vanity Fair and is a partner in Agent X, a trend-spotting company, has complete command of his intricate plot, in which tinsel rises to the top.

The first two changes were no doubt to accommodate the casting of the Chicago native John Cusack; the last you can speculate about on your own. Otherwise, much remains the same. Rob is still the owner of a marginally failing vintage record shop, still called Championship Vinyl, which is still manned by ''the musical moron twins,'' Dick and Barry; he is still moping about his love life, especially his recent dumping by his girlfriend, Laura; and he is still the gloomy underachiever whose relentless navel-gazing is made palatable by his honesty about his shortcomings and his often quite funny insights about men, women and romance.

A son was exactly what she didn't want; and she hoped and prayed to anyone who was listening that her child would be born a girl. She declared the date of my birth the happiest day of her life because she got exactly what she had requested: a girl. However, sometimes it is thought that she asked too much or prayed too hard for a daughter -- I grew to be so much of a stereotypical girl that I was unrecognizable to my bold mother . . . . When she was a toddler, my sister's curly brown hair was cut short and my mother always dressed her in OshKosh B'Gosh corduroy overalls -- usually navy blue, just like my mother's outfits. Even though I worshiped my big sister, I wouldn't dream of wearing her filthy hand-me-downs. Not me, the Princess. Blue was definitely not an accepted part of my two-year-old wardrobe. My outfits were arranged in red and pink. Pink was the most precious thing on earth, and any object colored with it was beautiful, especially my clothing. A dress covering my little body put a smile on my face and turned me into this gorgeous celebrity that would sing and dance around the slippery living room floor in socks until she collapsed from exhaustion. . . .",2000-04-02T05:00:00+0000

In 1997, he set up the Blanche and Julian Robertson Family Foundation with $18 million, about half in cash, the other half in his hedge fund. ''Our success depends in part on its success,'' said Federal District Court Judge Bill Kluttz, the foundation board president, after hearing of the planned shutdown. But as Judge Kluttz said, even a somewhat reduced foundation would have a great impact on a town of 25,000. It has already given nearly $3.5 million to education, neighborhood revitalization, youth health and community planning. DEAN SMITH",2000-04-02T05:00:00+0000

To keep apace, clothing manufacturers are creating yoga collections. Next month, the model Christy Turlington, with Puma Sport, will introduce Nuala, above, a line of soft neutral pants, shirts and hoodies designed for yoga use ($60 to $110). Zen Sport by Danskin offers knit drawstring pants ($78), tanks ($56) and waffle shorts ($52), all at Saks Fifth Avenue. J. Crew has stretchy yoga pants ($48), bras ($24) and sleeveless tops called Om shells ($28). The Jivamukti center and Equinox Fitness Clubs are selling their own yoga lines (popular at Equinox are $28 shirts silk-screened with Chinese characters that translate as ''energy, harmony, Equinox'').

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Snapshots of a Nation,"Ambitious, intellectual and prickly, Walker Evans (1903-75) was driven to stake out territory not already claimed by Stieglitz and Steichen, the two reigning American photographers in the early 1930's. The goal Evans set himself was to tell the truth, and for him the truth resided in the unvarnished ordinary. Like many artists from a privileged background before and since, he searched for authenticity among the urban working class and the rural poor and in the commonplace, man-made landscape -- buildings, signs, storefronts. He created a photographic style that gave the illusion of objectivity and, as proof of his success in elevating the status of the documentary photograph, the Museum of Modern Art chose him as the first photographer to have a solo exhibit, in 1938. In 1994 the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the entire Evans collection, an unmined trove of papers, personal memorabilia and disintegrating negatives. Five years of sifting, sorting, conserving, printing, researching, writing, organizing and fund-raising have resulted in a notable archive, a major exhibition and a masterly catalog, WALKER EVANS (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton University, $65). Maria Morris Hambourg, Jeff L. Rosenheim, Douglas Eklund and Mia Fineman, curators and scholars from the museum, have contributed the book's six learned and lucid essays, which focus on Evans's artistic development and distinct phases of his work as well as his lesser-known photographs. The rich reproductions show the range of Evans's work, while the essays provide context for his achievements and, by showing his influence on leading members of the next generation like Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander, establish Evans's seminal importance in the evolution of the documentary photograph. UNCLASSIFIED: A Walker Evans Anthology (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Scalo, $39.95), a further collaboration of Rosenheim and Eklund, gives a more intimate look at the Evans archive with reproductions from the photographer's family albums, contact sheets, correspondence and working notes.

The film won awards for best picture, Kevin Spacey's lead performance, for the first-time director Sam Mendes, for the veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and for the first-time screenwriter Alan Ball. Many thought it would also win best actress for Annette Bening, but that award went to a relative newcomer, Hilary Swank, for her widely praised performance in ''Boys Don't Cry.'' The film that was expected to give ''American Beauty'' its biggest competition, Lasse Hallstrom's ''The Cider House Rules,'' came away with two awards, for Michael Caine's supporting performance and for John Irving's adapted screenplay.

It's an important site, partly because of the architecture and partly because of the layers of historical meaning that have settled over it. The building became eligible for landmark status in 1990. Should it be landmarked? Probably not. Which isn't to say the building isn't worthy of landmark designation. In my view, it should be the other way around.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  ENGLISH, PAUL WARD","ENGLISH-Paul Ward. Professor and former chairman of the Geography Department at the University of Texas, died on March 30 in Austin at age 64. He first joined the UT faculty in 1963 and over the years served the University in several capacities. From 1973 to 1979 he was Director of the distinguished UT Center of Middle Eastern Studies, and Professor English had earlier established his reputation as an expert on Iran and Afghanistan. His 1966 book, ''City and Village in Iran,'' won the Herfurth Award, and in 1977, at the age of only 41, he was given a Golden Medallion for ''outstanding contributions to Iranian geography'' by the Association of Iranian Geographers. He was also an extraordinary and charismatic teacher. His introductory course in world cultural/regional geography, which he taught at UT for 35 years, became legendary among UT undergraduates. Innovatively taught, with abundant visual and auditory aids, the course was the subject of an article in ''Alcalde,'' the UT alumni magazine, as early as 1968 and was instrumental in Dr. English being named one of the most outstanding college teachers in America by ''Change'' magazine in 1978. Each semester saw hundreds of UT students enrolled in this class. Its legacy lives on as part of their education and in two widely used textbooks, at the college and high school levels. Upperclass and graduate students perhaps treasure most highly his seminar in the Geography of Religion, a course that many found truly inspirational. Paul also helped launch the Oxford Summer Program in Geography, in which UT undergraduates and graduate teaching assistants spent six weeks exploring the wonders of England. Paul was a frequent participant in this program and was particularly drawn to Glastonbury, where his Celtic spiritual heritage remains so pervasive. Born February 20, 1936, in Worcester, Massachusetts, Paul was an unreconstructed Irish Catholic Yankee. In mindset and dialect, he remained true to this heritage and was totally impervious to the regional Texan culture. He sounded like a Boston Kennedy and played touch football with the same reckless abandon. His parents, Mary (nee Riley) and James (''Mickey'') English, preceded him in death, as did his dear young daughter, Elisabeth Ann. Paul received a bachelor's degree from Clark University in his native Worcester-an institution most famous for its geography program, a master's degree from Johns Hopkins University, and his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. We will sorely miss his wit, intellect, and expertise; his personal magnetism, friendship, loyalty, and tolerance; the twinkle in his Irish eyes. Paul is survived by two sons, Dr. Paul Ward English II, with wife Leslie, of Houston and Dr. Peter Herbert English of Washington, DC, by two grandchildren, Ava Elaine and Paul III, and by his loving devoted fiancee, Annie Delano, whose constant presence and care comforted Paul in his final month and eased his passage. Annie, we, his family and friends, consider you one of us and will always be grateful. You are a true angel of mercy. Paul's numerous friends and colleagues attended a visitation at Weed-Corley-Fish Funeral Home, Saturday evening, April 1, 2000. On Sunday, Paul was returned to his native land for burial in that mystical place he loved best, Cape Cod. Rest well, you happy pilgrim.

It's about time. An elegant 19th-century building that was clumsily refaced in 1980 with a brutalist ''Bladerunner'' reflective metal facade, right, not to mention an exterior waterfall splashing into a pile of artistic rubble, Drouot Richelieu is arguably the ugliest building in the city. ''It is not very fashionable, too much like the 70's,'' said Virginie Burnet, a Drouot spokeswoman. Nor very pleasing to visit. Mr. Wilmotte and the project architects, Fabrice Drain and Astrid Courtois, will streamline the warren of cramped escalators, hard-to-find entrances and sales rooms clad in grimy red and orange velvet. (The team's sleekly hip design, below, won a Drouot-sponsored contest; the grand-luxe decorator Jacques Garcia came in second.)

But the action, such as it is, is largely interior; ''Joe Gould's Secret'' is sometimes called a ''writer's book,'' and not without reason: it's a story that in part is about writing, a theme whose track record up on the screen is not terribly encouraging.

So hard that they are not only bidding up prices way beyond what was originally asked, they are paying those extra hundreds of thousands of dollars for houses only to tear them down as fast as they can and start over. ''I've heard of a one-acre lot in Atherton that went up for sale on a Saturday as a $3 million tear-down -- and sold for $7 million on Sunday,'' says Tom Quaglia, a real estate developer based in San Jose. Demolition plans are under way. Last year, nearly 10 percent of the 1.3 million single-family home starts nationwide were begun on lots recently cleared of existing houses, according to estimates from the National Association of Home Builders. Mark Calabria, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors, says that two factors are behind tear-downs, or scrapers: a shortage of large houses and the renewed appeal of older, first-generation suburbs where little open land remains. Calabria highlights California as a prime example: ''It's such a tight market, and there's such huge demand, you can't find lots there. The markets are crazy. And suddenly it makes a lot more sense to tear down: you've already got a site that has infrastructure, and it's easier to get a permit.'' Barring a stock market correction, says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the California Association of Realtors, scraping ''looks like a trend that will only accelerate.''",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

But scorched-earth satires like ''Welcome to the Dollhouse'' and ''The Ice Storm'' have burned that image away. Today, Hollywood sends out the message that perversity lurks behind every picket fence, that split-levels are really prison cells. How well does the suburbia that is portrayed on screen (or on the printed page) match up with reality? To explore the connection between suburban life and art, we set up a conversation between six creative minds whose work tackles the world of subdivisions and strip malls. Our panel included Alan Ball, a screenwriter whose script for ''American Beauty'' won an Oscar for best original screenplay; Gregory Crewdson, a photographer whose show ''Twilight'' recently appeared at the Luhring Augustine gallery in New York; A.M. Homes, a writer whose latest novel is ''Music for Torching''; Tamara Jenkins, a filmmaker who wrote and directed ''The Slums of Beverly Hills''; Eric Mendelsohn, the director and writer of ''Judy Berlin''; and David Schisgall, the director of the documentary ''The Lifestyle.''",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

But in an unexpected counter trend, the latest fund-raising reports show that the mayor has raised far more money than the first lady.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Procreation Anxiety,"It was bound to happen. The 30-ish heroines of all those I-Must-Have-a-Man books would grow a bit older and decide they must have babies. Enter Ellen Franck, the 35-year-old narrator of Laura Zigman's second novel, DATING BIG BIRD (Dial, $22.95). Ellen is funny, smart and successful, in a particularly Manhattan sort of way, and she excels in (but hates) her high-profile fashion industry job. She could slip right into the cast of ''Sex and the City'' and kvetch with the best of them. Ellen is an older version of Jane Goodall, the protagonist of Zigman's first novel, ''Animal Husbandry.'' The only difference is that while Jane was obsessed with finding a man, Ellen, her biological alarm clock ringing, has to have a baby. The other women in her life are all procreating like mad. Alas, the once-famous writer she is involved still suffers from the pain of his own child's death and can't imagine having another one. ''My vision had never included a baby,'' Ellen insists. ''It took until I grew tired of myself . . . until the nights became too quiet and too lonely to bear.'' Zigman indulges tired female stereotypes, portraying Ellen and her childless friend Amy as perhaps too desperate. (Amy even stops using birth control to trap her boyfriend into having a baby.) The story picks up when Ellen finally decides to have a child on her own, trolling through sperm-donor biographies with her humor in tow. Ellen is undeniably likable, and she'd be fun to have drinks with. Unfortunately, her likability can't save her from becoming a caricature. Lori Leibovich",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Made completely of 10-gauge stainless steel, inside and out -- grill head, cart, sidebar shelves that a set of chubby twins could sit on. Beneath the cover, I've got a porcelain-mesh infrared rotisserie and two heavyweight cast-iron burners that blow 50,000 B.T.U.'s. Oh yes, this is a gas machine. On a hot July night with the knobs maxxed out I think I can almost reach fission. Some grill, you say. Though you, of course, believe in the flavor of charcoal, you believe in the ancient rites of the fire, you believe in the waiting and the sometime heartbreak and you believe in nature and the fates. All this is mature, and good. But out here, on the wide, rectangular pad of my driveway, on the knife edge of these taintless streets, I favor the dream of mastery. I like rolling my grill to the cool of the grass, as far out as the orange extension cord will run, which snakes from inside the garage to the plug end of the rotisserie motor. I like having a couple of trussed chickens fixed on the spit, their skins paprika-rubbed and lumpy beneath with garlic cloves and veins of rosemary. I like reaching underneath and releasing the valve of the propane tank -- I've got another in the shed, full and ready, because you run out only when you're grilling -- and then flipping the spark igniter, which never works the first time or the second and so makes you cringe, anticipating the basso whoomp of the burn. I like waiting there, nearby, however long, taking an 8-iron to the patches of crab grass, gathering the overripe tomatoes, sipping my near-frozen-cold can of Old Milwaukee, until Michelle calls out from the side door, Are we ready? And I lift the cover, the birds crackling and the barrage of smoke sweet enough to breathe, breathe in deep, though I can't, and I can only whisper, Oh yeah we're ready, we're ready.",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

The case has been cited in other New Jersey cases and has been used nationally in cases charging discrimination against deaf people, according to Clara Smit, who represented teh couple in the Newark suit.

I invented some of them: that the suburbs literally shrivel the brain, for example. I also know that suburbs have become aluminum-sided theme parks -- celebrations of sameness -- and that nowhere else on earth can you find architecture of such awfulness and pretension. ''Get me out of here!'' I used to announce periodically when the children were small. ''I can't last a minute longer.'' My wife and I would look through the Manhattan real estate ads, in search of some steerage-size apartment that might fit our budget. Then we'd factor in the cost of private schools and of an occasional weekend trip, because we thought we deserved to see grass and trees at least once in a while, and even before we totaled it all up, I'd slink off, my heat spent.

us,COMMUTERS' REFUNDS,"New Jersey residents who work in New York City won a court battle early last week when a New York State Court of Appeals declared the commuter tax imposed on out-of-state residents as unconstitutional. The 240,000 New Jersey commuters then got an added bonus Wednesday when New York said it would immediately refund the tax money rather than make people wait until tax returns are filed next year. Refund forms for the money paid in so far this year will be mailed to commuters over the next several weeks, said Marc Carey, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. For the tax paid from July 1, 1999, to Dec. 31, 1999, those who have not yet filed their 1999 tax returns can change the amount due. Those who have already filed their returns can file an amendment. Instructions will be available by calling (800) 225-5829ok (CALL-TAX) or at the Web site, www.tax.state.ny.usa. The tax has been in effect since 1966, when it was imposed on New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island and other New York State residents who worked in New York City. But the New York Legislature amended the law in June 1999 exempting Long Island and other New York State residents, which prompted a suit by New Jersey and Connecticut on the ground that the tax could not be selectively imposed. The court upheld that argument, and refunds are retroactive to the time the change was made last year. KAREN DeMASTERS",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

I was working for a BBC arts program, which was doing a segment on the controversy surounding the novel, and heard the producer in charge exclaiming that the book was vile and should not have been published. I found out later she had not read it. Curious, I bought a copy and began reading it on the subway, braving the horrified glances of other passengers. Nothing I had read about the controversy prepared me for what kind of book it was. The story of Patrick Bateman, a status-obsessed Wall Street executive who commits frenzied murders in his spare time, was not a slasher novel. It was a surreal satire, and although many scenes were excruciatingly violent, it was clearly intended as a critique of male misogyny, not an endorsement of it.",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

He and his wife, Jeanmarie, his high school sweetheart (they both graduated from Columbia High in 1954) had four healthy children, three boys and a girl, ages 5 to 12.

French soldiers bulldozing corpses of refugees in the Congo (then called Zaire); Bosnians ritually washing their dead in the shadows of their mosque; an impossibly emaciated, naked Sudanese man crawling into an emergency-relief tent; the headless Rwandan torso of a little girl still wearing a flowery sundress; a family of ''untouchables'' in India prepare their evening meal by cooking skewered rats on an open flame -- it seems unimaginable to absorb these horrifying images. Nachtwey's eye is impeccable, but photo after photo of misery quickly becomes numbing. Maybe that is the point of this war photographer, who, he notes, would rather be considered an ''antiwar'' photographer. Lance Gould",2000-04-09T05:00:00+0000

She is hailed as ''first in beauty, wisdom and accessories'' by a handmaiden, and her big production number about clothes (''I would rather wear a barrel,'' she belts, ''than conservative apparel'') is capped by a runway show with hats to rival Philip Treacy's and gowns that make John Galliano's look puritanical.

Her family surrounded her at her home at 12305 S.W. 73rd Avenue, in Miami, as her life ended. She was a lady of class. Graham filled her life and those around her with beauty, dignity, grace and love. A stunningly beautiful woman, Graham's optimistic humility inspired whomever her life touched to feel warm and good about themselves. She never disrespected anyone for any reason including race, religion, disability, sex or economic status. Graham also excelled in matters of the intellect. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College on a full academic scholarship with highest honors. She remained a thorough scholar, researcher, editor and reader throughout her life. Graham had a ''green thumb.'' Every plant she touched thrived and in her last days, she lay outside on her patio enveloped by brilliantly colored orchids of her own creation. The late United States Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, her father-in-law, adored Graham. She is survived by her husband of 53 years, Hugo L. Black, Jr., a veteran Miami trial attorney; their three children and spouses: Elizabeth Black and spouse Peter Goodfellow of Auckland, New Zealand; Margaret Black and spouse John Gallardo of Los Angeles, California, and Hugo Black III and wife Jeannine Crowell Black of Miami. She is also survived by her brothers, Richard R. G. Hobson of Alexandria, Virginia, and Archer Hobson of Staunton, Virginia, and the 11 children of her late brother Edwin Hobson of Rye, New Hampshire. Graham was a founder of Saint Andrews Episcopal Church at the corner of Old Cutler Road and Mitchell Drive in Miami and took much pride in her service on the Landscaping Committee that wove the church and its buldings into a natural and spiritual setting. Graham was a member of the Royal Palm Tennis Club, the patrons of the Museum of Natural Science, the South Florida Orchid Society, Coral Pines Garden Club, Fairchild Tropical Gardens, St. Andrews Book Club, the Tropical Fruit Society and the Villagers.

''Massimo never does a single object, but starts far away from it, making a lot of drawings of an environment the object might belong to,'' she said. For instance, when he was asked to design a new subway station for the Kropcke stop, above, in Hanover, Germany, he first invented a host city for the station: a futuristic urban landscape that he drew, then converted (via computer) to wall-size glass mosaic murals in light greens and yellows. He updated the station, designed in harsh 70's concrete, with four subfloors joining 10 subway lines with the main train station, in time for Expo 2000, the World's Fair that opens in Hanover on June 1. To further uplift the station, Mr. Iosa Ghini bounced light off ceilings, calmed the acoustics, improved maintenance (consulting with the cleaning company), gave the floors more friction and designed aluminum furniture and fittings to look dynamic.",2000-04-13T05:00:00+0000

His character, Henry, is a convicted bank robber whose salad days are behind him, and you can't look at him without thinking of the end of ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' where he played a good-natured rogue who outlived his usefulness.

Paul Rosengren, a spokesman for the utility, said the bids ''were not reflective of the market value'' of the parcel that includes a soon-to-be-replaced substation serving downtown, Pennsylvania Station and the river. The property is practically in the path of the proposed Joseph G. Minish Riverfront Park, a ribbon of green that is to run two miles along the river's edge amid envisioned new office and other commercial uses. The bids that the utility rejected came from the Millenium Group, which envisioned developing a 300-room hotel there and the Newark Economic Development Corporation, which also proposed a hotel and apartments on the site just southeast of the city's New Jersey Performing Arts Center.

At breakfast recently at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles, Poitier consumed an omelet made of egg whites, to avoid cholesterol, and a side dish of broccoli, in keeping with his habit of eating vegetables at every meal.

It is almost a century old, and its heavy columns and doorways and row upon row of unlighted windows extend along the riverbank for hundreds of yards. From a distance, it might be an abandoned palace or an emptied party headquarters in Eastern Europe; up close, there is dust on glass doors and piles of debris in hallways. Here and there, rooms are occupied: by a shop selling soccer memorabilia, a Marriott hotel, a busy riverside McDonald's. But the refurbishments feel thin, temporary. And along two sides of the building, more carefully drawn than the corporate logos, is a message from the past in carved gold capital letters. ''County Hall,'' it reads.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Hard and the Soft,"Best known for lavish sculptures that fuse fiber and bronze, Barbara Chase-Riboud has pursued an artistic career that spans three decades. Her production ranges from intimate works to grand public projects. In BARBARA CHASE-RIBOUD: Sculptor (Abrams, $39.95), Peter Selz and Anthony F. Janson examine the various sources of her work, including archaeology, classicism, baroque Rome, African and Egyptian culture, spiritualism, Surrealism, modern sculpture and the artist's own life. While Selz, an emeritus professor of art history at the University of California, Berkeley, traces Chase-Riboud's precocious beginnings and sculptural evolution, Janson, an art historian, focuses on her ''Monument Drawings,'' a series of large-scale works dedicated to diverse literary and historical figures from Pushkin to the Queen of Sheba. Chase-Riboud is shown to be a great reconciler who deftly merges opposites in her work, a goal that the artist set for herself early on: to make art that ''unites opposing forces -- male/female, negative/positive, black/white.'' The authors also seek to establish links between Chase-Riboud's literary and visual production, and her writing and poetry are interspersed throughout the book. The eloquence of Chase-Riboud's own words underlines the rather prosaic quality of the main texts, which do not share the finesse and complexity of the artist's work. The book is nonetheless valuable for its wealth of images and as a general introduction to Chase-Riboud's socially engaged and sensually satisfying art. Suzanne Ramljak",2000-04-16T05:00:00+0000

It soon became a Mecca for book pilgrims and the curious, even a national institution, with its own literary festival.

She was the most devoted, loving, caring wife, mother, daughter, ''nonni'' and friend. Her heart was full of love for so many people. One of her legacies was that she got great joy in bringing happiness to other people. She valued the happiness of the people she loved above her own. She had a joy of life that was unique. She saw each day as an adventure, filled with great promise and joy. Her bubbly effervescence was infectious. She entered a room with a sense of fun and exuberance. She lit up the lives of all the people she ever touched. She was such a sensitive person that, in her entire life, she never intentionally, every wanted to do or say anything that would hurt another person. We shared a love that we called ''our secret''. We felt that no other person could understand that two people could love so completely. She was a success at everything she did in her life. She enjoyed every stage of her life. She was a very successful actress, tennis player, real estate agent, but her greatest accomplishment was that she was the most wonderful, loving and devoted wife and mother. She leaves behind three wonderful sons who she poured love into and who will carry her in their hearts forever. I have been blessed to be able to share my life with someone who has brought me more happiness than I ever knew could exist. She loved her three wonderful grandchildren with all her heart. She only regretted that she wouldn't be here to share their lives. She was so thankful that her sons' wives became such wonderful, loving daughters. The moral of her life was to give and receive love freely and to make the most of every day as she did-Lynne, I love you, my wonderful soulmate.",2000-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Children's Books; Monkey Business,"''Caps! Caps for sale!'' Baby boomers remember that popular refrain from the classic children's book ''Caps for Sale,'' the 1947 version by Esphyr Slobodkina. Based on a folk tale, that much loved and best-selling book tells the story of a distinctly Slavic hat peddler who finds his wares stolen by a treeful of devilishly naughty monkeys. In his new book, The Hatseller and the Monkeys (Scholastic, $15.95; ages 3 and up), Baba Wague Diakite has returned this simple story to its African roots. Diakite, who was born and raised in a small village in Mali, recalls hearing the story of BaMusa and the monkeys as a boy. In this version, the hat seller, BaMusa, is a peddler who traverses the countryside, his head piled high with wide-brimmed dibiri hats and closefitting fugulan caps. The progeny of a long line of hat sellers, the joyful BaMusa sings ''Hee manun nin koi kadi sa'' (''What a wonderful business hat selling is'') as he walks from town to town. One day, rushing off to a festival, BaMusa skips breakfast. Hungry and tired, he stops to nap under a tree, and while he is sleeping, mischievous monkeys steal his hats. But it isn't until BaMusa fills his stomach with mangoes the monkeys have thrown at him that he is able to outsmart them and get his hats back. The moral of the story: it is with a full stomach that one thinks best. As he did in his earlier book, ''The Hunterman and the Crocodile,'' Diakite has beautifully illustrated ''The Hatseller and the Monkeys'' with vivid, African-inspired ceramic-tile paintings. Each double-page spread is completely framed by a black-and-white frieze of playful monkeys linked tail to tail, adding energy and wit to the colorful, detailed illustrations and text. A word of advice for parents and other adult narrators: Before you read this book aloud to your children, go through it once without a young audience. Otherwise you may find yourself stumbling over some of the tongue-twisting West African speech sprinkled throughout. And check the author's note for help pronouncing BaMusa's song, which you may want to sing yourself. ''Hee manun'' is both ''an expression of joy and a plea for help.''

The debate shows no signs of ending any time soon. Last month, Vanity Fair published a long, passionate defense of Kubrick, and in particular of his widely unloved last work, by his friend and sometime collaborator Michael Herr. And beginning Friday, Film Forum will provide fuel for many nights of heated cafe-table contention as it mounts a three-week retrospective of the director's work, ranging from the limpid black-and-white of ''Killer's Kiss'' to the deep red of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' -- from Kirk Douglas to Jack Nicholson to Tom Cruise.",2000-04-16T05:00:00+0000

In winter, fresh air is pumped to the ranger station at the entrance, so bad is the pollution there.

us,Books in Brief: Poetry; Arriving Inside the Object,"In SELECTED EARLY POEMS (Braziller, $22), an expanded and revised edition of his ''Selected Poems, 1963-1983,'' Charles Simic shows that he is among the very few poets for whom surrealism is a genuine vision, a tool of discovery, rather than a collection of arbitrary shocks. Like the ''explorers'' in his poem of that name, who ''arrive inside / The object'' as ''The lamps they carry / Cast their shadows / Back into their own minds,'' his skewed vision manages both to capture the alien concreteness of things and to make them reflect his own consciousness. In a series of early poems, an ordinary ''old spoon'' is seen ''Ready to scratch / Today's date / And your name / On the bare wall''; a fork ''resembles a bird's foot / Worn around the cannibal's neck.'' Sometimes this vision turns into black comedy, as in ''Bedtime Story'': ''When a tree falls in a forest / And there's no one around / To hear the sound, the poor owls / Have to do all the thinking. / They think so hard they fall off / Their perch and are eaten by ants, / Who, as you already know, all look like / Little Black Riding Hoods.'' And when Simic, who was a child in Yugoslavia during World War II, recalls the horrors he saw there, his hard, plain style and dark vision are both explained and confirmed: ''I'm told but do not believe / that that summer I witnessed / men hung from telephone poles.'' His skill and sure instinct make this book one of the important poetic achievements of our time. Adam Kirsch",2000-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Lost World,"When the New York Yiddish newspaper The Jewish Daily Forward published Alter Kacyzne's photographs of shtetl life from Europe in the 1920's, he fought with the editors over money and expenses. No one knew this work would be his final legacy. POYLN: Jewish Life in the Old Country (Metropolitan/Holt, $50) includes about 150 of Kacyzne's exquisitely detailed, haunting black-and-white portraits of the lost world of Polish Jews at the rustic shops, town halls and synagogues where they toiled and prayed. Born Alter-Sholem Kacyzne in 1885 to a poor family of laborers, he went to work as a photographer's apprentice when his father died. Following his mentor, the famous Yiddish writer I. L. Peretz, to Warsaw, Kacyzne became a poet, playwright and well-known photojournalist in Poland, at the time the home of three million Jews. For The Forward he took photographs in 120 locations, from the crowded quarters of Warsaw to the barren countryside. Kacyzne was killed in a pogrom on July 7, 1941, in Tarnopol (now Ternopil, Ukraine). His wife, Khana Khachanov, died in the Belzec death camp. Only their daughter, Sulamita, survived -- along with 700 photographs from which this selection was made. It restores Kacyzne's original, idiosyncratic captions; for example, under a photograph of an intense-looking Hebrew teacher wearing a black hat, Kacyzne wrote: ''More than once his students have nailed his beard -- the longest in Byale -- to the table when he has dozed off. Perhaps that's why he has such wonderful, sad eyes.'' Susan Shapiro",2000-04-23T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Natvig began his career with Citibank as a 15 year old office boy in 1931 in New York City and retired in 1976 as a Vice President of one of the world's largest banks. He attended Brooklyn College at night for seven years graduating Summa Cum Laude. During World War II he served in the U.S. Army. In the early 1950's he joined Citibank's Comptroller's Domestic Inspection Division and within a few years moved to International Inspection, where he was to spend the remainder of his banking career. During that period he traveled around the world nearly 50 times. During his tenure in the Comptroller's Division, Mr. Natvig was regarded by many as the bank's foremost expert on Foreign Exchange. In addition to being instrumental in establishing Citibank branches around the world, he created and maintained the Inspector's Handbook, which reportedly was considered of incalculable value to the Inspection effort throughout Citibank's International Operations. After his retirement Mr. Natvig remained with Citibank in an advisory capacity for five years working in Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, Canada and the Caribbean. Mr. Natvig leaves two sisters, Ruth Halstead of New Port Richey and Joan Shuman, of Centerville, Massachusetts; four nieces and two nephews; 10 great nieces and nephews.

Born in Madrid, Spain, Luly received her master's degree in physical chemistry from the University of Madrid and studied at Oxford University and the University of Geneva. Continuing her education in the U.S. Luly attended Harvard University and met her husband while attending Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. She performed research in the field of molten salts using nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry at the University of Virginia from 1964-1966. She and her family moved to New York in 1969. From 1977 to 1987 Luly taught Spanish grammar and literature at the Brearley School. Luly was a fixture on the Upper East Side, well known by many for her beloved Labrador Retrievers: Powhattan, Amelia and Augusta, who she enjoyed walking daily. She was involved in student affairs at the Collegiate, St. Bernard's and Brearley Schools, which her children attended. Nothing gave her more pleasure than the children's summer swimming races at the Lawrence Beach Club on Atlantic Beach, Long Island. As the family grew and children moved from home, Luly was instrumental in gathering every member, including additions through marriages and births, for memorable birthdays and holidays at a country home in Oxford, Maryland. Luly was proud of her heritage. Her Spanish family was instrumental in advancing education for women. Her grandfather founded the first co-ed, non-sectarian private school in Spain in the 1920's. Luly's parents were both Olympic athletes in the Republic of Spain in the 1930's. Luly shared their love for the mountains and skiing, a passion she continued to pursue with her husband and children. Her favorite family destination for over 20 years was the pistes in Klosters, Switzerland. Luly was known for her Castillian determination and her contagious smile that inspired everyone around her. She was loved by many and will be missed all the more. Luly is survived by her husband, Donald McLean Wilkinson, her children Donald McLean Wilkinson III and his wife, Lauren Doyle Wilkinson, of Manhattan, Duncan Austin Wilkinson of Arlington, Virginia, Charles Carroll Wilkinson of Dallas, Texas, and Margot Carolina Wilkinson Kaye and her husband Jason Philip Kaye of Fort Collins, Colorado, and her grandchildren Donald McLean Wilkinson IV and Ian James Wilkinson of Manhattan.

''My sex life is pathetic,'' Mr. Barman announces at the record's outset. ''That's why I fantasize in four out of five songs.'' The first of those songs, ''The Joy of Your World,'' sets the tone.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; The Terrain of Memory,"The rough landscape of northern Ontario takes on universal dimensions in SUMMER GONE (Crown, $23), David Macfarlane's expertly controlled first novel. A divorced magazine editor in Toronto named Bay Newling heads north with his 12-year-old son into the territory of summer memory. On a canoe trip together, Bay reaches back to his own youthful confusion and tells his resistant son about the woodsy metaphysics of a boys' camp he attended in 1964. Gently, as with a fine ghost story, Bay's complicated past is lived and relived from different points on a shadowy timeline. The pain of lost innocence ripples through this remarkable novel. A lone instance of infidelity troubles the middle-aged protagonist in ways that illustrate the price of lust, and the eroding splendor of the Canadian wilderness reflects the greed of reckless developers. Yet the book wears its themes lightly. Macfarlane animates ''Summer Gone'' with exacting descriptions of natural life (''branches as fine and dark as cracks in old china''). The novel's language -- perfectly tuned to guilt, responsibility and transcendence -- evokes the freshwater lakes and rivers that the characters navigate. Stories-within-stories gather force like tributaries. Finishing ''Summer Gone'' leaves the reader with a sense of loss -- not only the loss that inheres in Bay Newling's quiet tragedy, but the loss of the narrator's good company upon reaching the final page.

Age 61, died peacefully April 21 at her home in Manhattan of breast cancer, which she had been fighting for the last two years. Born in Madrid, Spain, Luly received her master's degree in physical chemistry from the University of Madrid and studied at Oxford University and the University of Geneva. Continuing her education in the U.S. Luly attended Harvard University and met her husband while attending Mary Baldwin College in Virginia. She performed research in the field of molten salts using nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry at the University of Virginia from 1964-1966. She and her family moved to New York in 1969. From 1977 to 1987 Luly taught Spanish grammar and literature at the Brearley School. Luly was a fixture on the Upper East Side, well known by many for her beloved Labrador Retrievers: Powhattan, Amelia and Augusta, who she enjoyed walking daily. She was involved in student affairs at the Collegiate, St. Bernard's and Brearley Schools, which her children attended. Nothing gave her more pleasure than the children's summer swimming races at the Lawrence Beach Club on Atlantic Beach, Long Island. As the family grew and children moved from home, Luly was instrumental in gathering every member, including additions through marriages and births, for memorable birthdays and holidays at a country home in Oxford, Maryland. Luly was proud of her heritage. Her Spanish family was instrumental in advancing education for women. Her grandfather founded the first co-ed, non-sectarian private school in Spain in the 1920's. Luly's parents were both Olympic athletes in the Republic of Spain in the 1930's. Luly shared their love for the mountains and skiing, a passion she continued to pursue with her husband and children. Her favorite family destination for over 20 years was the pistes in Klosters, Switzerland. Luly was known for her Castillian determination and her contagious smile that inspired everyone around her. She was loved by many and will be missed all the more. Luly is survived by her husband, Donald McLean Wilkinson, her children Donald McLean Wilkinson III and his wife, Lauren Doyle Wilkinson, of Manhattan, Duncan Austin Wilkinson of Arlington, Virginia, Charles Carroll Wilkinson of Dallas, Texas, and Margot Carolina Wilkinson Kaye and her husband Jason Philip Kaye of Fort Collins, Colorado, and her grandchildren Donald McLean Wilkinson IV and Ian James Wilkinson of Manhattan.

He produced thousands of educational videos during some forty-five years of helping the family's MDA serves-many of which were featured on and contributed to the success of the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. For decades, Jerry traveled the country each year to create the Telethon profiles of families served by MDA that brought an intimate, warmly human dimension to MDA's appeals. Many of his profiles were so powerful that pledge phones from coast to coast were jammed following their airing. Similarly, Jerry created for MDA some of the most impactful TV public service announcements ever seen, and educational video material that informed physicians and their patients alike, and inspired tremendous volunteer support of MDA throughout the nation. Jerry's indefatigable creative genius has immeasurabely advanced the battle against neuromuscular diseases. Millions affected by these progressive disorders worldwide are in his debt. Jerry's unparalleled productions played a key role in MDA being honored by the American Medical Association with a Lifetime Achievement Award ''for significant and lasting contributions to the health and welfare of humanity''.

An honorary director at the time of his death, Robert joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Association as a managing director in 1976. He has left a legacy of more than three decades of dedicated service, as vice president from 1991-1999, as a long-time member of the executive committee, as chairman of the production and art committees, and through service on the nominating committee. We recall with admiration Robert's prodigious knowledge of opera, theater, and contemporary art. These passionate interests were evident in his continual efforts to preserve the Met's heritage through his work with our archives, in his family's support for our pioneering production of Berg's ''Lulu,'' and in his own support for an all-Stravinsky evening designed by David Hockney. Robert's commitment to bringing the contemporary repertory to our stage is also reflected in his leadership gift for our production of ''Porgy and Bess'' and in his underwriting of our commission for Philip Glass's ''The Voyage.'' A founding member, with his beloved mother, Mag Tobin, of our Golden Horseshoe Program, he also gave leadership support to our first endowment campaign and to our current effort to secure the Met in the new century. A memorable presence whenever he was in the opera house, he particularly relished attending opening nights and premieres. We were especially touched this winter when, despite failing health, he remained almost to the conclusion of the supper he gave for the cast and the company after ''The Merry Widow'' premiere. We remember with deep affection Robert's abiding devotion to the Metropolitan Opera, his elegance, his passionate commitment to artistic excellence, his wise counsel during challenging times for our company, and his irreverent wit even in the most dire of personal circumstances. Robert's extraordinary personal courage during his extended period of ill health and his heroic effort to meet his Metropolitan Opera board responsibilities were an inspiration to all of us. Most of all, his passing is a profound loss to those of us who were privileged to know him as a friend. Mrs. Gilbert W.

Mr. Zafian joined Fish & Neave upon his graduation from Columbia Law School in 1948, was Managing Partner from 1970 to 1976 and remained in active practice with the firm until his retirement in 1988. He specialized in patent and related litigation, often of long duration such as the patent and antitrust litigation involving the antibiotic tetracycline in Federal tribunals from the early 1950's into the 1980's, including proceedings in numerous District Courts, the Federal Trade Commission, four U.S. Courts of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. He was born in Bayonne, New Jersey and graduated from high school at age 14. Upon graduating in 1941 from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was employed as an engineer by General Electric Company until, after World War II began, he enlisted in the United States Air Corps where in 1943 he received a degree in meteorology from New York University and thereafter served principally as a reconnaissance meteorology officer, including weather flights in the North Atlantic before D-Day in Europe and service in the first hurricane reconnaissance squadron in the Caribbean. Mr. Zafian is survived by five children: Lisa Weaver of Slingerlands, New York; Tracy Zafian of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Amanda Zafian of New York City; Peter Zafian of Denver, Colorado; and Colin Zafian of Telluride, Colorado; four grandchildren; and a sister, Louise Stone, of Santa Monica, California.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  TOBIN, ROBERT L.B.","TOBIN-Robert L.B. The Metropolitan Opera Association mourns with profound sadness the death of our very dear friend, Robert L. B. Tobin. An honorary director at the time of his death, Robert joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Association as a managing director in 1976. He has left a legacy of more than three decades of dedicated service, as vice president from 1991-1999, as a long-time member of the executive committee, as chairman of the production and art committees, and through service on the nominating committee. We recall with admiration Robert's prodigious knowledge of opera, theater, and contemporary art. These passionate interests were evident in his continual efforts to preserve the Met's heritage through his work with our archives, in his family's support for our pioneering production of Berg's ''Lulu,'' and in his own support for an all-Stravinsky evening designed by David Hockney. Robert's commitment to bringing the contemporary repertory to our stage is also reflected in his leadership gift for our production of ''Porgy and Bess'' and in his underwriting of our commission for Philip Glass's ''The Voyage.'' A founding member, with his beloved mother, Mag Tobin, of our Golden Horseshoe Program, he also gave leadership support to our first endowment campaign and to our current effort to secure the Met in the new century. A memorable presence whenever he was in the opera house, he particularly relished attending opening nights and premieres. We were especially touched this winter when, despite failing health, he remained almost to the conclusion of the supper he gave for the cast and the company after ''The Merry Widow'' premiere. We remember with deep affection Robert's abiding devotion to the Metropolitan Opera, his elegance, his passionate commitment to artistic excellence, his wise counsel during challenging times for our company, and his irreverent wit even in the most dire of personal circumstances. Robert's extraordinary personal courage during his extended period of ill health and his heroic effort to meet his Metropolitan Opera board responsibilities were an inspiration to all of us. Most of all, his passing is a profound loss to those of us who were privileged to know him as a friend. Mrs. Gilbert W.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  BLACK, EUGENE ROBERT","BLACK-Eugene Robert, retired investment banker and longtime playwright, died April 24 at Mount Sinai. A memorial service will be held Sunday, 2pm, Saint Luke's Episcopal Church, East Hampton. Gene, as he was known, was born in Atlanta on July 19, 1924, the son of Eugene R. Black (later president of the World Bank) and Dolly Blalock Black. He got his bachelor's at Yale, served as an officer in the Marine Corps and attended Oxford University after World War II. Gene later worked for Lazard Freres, where he was an international general partner. He effected corporate mergers and acquisitions, helped invest for the firm's own account, managed Eurodollar loan syndications and represented Lazard at international meetings in Washington. He also worked for years in Brazil, advised Japan's Sanwa Bank and served the Carter Administration as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior for Economic Development. Gene devoted great energy to public theater projects. He was at various times chairman of New York's Circle in the Square, chairman of the Mayor's Cultural Committee, chairman of the Mayor's Report on the New York Theater, and a board member of the Lincoln Center Repertory Company and Stratford Shakespeare Theater. Before and after retiring from Lazard he wrote 16 plays, usually under the pen name Franklyn MacGregor. Several plays, including ''Camelot Lost'' and ''The Cleansing of George Cuthbert,'' were produced off Broadway. He also wrote thrillers, screenplays and children's stories. His plots often turned on historical characters and scandals, from George Washington through the Kennedy and Clinton administrations. Gene was a man of huge good humor and zest for life. He seemed to know everybody and enjoyed dealing with people, ideas, food, golf, real estate and more. In addition to his wife, Susanne Hardwick Black, Gene is also survived by his three children, Susan Black Allen of New York, E. Robert Black of Beaufort, North Carolina, and Brittany Black of Palm Beach; two grandchildren, Lindsay and Clayton Allen; his sister Elizabeth Black Campbell; his brother William H.

Mark has photographed runaway street kids in Seattle, prostitutes and pimps in Bombay, inmates of prisons and mental wards -- not with the intent of exploiting these images for their shock value, but to reveal the common spark of humanity that links them to us. In MARY ELLEN MARK: American Odyssey (Aperture, $50), the black-and-white photographs continue to challenge our preconceptions, though her focus is on our country's eccentric as well as its outcasts. Here are photographs of a baby beauty pageant and senior citizens in dance classes, rodeos in Texas, Coney Island bodybuilders and Christian bikers. Images of celebrities abound as well: an aged Henry Miller with a companion, the blues singer Etta James sporting a flamboyant black feather hat. Some of the most poignant photographs are those of the Damm family, homeless when Mark first shot them living in their car in 1987, and again in 1994, squatting on an abandoned ranch. Also haunting are several updated portraits of a woman called Tiny, first photographed in Seattle as a 12-year-old street child, now shown middle-aged and naked in her bathtub, a single mother of five. Unlike Diane Arbus, to whom she has been unjustly compared, Mark emotionally engages her subjects, and through this bond we, as viewers, are drawn in too. Andrea Barnet",2000-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; O'Brian Dry Shod,"In the 1930's, decades before he won fame for his seafaring Aubrey/Maturin series, Patrick O'Brian published two small, entertaining novels. Each is set in Asia, but the land they truly inhabit is that of the imagination. CAESAR: The Life Story of a Panda Leopard (Norton, $21.95) is about a mythical animal who relates his tale with touching simplicity. O'Brian was only 15 when the book was published, but he already possessed an instinct for deft plotting and uncomplicated narrative. Caesar hunts prey, survives attacks in the wild and later lives in captivity with a benign master. His observations are generally limited to what an animal might actually perceive, yet there is never any sentimentality about the natural world. In HUSSEIN: An Entertainment (Norton, $23.95), published eight years later and set in India, nature also challenges the young hero, although human intrigue and emotions seem far more unpredictable and treacherous. Hussein is a young mahout, or elephant trainer, who sets out to make his fortune and to win Sashiya, the woman he loves. With courage, cunning and luck, he eludes everything from wild dogs to assassins, and he cleverly adapts himself to a number of professions, including snake charmer, storyteller and spy. O'Brian times the narrative perfectly; there is barely a moment to catch your breath before Hussein dives into another adventure. Love is treated with dry wit in this novel, and loyalty (man to man, man to elephant) is paramount. Although O'Brian had never been to India at the time he wrote ''Hussein,'' he convincingly conveys a sense of time and place. The pleasure O'Brian himself takes in the storyteller's art is evident in the energy and inventiveness in each of these early novels. Linda Barrett Osborne",2000-04-30T05:00:00+0000

us,The Movie That Created the 'Summer Movie',"TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' created the Summer Movie as we know it: the action-heavy ''thrill ride'' sort of picture, aimed at sensation-hungry younger audiences, which moves into theaters around Memorial Day and remains there, partying hard, until the school year starts up again in September. ''Jaws'' opened on June 20, 1975, and its phenomenal popularity -- it was the first movie to relieve American audiences of more than $100 million of their hard-earned money -- helped turn Hollywood into what is now largely a summer-business town, sort of like Amity, the New England beach resort where the film's dire events take place. Watching the picture today, you might interpret it as a kind of allegory, in which the business community of Amity, refusing to close the beaches after a couple of fatal shark attacks, eerily embodies the ethics and aesthetics of the entertainment industry. The distributors and exhibitors do not shut down the multiplex even when they know that something lethal -- a ''Speed 2,'' a ''Godzilla,'' a ''Wild, Wild West'' -- lurks within.",2000-04-30T05:00:00+0000

This spring, there are new options, including K2's Catalyst (above), a superlightweight skate made of magnesium (at www.k2skates.com, for $249). A K2 size 9 man's skate weighs 3 pounds, 2 ounces, while the average in-line skate of that size in plastic comes closer to four pounds. Besides being easier to carry, lighter skates are supposed to help you skate faster and fatigue slower. Even more convenient are Street Flyers (top right), a combination of street shoe and in-line skate. Street Flyers ($150 at Target and sporting goods stores in Manhattan) have retractable wheels and are designed to allow skaters to walk home or into a store in skate boots (granted, feeling a bit like Herman Munster). Another on-the-move look comes from Samsonite, the rejuvenated luggage company, which introduced its first line of ready-to-wear last year, designed by Neil Barrett, formerly of Prada Sport.

He was born to Margaret Batts and Edgar Gardner Tobin on March 12, 1934. He was named in honor of his grandfather, the distinguished Jurist Judge Robert Lynn Batts, who was the Chief Judge of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Mr. Tobin was educated in the Alamo Heights School District and The University of Texas, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. His father died in a tragic air crash in 1954, and he returned to San Antonio at the age of 19 to set goals and direction for Tobin Surveys, Inc. He built it into the nation's largest and highest quality mapmaker to the oil industry. In addition to his business interests, in his twenties he became president of the Children's Service Bureau. He shared his mother's enthusiasm for history preservation and combined the two by placing welfare agencies in historical buildings. He also became production coordinator for the annual opera in San Antonio where he learned the repertory and came to know the luminaries of the musical world through the years as he worked as a stage-hand and carried the prestigious gold card of honorary membership in the local. He became a member of the Board of Directors of The Metropolitan Opera in New York and a member of its Executive Committee, a Vice-President, and Chairman of the Production Committee of The Metropolitan Opera. The same day he accepted the Board membership to The Metropolitan Opera, he was asked to join the Board of Directors of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and became Chairman of its Drawings Committee. After a major operation, he returned to San Antonio and his beloved Oakwell, his principal residence in San Antonio, which was named after his ancestral manse, a fascinating structure which was celebrated by Charlotte Bronte in ''Shirley''. With Oakwell situated on the Salado Creek, he was a descendant of the Canary Islanders, who had used the same water. Although no longer a sheep farm, the farm's role as a planned real estate development community with allegiance to the earth was paramount in Tobin's thinking. To Tobin, there were two major pieces to his life: Oakwell Farms and chairmanship of the Board of the McNay Art Museum. Theater and art have been Robert Tobin's life. A life that he willingly shared with anyone who was willing to look and/or listen. Generous to a fault, Tobin continued the family legacy of leadership and vision in philanthropy and the arts, devoting his energy and resources to philanthropic pursuits and the international arts community. Tobin focused many of such efforts to support and benefit the McNay Art Museum, Metropolitan Opera and Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Santa Fe Opera. He served as a Regent of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. His gifts to the Tobin Collection of Theatre Arts at the McNay Art Museum has made the McNay Art Museum the leading center in the United States for the Exhibition and study of scene and costume design. Of his gift of the Tobin Collection to the McNay, Tobin stated ''Our world is limited only by our imagination, which being quite a lively phenomenon, is a living thing. The collection is not full of 'books and designs' but of 'creations' which fairly cry out to be seen, used, understood, and above all loved.'' For many years, Tobin was listed among America's Top 100 Collectors in Art and Architecture Magazine and in the top 200 collectors in ARTnews. Tobin is survived by his beloved dog, Samantha, and many friends and cousins. A public visitation will be at Oakwell, 3316 Oakwell Court in San Antonio on Wednesday, May 3, 2000, at 5:00 7:00 P.M. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the McNay Art Museum, Interfaith Center of New York, Santa Fe Opera or to a charity of choice. Following the private interment in Sunset Memorial Park, a private memorial will be held at a later date, with the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, Dean Emeritus of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York officiating.

While they were waiting, the novelist's elder son, the film director Tristram Powell, chatted to Dr. Powell about what part of Wales he and his ancestors came from. It was a Powellian moment: unexpected, genealogical, comical, melancholy. Tony Powell died later that night, quietly at a great age (94) after a long period of wandering frailty, surrounded by his two sons and his wife, Violet, to whom he had been married for over 60 years. He left behind him the slightly surprising instructions that his ashes were to be scattered on the lake below the Chantry, his Regency house in Somerset. The fishing syndicate would, however, need to be consulted, since at this season they had a tricky feeding program for the trout.

He was 78 years old and lived in New York City. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. Mr. Zafian joined Fish & Neave upon his graduation from Columbia Law School in 1948, was Managing Partner from 1970 to 1976 and remained in active practice with the firm until his retirement in 1988. He specialized in patent and related litigation, often of long duration such as the patent and antitrust litigation involving the antibiotic tetracycline in Federal tribunals from the early 1950's into the 1980's, including proceedings in numerous District Courts, the Federal Trade Commission, four U.S. Courts of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. He was born in Bayonne, New Jersey and graduated from high school at age 14. Upon graduating in 1941 from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was employed as an engineer by General Electric Company until, after World War II began, he enlisted in the United States Air Corps where in 1943 he received a degree in meteorology from New York University and thereafter served principally as a reconnaissance meteorology officer, including weather flights in the North Atlantic before D-Day in Europe and service in the first hurricane reconnaissance squadron in the Caribbean. Mr. Zafian is survived by five children: Lisa Weaver of Slingerlands, New York; Tracy Zafian of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Amanda Zafian of New York City; Peter Zafian of Denver, Colorado; and Colin Zafian of Telluride, Colorado; four grandchildren; and a sister, Louise Stone, of Santa Monica, California.
