us,The Screen:A Social Satire From Brazil at Modern Art Where Is Daniel Vax ?',"Arnaldo Jabor's Brazilian film, ""All Nudity Shall Be Punished"" (Todo Nudez Sera Castigado), is an exuberant, sometimes slapstick social satire about a rich, self-absorbed, paunchy businessman named Herculano, whose wife has just died, leaving him so despondent he sits all day and night in his underwear, weeping over his fate.This gives a great deal of worry to his ancient maiden aunts and especially to his brother. It interrupts their television viewing, besides which Herculano is their meal ticket. Herculano's 18-year-old son so identifies with his dead mother that, after considering a joint suicide pact with his father, he has sworn him to celibacy for the rest of his life. Clearly, here is a family with problems.For much of the time ""All Nudity Shall Be Punished"" exaggerates and intensifies those problems for very funny and deadly serious effect, especially when Herculano falls madly in love with a whore who makes the one played by Melini Mercouri in ""Never on Sunday"" seem underfed and mean-spirited. Herculano simply must marry her, not only because she demands it but because he requires it. He has hangups.""All Nudity Shall Be Punished"" is a most curious and interesting film. Even when it pulls its punches, you are aware of the wit and the passion of the man who made it. The film was shown yesterday at the Museum of Modern Art in the ""New Directors/New Films"" series, sponsored in association with the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It will be shown again in the museum's auditorium today at 6 P.M.Although the film wouldn't seem to have an obvious political purpose, it's difficult not to associate some of the butts of Mr. Jabor's satire with right-wing military regimes that have been all-powerful in Brazil.It isn't just that the society that Herculano inhabits is inhibited by the past, but that his life and feelings are constantly bent in various directions to deny the truth around him. This is dangerous business, as is a dictatorship that denies a nation's needs. When Herculano finally does marry the whore, beautifully played by an actress named Darlene Gloria, the results are catastrophic.Mr. Jabor's screenplay is based on a play by Nelson Rodrigues, but there is nothing in his direction of the film to suggest its theatrical origins.It is a tumultuous movie, handsomely photographed and set in locations in and around Rio de Janeiro. They do almost as much as the screenplay and the acting to suggest that peculiar mixture of sensuality and repression that marks so much Brazilian life. Herculano's bedroom, where we first see him on his bed of tears and sweat, looks like the inside of an old mahagony armoire, which is no place to live.",1974-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Spirites 'Threee Musketeers' (No. 6),"Richard Lester, the man who gave us ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Help!,"" ""Petulia"" and ""How I Won the War,"" now rips into ""The Three Musketeers"" with such high good spirits that I feel somehow lacking not to be able to respond with the same reckless enthusiasm.The film, which opened yesterday at the Columbia I, the Guild and other theaters, is, according to the records, the sixth to be based on the Alexander Dumas adventure novel. Here they are again: Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who, with the short-tempered D'Artagnan, loyally defend a muddle-headed Louis XIII and his adulterous Queen, Anne of Austria, against what I've always suspected was the perfectly reasonable, statesmanlike treachery of Cardinal Richelieu. Even as a boy I felt that way, which may be why the book was never my favorite.Photographed in Spain, with lots of name-actors showing up in smallish roles (rather like an Oscar show), Mr. Lester's interpretation of ""The Three Musketeers"" looks like an evening in a bump-o-car arena, with magnificently costumed people in place of cars. The adventures are less swashbuckle than slapstick.The narrative, mostly concerned with the efforts of the musketeers to retrieve the Queen's diamonds given to the Duke of Buckingham, moves forward through a series of physical collisions, man with man, man with woman, man with windmill, woman with inkwell.D'Artagnan (Michael York) and Constance (Raquel Welch), the married seamstress he loves, are particularly accident-prone. When D'Artagnan swings on a rope to attack a man on horseback, he lands not on the man but in a puddle. For all his worthy spirit, D'Artagnan is a terrible judge of distances.The three musketeers whom D'Artagnan aspires to join are played by Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlin and Frank Finlay. Boisterously However, it took me almost the entire film to figure out which actor was playing which musketeer. I suppose such identification is not all that important, but the difficulty says something about the screenplay written by George MacDonald Fraser. It's, extremely light on character.Mr. Lester seems almost exclusively concerned with action, preferably comic, and one gets the impression after a while that he and his fencing masters labored too long in choreographing the elaborate duels. They're interesting to watch, though they are without a great deal of spontaneity.Another of the director's fascinations is period detail, which is sometimes more fun than the comic action sequences.The movie is chock-full of research into the ways in which the upper crust of 17th-century France spent its leisure time (in tennis, gambling, falconry and jousting, among other things). Richelieu's dungeons are filled with prisoners enclosed in what look like decorative metal bird cages. While the King and Queen enjoy a country picnic, the court musicians stand apart from them, almost hidden by the high grass, sawing away at their instruments.Some of the other prominent performers in the cast include Charlton Heston as Richelieu, Simon Ward as Buckingham, Jean-Pierre Cassel and Geraldine Chaplin as the King and Queen, and Faye Dunaway as Richelieu's beautiful English spy. Nobody plays it for laughs, which is as it should be.If the story doesn't seem to go anywhere much, it may be because this film is, according to the trade press, just half of the film that was shot. Instead of releasing it as one three-hour movie, the producers decided instead to make it into two. The second part reportedly will be released at the end of the year.",1974-04-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'The Christian Licorice Store',"Every concept of box-office poison admits to exceptions; from ""Gone With the Wind"" to ""M*A*S*H,"" supposedly toxic subjects have yielded hits. And with all respect to the exhibitor who once stated, ""I don't want any more movies where people write with feathers,"" even the currently despised costume picture could have a comeback. But some in Hollywood suspect that sports movies (along with films about writers) rarely do well. ""The Christian Licorice Store,"" which is playing today and tomorrow at the First Avenue Screening Room, offers some clues about potential sports flops.The movie, which was made in 1971 by James Frawley, who later directed ""Kid Blue,"" follows the fortunes of ""the new golden boy of tennis,"" Beau Bridges, all floppy hair and ceaseless smiles. There's no excitement afoot while he smashes his way to victory, because we know we're watching actors and not a real game. So the grunts of effort fail to generate suspense. The camera does all the work; the players aren't athletesit's the movie maker who decides who will lose or win.Admittedly, ""Licorice Store"" has other problems. The tennis star has a soupy sense of alienation and a beautiful, adoring girlfriend (Maud Adams) who was given no character whatsoever. Eventually, he's corrupted by lush offers for hairspray ads and movie roles. Decadence is his destinyas established by a party scene where he strokes two young women (a timid imitation of ""Blow Up"") in a house with an unfilled swimming pool. Empty pools always mean that all's not well in Hollywood.However, one vast, brief pleasure lurks within this picture: a visit with Jean Renoir. He talks about a book he's writing, and says that ""it's going slowlybut I hope safely,"" adding that it's not an autobiography but ""some souvenirs"" from the present and the future, as well as from the past. That glimpse of the great man is worth the movie's oppressively lyrical soundtrack, and a script crammed with lines like ""This is a damn good racket,"" or ""I think the nicest things in life happen when you're naked."" There's also one gallantry that wipes the eye of history: A young woman says, ""I would have loved the thirties,"" and is told, ""The thirties would have loved you.""",1974-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The private colleges' fear of competition from many lowcost public sectors, at a time of decline in the pool of applicants, added an element of acrimony, to the debate.",1974-04-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Canadians Offer 'Ordinary Tenderness':The Cast,"Jacques Leduc's ""Ordinary Tenderness"" (La Tendresse Ordinaire) is a French-Canadian film of complex sweetness, a truly poetic film that describes love entirely in terms of loneliness, friendship, boredom, the anticipation of reunion and the momory of moments of absolutely no apparent importance. The movie was shown yesterday at the Museum of Modern Art in the ""New Directors/New Films,"" series and will be repeated there today at 11 P.M.Unlike most filmmakers who mistake pretty or bizarre images for poetry, Mr. Leduc uses images of sometimes stunning banality to describe the contradictory emotions of Esther and Jocelyn Levesque, the young couple who, in the course of the film, are meeting after a separation of four months. Jocelyn, who has been working in northern Canada, is returning to his home in Quebec by train and car. The move cross-cuts between their separate present states and their memories.The details of the film are as precise as good journalism, but the cumulative effect is as stunning and ambiguous as a nightmare. ""Ordinary Tenderness"" is, in fact, a film editor's dream, being composed of dozens of fragments that have one meaning alone and quite another in their various associations.Mr. Leduc, who is in his early 30's and began his career as a cameraman, seldom traffics in scenery for its own sake. The movie is set mostly insidein cramped kitchens, dining rooms, motel bedrooms and bars, in supermarkets and on trains. Like the early Andy Warhol, but less spectacularly so, Mr. Leduc is fascinated by the smallest, most common gestures, the drinking of a glass of beer or the maneuvering of a shopping cart through a supermarket. The gestures are not ends in themselves. They are the coded messages of lovers and friends.""Ordinary Tenderness"" is quite unlike any movie I've ever seen. I'm not sure it sustains its feature length. Yet it is a courageous attempt to create a narrative of the emotions tied only loosely to events. Conventional narrative cinema works just the other way around.",1974-04-06T05:00:00+0000

So he owned many slaves. One of these slaves, a lovely, almost white, quadroon, Sally Hemings, became at 16 (after Mrs. Jefferson's death) Jefferson's concubine. She eventually bore him five children, four of whom lived, all of whom knew, who their father was.

us,Film: 'Promised Land',"Miguel Littin, writer-director of ""The Promised Land,"" the Chilean entry in the New Directors series shown Saturday and last night at the Museum of Modern Art, states his case against Latin-American oppression with the fervor of an unvanquished revolutionary. But if his love of the land and its enfranchisement is as heartfelt as his impassioned rhetoric, his highly stylized drama is less than convincing in its treatment of the Establishment and foreign exploiters.The 31-year-old movie maker, who completed his film last year when he was still head of the studio that was an official part of the overthrown, left-wing Allende Government, is obviously autobiographical in his treatment of a group of 1930, Depression-afflicted, homeless, wandering peasants who founded and cooperatively worked a village called Palmillo (the director's birthplace).The sweep and the irony of ""The Promised Land"" are fitfully visualized against a colorful background of lush tropical and snow-draped, authentic backgrounds. Mr. Littin's hordes of peasants, led by Nelson Villagra, unsuccessfully attempt to rise against the entrenched capitalists in a neighboring town only to be cut down by the cavalry of another rightist government that has just come into power to thwart their desperate attempt at self-rule.The tragedy of injustice is strikingly apparent, but its impact is lessened by a plethora of loving declamatory scenes and diffuse religious symbolism that tend to confuse, rather than impress, an uninitiated observer. It is easy to feel the irony and reality of the off-screen, narration of the aged peasant who survived doleful things past. The symbolism, however, is still distratcing, and a viewer can't help wonder of the estate owners, businessmen and the religious figures were as one-dimensional as they are depicted to be.Mr. Littin, who is reported living in Mexico, is forthrightly biased, and his peasants and workers look truly confused and driven. But if this anguished outcry against exploitation is unbalanced, it is also a powerful illustration of the talents of a dedicated movie maker.",1974-04-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film of Simon Gray's 'Butley' Is Full of Verbal Wit,"Are masochists more destructive than sadists? (Answers by Friday, 25 words or less.) It's easy to brush off sadists if you don't like them, and they're always terribly dependent on the cooperation of their victims. However, those who pursue pain or punishment are nearly always successful, and they tend to drag their friends or intimates along with them.Of course, the most effective human time-bombs are larded with both ingredients. Alan Bates, in his superb performance in Simon Gray's victim and a helpless mugger ""Butley,"" is both a dangerous  who forces others to abandon him. Few actors can embody that style of paradox. The American Film Theater's presentation of ""Butley,"" directed by Harold Pinter, opened yesterday at selected theaters.The play, which rings with loud echoes of John Osborne's ""Look Back in Anger"" and ""Inadmissible Evidence,"" also recalls the hero of Kingsley Amis's ""Lucky Jim""  the teacher who recoils from teaching, plagued by irksome students who demand to be taught. But while Mr. Osborne and Mr. Amis used their protagonists as part-time social critics, Simon Gray is concerned only with the inner man.""Butley"" focuses on a sizzling depressive who gets ""news of two divorces in the same day"": Both his wife and the man he feels married to are leaving him for someone else. He doesn't seem to care at all about his marriage, and he has no apparent affection for the young man. But he can't stand rejection, ""Butley"" hasn't much emotional depth. However, there's plenty of verbal wit for Mr. Bates to mount and ride on, and the play's energy springs from one-liners, such as ""I'm a one-woman man, and I've had mine, thank God,"" or ""Toadying is the sincerest form of contempt.""Mr. Bates's performance has changed since I saw him on stage in London nearly three years ago. Then, he was all fury and disgust. Here, he has subtly toned himself down for the camera, and the characterization seems to be far more varied. As he sheds the layers of an excruciating hangover, he displaces more and more air  his bulky presence looms with the authority of rage, although he never quite has the total tantrum that we're expecting.The mood keeps shifting, as he chants nursery rhymes, plays interrogator, strums on others' guilts, assumes an elegant upper-class voice to distill his exasperation and luxuriates in confrontation. Coughing hideously, bursting into song, he weaves complex webs of misunderstanding and revels in them.Beaming with malice, he also runs through an anthology of smiles: faint smiles of pain or huge, dimpling flashes that contradict what he's just said; bland smiles to underline an insult; subdued, gleeful smirks as he closes in for the attack; grotesque, challenging grins. Butley is deft at self-mockery, as well as mimicking others. Meanwhile, whatever he feels is apt to be contagious for them. Gradually, he's converted from a giant, cackling gnome to a muted loserbereft because he's driven everyone else away.On stage, Butley's lengthy monologues were hard on other actors; you were aware of their efforts to keep responding while listening. But the camera can rest on his face to an advantage; many of his speeches seem just right for close-ups. On several occasions, Butley makes someone stay and hear him out who longs to escape his office; again, this works well in the movie, as it didn't in the theater.Simon Gray has slightly altered his own text, and it flows smoothly onto film. And Jessica Tandy  crisp and direct, simmering against her will, stern but not grim  Richard O'Callaghan and Michael Byrne are all very fine as Butley's sparring partners. Along with ""The Homecoming"" and ""The Three Sisters,"" this movie represents the American Film Theater's best work so far.",1974-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Black Holiday',"""Black Holiday,"" the Italian feature directed by, Marco Loto that was screened last night and will be repeated tonight as part of the New Directors series at the Museum of Modern Art, Iilluminates a somber past that, like old wounds, is real but has receded beyond pain. The 42-year-old director's concern with the moralities of fascism and antifascism is, in essence, an intellectual drama that disturbs but does not excite an intelligent observer.He focuses basically on a young history professor who refused allegiance to Il Duce's regime in 1931, the carefully bureaucratic police commissioner and the others in the group of Communists, anarchists and apologetic liberals incarcerated under the commissioner's jurisdiction on a small island for their crimes against the fascist state. Their enforced ""holiday"" is relegated largely to an exposition of political credos that still stir the mind and heart, if not, a viewer's pulse.Adalberto Maria Merli is properly introspective as the pedantic professor confused by conflicting viewpoints until he is finally committed to action by unnecessary bloodshed. Adolfo Celi is bland and wily as the commissioner who befriends the professor and even allows him to teach and the added comforts of a villa, his wife, infant daughter and his books in order to stress his seemingly decent stewardship. And John Steiner is forcefully natural as the militant worker-leader of the prisoners who is murdered as a result of the commissioner's discreetly oblique orders.""Black Holiday"" has been photographed in black and white but its divided principals, their emotions and politics are neither black or white nor simple, as the English subtitles help make abundantly clear. The passage of time has dimmed a drama that is sometimes too talkative, but its ideas and people remain vivid and provocative.",1974-04-09T05:00:00+0000

Not the sound of the cheers, or the sound of Henry Aaron saying, I'm thankful to God it's all, over, but the sound of Henry Aaron's bat when it hit the baseball tonight. The sound that's baseball's version of a thunderclap, the sound of a home run, in his case the sound of the 715th home run. The sound momentarily was the only sound in the expectant silence of 53,775 customers at Atlanta Stadium and then, as the sound faded, the ball soared high and deep toward the leftcenterfield fence. And over it. On the infield basepaths, Henry Aaron was trotting now, trotting past Babe Ruth into history in his 21st season. On his first swing in tonight's game; the 40yearold outfielder of the Atlanta Braves had hit another home run, Just as he had hit his recordtying home run on his first swing at Cincinnati in last Thursday's season opener. At home plate, surrounded by an ovation that came down around him as if it were a waterfall of appreciation, he was met by his teammates who attempted to lift him onto their shoulders.

""Thomasine and Bushrod,"" which opened yesterday at the Penthouse Theater and the 86th Street East, is a black Western of considerable freshness, directed by Gordon Parks Jr. It's dated between 1912 and 1915, when a number of black people dwelled throughout the West.Bushrod, (Max Julien, who wrote and co-produced the picture) and Thomasine (Vonetta McGee) live on the lam in the wilderness. Between stickups tnd shootouts, they share many of their spoils with Indians, Mexicans and poor whites, for whom they become folk heroes. Pursued by a fabulously evil white sheriff (George Murdoch), who vows to kill them, Thomasine and Bushrod are both cowboys and Indians, the hunters and the hunted.The movie is somewhat thin on plot, but the script gives some fresh twists to old formulas, especially the sex roles. Thomasine is an independent, feisty woman, who craves equal billing on their WANTED postersand gets it. Bushrod, although lethal to his enemies, is a reluctant outlaw who yearns for another way of life, and he's characterized as a man who's not afraid to be gentle or sensitive. Meanwhile, these lovers fight with gusto. But they're definitely partnersin a way that's rare on screen, or among cow-persons.There are some slow moments, but the picture is carried by the talents of the two performers. Their style is utterly contemporarynot that it really matters. Miss McGee  laughing or raging, reveling in risks  alternates a luxurious cool sass with a rebel's defiance, and Mr. Julien's beguiling humor and flexibility make him all the more formidable when he's behind a gun.",1974-04-11T05:00:00+0000

The prisoners mill around the yard, improvising tents, sleeping, looking uneasily at cameras, which, equipped with telescopic lenses, can see them far more clearly than they can see the cameras.The prisoners at Attica are in the middle of rebellion. They've issued a manifesto demanding reforms dealing with treatment of blacks and Puerto Ricans, with food, medical care, education. Says one prisoner: ""They [the prison authorities] think we're just shucking and jiving."" Says another: ""We're not advocating violence. We're advocating communication and understanding.""Four days after the rebellion began, troopers armed with shotguns and rifles, some using dum-dum bullets, stormed the walk to secure what is genteelly called the correctional facility, leaving 32 inmates and 11 of their hostages dead, most from shots fired by the state police.""Attica,"" produced and directed by Cinda Firestone, who also edited the film with Tucker Ashworth, is an exceptionally moving, outraged recollection of that terrible event. It's a documentary record of the event itself, the conditions that helped prompt it, and some of the things that have (and haven't) happened since. Though it asks questions that go unanswered, it is surprisingly temperate in tone.""Attica"" opened yesterday at the First Avenue Screening Room and it is, like ""I. F. Stone's Weekly,"" a superior example of committed film making.The thing that made Attica such a consciousness-raising event is preserved on film in the voices of the prisoners, both during and after the event, in interviews with the hostages, and in coverage of the official inquiries that followed it. We see it in the unity of the prisoners, in the discipline they maintained during the fruitless negotiations with correctional officials, in the faces of civilians who served on the unofficial ""observers' committee,"" as well as in the faces of the men who made the decision to retake the prison by force.Does a commitment to a desperate cause make a man lean and strong? Does representing an established system make another man look sort of swollen, overfed, the way the sheriff of Nottingham is always portrayed? I was beginning to think so while watching ""Attica"" until we are presented an interview with one especially articulate, passionately angry black prisoner who is in fact, almost plump. Stereotypes do not hold in ""Attica.""Nor is its anger self-defeating. One of the most moving sequences in the film is composed of interviews with the members of the family of one black prisoner who, post-rebellion, has apparently embarked on a self-improvement binge. ""You wouldn't be able to walk into my cell, for all the books I got,"" he has written his sister.Eloquence keeps turning up in the midst of jargon, and there is nothing so eleoquent as the last line of the film, spoken on the soundtrack by an ex-inmate who would shake the public out of its historic disinterest in penal reform. ""Wake up,"" he says, ""because nothing comes to a sleeper but a dream.""",1974-04-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen:Jckal of Nahueltoro, Strong Chilean Film","When a murderer seems as vulnerable as his victims, that's proof of the film maker's talent. ""The Jackal of Nahueltoro,"" written and directed by Miguel Littin of Chile, is a remarkable picture, based on a real case. It was made before the election of Salvador Allende Gossens; while he was president, Mr. Littin was the head of the state-owned film company. The movie, which was a vast success in Chile, is playing at the First Avenue Screening Room today.The picture's strength springs from the extreme simplicity of the narrative, which was clearly designed for an audience of all classes. The acting style is plain, some of it close to pantomime; the plot, rather than the actors, is the star. A burly peasant kills a farm woman and her five children for no apparent reason. The one clue is the grinding poverty that both had always knownwhich serves as a reminder that the poor can turn on one another.In jail, the illiterate murderer is educated, converted to Catholicism, taught to value life as he never did beforeand then executed. It's the agonizing buildup to his death that gives this film its emotional and political depth. The director condemns institutions (the church and the state) rather than individuals, and the system that perpetuates poverty and ignorance is cited as the true killer. Throughout, a benevolent prison system appears just as cruel as its most brutal counterparts.",1974-04-13T05:00:00+0000

Bantam's streaking book is by Gerald Gardner, chief balloon writer for The Watergate Follies, and consists of photos of bigwigs reacting to streakers; Ballantine's emulates the cover of The Joy of Sex, but not the rest of the book, and consists mostly of photographs of streakers with funny captions. As far as other streaking books are concerned, Pinnacle was going to do one (a magazine called The Streaker's Handbook), couldn't get it out fast enough and passed it on to Marvel Comics, who will bring it out. Dell will distribute The Altogether in the Altogether, by Hugh Ranier (French speakers are supposed to recognize a pun in the name of the pseudonymous author), prepared by the Tobey Publishing Company. This Is all putonan astrological guide to streaking, streaking records, etc.and will be out in May. There will probably be more and an editor tells us she received three streakingbook proposals last week alone. We understand that the burning esthetic (legal? moral?) question for publishers of streaking books is, to show or not to show the male genitals? Too bad the streakers didn't think of that.",1974-04-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"In 'Love and Anarchy,' Lust Excels:The Cast","Despite her Germanic name, Lina Wertmuller is one of Italy's rare distaff director-writers, a biological distinction that has no bearing on the fact that ""Love and Anarchy"" is a solidly professional work. Her anti-Fascist drama about an abortive attempt on Mussolini's life in the nineteen-thirties, which opened at the Little Carnegie yesterday, is a mite closer to love and lust than to anarchy. However, it is passionate and stirring in its hatred of oppression and its love of the indomitable battlers against tyranny.Miss Wertmuller obviously is stressing that some of the anonymous masses did a good deal of the fighting and dying against dictatorship by concentrating on such disparate principal plotters as a confused, timorous country bumpkin and a pair of prostitutes in one of Rome's poshest bagnios.But her vignettes grow in tension and meaning as she develops an awareness of the time, the place and her driven people in a succession of vigorous, coarse and violent scenes. Tunin, her callow hero, is simply a freckled, bearded young farmer, who has come to this bordello on vague instructions from an anarchist friend who has been murdered by Fascists. Salome, the blonde, outspoken queen of the establishment and his mentor, isit turns outa dedicated revolutionary who joined the oldest profession after her anarchist lover was slain.Of course, there are comlications. Our hero and Tripolina, another of Madame Aida's girls, fall in love. And, Spatoletti, one of Mussolini's rough enforcers who bears a surprising resemblance to Il Duce and is a regular patron of the ""maison,"" also is on hand to mess up the plan. However, Miss Wertmuller and Giuseppe Rotunno, her cinematographer, manage to give these bare outlines substance and color that underline the irony and tragedy of unrequited sacrifice.Perhaps there is more here for the voyeur than the historian. But the scenes inside the bordello that are reminiscent of Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as having explicit, four-letter dialogue, are vividly multidimensional. The physical aspects of Rome, its streets, squares, monuments and the green countryside also evoke the period and the the effects of the dictatorship.As Salome, Mariangela Melato wears her blond, Jean Harlow coiffure to the manner born. But above all, she is an inflexible patriot who projects idealism as grossly and fervently as she purveys her charms. Giancarlo Giannini's portrayal of Tunin is a shaded stint ranging from the shy peasanta tender, love-smitten swain to the man driven to a fatally violent act in a cause he has failed. Lina Polito is pitiably real as the pretty, anguished, brunette Tripolina, whose unwittingly selfish love helps push him toward self-destruction. And, Eros Pagni is properly vicious as the bullying Spatoletti.""Love and Anarchy"" may be slightly biased in its view of Fascist Italy, but Miss Wertmuller has illustrated it with enough power and style to make it memorable and often moving.",1974-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Lovin' Molly':Texas Farm Woman Not True to Type,"""Molly always stood where you left her, as long as she could see you,"" says Gid, one of the three narrators of ""Lovin' Molly,"" which opened yesterday at the 68th Street Theater. That's the sort of thing you or I might say about a well-trained, apartment-bound Labrador retriever, one that wags its tail at the sight of a leash and stays the proper distance when told to heel.But Gid is not talking about a brain-washed dog. He's talking about Molly Taylor (Blythe Dannner), the independent, headstrong Texas farm woman who, in the course of the 40 years covered by ""Lovin' Molly,"" is so overflowing with love she can give herself equally to Gid (Anthony Perkins), an uptight farmer, and Gid's best friend Johnny (Beau Bridges), a footloose cowboy, without anyone feeling even a mite peeved or jealous.Molly is one of those great, life-affirming fictional characters that you may or may not be able to believe. I can't, any more than I can believe most of this movie. I'm not sure whether it's because of the performances, the direction by Sidney Lumet, a born-and-bred city fellow, or some of the nonsense the characters have been given to say in Stephen Friedman's screenplay, adapted from Larry McMurtry's novel ""Leaving Cheyenne.""Much, I suspect, has to do with the screenplay, which comes across just as rural phony as the apostrophe in the new title. Molly, sitting on her porch at evening, is likely to reminisce about her various lovers: ""My menfolk began rising with the moon.""This is definitely not meant to be funny. A kind of patronizing poetry has been imposed upon her. In an earlier scene she has been so overwhelmed by the miracle of birth that she has kissed a new-born calf, after-birth and allexactly the sort of gesture that would make any real-life, no-nonsense farm woman roar with unkind laughter.There also seems to be a real problem in the film's continuity. Inportant motivations have either been left on the cutting room floor or perhaps they were never shot. This puts a further burden on the credibility of the three leading performers, who also must overcome some of the worst make-up ever seen in a first-class movie.As Beau Bridges gets older, his eyebrows simply become thicker until, as an old man, they look like Groucho Marx's. As Blythe Danner ages, she turns increasingly pale and appears to chop off her gray hair with sheep shears. Anthony Perkins, who doesn't look like the young man in his early 20's he is supposed to be at the beginning, returns to his ""Friendly Persuasion"" mannerisms. He acts mostly with his jawbone as the young Gid, then ages in the stiff-faced manner of a person who's had too many facelifts.Undermining the film, however, is a more important fault of San Andreas dimensions: Who loves whom and why? Mnages  trois are difficult propositions, in fiction as well as life, unless you can believe in the heightened sensitivities of the participants. Truffaut managed it successfully in ""Jules and Jim"" through a soaring lyricism of style and by having the extraordinary Jeanne Moreau at the mysterious center.Miss Danner is attractive in short takes but lacks the dynamism that could have given the film a focal point. It is so literally staged and acted that one begins to question the true psychological relationship between the two men. Is Molly important to each of them as herself or as a kind of sexual surrogate for the other? The Molly of the novel possesses a splendid self-assurance and a will to self-determination that the movie talks about but never successfully demonstrates.The backgrounds of ""Lovin' Molly,"" which was filmed entirely in Texas, look right. In the foreground, however, are all those city-folk-actors playing make-believe.",1974-04-15T05:00:00+0000

us,A Haunting 'Conversation':'Conversation',"HAVE you considered the possibility that everything that's ever been said in this world might still be echoing somewhere, maybe rattling around within the interior of a stone, a tree trunk or at the bottom of the sea? Though becoming increasingly faint, the sounds shall never disappear entirely and one day, perhaps, there will be equipment Sensitive enough to retrieve and record mankind's oral history. In 24 abridged volumes it would make a perfect introductory offer to a book club. Or even a book club all of its own.In the meantime our technicians have developed eavesdropping equipment of almost staggering complexity and efficiency, to be used not for historical purposes (as we all now know, only the cheap stuff is used for that) or even to satisfy curiosity about human nature. Rather it's more often used for personal and corporate gain, which sometimes means murder.That's the idea behind Francis Ford Coppola's haunting and bothersome new film, ""The Conversation,"" now at the Coronet. One of the lessons implicit in ""The Conversation"" is that private enterprise, as always, leads the way. Government breakthroughs, like break-ins, are usually a mistake.The film is haunting because its suggestion that technology has gotten out of hand, though not exactly new, is so convincingly and fastidiously detailed. It's bothersome because Mr. Coppola, the writer as well as the director, has nearly succeeded in making a great film but has, instead, made one that is merely very good. Among its virtues is a superb performance by Gene Hackman in a role that comes very close to being the uptight Watergate era's equivalent of the mad doctors in old-fashioned Vincent Price films.Harry Caul (Hackman) is pre-eminent in his field. His trade magazine is called ""Security World"" and sound is his universe. Harry Caul is an expert professional eavesdropper. He once placed a bug in a parakeet. When he is not planning and executing elaborate taps, mostly without wires, he returns to his bleak, furnished San Francisco apartment, which is protected by four locks on the front door as well as by a burglar alarm system, to relax by playing riffs on his saxophone to the accompaniment of records. Harry is a queer fish indeed. He is suspicious of everybody and everything. Rain or shine he always wears one of those transparent plastic raincoats, as if for prophylactic protection against society.Harry is unmarried and probably incapable of marriage, though not of desperate, anonymous sex. He keeps a sweet, none-too-bright girl in a small apartment that he visits when he can, turning the key in the lock slowly then pushing the door suddenly open, to mash anyone who might possibly be hiding behind it. A birthday present from his landlady, which she has somehow managed to put into his apartment without his knowledge, prompts a near-paranoid fit. If you're in the business of spying on other people, it's difficult to believe that other people are not spying on you. If you're in the business, it may also mean that the forbidden and the clandestine have an immense fascination for you.This, however, Harry vehemently denies. He tells an associate, a young man who admits that Internal Revenue assignments always send him to sleep with boredom, that he isn't interested in human nature, nor does he have any curiosity about the people whose conversations he bugs. It's just a business, says Harry, yet Harry is riddled with guilts. When he goes to confession, he asks forgiveness for having swiped several newspapers from a blind dealer and for having taken the Lord's name in vain and pleasure in impure thoughts. He's also bothered by the suspicion that the current job he's working on may well be endangering the lives of the two young people whose conversations he has recorded during their lunchtime tryst in a busy San Francisco park. More of the story I cannot reveal.Mr. Hackman is fascinating as this eccentric loner, and the character itself is thoroughly realized up to a point, when he becomes, if possible, overly realized. Harry isn't simply neurotic. He gives every indication of being psychotic, which lessens the impact of the story Mr. Coppola has written for him. Psychotics make unreliable heroes. No rules need apply to them. Then there are times when Mr. Coppola seems to have forgotten the sort of character he has created.At a crucial point in the film he allows Harry, who is constantly on his guard with strangers, to invite a group of drunk, newly made friends back to his loft, where he keeps all of his extraordinary equipment and tapes. Because it's about the last thing in the world Harry would ever do, you begin to hear plot-devices bumping around just off-screen.It could be that Mr. Coppola really wasn't aware how good a movie he was on the verge of making in ""The Conversation."" Perhaps he only wanted to make a better-than-average melodrama, which might explain some beautifully photographed but basically foolish dream sequences and hallucinations. Such devices, even in Hitchcock, are usually cop-outs of one sort or another, or such overly simplified Freud that they hardly bare scrutiny except as comic-strip psychiatry.Everything about ""The Conversation"" prompts you to demand better than that. The nightmare situation that Harry finds himself in is both funny and compelling, and although I'm not much taken by the sort of ""Blow-Up"" ambiguity that Mr. Coppola eventually has recourse to, the movie leaves you wanting more, which is a nice change from all the other movies that send you groggily from the theater feeling as if you'd been force-fed on jelly beans.The members of the supporting cast are almost as good as Mr. Hackman, particularly Allen Garfield as a surveillance expert from Detroit who bugged his first phone at the age of 12 and then went on to become famous in the trade as the man who told Chrysler that Cadillac was getting rid of its fins.

It doesn't fail in an attempt to do something beyond its means. It doesn't attempt to do anything except pass the time, which simply isn't good enough when most of us have access to television. It's a B movie, made approximately 30 years too late for the market, about a nice, honorable, revenge-driven bank robber (Robert Duvall) who sets out to destroy the syndicate that murdered his brother.Because the movie is about the ways and means by which that revenge is carried out, it contains a good deal of action in terms of gunfights and holdups, that sort of thing, and hardly anything to think about except, possibly, the members of the cast.John Flynn, a director who has yet to distinguish himself, has reinforced the film's B-picture image by casting it with lots of players one associates with a more innocent time, if not directly with B pictures. Richard Jaeckel, Marie Windsor, Anita O'Day, Jane Greer and Elisha Cook, among others, turn up in roles so small you might miss them without a scorecard.They're all good performers, as are the stars, Mr. Duvall, Joe Don Baker and the late Robert Ryan (in one of his last roles), but the film doesn't appreciate them by giving them anything to do.""The Outfit"" opened yesterday at the Trans-Lux West and other theaters.

If you don't know where to start, try the Baroque Museum in the Mirabell Gardens. It's so new that loins local people may not have heard about it, but they'll know where the gardens are. The museum is an audiovisual thing, nicely done even if you don't understand German. After the Baroque Museum, no matter how many threestar and fourstar at tractions you hit, don't fail to see the Collegiate Church (Kollegienkirche), which was designed at the end of the 17th century by Fischer von Erlach, whose name you will hear a hundred times on tours of Vienna and Salzburg. The church was built as the university church and is entered from Universittsplatz. Some guidebooks don't even mention it, possibly because their authors were so captivated by the flower stands in the square in front of the church entrance that they neglected to notice the church itself. That's a mistake. After looking at the flowers, gaze heavenward at the figures of the Evangelists on the church tower, then walk inside. If you think baroque is all clusters of knickknacks, be proved happily wrong. The church displays great line and simplicity; proportions and symmetry are perfectwith baroque decorations. The great delight is in discovering that baroque can permit such a clean and simple creation as this.",1974-04-28T05:00:00+0000

To write, in that older tradition, is to test consciousness and maintain it, to try to fulfill, as the acceptance of a responsibility, the human need for articulation, for voices. In everything Max Frisch has published novels, stories, plays, essays, political and social commentary, and now this Sketchbook made up of some of those things and a number of unclassifiable forms  he has wrestled with the angel or demon of the literary vocation.
