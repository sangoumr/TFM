He said yesterday that the nurses were ""angry and frustrated that four months of negotiations have been stalled."" In a vote tallied Wednesday and released yesterday, 418 nurses voted for the strike authorization, with 19 opposed. The union represents about 800 registered nurses who have been working without a contract since July 1 at the state-owned hospital. The nurses have said they are concerned about understaffing and want the hospital to include the hiring of more nurses in the contract. New Jersey law prohibits state employees from striking; the union risks getting fined if the nurses strike.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   TAUSSIG, , WALTER","TAUSSIG--Walter. The Metropolitan Opera mourns the death of our beloved associate conductor, Walter Taussig. A member of the Met's music staff since 1949, Walter meticulously coached several generations of singers in their roles, including many of the most famous artists of the last half of the 20th Century. He was truly a link to the great musical traditions of the past, having assisted legendary conductors like Fritz Busch, Emil Cooper, Karl Bohm, and Herbert von Karajan, and tirelessly brought his wealth of knowledge and experience to the musical preparation of Met performances. Walter matched this wonderful musical pedigree with a true talent for teaching musical ideas, and an engaging, warm personality that endeared him to all those who had the privilege of working with him. With Walter's passing, we at the Met have lost one of our artistic treasures and dearest friend. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Lore, and his daughter, Lynn, and his many friends.

On the north shore, Nantucket town bustles with chowder houses, stately inns and art galleries. The town becomes a congested tangle in July and August as the island's population -- year-round and summer residents -- swells to 40,000 and is joined by tens of thousands of daily and weekly tourists. Visitors are discouraged from bringing cars to the narrow cobblestone roads, and parking is scarce. So leave your vehicle at the mainland ferry parking lot in Hyannis, Mass., and enjoy the island by bike. The bus is a convenient and affordable alternative. If you can sort through the barrage of overpriced, mediocre restaurants and look beyond the perpetually tanned 20-somethings in their parents' Land Rovers, Nantucket offers a lovely respite amid a wealth of natural beauty.

us,'Morningside Heights'," This neighborhood was always middle-class and urban. The advent of the subway at the start of the twentieth century transformed the countryside so rapidly that less than a decade after the stations opened, the fields were gone and the massive, sedate apartment buildings that you see today already lined the streets. They were grand places, designed to persuade prosperous New York families that their bourgeois dignities could be preserved as well in an apartment as in a brownstone row house with a stoop. The building at 635 West 117th Street was similar to scores of others built around the same time, and, like them, it filled with tenants as soon as it was completed, in 1906. It had twelve stories, with four ample apartments per floor, each divided into a living and dining room, several bedrooms, two bathrooms, all large and airy, plus a small library, and, behind the kitchen, a miniature bedroom and bathroom for the live-in maid. During the Depression, the landlords carved most of the apartments into two or three, creating the ten to twelve on a floor that you find now. The cut-up layouts made no architectural sense, but in those hard times the new tenants could not afford to be choosy. Only a few apartments in the building retain the original floor plan, with the cramped kitchen and tiny sleeping nook where a lonely girl spent her days and nights in service to the family living in comfort in the other rooms.

For $30 an hour ($24 if you book a solid day), temps, some of whom are at right, attend to such boring-but-essential errands as dry-cleaning, gift-buying and picking up film. Clients include celebrities with more money than time: Taken to Task (www.takentotask.com) organized a move for the actress Parker Posey, now ensconced in the East Village; haggled over the price of a first edition of ''Great Expectations'' on behalf of Jimmy Fallon, the comedian; and cleaned out some closets for John Lyons, the movie producer. Heather Smith, an owner, says Taken to Task is the human equivalent of TiVo, springing into action at the user's convenience. And like TiVo, the temps don't ask questions. ''Sometimes the problem with a full-time helper is that you get to know them so well, you feel uncomfortable asking them to do anything really personal,'' she said.

But Robert Cort is no Jackie Collins, lounging in leopard prints by a pool in Beverly Hills and churning out pulp like ''Hollywood Wives.'' Cort has produced 52 films, including ''Runaway Bride'' and ''Mr. Holland's Opus,'' and he clearly knows his way around what Collins and her competitors invariably call Tinseltown. He has put his knowledge to good use in ACTION! (Random House, $24.95), a sprawling book that manages to be both entertaining and smart. ''Action!'' traces three generations of the Jastrows, a family of filmmakers. It opens in 1948 when Harry Jastrow, the most powerful lawyer in Hollywood, fails to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn a court ruling against the distribution monopoly of the five biggest studios. The story then shifts to his son, AJ, whose life is dedicated to gaining the power in Hollywood that his father lost. Along the way, father and son are taught the intricacies of the town's politics by everyone from a bitter Bing Crosby and a rebellious Steve McQueen to a sex-mad Romy Schneider and the comedian Sam Kinison. AJ's enemies are worthy opponents: the agent Mike Ovitz; the studio head who helped do in his father; even AJ's own mother and son. Unlike his father, however, AJ fights the power and prevails. Cort does succumb to a Hollywood ending, but after so many pages of quirky realism, his way of saying ''Cut!'' actually works. Dana Kennedy",2003-08-03T05:00:00+0000

The set covers the years from 1958 to 1963, as well as the distance from Mr. Weston the player of piquant, swinging miniatures with a profound extreme-register style to Mr. Weston the concocter of large-ensemble evocations of Africa. Unlike Ellington, who used African and Asian elements with a very conscious air of paraphrase, Mr. Weston wanted to make the link more explicit. And that's what Langston Hughes's liner essay to the 1960 album ''Uhuru Afrika,'' reprinted here, confirms. ''That jazz owes its basic debt to Africa, no one disputes,'' Hughes wrote. ''Therefore contemporary Africans did not really have to learn to play jazz because their own tribal music from time immemorial has contained the major elements that distinguish jazz from other musical forms.'' Wow, how simplified and yearning that reads now. Randy Weston loved music from many parts of Africa, and still does. But most of his aesthetic DNA comes from Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, who descended from the Harlem stride-piano players of the 20's, and all of those guys were as American as apple pie.",2003-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Medici of the Meadowlands,"The tangled relationship of art, illusion and the marketplace being what it is -- an ongoing melodrama, set to the strains of keening violins -- it so happened that 250 tuxedoed, gowned and bejeweled members of the patronage class showed up for an Italianate palace ball one night this spring at a defunct train station in a Jersey City marsh. Guests were met at the gate by a young man in a pleated skirt, pointy black slippers and a frilly blouse under a gold brocaded vest, who bowed theatrically and said, ''Buona notte, signori e signore.'' The title of the ball was Palazzo di Cremona, and the domed terminal of the Central Railroad of New Jersey was done up for the evening with garlands of citrus leaves and blood oranges. Three former governors of New Jersey were present, along with Paolo Bodini, mayor of Cremona, Italy, a 2,300-year-old town north of Milan. Cremona occupies a status among violin aficionados akin to that of Detroit among car buffs, having been the ground on which such violin-making luminaries as Niccol Amati, Giuseppe Guarneri and, above all, Antonio Stradivari thrived. Mayor Bodini was a guest of the evening's honorees, an elderly couple named Evelyn and Herbert Axelrod, who had gained vast wealth by addressing themselves to the needs of caretakers of guppies, goldfish, parakeets, lizards, gerbils and the like, and who elicited, throughout the evening, comparison to the beneficent Medicis of Florence.",2003-08-03T05:00:00+0000

His chatty 1970's heroine, identified only as ''K. O'Connor,'' is an author of slick celebrity profiles who lands a book contract to do a come-clean show-biz biography of Vince Collins, the mellow singer-swinger half of a popular comedy act (ever so close to Martin and Lewis) that broke up in the late 50's under shady circumstances. It seems that neither Vince nor his partner, Lanny Morris, could explain how a woman with whom they had both dallied in Miami wound up dead in the bathtub of their private suite at a mob-run casino in New Jersey. Holmes, who has won honors galore for his inventive storytelling on Broadway and elsewhere, can be forgiven for milking the mystery of ''the Girl in New Jersey'' because he delivers such a giddy fun-house ride through bygone eras. As the go-go girl of the 70's, O'Connor tempts us to throw on a pair of bell-bottoms and dash out for some reckless sex, while Vince and Lanny invest the forgotten 50's with all the brash and vulgar celebrity glamour of a mad tea party in Las Vegas.",2003-08-03T05:00:00+0000

us,A Changed Climate in Turkey,"The votes by Turkey's Parliament last week to curb the political power of the military and increase freedom of expression are a significant step away from army domination of Turkish politics. The challenge now for the government, dominated by moderate Islamists of the Justice and Development Party, is to ensure that the new measures are carried out. Not long ago, Turkey's military would have responded to such initiatives by seizing power -- the armed forces removed four governments in the last four decades. That is less likely today because of broad support in Turkey for democratic rule, but these reforms present a test of just how much the climate has changed. The military should step back and let the nation continue unhindered along the path to a fuller democracy and the coveted prize of European Union membership.",2003-08-04T05:00:00+0000

AT&T Wireless, along with eight former TeleCorp executives, agreed to pay the money to avoid a trial in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, according to court papers. Almost a dozen TeleCorp shareholders said in the lawsuit that the wireless company secretly paid TeleCorp executives $140 million to win their support for the $4.6 billion buyout. The settlement came as AT&T Wireless completed a buyback of $540.4 million in high-interest debt it had assumed in the acquisition of TeleCorp and another company. AT&T Wireless executives declined to comment on the settlement. Lawyers for the company, which is based in Redmond, Wash., said in court papers that AT&T Wireless denied any wrongdoing and settled the case only to ''avoid the substantial expense, inconvenience, risk and distraction of continued litigation.''",2003-08-05T05:00:00+0000

In the period last year, Cathay had a profit of $181 million. Revenue was $1.6 billion, down 21 percent from a year earlier. The loss was a result of fears over SARS, which kept travelers from flying to many parts of Asia in the spring. In April, at the height of the SARS scare, Cathay parked 22 aircraft and reduced its schedule by canceling up to half of its regularly scheduled services in May and June. The airline has since restored much of its schedule and now has four planes sidelined , said Mary Jersin-Shammas, a Cathay spokeswoman.

She said train service would not be affected today, since trains that would normally use the two tracks can be rerouted. Ms. Anders said the only effect on riders last night was that lights went dark on platforms throughout the concourse level of the station, and passengers had to rely on the dimmer lights from inside trains.

us,Democracy's Landscape,"The 843 acres of Central Park represent not only a masterpiece of landscaping art and artifice, but a secret garden of 19th-century symbols waiting to be decoded, Sara Cedar Miller, the official historian and photographer for the Central Park Conservancy, writes in CENTRAL PARK: An American Masterpiece (Abrams, $45). Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the years around the Civil War, Central Park combined democratic ideals with the latest in Victorian technology. Picturesque rambles disguise the circulation patterns, which seamlessly integrate footpaths, bridle trails and carriage drives. The sunken transverses that handle crosstown traffic anticipated highway overpasses by decades. Even the most naturalistic elements of the park are engineering triumphs: the Pond at the south end is lined like a sink and fed with the same water that fills the city's bathtubs, and sloping meadows like Cedar Hill were formed by blasting away rock and covering it with lawn. Americans in the 19th century looked to our natural resources as a symbol of national pride, and during the Civil War, the park came to stand for what was best about the United States. The balustrades of Bethesda Terrace contain encoded symbols of the Union for the sharp-eyed: a buckle of Union stars, and sheaves of wheat, which represented the North as much as cotton did the Confederacy. Though the photographs are occasionally pedestrian, relying too heavily on scenic beauty for interest, Miller's history is as clear and sprightly as Huddlestone Cascade (uptown, near Lasker Rink), at 15 feet the highest waterfall in the park.

us,Called Your Telemarketer Recently?,"TOM MABE -- Though Tom Mabe's first two ''Revenge of the Telemarketers'' CD's were prank-call classics, the third CD in the series, ''A Wake-Up Call for Telemarketers'' (Megaforce), pushes the joke too far. On his earlier albums, in which he pulled pranks on the annoying telemarketers who called his home, the victims of his jokes never realized that they were being duped. On practically every phone call on the new CD, instead of fooling the telemarketers, he ends up annoying them -- and, in the process, the listener. There is more anger than humor directed at the pests here, but there are still some laugh-out-loud moments. What saves the CD is a segment in which Mr. Mabe calls telemarketers (who are in a Washington hotel for a convention) in the middle of the night, waking them to try to sell them things. Here the listener learns the people who are the rudest to nuisance phone calls just may be telemarketers themselves.",2003-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Secret of the Black Paintings,"As an art historian and artist, I find that the possible reattribution of the Black Paintings to Francisco Goya's son, Javier, suggests several re-readings of the images (Arthur Lubow, July 27). The paintings are no less interesting or skillful, and may still be read as the painterly ''outflow of a tormented'' soul. We have a horrific image of a father consuming his child in ''Saturn,'' which may be seen as the vision of a painter's son overwhelmed by a successful father. In ''The Sabbat,'' Javier may have painted his father as a he-goat captivating the admiring masses. And in ''The Fates,'' well, yes, what would have been Javier Goya's fate, had his father not been the great Goya?",2003-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,METLIFE DISMISSES 4 FOR ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS,"MetLife, a leading life insurance company, has dismissed the president of one of its main sales units and three other executives after discovering that $31 million in operating expenses after taxes had been understated over five years at its New England Financial subsidiary in Boston. As a result, MetLife revised yesterday the second-quarter earnings report that it issued last week, adding $31 million in expenses to reduce operating earnings for the period to $620 million. David M. Monfried, a spokesman for MetLife, said the underreporting, which had the effect of making New England Financial's performance look better than it really was, was tiny in comparison to MetLife's $34 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in operating income in 2002. He said MetLife was confident that ''this was an isolated incident.'' Andrew S. Kligerman, an analyst for UBS Securities, said, ''I don't think this is a major issue. You never know, but it appears that MetLife took the appropriate actions here, not only to report it to regulators but to admit it. This does not appear to be the tip of an iceberg.'' Joseph B.

In the 2000 case, the man, Russell Peeler Jr., was also convicted of ordering the killings of an 8-year-old witness to the slaying of the drug-dealer and the witness's mother. The high court ordered a new trial for Mr. Peeler because his lawyer was barred from representing him. The testimony of the lawyer, prosecutors contended, was essential in the trial for the 1999 killings of Leroy Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke. But the high court disagreed and ruled that Mr. Peeler was entitled to a new trial and counsel of his choice. Stacey Stowe (NYT)",2003-08-12T05:00:00+0000

''This is the last major step in the successful transformation of DuPont from an unwieldy $45 billion cyclical conglomerate to a less cyclical, higher-growth $20 billion innovative science company,'' said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical-industry analyst with Bear, Stearns. Steven McCracken, the textile unit's president, said that his unit was profitable and brimming with new products, but conceded that the divestiture made sense.

He sang all the leading Verdi and Puccini roles here, but is perhaps best remembered as a passionate advocate of new American opera, creating leading roles in NYCO world premieres including ''The Crucible'', ''The Golem'', and ''The Good Soldier Schweik''. Though his busy career also took him to the opera companies of San Francisco, Houston, Boston, Vienna, La Scala, and Rome, as well as numerous orchestras and musical theatre stages, we are proud that NYCO was always his artistic home. His unforgettable voice, powerful stage presence, unfailing collegiality, and infectious joie de vivre endeared him to all of us. We have lost a great artist and a great friend, and we will miss him. Contributions in his name can be made to Opera New York, 205 West End Avenue, NY, NY 10023, earmarked for the Chester Ludgin Memorial Fund. Paul Kellogg General Director",2003-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Though slight in stature, Bette McKean was large in courage, independence and heart. Born in Dixon City, PA. on June 10, 1929, Bette grew up during the Depression and World War II. After graduating from Hunter College, she moved into an apartment on East 37th Street with several girlfriends. Bette became a successful and well-paid executive assistant in Lennen and Knewell, but did not feel her worklife was satisfying. So, during Mayor John Lindsay's administration, when she read in the newspaper that the city needed teachers, she applied for a job and became a kindergarten teacher in the South Bronx for many years. Bette eventually moved to Tudor City, where she lived for more than three decades. There she met and in 1974, married John F. McKean, a retiree and leader in the tenants movement. During the 1980s, John and Bette led the successful fight to prevent Harry Helmsley from erecting high-rises on the Tudor City parks including one famous episode where they went out with bullhorns at 7 A.M. to rouse their neighbors and stop the bulldozers. After John died in 1993, Bette continued to live in their apartment overlooking the parks. Though her mobility was limited in recent years, she never lost her sharp eye for deceit nor her keen sense of humor. She is survived by her sister-in-law, Cornelia Bowe of Summit, NJ; her niece, great niece, and great-great niece Amy, Marisa and Giana Ross, all of NY; great niece Julia Ross of Suffern, NY; great nephew, Chris Harris of FL; stepdaughters Sandy McKean Ogden and Susan McKean Lewallen of CA, and step grandchildren Charles and David Ogden and Julie and Coe Gibbs, all of CA and WA.

us,A Man Who Can Tell Stone Crabs From Chaff,"South Carolina's crabbers look for blue crabs and usually toss back the stone crabs that wander into their pots. But Jerry Gault, above, a crabber from Florida who now lives in Beaufort, S.C., knows the value of fresh stone crab claws. The season for claws from Florida, the dominant source, closes between April and October to protect the spawning crabs. In South Carolina, where the annual harvest is about 1 percent of the more than one million pounds that come from Florida, the fishery is open all year. And that's good for stone crab lovers, because it makes the delicacy available in summer, a season for cold seafood. Mr. Gault is now shipping his meaty stone crab claws north, where they are being sold at Citarella stores for $19.99 a pound (four to six).",2003-08-13T05:00:00+0000

A charge for early debt retirement would reduce third-quarter profit by another $39 million, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Monday. AT&T Wireless is writing down its investment in Far EasTone Telecommunications, Taiwan's No. 3 mobile-phone operator. Far EasTone's shares have plunged about 40 percent from a 2001 high amid competition. AT&T Wireless had a 23 percent stake in the company, based in Taipei, at the end of last year, according to regulatory filings. AT&T Wireless is expected to earn about 6 cents a share this quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Based on current shares outstanding, that equates to $163 million. In the third quarter of last year, AT&T Wireless had a loss of $2.04 billion, or 76 cents, in part because it wrote down the value of other assets.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that there could be more claims than it expected and that the $2.78 billion in cash it agreed to set aside to pay them might not be sufficient. In that case, the company, based in Houston, said it would need to decide whether to pay less for each claim or increase the amount in its fund. If Halliburton seeks lower payments, plaintiffs' lawyers ''may not proceed with the settlement or may attempt to renegotiate the settlement amount,'' it said in the filing. ''Conversely, an increase in the amount of cash required may make completing the proposed settlement more difficult.'' Under the proposed settlement, announced in December, Halliburton agreed to pay a total of $4 billion in cash and stock to resolve 300,000 cases.",2003-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Michael Leavitt's nomination to succeed Christie Whitman as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency means that the country will be not be treated to a rerun of the political soap operas that marked the Whitman years. That is bad news. Mrs. Whitman almost always lost her internal battles on behalf of the regulatory framework that for 30 years has brought the nation cleaner air and water. But the country was better off for having her in Washington, a solitary if increasingly faint voice against the ideologues and lobbyists who occupy every other important environmental job. Mr. Leavitt, by contrast, is at one with the administration: a Westerner, unlike Mrs. Whitman, and an antiregulatory one at that. He should fit right in.",2003-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Technology Briefing | Hardware: ATI And Microsoft Sign Pact On XBox Components,"ATI Technologies said yesterday that it had signed a contract with Microsoft to produce components for future versions of the Xbox game console, beating out the market leader, Nvidia. ATI said it had entered a technology agreement with Microsoft to develop ''custom, leading-edge graphics technologies'' for the console. ''We selected ATI after reviewing the top graphics technologies in development and determining that ATI's technical vision fits perfectly with the future direction of Xbox,'' Robbie Bach, senior vice president of Microsoft's home and entertainment division, said. The announcement ends months of speculation over whether Nvidia, the leading maker of graphics processors for PC's, would renew its troubled partnership with Microsoft on the Xbox. The graphics processor is the most expensive component in the Xbox, and Nvidia stood poised for a major windfall after the chipmaker won the contract shortly after the Xbox was announced three years ago. But sales problems and hardware changes left Nvidia with piles of unsold and unusable chips, putting it in a position where it could have lost money on the console if it had not submitted the Microsoft contract to arbitration. The Xbox deal has accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of Nvidia's sales the last two years, and company executives credited Xbox-related business for a surge in profit during Nvidia's most recent quarter. Analysts had predicted the contract for the next Xbox might go to ATI, which also makes the graphics processor for Nintendo's GameCube. Microsoft has yet to set a date or reveal details on the successor to the current Xbox, despite rampant speculation from fans and game makers. While Microsoft will need to deliver new technology that can compete with Sony's successor to the PlayStation 2, it is also probably looking for ways to cut costs after after taking significant losses on the Xbox.

us,Technology Briefing: Hardware," ATI AND MICROSOFT SIGN PACT ON XBOX COMPONENTS ATI Technologies said yesterday that it had signed a contract with Microsoft to produce components for future versions of the Xbox game console, beating out the market leader, Nvidia. ATI said it had entered a technology agreement with Microsoft to develop ""custom, leading-edge graphics technologies"" for the console. ""We selected ATI after reviewing the top graphics technologies in development and determining that ATI's technical vision fits perfectly with the future direction of Xbox,"" Robbie Bach, senior vice president of Microsoft's home and entertainment division, said. The announcement ends months of speculation over whether Nvidia, the leading maker of graphics processors for PC's, would renew its troubled partnership with Microsoft on the Xbox. The graphics processor is the most expensive component in the Xbox, and Nvidia stood poised for a major windfall after the chipmaker won the contract shortly after the Xbox was announced three years ago. But sales problems and hardware changes left Nvidia with piles of unsold and unusable chips, putting it in a position where it could have lost money on the console if it had not submitted the Microsoft contract to arbitration. The Xbox deal has accounted for 15 percent to 20 percent of Nvidia's sales the last two years, and company executives credited Xbox-related business for a surge in profit during Nvidia's most recent quarter. Analysts had predicted the contract for the next Xbox might go to ATI, which also makes the graphics processor for Nintendo's GameCube. Microsoft has yet to set a date or reveal details on the successor to the current Xbox, despite rampant speculation from fans and game makers. While Microsoft will need to deliver new technology that can compete with Sony's successor to the PlayStation 2, it is also probably looking for ways to cut costs after after taking significant losses on the Xbox.

Born in The Bronx in 1926 to Adele and Arnold Rosenstein, Neil was a proud alumna of the City College of New York, class of 1942 (BBA). An enthusiastic and proud New Yorker for 43 years, Neil resided in Manhattan and Long Island before relocating to Beverly Hills,CA in 1969.

Neil had a varied and successful business career, including being Chairman of the Board of National Sugar Refining Company (1969-1971), and Founder, Chairman and President of Jackpot Enterprises, Inc from 1980-1993. He is deeply loved by his family and will be remembered as a kind and generous man with an extraordinary sense of humor and charismatic charm.

Directors at the institutions say some form of renovation and expansion will go forward, but no specific plans have been made.",2003-08-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Wash Your Hair With Borax,"Sheri Holman's lovely, disarming third novel, THE MAMMOTH CHEESE (Atlantic Monthly, $24), begins with the media circus surrounding the birth of 11 infants to Manda Frank, a hapless young dog breeder living in the rural Virginia town of Three Chimneys. It's a situation ripe for satire or social commentary, but Holman isn't interested in anything so obvious. Her focus quickly widens to encompass a handful of Frank's neighbors and their ordinary, deeply eccentric lives. The emotional center of the book is Polly Marvel, an eighth grader with a wild, possibly requited, crush on her cynical and magnetic 33-year-old teacher. It's easy to understand why Polly is desperate for love. Her roguish father (who cheerily describes himself as not ''the sort of man a woman should ever get cancer on'') has decamped after an affair with his secretary. Her mother, Margaret, is an artisanal cheesemaker who wants to protect Polly from every modern peril, from storebought bread to synthetic fibers. (Holman is particularly funny when describing the antics of this puritanical woman, who washes her hair with borax and egg yolk and is gradually ridding her house of appliances.) But there isn't a caricature in this book, and even Margaret is a sympathetic figure, capable of change and of being loved -- in this case by her farmhand, August, who moonlights as a Thomas Jefferson impersonator. The cheese of the title is a 1,235-pound Cheshire that Margaret makes for the president of the United States, a replica of a gargantuan cheese once presented to Jefferson. The story line is droll, but the book is also tough, sad and surprisingly sweet. Jennifer Reese",2003-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Abram Sohmer earned his M.D. in 1939 at Emory University, Atlanta, and served as a Lieutenant Colonel flight surgeon with the Ninth Air Force in Egypt, England, and France during the Second World War. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal and served on General Eisenhower's staff during the Battle of Bulge. After the war, he entered private medical practice in Jamaica, New York. His brilliance as a diagnostician, his kind and caring manner, his optimism and gentle humor brought him a large practice, more than ten thousand persons. He loved being a family doctor and spurned offers to specialize. He routinely treated more than sixty patients a day. He began his hospital rounds at 6AM, held office hours from 10AM to 9PM, and rarely completed his house calls before midnight. He delivered more than two thousand babies. He saved many lives. He was old school. He was loved, honored and cherished by the community to which he devoted his life. A humble man, he turned from praise.

In fact, Pop-Tarts, which turn a venerable 40 next year, are among America's most entrenched guilty pleasures: in 2001, the number of Tarts sold (2 billion) would have reached halfway to the moon. Psssst: 40 percent were consumed by adults. Metaphorically, our Top 40 tarts are consistent with the pastry originals: they're better when they're a little flaky, their visuals are candy-colored, the lite lyrics melt in your mouth. The music's market-researched beat has all the torque and spring of a four-slice Toastmaster. And what tasty fun, assigning an imagined flavor to each of today's ruling Billboard princesses.",2003-08-17T05:00:00+0000

Pretty soon we'd picked up five middle-aged Russian women who had been walking from Midtown Manhattan to Brighton Beach.

Cycads, he pointed out, bear cones, as conifers do. They are ancient, predating dinosaurs by some 75 million years. Intriguingly, cycads are also dioecious, meaning that they are either male or female. When a plant puts out cones, this becomes as plain as day. Male cycads generally produce long, phallic cones, while female cones, which hold the seeds, tend to have a fuller, rounder shape.

For years, while working in prisons, I have noticed the unusually high percentage of men and women inmates who never knew who their fathers were and sometimes not even their mothers.

Most sellers are doing so to move on to another house or to another location and often have serious time constraints. Included in the data that Levitt collected were, in all probability, properties owned by real-estate agents for investment or, God forbid, speculation.

Yet an investigation by the Division of Youth and Family Services did not substantiate abuse or neglect.

It is with the greatest saddness that the Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art mourn the untimely death of their dear friend and former colleague, Kirk Varnedoe, who was for many years the Museum's Chief Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture. Kirk leaves and extraordinary legacy, for he was a man of many talents--a brilliant curator, writer, teacher, lecturer, scholar, and mentor to younger colleagues during his 15year association with MoMA. An astute historian of the Museum's collection and of modern and contemporary art, he negotiated crucial acquisitions and organized landmark exhibitions. His deep friendships with artists greatly benefited the Museum in myriad ways. Some of these friendships developed out of the artist-organized exhibitions, ''Artist's Choice,'' which Kirk created and directed. We extend our most heartfelt sympathy to his wife Elyn Zimmerman, to his brothers Samuel and Gordon Varnedoe, and to his sister Comer Meadows.

It was the biggest single-month increase in Atlantic City, officials said, and it comes as the casinos are trying to respond to competition from nearby Indian casinos and Las Vegas, which adds new attractions often. The Borgata reported $46.9 million in revenue for July, but revenue at 7 of the other 11 casinos declined from July 2002. Some industry watchers said they had hoped that the opening of the Borgata would expand the market for Atlantic City. It was also expected, at least at first, that the new site would take away business from existing casinos. ''One month doesn't make a trend,'' said Marc Falcone, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.

After the hearing on Friday, the judge, Denny Chin, will decide whether to grant Fox the injunction it seeks to stop Mr. Franken, and his publisher, Penguin Group, from selling his new book, ''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.'' In dispute is the title and cover design with the words ''fair and balanced.'' Lawyers for Fox argue that the network trademarked ''Fair and Balanced,'' and that Mr. Franken's use would ''blur and tarnish'' the phrase that the network uses to market its news coverage. A lawyer for Penguin, Floyd Abrams, stated in court papers that he planned to defend Mr. Franken's ''wordplay'' on free speech arguments and other grounds. In court yesterday, he questioned the timing of Fox's actions, noting that the first 50,000 copies of the book have already been shipped to bookstores nationwide.

TMM, which defaulted on a $177 million bond in May, may be able to use the cash from the award to pay off creditors. It has debts totaling $1.4 billion.

Kirk leaves and extraordinary legacy, for he was a man of many talents--a brilliant curator, writer, teacher, lecturer, scholar, and mentor to younger colleagues during his 15year association with MoMA.

The cable is intended to give extra power to Long Island residents and has been operating under federal order since last week's blackout. It had previously been prevented from carrying power by Connecticut officials, who say it does not meet construction-permit and environmental regulations. The line is available to the Long Island Power Authority until Sept. 1, but at least one Connecticut official has called for it to be closed sooner. A spokesman for Senator Schumer said Long Island came ''perilously close to the edge'' of its power needs without the line. Leslie Kaufman (NYT)",2003-08-20T05:00:00+0000

While the Qwest problem lasted only 10 minutes, eBay technicians were forced to shut down and reboot their local systems, making the company's Web site inaccessible from 8:55 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. EBay said it would credit listing fees for sellers affected by the failure and would extend their listing time for an additional 24 hours. The company also will reimburse the ''10 cents for 10 days'' fee for auctions that were active during the power failure. In the past, eBay has experienced failures that crippled the site for hours at a time. In 1999, the company suffered a number of problems that sometimes made the site inaccessible for nearly a day. Since then, the company has strengthened its back-end systems to prevent prolonged power failures.",2003-08-22T05:00:00+0000

But it has continued to climb since the 1989-90 school year, when it was just over a million students. No leveling off is expected in the next few years, Mr. Vespucci said, but factors like immigration make it hard to forecast accurately. ''We're a little harder to predict than some places,'' he said.

us,What Was Michelangelo Thinking?,"When Michelangelo was in his mid-70's, he worked almost every day for several years, according to Vasari, on a complex four-figure sculpture designed to mark his own tomb. It depicted a crucified Christ being returned to the lap of his mother with the aid of Mary Magdalene and a bearded man chiseled with the features of the artist. Vasari reported being told that Michelangelo became so enraged with his servant's incessant nagging to finish that he attacked and mutilated the sculpture (his assistant later repaired some of the severed limbs). In an unusually suspenseful piece of historical scholarship, MICHELANGELO'S FLORENCE PIET (Princeton University Press, $75), the art scholar Jack Wasserman uses a persuasive mix of technology and psychology to probe Michelangelo's intentions for this sculpture, which has been maligned by many over the centuries for its distorted proportions. Wasserman illustrates that when the massive sculpture is installed high above an altar, as he believes Michelangelo intended, rather than on a low pedestal as currently exhibited, the perspective adjusts correctly to the viewer looking up. Michelangelo therefore purposefully accommodated for distance and angle, common practice among Renaissance painters but not sculptors. Wasserman rejects Vasari's story and argues that Michelangelo engaged in ''selective pruning,'' that is, revision, not destruction. Unable ultimately to resolve the piece, though, Michelangelo gave it away, and it was not until the end of the 19th century that the Florence Piet came to be appreciated by a modern sensibility pioneered in sculpture by Rodin, who admired the statue's raw surfaces and fragmentary qualities, and who once said, ''That which is more beautiful than a beautiful thing is the ruin of a beautiful thing.''

While I am fully aware that antennas are the least of the Sept. 11 losses, it seems that the building management is giving me a story. I can't imagine that everyone else in the city is either hooked up to cable or does without television. Doesn't this constitute a decrease in services provided? Might my landlord have an obligation to provide an antenna that receives the free television stations, or hook me into cable for reception at no charge, or perhaps decrease my rent for loss of services? . . .

There, Laurence Olivier, whom Tynan worshiped, had gathered a high-powered company of actors who were to perform a minor Jacobean play and ''The Broken Heart'' by John Ford. When Tynan saw the Ford he was underwhelmed, so much so that he wrote a famous ''Open Letter'' in which he addressed Olivier, stating the ''general feeling that all is not well with you.''

He recovered, and the success of the remainder of his tenure was guaranteed by a combination of courtliness and an almost hyperbolic humility in the face of his own faculty. ''He would thank you for absolutely anything'' is how one university administrator I spoke with put it. By the time Rudenstine announced his intention to retire, the university's governing board, the Harvard Corporation, concluded that the institution had grown complacent, though of course it remained matchless. And so in March 2001, the board replaced Rudenstine with Lawrence H.

The site, including the hand imprints and autographs of German celebrities like Ute Lemper and Caterina Valente, is to open on Sunday in front of the Friedrichstadtpalast Theater, on a site where Dietrich performed in 1926 as a chorus girl. ''Had the city of Berlin initiated the project, this would have been a whole different story,'' said Frieder Roth, the Dietrich family lawyer.

But it cites the rising cost of insurance and supplies and the decline of Medicare payments as reasons for the worrisome deficits. The report by the group, the United Hospital Fund, analyzed 2001 financial data for 35 nonspecialty hospitals in the five boroughs. The hospitals had a combined $56 million deficit.

us,"36 Hours | Galveston, Tex.","THE story of the crumbling but achingly beautiful port city of Galveston, it is often noted, can be divided into three phases: the architectural boom in Victorian palaces and ornate banking edifices that followed its creation as a prosperous trading outpost on the Gulf of Mexico, much of which was washed away by the devastating hurricane of 1900; a descent into a ''triad of vice'' of drinking, gambling and prostitution that gave Galveston a Big Easy kind of edge absent elsewhere in Texas; and a revival pinned on the expectation that urban renewal and a more sober tourism trade will pave the way to a brighter future. No doubt Galveston is recovering some of its luster since the days when the novelist Edna Ferber compared it to Miss Havisham, the old jilted bride of Dickens's ''Great Expectations.'' Its shops and restaurants are bulging with tourists, and it is almost impossible to book a good hotel room for a weekend on short notice. The stunning design of its 19th-century mansions jump out at you, especially if you're arriving from nearby Houston where so many old structures were razed to make way for a futuristic skyline.

Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District ruled that among other things, Deutsche Bank had failed to meet a key legal standard necessary for it to sue the city: establishing that the city owed the bank a higher standard of care than it did other residents and businesses. The suits had charged that the city negligently contributed to the collapse of 7 World Trade Center by storing diesel fuel there. The bank also charged in its lawsuit that the city prevented repair crews from entering the bank building when Lower Manhattan was sealed off.

The judge, Kent A. Jordan at Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del., upheld a finding by a magistrate in July 2002 that the two makers of hand-held devices did not rely on technology patented by NCR for a personal terminal. Palm said in June that it agreed to buy Handspring for about $168.9 million in stock. NCR, the largest seller of automated bank-teller machines, sued Handspring and Palm in March 2001, saying they used NCR inventions for devices that let users shop and conduct other business with credit-card-sized terminals connected to communications networks. NCR wanted a percentage of Palm and Handspring sales and was seeking ''significant'' amounts, a Palm lawyer, Brad Hulbert, said. Executives of NCR could not be reached for comment. NCR shares rose 5 cents, to close at $28.65. Handspring shares rose 8 cents, to $1.03. Shares of Palm rose $1.04, to $18.03.",2003-08-29T05:00:00+0000

Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District ruled that among other things, Deutsche Bank had failed to meet a key legal standard necessary for it to sue the city: establishing that the city owed the bank a higher standard of care than it did other residents and businesses. The suits had charged that the city negligently contributed to the collapse of 7 World Trade Center by storing diesel fuel there. The bank also charged in its lawsuit that the city prevented repair crews from entering the bank building when Lower Manhattan was sealed off.

According to the national statistics institute, the 1.6 percent contraction in the second quarter came after a contraction of 1.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Trying to inspire confidence in the market, Mr. da Silva's economic team raised Brazil's benchmark interest rate to 26.5 percent earlier this year to stifle inflation. But the rising rates also stopped the already slowing economy. Last week, the central bank, eager to spur growth, made its third rate cut in as many months. The overnight rate is now 22 percent.

Beloved daughter of the late Charles Cohn and Bella Cohen Cohn, adored sister of Seymour Cohn and the late Mildred Cohn, Maurice Cohn, Irene Colvin and Sylvan Lawrence, devoted and loyal wife of the late Henry Miller, and cherished aunt and great-aunt to each and every member of the Cohen and Cembalest families. Born on October 20, 1906 in New York City, the youngest daughter in a large and accomplished family, Pearl devoted herself to her studies, eventually becoming a teacher in the New York City Public School System. As a young girl, Pearl began her life-long involvement with Tranquillity Camp. As the ideal embodiment of the Cohen family credo ''Noblesse Oblige,'' Pearl soon became the indispensable right-hand of her uncle, the late Elias A. Cohen, one of the truly great men of his time, who founded Tranquillity Camp in 1919. After his sudden passing in July of 1952, Pearl shouldered the tremendous responsiblity of keeping the Camp going. For well over 50 years, Pearl selflessly and tirelessly devoted every minute of every day to her family, and to each of the children whose character was so quietly and subtlely molded by her example. Despite her towering intellect and photographic memory, Pearl, like so many members of the Cohen family before her, never talked down to anyone. To us she was a unique individual, a giant.

Our co-op apartment was put on the market, and in February 2003 we signed a cash-deal contract with a buyer who placed a 10 percent deposit into an escrow account. The closing was set for April 2. No broker was involved. The contract said that the buyer should submit his application to our corporation within 10 days after receipt of the fully executed contract. Five months have now passed and the buyer has not done so. He has also been reluctant to communicate, and his lawyer did not return calls from our lawyer. Can we retain the deposit? What is the procedure for doing so? And is there any way the buyer can prevent us from selling our apartment? . . . Kenneth Wu, Manhattan",2003-08-31T05:00:00+0000

Under the old system, each community had to have a fair share of lower-priced housing based on a complicated formula that many town officials criticized as cumbersome and developers used as a wedge to build large, dense housing complexes. Under the new rules, towns would have to require one new lower-priced unit for every 10 housing units built, and one unit for every 30 jobs created by new commercial construction. Critics questioned whether the new rules would have the desired effect or would result in keeping the poor and minorities in cities. They complained that the new rules allow towns that are not growing to avoid providing low- and moderate-income housing. Critics also complained that the rules doubled the number of units that could be set aside for the elderly, from 25 percent to 50 percent. George James",2003-08-31T05:00:00+0000

Devoted father of Lee, Philip and Arnold. Beloved and respected grandfather of Alexandra and Lauren. A charismatic, inspirational and innovative leader of the Holocaust survivor community, he built up a successful international trade business after surviving the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Majdanek, Budzyn and Flossenburg concentration camps as a teenager. Served as a witness at Nazi war criminal trials. He was the founder of the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization and the Holocaust Survivors Memorial Foundation and organizer of the first Holocaust commemoration event in the United States. He retired from business in 1978 to dedicate his life to write, lecture, and produce films and plays to educate the public on the significance of the Jewish Holocaust. Jack was the author of the autobiographical ''The Survivor'' (Morrow, 1980; reprinted by Kensington) on which the movie ''War and Love'' (written by Abby Mann and directed by Moshe Mizrahi) and the Broadway play ''The Survivor'' (written by Susan Nanus) was based. He produced documentary films and appeared in many others based on the Holocaust. He established the first Institute of Holocaust Studies at CUNY with public scholarly lectures and the first chair in Holocaust Studies at the Harvard Divinity School. Jack was the inspiration and sponsor of the controversial Goldberg Commission created to investigate the role played by American Jews during the Holocaust and chaired by Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. In 1993 he created the Children's Memorial Monument in Warsaw at the entrance of the Jewish cemetery dedicated to the one and a half million Jewish children killed by the Nazis. The memorial is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. In 1995 he organized the first Holocaust memorial event ever held at the Vatican at which Pope John Paul II presided. In the past decade he turned his attention to lecturing and writing on the role that Christianity and its teachings contributed to the Holocaust. He dedicated himself to promoting ChristianJewish tolerance and dialogue. His latest book ''The Happy Boys'' deals with the immediate postwar struggle of his group of orphaned teenage friends to rebuild their lives after the concentration camps.

Beloved daughter of the late Charles Cohn and Bella Cohen Cohn, adored sister of Seymour Cohn and the late Mildred Cohn, Maurice Cohn, Irene Colvin and Sylvan Lawrence, devoted and loyal wife of the late Henry Miller, and cherished aunt and great-aunt to each and every member of the Cohen and Cembalest families. Born on October 20, 1906 in New York City, the youngest daughter in a large and accomplished family, Pearl devoted herself to her studies, eventually becoming a teacher in the New York City Public School System. As a young girl, Pearl began her life-long involvement with Tranquillity Camp. As the ideal embodiment of the Cohen family credo ''Noblesse Oblige,'' Pearl soon became the indispensable right-hand of her uncle, the late Elias A. Cohen, one of the truly great men of his time, who founded Tranquillity Camp in 1919. After his sudden passing in July of 1952, Pearl shouldered the tremendous responsiblity of keeping the Camp going. For well over 50 years, Pearl selflessly and tirelessly devoted every minute of every day to her family, and to each of the children whose character was so quietly and subtlely molded by her example. Despite her towering intellect and photographic memory, Pearl, like so many members of the Cohen family before her, never talked down to anyone. To us she was a unique individual, a giant. When flattered by anyone, she would characteristically brush it off with a small wave of her hand, saying ''It's nothing. I just do what I do.'' She made it all seem so simple.

Expected by its founders to become the state capital, Marshall lost out through political chicanery (as local lore has it) to its upstart neighbor, Lansing. Today the old affront looks more like a blessing. On the one hand, Marshall, 171 miles east of Chicago and 117 miles west of Detroit on the railroad line that soon replaced stagecoaches, lost its chance to become the center of state government. On the other, the absence of development meant that hundreds of 19th-century houses were preserved and passed down for generations, making Marshall (population 7,459) a magnet for those who crave a weekend ''where the fast lane ends'' (as the chamber of commerce boasts on its Web site).",2003-08-31T05:00:00+0000

Like the boy in her story, Highsmith was a writer in search of identity. On every page of her cahiers and diaries the same self-searching questions are asked over and over again. Was she the sum of her consciousness? Or was her self merely made up of the perceptions of other people? 'There is an ever more acute difference ... between my inner self which I know is the real me, and various faces of the outside world,' she wrote in 1947. And could a writer, forever assuming the personalities of his or her characters, even have such a thing as a stable identity? ",2003-08-31T05:00:00+0000

The movie, based on a novel by Peter Gent, a former receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, is about a depraved professional football team, and as a kid I couldn't bear it. The players are loathsome cretins whose hatred for one another is matched only by their hatred for themselves. The coach is a cold, vicious tyrant, the games are murderous spectacles. The locker room is worse: with discomforting regularity, a hypodermic needle is jabbed into a player's mangled knee, and then he's good to go. Nothing -- not even the inept Joe Pisarcik's seemingly endless tenure as the starting quarterback for my beloved New York Giants -- was more depressing than this movie.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Follow This Dog,"A recent pick for Granta magazine's list of the top 20 young British novelists, Dan Rhodes has made a leap from his clever short fiction to TIMOLEON VIETA COME HOME: A Sentimental Journey (Canongate, $23), a whimsical, menacing exploration of thwarted love. The Timoleon Vieta of the title is a stray mutt with an affectionate disposition and eyes ''as pretty as a little girl's.'' His latest master is Cockcroft, a washed-up gay composer whose lonely exile in Umbria is interrupted by the arrival of a young man known only as the Bosnian. This dour and rather sadistic fellow proves less adept at conversation than at the once-weekly sexual act with which he pays his rent. The Bosnian's hatred of dogs and Cockcroft's regrettable decision to choose man over man's best friend results in Timoleon's banishment, and it is the dog's arduous journey home, or rather the stories of those he encounters along the way, that constitute the second half of the novel. This cast includes a broken-hearted Welsh woman, a deaf Italian girl, a Chinese orphan and a tragic Cambodian family. Although these narratives seem pointlessly digressive at first, they accrue into a powerful pattern of love and loss among the damaged and doomed. The worldview here would not be unfamiliar to admirers of James Purdy, and Vien Thuc's witty dog illustrations, incorporated into the book, lend emotional shading to the tale. Rhodes's unadorned prose style is either translucent or plain, depending on your taste, but his presentation of the thorny dream of life is sad, funny and often riveting.

The young ones, his son among them, had been sent out of the fields an hour or so before the adults, to prepare the late supper and, if there was time enough, to play in the few minutes of sun that were left. When he, Moses, finally freed himself of the ancient and brittle harness that connected him to the oldest mule his master owned, all that was left of the sun was a five-inch-long memory of red orange laid out in still waves across the horizon between two mountains on the left and one on the right. He had been in the fields for all of fourteen hours. He paused before leaving the fields as the evening quiet wrapped itself about him. The mule quivered, wanting home and rest. Moses closed his eyes and bent down and took a pinch of the soil and ate it with no more thought than if it were a spot of cornbread. He worked the dirt around in his mouth and swallowed, leaning his head back and opening his eyes in time to see the strip of sun fade to dark blue and then to nothing. He was the only man in the realm, slave or free, who ate dirt, but while the bondage women, particularly the pregnant ones, ate it for some incomprehensible need, for that something that ash cakes and apples and fatback did not give their bodies, he ate it not only to discover the strengths and weaknesses of the field, but because the eating of it tied him to the only thing in his small world that meant almost as much as his own life.
