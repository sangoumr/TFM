Turn and loosen the soil every other week if necessary and water well. If extra water does not help ailing trees, call the Forestry Division of your borough's Parks Department; the number is in the telephone book in the City Government section. A tree planted within the year is still the responsibility of the landscape contractor who planted it; he should also be informed of its poor health. Report a dead street tree to the Forestry Department and request its removal, along with the stump and root system, to facilitate replanting later. Try to determine the cause of death - neglect, vandalism, insects, disease - so that a more appropriate species may replace it. Street tree information is available from the Horticultural Society of New York (757-0915). Tree tips in English or Spanish are also available free from the Street Tree Consortium.

In recent years inflation has tremendously increased the number of homeowners who do the job themselves. Modern exterior paints are easier than ever to apply. And if a good quality paint is carefully applied, results can last longer than ever before. In addition, today's latex paints brush out smoothly and simplify the cleaning of brushes, rollers and other tools. premature cracking or peeling, or they fail to end up with the kind of job that they had hoped for - even when a top-quality paint is purchased. In most such cases, the first impulse is to blame the brand of paint, but more often than not some common-sense rules were not followed in preparing the surfaces or in mixing and applying the paint. To help minimize such disappointments, here are some rules to follow: * Before starting, take time to check all caulking around window and door frames and siding and trim joints. Joints or seams that are open where caulking is missing or cracked will allow water to enter and soak into the wood or masonry, and this is one of the most frequent causes of premature paint failure. * Replace dried out or cracked putty around window panes with fresh glazing compound after first scraping out all of the old material.

us,Music View;          SINGING IN PRAISE OF SILENCE,"Old wives to the contrary, silence is not golden. If it were, silence would be heavily traded on international markets, fetching $400 or $500 an antidecibel in London or Zurich. No investment portfolio would be complete without some. Speculators would get rich investing in silence mines. Silence would be hoarded and used as a hedge against inflation. Periodically, the United States Government would drop hints that it was considering going on the silence standard. On crowded Manhattan streets, chains of purest silence would be snatched from the necks of unwary pedestrians. But no. Silence breaks all the market rules. One of the scarcest and most necessary commodities, it is remarkably undervalued. Although there is precious little of it to be found lying about, nobody seems to covet the stuff. For instance, investors apparently did not rush the other day to take up the generous offer of Victor Fuentealba, who proposed to give the American public a sizable block of silence stock, without charge. Mr. Fuentealba, a Baltimore saxophonist and lawyer who is president of the American Federation of Musicians, suggested that all the music in the world be turned off for a day to dramatize the importance of musicians to our daily lives. Live musicians, according to Mr. Fuentealba, are an endangered species that needs protection, perhaps by a tax on blank recording tapes. Anyone who pauses to consider the advance of musical technology in the last 100 years or so will understand Mr. Fuentealba's concern, and his suggestion could indeed have an impact, in a quiet way. He failed to indicate how his plan might be carried out, a minor detail. However, the idea of pulling music off the market for an entire day is the dream of a utopian economist and hardly a practical proposal. I myself know from experience how the real world greets such noble ideas. Some years ago I proposed forming a syndicate to finance the world's first radio station devoted exclusively to broadcasting silence. The station, provisionally known as WPAX, was to be a blow for world peace - a noiseless blow, but a blow. The organization would have been capitalized at several million dollars and I myself was penciled in as board chairman, president and, of course, treasurer. For reasons best known to Wall Street, the project did not get off the ground. The financial community greeted it with silence. Nonetheless, I remain convinced that the world needs WPAX. It was dismissed by shallow minds as an unsound idea, but the financial wise guys probably got a good laugh out of the vacuum tube, too. Consider what WPAX could mean even today to a nation in danger of losing its hearing because of the tyranny of noise and noise's more respectable brother, broadcast music. WPAX proposed to transmit silence for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, on a powerful clearchannel beam that would have enabled you to tune in from Hawaii or Alaska or Del Rio, Texas. On this listener-supported station you would hear the purest nothing that modern electronic technology could achieve, no more. With the arrival of Dolby and other noisereduction systems, the silence could now approach an unearthly quality, unpolluted even by stray wisps of static. Nothing but velvety silence, at the twist of a knob, suitable for contemplation or, if you liked, the home production of string quartets or piano music. People could turn on WPAX and sing madrigals, or engage in solo humming. WPAX would be a station in contact with its audience, not merely a corporation pushing a product. A monthly nonprogram guide would describe in detail exactly what music you would not be hearing at any particular moment. A point would be made of not broadcasting, for example, the complete works of Telemann or the ''Ring'' in all available versions. For modest subscription fees, one would receive not only the guide but a copy of John Cage's ''Silence'' and a Tshirt on which nothing was printed. I suppose every sensible person would agree now that our failure to float the WPAX project has been injurious to the nation's musical health, if not to its hearing. Where can the harassed citzen turn for relief, especially in these raucous summer months, from the sound of what the majority of American citizens calls music? The arrival of those holstered little cassette players with their minuscule headphones has been welcome, certainly; let the noise-mesmerized citizenry destroy its musical sensitivity and lose its hearing as unobtrusively as possible. But the peculiar form of intergenerational hostility known as the big-box radio still afflicts us, and the mistuned steel-drum still serenades its metal mate throughout the sleepless city night. Storefront loudspeakers pound out endless rock in hopes of anesthetizing us to the point where we may wander in and buy a heliotrope leisure suit or a pair of cardboard shoes. Souvlaki and pizza parlors, not content with wafting their odors over helpless bypassers, also fling out their aural garbage by means of public-address systems apparently left over from the Munich rallies. Whether you choose to go by foot, by bus, by subway or taxi, you will march to the tune of salsa, reggae, rhythm and blues or the caterwauling of Sinatra. We who have ears and still are powerless not to use them are the daily victims of what the police call victimless crimes. All this sonic cholesterol clogs the ear passages and dulls the soul. The Beethoven Ninth, piped continuously through the brain for years, remains the Beethoven Ninth, granitic and unassailably great. But the brain, weakened by wear like a stone worn away by dripping water, finally refuses to relay the message of Beethoven to the soul. The Beethoven begins to turn to mush and its pounding excitements can no longer be felt in anything like the way Beethoven intended. At last, beaten into submission, the brain and soul are hard put to distinguish between the Beethoven Ninth and Ninth Avenue, between the tingles of Bach and the jingles of Toyota. You know this. We all do. And yet we resist the prophets such as Mr. Fuentealba who would free us from bondage to endless noise in the guise of public music, especially recorded public music. Perhaps we fear the alternatives: if Muzak disappeared from elevators and dentists' waiting rooms, would we have to think of things to say about the weather, as was necessary in primeval times? Do we fear the evangelists of austerity who might want to inaugurate Mozartless Mondays or Wagnerless Wednesdays? Perhaps we hesitate to protest because someone would be sure to charge us with trying to block technological progress: if everyone insisted on hearing music only when he or she chose, would the geniuses of the recording industry have been driven to take us from the 78-rpm record to the LP, and then into the age of stereo? (I stop short of the age of digital, which sounds more like a heart drug than a musical remedy.) I can hear the protests now, however. A world without cassette players? Without Percy Grainger on the strand? Without reggae in the subway? Without the complete Nocturnes, Waltzes, Mazurkas and Scherzos of Chopin on automatically, eternally reversing tape? Without the Beethoven Ninth, the Beethoven Ninth, the Beethoven Ninth, the Beethoven Ninth ...? Yes, it might be worth trying, if only for a day. Mr. Fuentealba's suggestion is a beginning and with the power of 280,000 live musicians to back him up, who knows where it might lead. There might, of course, be better and more practical plans for saving the nation from musical pollution, but that is for impartial investors to decide in their own time.

But musicians sometimes suggest another reason for the clarinet's sudden demise and the saxophone's ascendency: the saxophone is an easier instrument to master. Modern musicians have stayed away from the clarinet not only because there were few contemporary clarinetists to serve as role models, but because the instrument makes such difficult demands on both the lip and the mind.",1981-07-05T05:00:00+0000

It is filled with substitutes, though: with flashbacks to Pennsylvania farmland in the early 1890's, with unexpected entrances, with small sad ironies, with letters read aloud in counterpoint, with unbounded though profitless yearning. Helena, the most matronly of four sisters who have had very bad luck in love, longs for a time when the house seemed afloat in lilacs. Rebecca, the youngest, sits on a stoop out in dusty Nebraska - she's the only one who's married and she vigorously hates her husband - dreaming not of a new lover but of the clean sidewalks she's left behind her. And all four, when they are together, look forward wistfully to accepting an uncle's long-standing invitation to visit Manchester, England.

If every biographer were as scrupulous about the facts, as respectful of the work of his predecessors, as fascinated with his subject, as dutiful toward his readers as Roger Tennant, there would be no bad biographies. While those qualities alone may not ignite into revelation, they stand as safeguards against foolishness and phoniness. ''Joseph Conrad,'' though not the last word on the subject, much less the first, is a clearly written, modestly delivered work that never insults our intelligence or strains our good nature. Here are the formative years in Poland of the ''Pole, Catholic, and Gentleman,'' and the famous years at sea, which at age 30 Conrad would begin to transmute into his marvelous tales. Here are the first glimpses of figures who would grow into such reverberating creations as Almayer, Lingard, Kurtz and Lord Jim. As recognition came to Conrad, so came contacts with such lions of the day as John Galsworthy, Henry James, H.G. Wells, Stephen Crane and Ford Madox Ford. The final years of success were filled with illness, restlessness and brooding, the end of the tether. Given his conviction, expressed in the introduction, that Conrad is ''the greatest writer in the English language,'' Mr. Tennant's lowkey tone is somewhat anticlimactic. His occasional essay at criticism tends toward the conventionally appreciative. On the uses of Marlow as Conrad's narrator in ''Heart of Darkness,'' he writes: ''This method of distanced retrospection allowed Conrad to control his material, to select the significant and the symbolic, and to develop those shifts in time that made the finished story a complex work of art.'' The cool reticence becomes constraining when Mr. Tennant has to deal with Conrad's brushes with women. There are hints of some emotional infirmity or impotence, yet his attachment to his wife and children was powerful. Much remains cloudy, but then Conrad, though a tempting mark for psychology, has never proved an easy one. In a sense, he was a secret agent. Roger Tennant would no doubt concede in his modest way that there are depths of Conrad's personality that he was not able to sound, shadows that he was not able to penetrate, an unassailable darkness at the heart of this chronic alien existing on a cultural shadow line - this unorthodox conservative who shaped a foreign tongue into a prodigious instrument at the service of a prodigious imagination. The facts are here, clearly laid out. If it's revelation you're after, there are always the books. STRUCTURES OF AMERICAN SOCIAL HISTORY By Walter Nugent. 206 pp. Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University. $12.95. Camouflaged by the graphs, jargon and other apparatus of the professional demographer is information on such interesting items as sex, work, money, chance and dreams. Although Walter Nugent does his best to put off the merely curious with his stonewall title, he cannot altogether prevent human desires and drives from intruding into his pages and making them intermittently readable. Elaborating respectfully on the work of such celebrated analysts as Marx and Engels, Malthus and Frederick Jackson Turner, Mr. Nugent divides America's demographic history into four phases: 1500-1720, which for some reason he likes to call Vorzeit, or prehistory, when the Colonies were developed by immigrants from northern Europe while the native Indians were being decimated by disease; 1720-1870, ''the frontier-rural period,'' when young people settled cheap land, reared large families and built the West (''The average number of children born per average woman in her lifetime, as of 1790, was almost eight''); 1870-1920, which for some reason he likes to call ''The Great Conjecture,'' when the frontier closed and factories opened, drawing millions to new jobs in the cities ( and the ''Nordic alarmists'' of the 1920's ''predicted the exhaustion of oil, minerals, lumber and food supply within a generation or two unless population were controlled, by immigration or other means''); 1920-2020, our own ''Metropolitan Period,'' with its radical changes in family arrangements. Mr. Nugent commiserates with white American men now in their 20's and 30's, the boom babies, who find themselves competing for jobs with women and with minority groups entering the middle class. This is an era when productivity is down and the working young must support increasing numbers of the nonworking elderly, who are the beneficiaries of advances in medical care and social legislation. But demographers think in generations, and for the long term Mr. Nugent is sanguine. As long as population growth is contained - and he draws from history the grounds for his belief that it will be - he foresees a reinvigorated economy, with women, minorities and the elderly developing the skills to realize their inherent productivity and enrich the nation. He leaves us with the hope that if the American people do not again ignore Malthus as they did in the self-confident 1940's and 50's, and if they ''resume their semirational, semiconscious understanding of the relation of population to opportunity in a frontierless age, which put brakes on population growth, their future should be brightly bourgeois again.'' We should live so long. I HEAR THEM CALLING MY NAME A Journey Through the New South. By Chet Fuller. 255 pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. $12.95. How many generations of reporters will have to go tramping through the ''New South'' before it is worn down into middle age? This account confirms that for the many blacks still working the white man's land for subsistence, or forced to hold two low-paying jobs to meet their bills, or without any job at all, the newness was never all that new. Chet Fuller, a young black reporter for The Atlanta Journal, traveled around four states in three months of 1978, posing as a job hunter. He is fair to the individual whites he encounters, such as the gas-station rednecks who help him out when his car breaks down, and he has a good ear for the street-corner jiving of the aimless young black men he meets wherever he goes. Now and then he hears about progress in race relations. ''You know,'' a hard-working Georgia man tells him, ''if you whup a cracker fair and square now, he just whupped. Used to be - and not long ago - white folks could do anything to you they want, and you couldn't fight 'em back. Now you can whup they head.'' But that is the exception. Mostly, he learns that power still resides with the white landowners, plant bosses and politicians. ''Gadsden is rotten,'' a black woman tells him in a town where white policemen have recently killed a black man. ''They sho' don't b'leeve in helping no black folks here. The way them polices shot Madden, it's a crime. The polices here treat black people like dogs. They can't ask you a simple question, and then when you go to answer it, they tell you to shut up. Just like you ain't grown yourself. That's the way they do.'' Mr. Fuller works hard at padding the book out with his own feelings as an educated comfortably situated black professional confronted by the misery of blacks who have not made it and have no hope of ever making it. But that sort of introspection takes a different talent than most journalists can claim. Still, nobody is likely to quarrel with his observation that ''Your color still matters in the South, in this country.'' He finds no black faces in the front offices where he goes to ask about jobs, and much white manipulation behind the scenes. In the records office of a North Carolina county, he digs into the story of an elderly woman who was induced to put up her interest in 87 acres of land as collateral on a loan of $615 for heating oil - and lost the land.",1981-07-05T05:00:00+0000

us,A WINNING MIX OF ELECTRONIC INNOVATION AND LYRICISM,"''As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls'' (ECM-1-1190), a collaboration between the young jazz guitarist Pat Metheny and the keyboardist and his quartet, Lyle Mays, blends elements of jazz, rock, and turn-of-the-century Impressionism into an evocative quasiclassical music of shimmering translucence. It represents a new direction for two musicians who are best known as jazz-fusion artists. The album takes its name from the 20-minute tone poem that fills up the first side. A sound collage that juxtaposes several layers of keyboard texture and spare guitar against the light, agitated rhythms of the Brazilian percussionist, Nana Vasconcelos, ''Wichita Falls'' is a moodily atmospheric work with the pictorial quality of a sound track. Though no program is given, the score strongly suggests an extraterrestrial visitation with some of the plot elements and mystical overtones of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind.''",1981-07-05T05:00:00+0000

In London, more than 250 arrests were made and more than 40 people were injured. Blazes broke out in at least six sections of the city. William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary, said he could not rule out the use of troops in situations of ''extreme ferocity.'' (Page 1, Column 6.)

To an outsider, it might seem that the critics were being perverse. No fewer than five musical hits arrived on Broadway this season: ''42nd Street,'' ''The Pirates of Penzance,'' ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' ''Woman of the Year'' and ''Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music.'' By and large, these shows got favorable reviews from members of the Critics Circle, as did a sixth musical, ''Tintypes,'' which failed to find a large Broadway public. So why didn't the Critics Circle get together behind one of the six and christen it the best? You'd think we'd all come down with amnesia.",1981-07-12T05:00:00+0000

Paterson has not changed much since the early 1950's, except for the ripping down of a few downtown buildings in the expectation of an urban renewal that never came; if the city looks in any way different from 30 years ago, it is that its center seems just a little bit older and a little bit more tired.",1981-07-17T05:00:00+0000

Fluorescent's glare does not enhance intimate dinners, nor is it imaginable as the cozy light emanating from the woodcutter's cottage of fairy tales. Basically, the tube is the light of offices and subway arcades, and when Dan Flavin first brought it into art galleries during the 1960's, he was, in effect, doing what Marcel Duchamp had done with his ready-mades nearly 50 years earlier. Mr. Flavin has continued to work with neon in its pure form, placing the bars sometimes in their ''natural'' context, as at the railroad tracks at Grand Central Terminal and in the entrance to the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. But he has also explored, through color, the medium's expressive possibilities, besides revealing himself as a romantic through his rapid expressionistic drawings of landscapes.",1981-07-17T05:00:00+0000

It affirmed a commitment to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, efforts to ''improve regional and global stability'' to help deter countries from developing nuclear arms and to make the United States a more ''predictable and reliable'' supplier of nuclear technology for peaceful uses.

Herds of Dama gazelles and Addax antelopes gallop about a pasture thick with delicate, blue toadflax flowers, shaded here and there by massive oaks. In the southern Sahara, the Addax - which resemble small reindeer with long, twisted horns - have been decimated by oil-rig crews and nomads; on the island, their numbers have increased from six to 35 since 1975. The population of Dama gazelles in their northern African habitats have been destroyed by hunters and the competition from domestic animals that have intruded on their grazing lands. The Aldabra tortoises, natives of islands in the Indian Ocean, graze quietly in their enclosure. Five species of cranes settle into nests they've built in their own swampy enclave. Saint Catherines, a Bronx Zoo outpost, is a refuge for many endangered species of northern and central Africa. It can be reached only by a 30-minute boat ride.",1981-07-19T05:00:00+0000

These bits of memoir, published for the first time in ''The Last Laugh,'' are the tailpiece to a collection of 17 of Perelman's comic sketches for The New Yorker. Even in its fragmentary state, ''The Hindsight Saga'' strikes me as the best thing Perelman ever wrote.

When we published our first zucchini recipe in the early 1960's, it was a considerable oddity. There were very few people who were conversant with its uses in casseroles, creamed dishes, salads or the many other dishes it can enhance. It was still so unfamiliar to most in the 1960's, in fact, that it was necessary to define it among the ingredients as ''green Italian squash'' when we wrote about it. Today, the number of zucchini admirers and the recipes they develop increase every day. No matter how often we use zucchini throughout the summer, we are never bored with it. Our favorite recipes include zucchini in casserole and stuffed zucchini. The list of things that may go into a stuffed zucchini is a long one.

In most states and in the Federal courts the judicial system treats as juveniles children under age 18, but in New York, Connecticut, North Carolina and Vermont only those under 16 are so treated.

The agreement was announced in Jerusalem by Philip C. Habib, the special American envoy, and a separate announcement was later made in Beirut by the Palestine Liberation Organization. An Israeli official said that the Lebanese Government had indicated its willingness to try to curb the Palestinian guerrillas. (Page 1, Column 6.) The P.L.O. accepted the cease-fire. Kurt Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, which participated in the negotiations, said that Yasir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, had sent him a message saying that his guerrillas would honor a cease-fire ''if the other side did.'' Both sides handled the ceasefire acceptance in a gingerly way. There appeared to be face-saving on both sides that enabled them to say that they had not made a deal with each other. The Israelis avoided the term ''cease-fire'' and said it was not an agreement but an arrangement with the United States and the Lebanese Government. (1:5-6.)",1981-07-25T05:00:00+0000

(Page 1, Col. 6.) The United States thanked three of the leaders involved in bringing about the cease-fire that ended 16 days of intense shelling on the Lebanese-Israeli border.

At the end of a rough day, they may experience muscular aches across the upper back. While that is certainly a painful inconvenience, eventually office workers can become so worn into their individual variations on the slumped position that they assume them unconsciously. And the long-term effects of poor posture are even more serious -if simple steps to correct it are not taken.","The office-slump problem can often be traced to a sheer lack of energy, according to Dr. Howard F. Hunt, chairman of the physicaleducation department at the University of California, San Diego. ''Because of this lack, people begin to sag noticeably,'' he says. ''They just don't seem to have the energy to sit tall and walk tall - and to remind themselves to sit taller and walk taller. So the upper-body muscles in front, the pectorals in particular, become shorter and tighter, and this makes the slouch that much more difficult to correct. At the same time, the supporting muscles in the upper back - especially the trapezius and deltoid muscles - become longer and weaker and so fail to keep the shoulders from slumping forward. All this makes for the rounded back and rounded shoulders.''",1981-07-26T05:00:00+0000

What could still be construed as a sectarian view of art in that distant period is now firmly established as a vital tradition that commands the loyalty of many living artists. Geometrical abstraction of the sort that Mondrian introduced into modern painting may still have its portion of highly vocal enemies - there is almost no artistic position on the current scene, after all, that doesn't - but that in itself is a proof of its continuing existence.",1981-07-26T05:00:00+0000

Eliot, and one of the few new shows of merit was written in 1871 by the Russian playwright, Alexander Ostrovsky. Eliot's posthumous contribution is to Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, ''Cats,'' the most popular English musical since the composer's pre-Eliot collaborations with Tim Rice (''Jesus Christ, Superstar,'' ''Evita''). London has quickly become ''Cats'' conscious and a Broadway production is inevitable. At the same time, theatergoers are joining the queue at the Royal Shakespeare Company's small, experimental Warehouse Theater to see ''The Forest,'' which comes to London from the R.S.C.'s home at Stratford-Upon-Avon.

The bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee and now before the Senate is similar to the Administration's substitute House bill in many respects. DEMOCRATIC BILL INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES Would reduce tax rates for 1981, 1982 and 1983. Democratic tax writers do not see much reason to reduce withholding taxes on Oct. 1 and might give 1981 tax relief in form of a 1982 refund after returns are filed. Democratic cuts in rates would average 10 percent in 1982, 16 percent in 1983 - but relative reductions would be greater below $50,000.
