This is his first independent move; he is still the executive chef at the West Village restaurant Perry St., owned by his fathers company. So the name, Wayan, meaning first-born in Bali, is fitting.

Theres greenery throughout for a tropical feel, and the design, by Rockwell Group, includes custom Indonesian decorations.

us,"A Retreat in Vietnam, Cult-Inspired Dressing and More","Soon after the turn of the 20th century, Sapa  a verdant Vietnamese mountain town known for its terraced rice fields  became a stylish retreat for French colonials who would take the train from Hanoi for visits to their country villas and to a now-defunct sanitarium. Today, travelers come to hike the misty trails linking Sapa to surrounding stopped-in-time villages such as Ta Phin and Cat Cat, whose residents sell handmade brocades and silver jewelry. For the new 249-key Htel de la Coupole, set in a mustard-yellow building in Sapas Muong Hoa Valley, the Bangkok-based architect and designer Bill Bensley was interested in how, a hundred years ago, these types of artisanal goods made their way to Paris and ended up influencing Western fashions. I found a 1920s haute couture hat in Paris, which was basically a Vietnamese rattan hat covered in white and red polka dots, and decided to do the entire hotel like that, he says. To that end, there are cane and velvet barrel chairs in the high-ceilinged cafe, Cacao Patisserie, and, in some of the bedrooms, French lounge chairs covered in graphic hill-tribe fabrics and linen-colored pendant lights draped in tribal silver beads. Bensley, who believes a hotel should be a layered, even intellectual adventure in itself, has also hung some 500 vintage fashion illustrations and ads throughout the property and erected a lobby installation lined with industrial-size bobbins spooled in jewel-toned threads that recall not just vibrant silks but also the lush orchid gardens of nearby Ham Rong Mountain.

Gilkisons crop goes into products containing cannabidiol, or CBD. People still titter.

South Beachs famously louche night life has fanned out across Biscayne Bay and onto the mainland, along with cutting-edge art galleries, top-notch restaurants and funky but chic boutiques. The growing pains are unavoidable  traffic jams may sprout up anywhere, and some residents of previously off-the-radar neighborhoods arent exactly thrilled with the rent hikes that come with being discovered. The upside? An already dizzying multiculturalism has only gotten richer: Little Haiti and Little Havana now find themselves competing for attention and influence with Little Venezuela and Little Moscow.

The designers Patric DiCaprio, Claire Sullivan and Bryn Taubensee have ended their fashion shows with a white floor-sweeping terry-cloth bathrobe (spring 2018) and a bouffant chefs smock accessorized with a two-foot-tall toque (fall 2017). But this fashion week, the designers presented perhaps their most memorable showstopper yet: a gown (of sorts) which they titled the Big Pretty. A mountain of lilac satin topped by a gift bow the size of a beach ball, it was so wide that it brushed showgoers knees on both sides of the runway. The idea was a riff, explains DiCaprio, on an early fashion meme: a series of newspaper cartoons from the 1850s depicting women drowning in excessively large dresses and captioned with a version of death by crinoline. The oversize bow, meanwhile, evoked a giant housewarming gift. The designers had been thinking about domesticity, an idea that informed looks in pajama-like stripes and a shiny brocade reminiscent of 80s-era curtains. They looked, too, at domestic portraits by Tina Barney, whose subjects often seem inseparable from the chintzy dcor of their living rooms.",2019-02-14T23:18:56+0000

As for Rimbaud it frequently was; his flailing misadventures with his lover Paul Verlaine are a case study in knives, bullets, profanity, theft and dubious personal hygiene. The idea behind this outr behavior was that deranging the senses doesnt simply mean sitting at your desk having especially unusual thoughts; it means actively surrendering to your own unconscious and often unconventional desires.

It is a salvage or rescue mission, finding a use for the lowliest of products  yesterdays news. In an age rife with the sleek and the minimal, papier-mch (chewed paper in French), has less-than-mythic associations: It is homey and sloppy, redolent of kindergarten and the corner store. Like clay, papier-mch is infinitely moldable, but instead of coming straight from the earth, a noble mix of raw minerals, it has lived another life entirely, from tree to pulp to industrial printing press to breakfast table to garbage bin to art, before emerging entirely unrecognizable in sculptural form.",2019-02-22T13:00:10+0000

While reading it, I was frequently tempted to head to the kitchen and fry some onions, the step that starts many of the Eastern European recipes in his book, especially those attributed to an aunt and notably to Oksana, a Ukranian woman and a magical cook who was his grandfathers companion in Brooklyn.

us,Overproofed Gin for Your Martini,"Navy-strength describes a category of gin thats overproof, that is, more than the standard 40 percent alcohol for most spirits (and sometimes more than 50 percent). But why Navy? you may ask as you sip your gin and tonic. In the British Navy, the shipboard gin supplies traditionally included casks, usually from sherry-making, that held high-proof gin reserved for officers. If gin (or rum) could ignite gunpowder, it gave proof that it was not diluted, and had to be at least 57 percent alcohol. Simon Ford, who makes Fords Gin, has now introduced his Officers Reserve, a Navy-strength gin at 54.5 percent alcohol. Like Fords Gin, its London-style, dry and infused with classic botanicals and spices, like juniper, which impart subtle flavor. The alcohol gives it heat, which can be tempered with ice and a splash of lime and good tonic water. It does well in a martini, with a little more than a soupon of vermouth.",2019-02-25T22:23:06+0000

When the employee in the Midwest was offered the position, the hiring manager did not consult the human-resources department and offered her a salary above the typical range. The employee in Florida was hired just a few days later and was offered a salary several thousands of dollars below what the Midwestern employee makes. The cost of living is significantly less in the part of the Midwest where the white employee lives, making the wage difference illogical.

Beginning in late 2016, a series of anonymously sourced reports claimed that Trump was not taking the brief with sufficient frequency, or seriousness, or focus, or preparation. Even after the inauguration, there were claims that the spies did not trust him and were holding the good stuff back; there were claims that Trump did not even believe in objective reality. In the middle of it was Pompeo, Trumps new C.I.A. director, who some in the presidents circle felt was the man best suited to educate Trump about the complexities of foreign policy.

These were places that served what was then referred to as Continental cuisine, their menus drawn from those of Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom and filtered through an American sensibility. Now, Keller is returning to the comfort food of his youth with TAK Room, opening in Manhattans new Hudson Yards complex later this month. The 180-seat, two-story space (with a wraparound gold-leafed Cubist-style mural on the ground floor and a grand polished walnut staircase leading to the second) will offer clams casino, oysters Rockefeller and cornflake-crusted crab cake served with coleslaw and spicy mayonnaise as well as classic mains such as roasted chicken for two, Dover sole in brown butter and parsley-topped strip steak. These dishes might be paired with an expertly mixed Rob Roy or Tom Collins and, for dessert, theres spumoni and ice cream sundaes. Im not trying to invent anything, says Keller. But he is trying to build a New York restaurant more approachable than Per Se, his celebrated fine-dining outfit farther uptown. It used to be that you ate out to meet friends and to celebrate, he says. There was a real sense of fun. To that end, TAK Room diners can look forward to live music and table-side preparations, which, Keller believes, arent about showing off technique so much as personality.
