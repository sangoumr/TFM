us,Screen: A Battle Fought Strictly for the Camera:Bondarchuk Directs Craig's 'Waterloo' Rod Steiger Portrays Ill-Fated Napoleon,"Sergei Bondarchuk's ""Waterloo,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater, has at least to its credit that it means to be about the battle itself, essentially about the events of June 18, 1815, which resulted in Napoleon's defeat and the end of his second bid for power. As to the film's historical accuracy, I am not competent to say. In matters of record it seems to follow the encyclopedia accounts of the battle; in places it feels rather like an encyclopedia account. But the sense of the film itself is another matter, and the particular dullness of Bondarchuk's attempt to translate history into cinema makes ""Waterloo"" a very bad movie.In most non-essentials, ""Waterloo"" has all the look of qualitythe muted colors, the selection of realistic detail, the concern for a compositional control so obsessive that in each phase from the marshaling of troops to the joining of the battle, to the arrangement of corpses when the battle is over, any frame might be excerpted and labeled ""handsome"" or ""effective."" But in movies the look of quality is almost always a crushing bore. And Bondarchuck especially applies his delicate palette with the subdued refinement of a sledgehammer.Thus, when Blcher leads his troops to Wellington's aid (""Raise high the black flag, tzhildren!""I wish I could duplicate the accent), they are observed from a great distance by Napoleon and his generals. Napoleon wonders whether they are indeed the Prussians or perhaps much needed French reinforcements. But we don't wonder, because we have been hearing ""Deutschland Uber Alles"" in the cellos and basses on the soundtrack for quite some time. And not only in sound, but also in image, Bondarchuck orchestrates his filmmore or less the way Tchaikovsky orchestrated the Battle of 1812.Occasionally his methods work, as when by helicopter shot he spectacularly demonstrates the logic of the failure of Marshal Ney's cavalry charge against the allied infantry square at La Haye Sainte. But more often those methods amount only to ways of filling up the screen or parts of the screen with fleshed-out schema. The shadow of ""Alexander Nevsky"" hangs heavy over ""Waterloo"" (as, in fairness, it hangs heavy over almost every classy battle movie from ""Henry V"" down) and the drama it inspires has less to do with humanity or history than with a mechanical rhetoric of cinema.Against this background it it difficult to speak of performancewhich most often resembles a more or less detailed caricature worked out before a frieze of significant events. As in most movies of this type, in any 20 lines there is likely to be something laughable (I greatly admired Napoleon after Ney's debacle, running up to his command post screaming ""What's he doing? Can't I leave the field for a minute . . . ?"")which, given the frailties of historical epic, is not the point. Actually, much of the film's cast seemed to me pretty goodexcept for Rod Steiger.Steiger plays a peace-loving Napoleon, crafty, tired, much weighted with the destiny he seems never to get off his mind. Like a Willy Loman not wholly aware that he has lost his territory, he alternately schemes and complainsas if, in addition to all his other achievements, he had discovered at Waterloo the sources of theatrical naturalism. It is an awful performance, and every mannered point of it is emphasized by the elephantine selectivity of Bondarchuk's cameranarrowing upon the eyes, a weary fold of flesh, the carefully hunched back, the hat, the pudgy man's walk.During the first parts of ""Waterloo,"" when Napoleon is much in view, I thought that no director, not even Bondarchuk, merited Steiger's performance. Later, in the heat of the battle, I felt that not even Steiger need have suffered through Bondarchuk's direction. But now critical calm has put all things in perspective, and I realize that they richly deserved each other.",1971-04-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Clint Eastwood Is Star Of Siegel's 'The Beguiled',"Donald Siegel's ""The Beguiled,"" which opened yesterday at the Cinerama and the R.K.O. 59th Street Twin Theaters, sounds simple enough on paper: Clint Eastwood, as a wounded Yankee soldier, charms and then terrorizes the ladies who nurse him back to health at a very peculiar, more or less forgotten, Louisiana seminary during the closing days of the War Between the States. Nothing, however, is as straightforward as it seems in ""The Beguiled,"" not even its perversities.Take, for example, the lovely opening sequence in which a little, 12-year-old girl comes upon the body of the soldier in the forest. She is, at first, frozen with fear. Through her mind we hear her wonder whether her father died the same way. Cut to the soldier, and through his eyes we see a curious, shapeless child swim into focus.They talk, exchange names, and just before the child helps him to stand, he draws her down beside him and gives her a long, not really friendly kiss on the mouth. She's confused, but immensely happy.The film thus begins as a quite odd Civil War romance, evolves into a battle of the sexes in which the man is more vanquished than victor, and then turns into the kind of grotesque character comedy that mightmistakenly, I thinkbe identified as gothic horror. There is certainly horror in ""The Beguiled,"" but it is played for what amounts to an extended, completely silent laugh.Whether this is intentional or not, I've no way of knowing, but there's no other way to explain the amusingly overripe excesses in a film by a man who has, heretofore, managed to make films that were more complex in effect and a good deal more simple in design (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"").""The Beguiled"" is Mr. Siegel's 26th film, as well as his most ambitious and elaborate. I'm not referring to the sets, costumes and Spanish moss-hung locations (the exteriors were filmed in Louisiana at a fine, photogenic, old plantation), but to the narrative style. The movie employs, in addition to straight exposition, interior thoughts spoken on the sound-track, flashbacks that contradict spoken dialogue and the kind of fantasies commonly enjoyedaccording to literary conventionby hashish smokers, sailors and sex-starved spinsters.In fact, every major character in the movie, with the exception of Eastwood, is a female suffering to a greater or lesser degree from the need for a man, including the little girl (Pamelyn Ferdin) who first finds the soldier, the precocious 17-year-old (Jo Ann Harris), who seduces Eastwood with the graces of Belle Watling, and the sweet virginal teacher (Elizabeth Hartman), who comes close to being an unequivocally decent person, the only one in the film.The most deprived (ergo, according to Hollywood Freud, the wildest and most dangerous) woman is the seminary's headmistress (Geraldine Page), whose initial flashback, as she stares at the bloody, maggoty soldier, is to the bed in which she and her brother made frenzied, slow-motion love. My favorite fantasy, however, is Miss Page's wine-induced dream in which she, Eastwood and Miss Hartman make love and then assume the positions of a piet, more exhausted, I suspect, than sorrowing.This is very fancy, outrageous fantasizing from the man who gave us ""Riot in Cell Block 11"" and"" Baby Face Nelson,"" and must strike horror in the hearts of those Siegel fans who've made a cult of his objectivity. ""The Beguiled"" is not, indeed, successful as baroque melodrama, and, towards the end, there are so many twists and turns of plot and character that everything that's gone before is neutralized. People who consider themselves discriminating moviegoers, but who are uncommitted to Mr. Siegel will be hard put to accept it, other than as a sensational, misogynistic nightmare.I must say that I found it interesting (even when it approached the ludicrous) because of its place in relation to other Siegel films and because I have nothing but appreciation for the performers, especially Miss Page, Miss Hartman and Mr. Eastwood, who, by simply reacting well, has become an important actor of movies.One final note: The screen credits list John B. Sherry and Grimes Grice as authors of the screenplay, adapted from the novel by Thomas Cullinan. Those are the pseudonyms, respectively, of Albert Maltz, who did the initial screenplay, reported to have been a romantic comedy, and Irene Kamp, who did the rewrite with help, I'm told, from Claude Traverse, the associate producer. This may explain some of the peculiarities of the completed film.",1971-04-01T05:00:00+0000

Some gifted people are involved in what turns out to be a neatly organized morality comedy with bright contemporary trimmings. The Faustian young hero is a bouncy but sensitive boy caught up in some Madison Avenue advertising and sexual coils and some hang-ups of his own.The best thing about the picture is the funny, blithely warm performance of Peter Kastner, the young Canadian actor who came on solidly in ""Nobody Waved Goodbye"" then marked time in ""You're a Big Boy Now."" He's dandy here as a hip but wistful operator who succumbs to office intrigue and an influential female octopus before seeing the light.With young Mr. Kastner appealingly front and center, the movie skips along jauntily, wisely and amusingly, reined in by a snug cluster of key performances and the pointed, tart dialogue. The excellent cast includes Joanna Barnes as the steely octopus, JoAnna Cameron as a sex-hungry kook, Louise Sorel as Mr. Kastner's patient fianc, Gary Burghoff as his pal and Richard B. Shull as a wily executive. Add a funny cameo by Mary Lou Mellace as a car rental agent, and a well-utilized rock score by Jimmy Dale and Mark Shekter.This marks the first feature written and directed by Steven H.

us,Screen: 'The Emperor and General':Japanese Film Shows Last Hours of War Young Officers' Group Weighs Surrender,"Kihachi Okamoto's ""The Emperor and the General"" is a very long, very careful dramatized account of the events surrounding the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. A Japanese movie, it deals almost wholly with the shaping of internal policy from just before word of the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, until the Emperor's broadcast of the acceptance of unconditional surrender on Aug. 15. However, the film is mostly concerned with the 24 hours preceding the broadcast  the drafting and recording of the speech, the suicide of War Minister Anami, the futile attempt of some young officers to destroy the recording and continue the war to destruction.As historical document, I suspect that the film is meticulously accurate, with everyone saying or doing what, on record, he did say or door, at the very least, saying and doing what, under the circumstances he would have said or done. To an almost stultifying degree, the action is confined to meetings of the cabinet, press conferences, audiences with the Emperoruntil the brief rebellion is joined and suddenly all hell breaks loose: blood gushes, bodies fall and heads, literally, roll.The aim of the young officers, under a Major Hatanaka, is not to win material advantage so much as to assure that Japan's behavior at the last should hinge not on the matter of victory or defeat but on the continuance of an honorable mode of action. This is a theme, and a real one, worth making a movie about, and it has been rather badly slighted in ""The Emperor and the General"" in favor of a suspense plotwill Japan surrender successfully or won't it?that in a film made more than 20 years after the fact seems a little silly.In curious ways the movie (and not just the characters in the movie) seems involved in Emperor worship. On the one hand it hides Emperor Hirohito from the camerabehind screens, doorways, people's backsallowing only the slightest symbolic identification, the way a cigarette holder or a black scotty used to signify President Roosevelt in the more reverent old American movies. And on the other hand it devotes very nearly obsessive attention to the outward signs of the Emperor's willto drafting, recording and even correctly copying out the proclamation. About half way through, ""The Emperor and the General"" begins to seem like a Kafka subject that has somehow been misread as semi-documentary.Some distinguished actors appear in the filmMifune, of course, and the wonderful Chishu Ryo, a regular in the Ozu stock company. But the rebellious officers (I am able to identify only Toshio Kurosawa) play broadly for mad rage, and in its treatment of the military ""The Emperor and the General"" looks distressingly like the rape of the Pacific, the way grade-C American movies showed it during World War II.Most of the rebels tremble with anger. But one of them, the commander of a naval air unit that mounts a kamikaze attack (not the film's finest moment) trembles both with anger and from pesky bouts of malaria  and his performance is perhaps the chief absurd glory of the movie.""The Emperor and the General"" opened yesterday at the Bijou Cinema.",1971-04-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Flight of Doves':Dublin Background for Tale of 2 Orphans,"""Flight of the Doves,"" which opened yesterday at the Loew's State 2, is a movie for kids. It is also a movie that parents are supposed to want to take kids to and this, I think, results in a genuine conflict of interest. On the one hand the film promotes an adventure-escape story that is adequately both terrifying and funny. But on the other hand it indulges in picturesque scenery for charm's sake, suffers adult sentimentality about little children gladly and, as if unsure about its fiction, interrupts it for various pointless entertainments.The worst of these is an ecumenical St. Patrick's Day production number, like something out of a 1940's B-musical, set in a park in Dublin. A lot of local talent appearsalong with Orientals, black Africans, tan Africans, continental European nationals and an Orthodox rabbi  and everybody dances a jig and shakes his arms and sings a song that goes, I swear, ""You don't have to be Irish to be Irish."" If you can value this, or even stomach it, then your soul is with the Horn & Hardart Less Work for Mother Children's Hour, and you are all by yourself a one-person generation gap.St. Patrick's Day, like the scenery, is mostly eyewash. But Dublin is in Ireland, and Ireland is where Finn and Derval Dove, young orphans with an inheritance that becomes a price upon their heads, have fled to escape a wicked stepfather and to find a kindly grandmother and a place they can call home.The stepfather gives chase, as do assorted cops. But the real danger is from a pursuing uncle, failed actor and half-master of disguise named Hawk Dove, a man of mixed impulses.The flight and chase are well-managed, except when we pause to sing and dance, the characters are generally complicated enough for interest and the balance between comedy and terror is sharp enough to establish a real and rather exciting tension. I could have done with less of Dorothy McGuire's Granny O'Flaherty and Helen Raye's Derval Dove (neither indomitable advanced maturity nor sweet little girlhood being my favorite ages of women), but the men are good, sometimes quite elaborately good.Jack Wild succeeds for me as Finn Dove because despite his determined professionalism he seems humanly to hate his part and to suggest a reservoir of surliness that redeems his casting as cute kid. I thinkat least I hopethat he is going to be a good actor.Ron Moody plays Hawk Dove, a virtuoso role, like a virtuoso, and so often does the film depend upon his ability to transform caricature into character that I cannot imagine its (relative) success without him. Ralph Nelson (""Charly,"" ""Lilies of the Field"") has never been one of my pantheon directors. But enough good things have happened in his movies, such as Candice Bergen's performance in last year's ""Soldier Blue,"" and now, in quite different ways, Ron Moody's in ""Flight of the Doves,"" that I should like this review to be a notice in his favor.",1971-04-03T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"A mood of autumnal stillness hovers over this work, one of regret for vanished beauties, for glorious moments that have disappeared forever. It is almost as if Harold Acton were writing not his memoirs but those of another whose life he knew he could never duplicate. Everything lies in the past: the art, the literature, the build ings, the experiences, the values, even the people. For Acton admits that those who have meant more to him belonged to an older generation: Bernard Berenson, Max Beerbohm, Norman Douglas, Osbert Sitwell among others. And even his nearer con temporaries, like Evelyn Waugh, were those who shared his feeling for a vanished time. Although Acton is partly American, it is interesting how he was turned off by an extended visit to this country after World War II. He could appreciate the dy namism of America, but he was not at tracted by it and certainly did not want to be swept up by its energy. There was more life for him in the museums, libraries and private collections of good friends than in the streets and alleyways of Chicago, for example. ",1971-04-05T05:00:00+0000

The failure, say, of ""Zabriskie Point"" is a failure in personal vision and it is not subject to correction. But when an entertainment goes wrong, all sorts of ideas spring to mind, for everything is subject to correction.It was therefore in a fever of vicarious creativity that I sat through Robert Fuest's ""And Soon the Darkness,"" which opened yesterday at the Forum and Murray Hill Theaters, and which should have been a good movie.Two British girls alone on a bicycle holiday in France, deserted stretches of country road, a few small towns with roadside cafes, flat reaches of open field interrupted only by an occasional overgrown wood unpleasantly dark in the glaring light of the dayelements that the film puts to purposes of atmosphere and terror with considerable economyuntil it loses its purpose and squanders everything it has earned in a mad effort to preserve suspense.Ultimately ""And Soon the Darkness"" tries to keep you guessing by the expedients of disguising good as evil and of providing so many false clues that not even the fruitiest denouement (in fact there is no denouement) would justify them.Everything hinges on the disappearance of one of the girls, the suspicion of sexual assault, the inability of the other girl to make herself understood or to learn what the local people think and fear themselves. Until the disappearance and for a while afterward everything goes very well toward building tension with understated effects. But eventually, by mere repetition, the understated effects begin to look like poverty of the imagination. Then terror becomes a function of gratuitous camera technique, and danger the product of dishonest characterization.The minor characters seem unusually well detailed in ""And Soon the Darkness,"" and because none of them speak English, the details merge into interesting patterns of frustrated hostility. The secondary people who do speak English (Sandor Eles and Clare Kelly) fare less well, at least partly because they must contend with some of the larger idiocies of the plot.I liked both Pamela Franklin and Michele Dotrice as, respectively, the prudent and the imprudent of the two girls. Pretty and a little plump, by no means glamorous, they are, if only for the matter-of-factness of their portrayals, exactly right for their parts. And Miss Franklin, who does the principal work in the film, keeps her mounting fear well the proper side of hysteria.",1971-04-05T05:00:00+0000

Four Syracuse pitchers walked a total of 24 batters as the middies trotted to a 241 victory. But there is some good college pitching around, such as Coach Jack Kaiser's staff at St. John's.

Maureen Forrester's recital at Carnegie Hall on Sunday night, part of the Art of the Lied series, proved the point. The Canadian contralto, supported by John Newmark's expert though rather sketchy and smallscaled pianism, drew her own artistic profile while doing nothing but justice to songs of Mahler and Wagner. She emerged as an artist of great honesty, directness and warmth, not unexpectedly in view of her past recitals. But Maureen Forrester as a ??? tamorist? Yes, that too. Among the six songs she chose from Mauler's Des Knaben Wunderhorn, two of the most successful were the broadly funny Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt (St. Anthony Preaches to the Fish) and Wer hat dies Liedlein erdacht? (Who Thought Up This Song?). In the latter, Miss Forrester's ease in sustaining the longheld notes was both literally breathtaking and charming. In the darkerhued songs such as Urlicht, Wo die schnen Trompeten blasen and Das irdische Leben, the recitalist's seriousness and cellotoned contralto captured the mood more predictably, of course.",1971-04-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Inscrutable 'Snow Country',"For two long hours, ""Snow Country"" unreels with three Occidental strikes against it The import is playing a two-day engagement, ending today, in the Japanese series at the Bijou.In any case, the film should only confuse many American viewers who believe geishas to be traditional prostitutes and also those who know them to be highly trained companions. The picture is a highly indigenous drama, based on a novel by Yasunari Kawabata (a Nobel Prize-winner, no less), that throws little light on its background, much of it being a geisha house, not to say the characters.Most of the time the rather petulant geisha heroine, played by Keiko Kishi, and her painter-lover, Ryo Ikebe, stare at each other fondly, quarrel or pad around in the snow bewailing the hopelessness of it all.Indeed it is hopeless, with skimpy English titles that are occasionally downright baffling. That's hitch No. 2, at least on this side of the Pacific.Finally, the static, fragmentary and clipped-off facade of the picture suggests that the esteemed director, Shiro Toyoda, has deliberately siphoned out the whole thing to suit himself or home audiences, which is admirably chauvinistic but hardly enlightening here. The picture is never moving consequently, as it sketches the tender affair of the principals. For that matter, it's hard to tell if the two key performances are low-keyed or simply listless. Personally, we were more intrigued by the fresh-faced vivacity of the supporting Kaoru Yachigusa.The picture is different, granted.

us,' Shinbone Alley' Recalls Lives of archy and mehitabel:Marquis Theme Opens at Guild Theater,"it s one day up and the next day downi led a romantic lifeit was being abducted so many timesas spoiled me for a wifedance mehitabel dancetill your old bones fly aparti aint got any regretsfor i gave my life to my artfrom ""mehitabel dances with boreas"" by Don Marquis""Shinbone Alley,"" which opened yesterday at the Guild Theater, is a musical cartoon feature about the late Don Marquis's philosophical cockroach named archy and archy's best friend, mehitabel, the down-at-the-heel alley cat to whom archy was a sometimes stern, sometimes astonished, but always fond Boswell. The movie, based on the 1957 Broadway show, has its ups and downs but, unlike the generous, ever optimistic mehitabel, I got my regrets.Except for one flaw, I might have forgiven the movie almost everything, including its rather ordinary, Tom & Jerry animation style, which occasionally peaks into designs in the now boring fashion of Max, and its musical score, which is, at best, reminiscent of Kurt Weill, not at his peak. ""Shinbone Alley,"" after all, should send one back for a re-read of the original vers libre pieces that archy, more than 50 years ago, began to plunk out on the boss's typewriter (whose capital letters and punctuation marks were beyond his cockroach capacities).However, one thing about the movie must be unforgivable, at least to Marquis fans: the physical transformation of its heroine into a sleek, apparently sexy, cartoon pussycat, an unhappy feline sort of mix-up between Auntie Mame and Dolly Levi, with a voice provided by Carol Channing. Gone, lost in an earlier transmigration, is the indomitable old mehitabel who, as first drawn by George Herriman, looked like a refugee from Mr. Herriman's Krazy Kat world, a beat-up, emaciated lady with a gimpy hind leg and patchy, perpetually frozen fur that she tries to warm by dancing and singing the night away on the cobbles.Paradoxically, this cleaned-up, chic mehitabel, accountable to the animation designs of John D. Wilson, the film's director, is at odds most of the time with Joe Darion's screenplay. If you simply listen to the film, without watching it, you can actually hear the ferocious spirit of mehitabel behind all the pretty make-up. She is most definitely there, for example, when she staggers home to Shinbone Alley after a very short affair with a torn named big bill. Mehitabel says she has left big bill, but archy, somewhat petulant, points out that she never left a tom in her life. ""I left ralph,"" says she. ""ralph! ralph!,"" screams archy, ""mehitabel, ralph was dead!""There is another bitter, pure Marquis sequence when mehitabel returns to Shinbone Alley with a litter of very tiresome, very unwanted kittens. With amazing, matter-of-fact cool, she discusses ways of disposing of them, in the river or maybe just by leaving them in a garbage can during a heavy rain. (They are not on hand at the end of the movie.)I thus am somewhat torn by this conflict between sound and image, resenting the rehabilitation job effected on the mehitabel, and yet cherishing those apparent reminders of what she once was, a toupours gal old dame with the soul of Cleopatra, the airs of Emma Bovary, the artistic longings of Isadora Duncan, the hangovers of Dorothy Parker's Big Blonde, and the sexual resolve of ""Trash's"" Holly Woodlawn.I suppose it would have been impossible to make an easily appreciated cartoon feature in the bleak visual style of Mr. Herriman's black-and-white drawings. The film's producers at least pay homage to the cartoonist in two short sequences. These are nice enough in themselves but have the effect of making the rest of the movie look as hard and idiosyncratic as a fresh marshmallow.Eddie Bracken provides the voice of archy and John Carridine is tyrone t tattersall, who has the best song in the show, a lament to the theater's good old days titled ""They Don't Have It Here."" I suspect that if it weren't for the attractively jazzy orchestrations, it would be impossible to remember the movie even has a score.""Shinbone Alley"" is a little like the old mehitabel. It suffers from split personality being based, as it is, on works that must go over the heads of 8-year-olds (at least those who won't know what's happening when archy gets rolled in a bordello staffed by ladybugs), but it's executed in a mostly juvenile style that's not too far removed from what the children see on television. It's a very mixed bag and this, in case you hadn't guessed, is a very mixed review.",1971-04-08T05:00:00+0000

Emshwiller is a cinematographer of considerable accomplishment, and even those who have not much cared for his films (""Thanotopsis,"" 1962; ""Relativity,"" 1966; etc.) have admired their camera work. In his collaborations with others, for example as photographer of ""Hallelujah the Hills"" (1962), it is difficult to say much about Emshwiller's contribution that isn't praise.""Branches,"" which opened last night at the Film Forum, where it will play on Thursday through Sunday evenings for the next two weekends, represents something of a collaboration. During the summer of 1970, Emshwiller was in residence at Cornell University where, together with a good many students, he made this filmwhich I trust was as much fun to put together as it now is to see.As the film's hero (Bill Weidnerlong-haired, bearded, and always wearing an undershirt marked with No. 1) sits in the student union listening to a friend (Christian Larson) tell a tale of improbable sexual success, he notices a pretty girl (Connie Brady) at the next table and fantasizes an affair with her. There may also actually be an affair. ""Branches"" is at no pains to clarify this, and I doubt that it matters much.What does matter is the succession of comic confrontations, somewhere between blackout skit and dramatic agon, that are the film's substance and the better part of its style.Actually there is rather too much style in the serious-cinema sense  superimposed images, repetitions of actions with minor variations, a chorus that alternately praises and blames the hero for obvious reasons. At its most pretentious worst, ""Branches"" looks a lot like a college arts festival, with much expressive formalism, a collection of modern dancers, and a ballerina who occasionally wanders through in the background.But at its least pretentious best it looks more like some of the nicer parts of college itselfintelligent, clever, at ease with its own discomforts. Bill is the kind of seducer who gets rejected even in his own fantasies, so I find him easy to identify with. And in the course of the little sketches, the returns to the battlefield of the daybed, that identification becomes an increasingly more rewarding pleasure.There are several other confrontations (all the talk is improvised, I understand)between Bill and an art-as-politics freak, between Bill and a Black Power theoretician, between both Bill and Connie and a women's liberationist and, best of all, a girl (Erica Saxe) forthrightly on the make for Bill. I loved the last and her rage at the beautiful Connie (""You are an evil person. Your hair is evil!""). But I loved Connie moreher reserve, her coldness, her appetites, her complexities, her arrogant good looks.Near the end, Emshwiller, who is old enough to appreciate a bit of sexual metamorphosis, dances her into a tree. He is very good at this sort of thing, and in ""Branches,"" by grace of the life he fosters around himself, he earns his ecstasy.",1971-04-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Valdez Is Coming':Burt Lancaster Stars in Vengeful Western,"""Valdez Is Coming"" is a revenge Western, set in post-Civil War Arizona, about a man whose principles are somewhat loftier than those of the movie that contains them. It stars blue-eyed Burt Lancaster, wearing a lot of dark brown make-up, as a discriminated-against Mexican constable, and it was directed by Edwin Sherin, the man who directed the prizewinning stage version of ""The Great White Hope."" It opened yesterday at the Victoria Theater on Broadway and at other theaters throughout the city.Within the first half-hour of the movie, Bob Valdez (Lancaster) is humiliated, called a greaser, shot at and mock-crucified, all because he wants to raise $200 from the white men responsible (along with himself) for the killing of a black freed-man, a murder-suspect later known to have been innocent. The money is to go to the black man's pregnant Apache woman.This bare description of the plot will give you some idea of the film's very contemporary racial sensibilities, which though honorable, are simply the dcor of a harmless Western. On second thought, perhaps, it's not quite that harmless. The humiliations suffered by Valdez early on, as well as the ruthlessness of the villains, are of such unequivocal nastiness that the film's ultimate satisfactions come not from the triumph of honor, but from the scope of the revenge.As in almost every Burt Lancaster movie, I'm not sure how much of ""Valdez Is Coming"" was directed by the star, and how much by the director. A lot of fancy flourishes, which I associate with Mr. Sherin's stage work, are apparent in the film, as in its picturesque groupings of picturesque characters, and in a musical score that's much given to comment on the action. Mr. Sherin, I suspect, is also responsible for the film debut of the several New York actors in the cast, only one of whom, Jon Cypher, shows up to advantage.Mr. Lancaster himself is simply beyond criticism, an enduring star whose screen personalitydecent, liberal, tough, well-intentionedprovides the shape of the movies that are constructed around him.",1971-04-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Familiar Songs:' Celebration at Big Sur' Depicts Pop Festival,"""Celebration at Big Sur,"" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is an account of certain features of the Big Sur Festival of 1969 after Woodstock and some time before the end. The music  by Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Dorothy Morrison, John Sebastian, and others  is mostly folk and rather gentle rock. The movie making  by Baird Bryant and Johanna Demetrakas  ranges from the obligatory coy to the needlessly reverent.The film purports to give the feel of Big Sur, but, public relations to the contrary, I doubt that the feel of any event is really available to anybody not directly involved. At least in this case, the various zooms into, and stop shots of, the audience reveal little except that good-looking kids look good. And the freak shows and interviews around the edges seem mainly to exist for the camera.The camera, in a movie like ""Celebration at Big Sur,"" can be an instrument of oppressiontaking more than it gives, making meaningless demands at the wrong times. For example, as Joan Baez sings ""David's Song,"" we are offered not only Joan Baez singing, but also a butterfly on a branch, a sunflower, a baby in its mother's arms, and an ocean of surf pounding the craggy coast of California. This is not an extension of the music so much as a reduction of the musiccomparable to pictures in a non-picture book, or what happens to Bach in ""Fantasia.""Whether you care to see ""Celebration at Big Sur"" will depend mostly on whether you care to see a number of familiar people performing music you probably know already. Carol Ann Cisneros, a Texas folk singer who is new to me, sang one classical-sounding Spanish ballad, and she seemed very good.John Sebastian's lax sweetness is not to my taste, and I am afraid I admire Joni Mitchell as much for the ravishing planes of her face as for her music. Her performance of ""Woodstock"" received the most offensive movie treatment, with a kind of fiery-edged negative montage of her hair to accompany the refrain ""We are stardust, We are golden . . ."" Joan Baez sings songs by Dylan (""I Shall Be Released"") and herself, and I guess she is the spirit of Big Sur, and overwhelming as she is, I am am not at all sure that the nobility of her presence ultimately compensates for the fortuitousness of her lyrics.",1971-04-10T05:00:00+0000

us,The Mephisto Waltz',"Shift ""Rosemary's Baby"" to California, with the nice young couple abruptly exposed to some chic, jet-set zombies, including the world's greatest pianist. When this old demon dies, the husband acquires both his soul and pianistic genius, pounding out Liszt to prove it.The sensible wife, who squares off early with the old musician's horrible dog, expects and gets the worst, with a couple of murders. Add some angular photography and a spooky, haunted-house score pelting us in a miserably infantile botch of occult suspense titled ""The Mephisto Waltz."" The picture, opening yesterday, is terrible.Style and subtlety might have done the trick this time, whatever the merits of Fred Mustard Stewart's novel. But this shrill, heavy-handed exercise only makes us appreciate ""Rosemary's Baby"" all over again.Are there good things here? Several. One is the candid, clear-eyed performance of Jacqueline Bisset as the anguished wife. (Hello again, Mia.) Some of the color interiors are handsome. The casting of Curt Jurgens as the nasty old genius is interesting. It's intriguing, too, to hear Liszt's ""Mephisto"" hand-breaker pinched out thematically and surfacing the clanky swirl of spook music added by Jerry Goldsmith.However, Alan Alda, as the supposedly satanic hero, seems nothing more than a genial, naive climber. As his witchy seducer, Barbara Parkins purrs acceptably. Bradford Dillman is lost as a sideline doctor.At one point, before the goblins close in, Miss Bisset casually says, ""The laundry didn't come back."" Oh yes, it did  from ""Rosemary's Baby.""",1971-04-10T05:00:00+0000

Yet three years later he wrote the Firebird ballet for Serge Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, and overnight he became famous.

One, Miriam Wasserman's The School Fix: NYC; USA (Outerbridge & Dienstfrey, $10), is notable for its effectiveness in linking concrete examples of school practice to general inferences about the social functions of public education.

To make the most of a view across Central Park, they took out the walls of three small rooms to make one impressive room with an expanse of windows. Because the new space needed furnishings of similar scale, the architects designed a 40footlong table that is not just for dining (above).

The book cost him nearly two years, punctuated by his own illnesses, the crippling of his wife, the failure of his bank, and the constant professional attentions of Ford Madox Ford, then called Hueffer, who actually seems to have written parts of it.

us,"' Buraikan,' Japanese Movie, Evokes Village Life","Chalk up ""The Scandalous Adventures of Buraikan"" as another Japanese import worth seeing at the Bijou Playhouse in its current series. The film opened yesterday and runs through tomorrow.We haven't the foggiest notion whose scandalous adventures the title indicates. What do come across, minutes after the opening, are the boldly mercurial direction, an arresting use of color and a pulsating flow of vignettes depicting a village in mid-19th-ccntury Japan.Masahiro Shinoda, one of his country's prominent young directors, sets the story in motion vividly, briskly weaving terse fragments that create a teeming rogue's gallery of kimonoed players. This picaresque stirring of characters and incidents is even enhanced by some snappy English titles, as when one young buck approaches a stately geisha and professes his love. ""No kidding?,"" she retorts loftily. Good for you, baby.The story, looping together the vignette strands, gets even better and more meaningful as it pinpoints the village's feudal subjugation and simmering rebellion. Unfortunately, instead of coming down to earth hard for an explosive climax, the film coats an ageless themerevolt against oppressionwith artful but obvious theatricality. Thus the picture sheds its juice and impact.Most of the performances have a good cutting edge, especially those of Tatsuya Nakadai, Suisen Ichikawa and Shoichi Ozawa. Mr. Shinoda's interesting movie is derived from a well-known Kabuki play. It remains far more engrossing when concerned with mischief, mockery and intrigue rather than with history  the old, old story.",1971-04-13T05:00:00+0000

We roared as she joined the other wives in the kitchen, but her husband, staring after her with proud male possessiveness, said You think she's kidding, don't you?  Well, of course she was. And yet, at the point late in Harding Lemay's memoirs that the anecdote occurs, it would not have seemed incredible if the machinegun bullets had been real. The Lemays were that kind of family.

They deal with other matters, too: loss of pride and dignity; the blighting of children's lives, the narrowing of horizons, the resentment that builds up in a man's mind under unending economic pressure until it takes heaven knows what form. But these are dividends of the basic need. The problem of the people studied in these books, who live in the Mississippi Delta and in Appalachia, in the eastern part of Kentucky, is how to get through the month fed and warm. Both books are forthright and uncluttered. They are free of jargon and sociological rhetoric. And they cover roughly the same ground, except that half of Tony Dunbar's volume is devoted to the blacks in the Delta, Louise, whereas Bill Surface restricts himself to Appalachia. Their methods resemble each other a trifle, too. Both took down verbatim the talk of the people they interviewed. Mr. Dunbar, a young and earnest Southerner who has worked on various community programs, quotes from them in formal question and answer paragraphs when they suit his need. Mr. Surface, magazine writer and native Kentuckian, has used the talk to give an almost fictional finish to his chapters as he shares the life of one family for five days in the heart of winter.

She is Margo, heroine of a new Israeli film called ""Margo,"" and she is something of a handful, being a good 50 pounds overweight.Margo has just escaped an assault on her virginity attemped, as nearly as I can tell, solely because it is there) and she is therefore a little apprehensive about Talmor's kind invitation to come in and warm up. But Margo isn't fat for nothing, and the Talmor household offers her marvels yet unknown: ""What a wonderful kitchen! Your wife must be very happy.""""My wife seldom visits the kitchen"" (in a tone usually reserved for ""my wife can never have children,"" or the like).""Who cooks for you? . . .""And that is the real interest, the meat and potatoes and cream soda with the main course, so to speak, of ""Margo,"" a film that in most respects is no different from any other disillusioned-maturity-meets-innocent-youth-and-discovers-love movie  except that it is much worse.There are all the paraphernalia of the crystalization of love, the usual lovers' poses in romantic places (in this case, shrines of the three major faiths), even a nude love-making scene  which confines itself to very selective details on account of Margo's special plumpness problem.But the thrust of ""Margo"" is really somewhat antiromantic, and try as it will to feel, it really wants to moralizeto show what is wrong with his wife, Shoshana (Beracha Ne'eman, and the worst of the film's many ludicrous performances) that Dr. Talmor should want to leave her and give up his university post that her father. Professor Levinhartz, pulled so many strings to get for him.What is wrong, of course, is that she doesn't cookwhile Margo cooks up a storm. Not gourmet things, mind you, but the wholesome well-seasoned foods that are the way to a man's heart. ""Margo"" may be the first love-story movie in which the tenderest close-ups are reserved not for the heroine's face or figure (understandably), but for her handsslicing the raw onions that will go into her lover's salad.",1971-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Angel Blake, a girl who'd probably be no better than she should be under any circumstances, throws caution to the winds and attempts to seduce the Rev. Fallowfield by revealing her breasts. He remains faithful to God, but most of the children, one by one, capitulate to the dark powers, some to be served up as sacrifices, some simply to serve as aides de camp.I've resisted the temptation to call this high camp because ""The Blood on Satan's Claw,"" of which the foregoing is only a most general prcis, is cinematic diabolism of some style and intelligence, nothing, perhaps, to confuse with ""Les Vampyres,"" but still a horror movie of more than routine interest. It opened yesterday at the Harris Theater on 42d Street in the company of another British film, ""The Beast in the Cellar,"" which is of routine interest.Although ""The Blood on Satan's Claw"" is based on an original screenplay by Robert Wynne-Simmons, it has a good deal of the quality of an H.P. Lovecraft work, in the vulnerability of even its heroic characters, as well as in its pastoral landscape that contains the threat of ""eeveel"" within every sun-dappled glade. Most particularly, it contains Lovecraft's perfectly straightfaced acceptance of a universe whose natural order may, at any time, be overturned by supernatural disorder.The film is the second to be directed by Piers Haggard but, as far as I can learn, it's his first to be released in this country. Mr. Haggard, a former member of Britain's National Theater and assistant to Lindsay Anderson on the stage production of ""Luther,"" is apparently a director of some authority, having avoided the intimations of humor contained in a number of the character names, and having resisted the orgiastic fruitiness to which the horror films of Freddie Francis are so often heir.Of the performers, I especially liked Linda Hayden, as Angel Blake, the sort of girl who, fully clothed, could have easily unhinged Salem, and Patrick Wymark, as the stern, rather Old Testament judge who finally gets to the root (and claw) of the problem.""The Beast in the Cellar,"" written and directed by James Kelly, looks and sounds very much as if it might have first been planned as a bad play for the ladies who rattle teacups during London matinees. It's about two elderly sisters, Flora Robson and Beryl Reid, who hide something in the basement that keeps getting loose and carving up the soldiers on a nearby army base. The ladies spend most of their time in the parlor, drinking tea and talking the plot over and out.Anyone interested in seeing ""The Blood on Satan's Claw"" would do well to catch it at one of the neighborhood houses where the double bill opens today. At the Harris yesterday, the projection was faulty, the audience restless, and the auditorium so brightly lit that the night scenes became light blue blurs.",1971-04-15T05:00:00+0000

Remember the time Abbie Hoffman, who was wearing an American flag, shared the guest bench on the Merv Griffin Show with Virginia Graham, who was wearing a lot of things that sparkled, rippled or were cinched in? The network blacked out Mr. Hoffman because his clothing was objectionable. Remember when Jerry Rubin appeared on a Channel 13 talk show and smoked pot and insulted liberals?Remember an underground movie called ""Brand X,"" in which Abbie, as naked as a jaybird, lay back in a bathtub full of money, which he set fire to, but then he had to climb out at the last minute, as if he had just remembered that self-imolation was not in his contract? Remember? It was only a year or so ago, when revolution for the hell of it was still something of a groove.Morley Markson's feature-length documentary, ""Breathing Together: Revolution of the Electric Family,"" contains none of these memorable moments, being, instead, a montage of events, personalities and reactions relating to last year's Chicago conspiracy trial. However, its principal actors are those spry, venerable old stars of revolution-as-burlesque, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and in revolution-as-burlesque, as in most other forms of theater, over-exposure (as well as complete exposure) can be fatal. It removes the mystery.Time has taken its terrible toll and although Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin were two of the eight defendants at the trial, they were the two least interesting, as well as the two most garrulous. From this vantage point, they simply are no longer as important as the issues raised by the trial and the manner in which the trial was conducted.This is the curious effect of Mr. Markson's very uneven film, which, when Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman are on the screen, approaches a purity of boredom, that is, in the revolutionary context, downright counterrevolutionary. If Mr. Robin, at one point, can stand and accuse America of boredom, so shall he be accused. That's show biz, gentlemen, which there is no other business like, except possibly revolution.The problem with ""Breathing Together"" as a movie is that it doesn't seem to realize any particular concept on the part of its producer-director, as much as it makes do with the material that could be obtained. Some of this is first-rate: R. Buckminster Fuller, seated in a lawn chair, looking like a tidily tailored prophet, talking about the changes taking place in this country, about the evils of property, about our confrontation with ""invisible information"" (radio signals) and exhorting us to ""let go of the physicalapprehend the metaphysical.""It's just bits and pieces, but bits and pieces of Buckminster Fuller are better than entire chunks of the two stars. I also liked a couple of pastoral sequences featuring Allen Ginsberg, the poet and player, and was moved, with the help of hindsight, by a sequence showing a Chicago rally being addressed by Fred Hampton, the Black Panther leader shortly to be shot dead by Chicago police. That was not burlesque.However, ""Breathing Together"" never succeeds in fusing its various parts into a more meaningful whole. I. for one, know no more about the Chicago trial now than I did before I saw the film, which, though fancily edited, is ordinary journalism. It opened yesterday at the Whitney Museum for one week.In yesterday's review of ""The Blood on Satan's Claw,"" I inadvertently compared the film to ""Les Vampires,"" by Louis Feuillade. The comparison should have been to ""Vampyr,"" by Carl Drever. The difference is, roughly, the difference between gangsters (Feuillade) and ghouls (Dreyer).",1971-04-16T05:00:00+0000

us,A Samurai's Strategic Rise to Power,"Despite the Western-style music (I mean cowboy-Western), the familiar presence of Toshiro Mifune in the lead, the by now accustomed ordering of spaces and deployment of forcesit is just possible that Hiroshi Inagaki's ""Samurai Banners,"" which opened yesterday at the Bijou, belongs to an altogether stranger order of being than at first we might imagine. I think this because in all its extraordinary length (almost three hours) and for all its self-evident effort to be popular, it never seems, at least in ways that I can recognize, to rise above or even to equal the interest of its particular events.""Samurai Banners"" deals with an unattached samurai, Kansuk Yamamoto (Toshiro Mifune), a cripple and a brilliant military strategist, who insinuates himself into the service of a great feudal warlord of the Takeda clan whom he counsels in the early stages of the lord's ambitious career. The movie begins in the 1540's, with Takeda's first victories, follows his rise as one of the most powerful leaders in Japan, notes his admission to the priesthood (when he takes the name ""Shingen""), and leaves him in 1561 after a massive battle with another priestly warlord, Kenshin Uesugi, which proves indecisive but which results in the bloody death of the strategist Kansuk.I mention all this because ""Samurai Banners"" makes a considerable thing of historyincluding dates and war conferences and plans and even animated battlefield maps painted on the screen at the same time that it means to be something more than history, or at the very least to annex to its history a vision of personal tragedy destiny. Thus Kansuk falls in love with a princess (Yoshiko Sakuma) whom Takeda takes as his second wife and who bears him a son and a little later dies without even seeking more from Kansuk than a kind of gruff fatherly protection.But when he diesas a Mifune hero ought to die, an enemy arrow in one eye and maybe half a dozen more scattered about his bodyit is in his lord's service but for himself, so that he may join his lady. And this story might have made a movie of great traditional beautyinstead of the sometimes colorful but usually perfunctory pageant that ""Samurai Banners"" seems most charitably to be.Inagaki handles his camera with an expertisein massive tracks, elegant crane shots and demanding anglesthat wars with the basic crudity of his sense of the dramatic moment and makes for a nagging unpleasantness that always results when there is more technique than feeling, and when visual display exceeds any sustained sense of controlling idea.",1971-04-16T05:00:00+0000

The Walter Reade Organization has had the gumption to book it for three weekends at neighborhood houses, Saturday and Sunday matinees, starting today.The ""Born Free"" team, Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna, are back in Africa again, this time adopting a trio of elephants (Slowly is the name of the baby) who nose into their Kenya backyard, where the couple are housekeeping for some absent friends.Co-written by Mr. Travers and James Hill, producer-director, the picture is a tame, dramatically uneventful affair, nowhere near as finished or forceful as ""Born Free."" Frail and even rambling in structure, the picture edges purposefully into the wilds for some magnificently authentic animal footage.As Mr. and Mrs. Travers explore the veldt, the animals seems even more plentiful and varied than in ""Born Free"" (which has a sequel, ""Swing Free,"" still unrealesed here). The camera holds hard and close to the wildlife in fascinating detail, everything from humming birds to rhinos. The only jolt, handled discreetly, is the sight of some jungle wild dogs finishing off a gazelle.In one brief, charming sequence, the couple visit the animal farm of their old friend, George Adamson, whom Travers portrayed in ""Born Free."" The Traverses themselves are as personable and winning as ever. But it does take the picture a good half hour to get going, as they twitter around the premises rather coyly.

For a full year, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Klein combed nearby rural areas until they found their 150yearold dairy barn. It was part of a complex of farm buildings set on gently rolling land hedged. by stone fencesand it was about an hour's drive from the city. One floor had been converted for living about 70 years ago. Renovating was a thrilling experience, says Mrs. Klein. We lived in the barn and learned to love it. We knew exactly what to change and where to respect the old lines. The lofty living room was virtually unaltered, the kitchen was expcmded and the loft became the master bedroom. A second old barn was bought to provide suitably old and weathered materials for the renovation. We used every inch, reports Ellie Klein. The siding provided fronts for the kitchen cabinets (below), and the old floor boards were used to make the dropleaf dining table (at bottom).

us,The World,"The continental shelf of Asia, running from waters off Burma to the seas between China and Japan, has become the focus of an in tense search for oil. More than 50 companies are drilling, doing geological studies or hold ing concessions. This activity has drawn the attention of some antiwar groups that have charged that the United States is fight ing in South Vietnam to protect oil industry interests. Thus far, most Congressmen appear to consider the charges unsubstantiated. The Saigon Government, however, is interested in attracting the oil industry to the area. On industry's side, preliminary seismic studies of offshore Vietnam have labeled it as geo logically a good risk. Only two countries in the entire area are producing oil in substan tial commercial quantitiesAustralia and In donesia. Indonesia, the center of most of the activity, is now producing about 900,000 bar rels a day, almost entirely from onshore wells, but output is expected to climb to more than a million barrels a day this year, with the bulk of the addition coming from offshore wells. In the waters off Burma, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, the activity is confined to surveys or preliminary drilling. Every Asian nation would like to find oil at home or at least nearby, and this quest has brought Japan, South Korea and Taiwan into con flict over jurisdiction and rights to grant con cessions in certain sections of the East China Sea. Communist China also is interested in oil in the area. United States awareness of this was demonstrated last week when it warned the Gulf Oil Corporation, which has an exploration contract with the Chinese Na tionalists, that it could not protect survey or drilling ships in the disputed areas around the Senkaku Islands.",1971-04-18T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: Coming of Age in the 'Summer of '42':Good Humor Mark of Fine Arts Arrival Its Youthful Principals Grow Up During War,"Robert Mulligan's ""Summer of '42"" is a memory movie, written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don't think you'll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards. It is, perhaps, just a little too perfect, a little too symmetrical; not the way things really were, but the way they should have been (and the way they always are in recollections of tea and sympathy):The movie is the memory of what it was like to be 15-year-old Hermie, almost 30 years ago, spending the summer with his family on an island off the New England coast, longing to be a man among women but having to make do with Oscy, who was bigger and thus could beat him up whenever he wanted to, and Benjie, who was younger and dumber, but who had access to an illustrated marriage manual.It was a time of Unguentine, ""Mary Noble, Backstage Wife,"" Bette Davis movies, double-dip ice cream cones (for 12 cents), paddle ball, a distant war and immense frustration. There was the night, for example, when Hermie sat in the back row of the movie house, ecstatically caressing Aggie's upper arm under the wildly mistaken impression that he had somehow managed to grab hold of her breast.Racked with guilts and exploding with mad desires, Hermie conducts himself like Jack the Ripper, a mysterious lodger in his own house and a figure of some eccentricity abroad, especially to Dorothy, a war bride and the ""older person"" of 22 whom he loves from afar. ""You should be careful,"" he says when she goes shopping without a grocery cart. ""You could get a hernia.""""Summer of '42,"" which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is the story of Hermie's coming of sexual age under circumstances that are, I suspect, a good deal more common in novels and screenplays (and in the Hermie-like fantasies of middle-aged writers) than in real life.However, one of the good things about the film, which is based on an original screenplay by Herman Raucher (who later turned it into a novel, in the manner of Erich Segal), is the reticent quality of its romanticism, which is recorded by the camera matter-of-factly, not subjectively indulged or interpreted in the cinematic equivalents to purple prose.Not so strangely, what works in the screenplay fails utterly in the novel, in which Mr. Raucher gives every impression of trying to write up to the form (sand dunes are described as ""sulking in the grass,"" and mist is ""fickle,"" giving way to wind ""in spiteful little gushes""). As a novelist, Mr. Raucher has great need of the kind of direction and performances provided by the film.Nostalgia can be rather easily and cheaply obtained in moviesa little fuzzy camerawork, a sad old song on the soundtrack and a tear manufactures itself in the eye. Mr. Mulligan (""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Inside Daisy Clover"") knows all the tricks but, with the exception of Michel Legrand's background score, he employs them with discretion in ""Summer of '42.""He is particularly successful with his young performersGary Grimes as Hermie and Jerry Houser as Oscy, neither of whom betrays the mystery of his youthful status with the perfunctory mannerisms of child actors. They are exuberant and intense and very, very funny. Also fine are Jennifer O'Neill, as the ""elderly"" Dorothy, a girl of almost magical loveliness and vulnerability, and, in smaller roles, Katherine Allentuck (Maureen Stapleton's daughter) as the besieged little Aggie, and Oliver Conant, as the chicken-hearted Benjie, a guy who grows faint and flees at the prospect of a blind date.Mr. Mulligan shot the film in northern California, in and around Mendocino, where Norman Jewison shot ""The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming."" Then, as now, I was a little put off by the comparatively mountainous coast, which looks like Cape Cod might have looked before the Ice Age. That's not terribly important, however, in a romantic film whose foreground is mostly accurate, in which sexual panic and fist fights and nose bleeds are treated with the great comic respect they deserve.",1971-04-19T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Horror Tales:House That Dripped Blood' Bows Here,"The horror movie is inherently the most imperfect of genres, combining as it does an aspiration toward the sublime with the mechanics of the high school play. The combination may be naturalat least the way anything unavoidable is naturalbut it rarely engenders great art, and even we who love them must admit that most horror movies fail on every level. Such failure, however, may be more or less interesting. And it is in terms of the esthetics of failure that I am of several minds about Peter Duffell's ""The House That Dripped Blood,"" which moves in many directions, but never too far from the mechanics of the high school play.I mean that it is the kind of movie in which you never see the dark at the top of the stairs but that you may be sure a face will appear to fill it. Always on cue, doors creak, clocks strike 12 and lights flicker and burn low. Doors, clocks, lights and the dark at the top of the stairsall belong to a house that serves as the connecting link among the four brief vignettes that makes up ""The House That Dripped Blood,"" a film in which (as any connoisseur of titles will have guessed) neither the house nor anything else drips blood.The first vignette concerns a murder-story author who moves to the house with his beautiful young wife and who shortly thereafter begins to see the maniacal strangler he is writing about. The second deals with a retired business man, the house's next tenant, who, in the local wax museum (a wonderful convenience), discovers on exhibit a beautiful Salome with uncanny resemblance to a girl long dead. Whoever cannot immediately figure out the central twists to these anecdotes needs more than a movie review to help him. Both stories are as dull in development as they are in idea.But the latter two stories, though necessarily too short and too schematic, generate some interest, and humor, and even a bit of characterization. One of these has to do with a shy little girl whose father won't let her go to school with other little girls and especially won't let her play with dolls. And the other, a piece of quite charming silliness, tells of a horror-film actor who in his search for verisimilitude visits the local curio shop to purchase a cloak""Exactly what a Transylvanian vampire might have worn."" He gets his cloak, and though he feels a slight chill when putting it on, he finds that he kisses his leading lady with renewed intensity. . . .As a director, Peter Duffell, though at no time a stickler for needless subtleties does better, the better his material. In fairness I should say that when he doesn't have to creak a door, he doesn't; and when he can play with a characterization he does.In horror movies, I usually find myself liking actors, and for ""The House That Dripped Blood"" I also have a list. Ingrid Pitt, as the vampire lover's lady, for her face and figure, and Jon Pertwee, her flamboyant lover, perhaps mostly for his face. Chloe Franks, in the third story, is the most nearly bearable (and most beautiful) child actress I have seen. As her governness, Nyree Dawn Porter begins her performance in what looks like confusion, but ends by suggesting a complexity that helped make worthwhile an afternoon at the movies.""The House That Dripped Blood"" opened yesterday at the Penthouse Theater and the 59th Street East Twin Cinemas.",1971-04-22T05:00:00+0000

The movie, which opened yesterday at the Cinema Rendezvous, Murray Hill and Juliet 2 Theaters, is funny without being exploitative, important without being unduly earnest.All of the people in ""Derby""  the Roller Derby skating stars like Charlie O'Connell and Eddie Krebs, the would-be skating star, Mike Snell, his family and friendssomehow seem cheerfully disposed towards putting on an authentic show. The result is that ""Derby"" has both the authority of fiction and the ambiguity of truth, qualities that, when they were reversed, made Allan King's ""A Married Couple"" such a calculated, perhaps even self-deceiving, put-on.In his film, if you remember, Mr. King and his camera crew lived with a Canadian advertising man and his family through months of marital crisis, the details of which were presented as solemn truth, accidentally discovered. Much of ""Derby"" is equally intimate, as Robert Kaylor, the director, and his camera crew move in with the family of Mike Snell, a $147-a-week employe of the Dayton Tire & Rubber Co., to record something of the life of a young man who has no doubts about the identity of his dream.The difference between ""A Married Couple"" and ""Derby"" is hardly one of detail. Mr. Kaylor has gotten some remarkably personal footage of Snell family life, as when Mike, talking to his best friend, compares the sexual talents of various recent girl friends to those of his wife.There is a curious confrontation between Mike's wife, accompanied by one of her girl friends, with a lady down the block who has apparently been sleeping with just about any guy who'd drop around, including Mike. The women face each other across a patchy yard, talk in circles, call each other ""man,"" and then part by exchanging desultory threats. Barbara Loden's Wanda might well be living next door.This scene and a number of others were obviously set up for the camera, but the truth lies not in the spontaneity of the confrontation but in the rather sad and funny style with which it is played.The ultimate difference between something like ""A Married Couple"" and ""Derby"" is that the making of the movie is obviously a major factor in the lives being recorded, a kind of preview of the success Mike seeks as a Roller Derby star. There is nothing unseemly about this spectacle, as there was in the self-conscious intimacies of ""A Married Couple.""If Mike Snell's story gives ""Derby"" its shape, scenes of the Roller Derby itself, an acknowledged amalgam of sport and pre-arranged spectacle, plus interviews with its various stars, give the filmand Mike's lifea fascinating context. Charlie O'Connell reminisces about the good things the derby has given him (a San Francisco hilltop house with a swimming pool); a bunch of the derby's female stars tell adolescent dirty jokes; on two occasions, which are unrelated, young men show off for the camera the guns they carryjust, as they say, to be on the safe side. One of these is Mike's best friend in Dayton, who explains, in a matter-of-fact way, that he's tired of being hassled and beat-on by drunk hillbillies whenever he goes into a Dayton bar.""Derby"" was commissioned by Jerry Seltzer, the son of the man who founded the Roller Derby in 1935, and who has nursed the derby through good times (in the 1950's, when it was a major television attraction) and bad (in the 1960's, when the public seems to have lost interest).I'm especially amazed that a film which was designed to be self-serving should be such an accurate report on a time and place, and should also have such an unsentimental regard for its people. For men like Mike Snell, there will always be the challenge of a new frontier, which, in this case, happens to be the Roller Derby.",1971-04-23T05:00:00+0000

The Art Deco print on the slab cush ions has a certain similarity to the geometric Shapiro painting. An Afri can mask by the window and the preColumbian statue on the glow ing oval table add ethnic accents. MULTIPURPOSEBy careful plan ning, the designers were able to pack a wall of books and a grand piano into the living room. An upholstered screen beside the entry door creates a hallway as well as a piano al cove. Antique kilim and Kazak rugs repeat the red wall color. OFFICE REFLECTIONSThe mir rored wall in the tiny office reflects the storage system. Cabinet fronts and counters are wrapped in charcoal vinyl; illuminated panels run across the top. On one wall a mask from New Guinea provides an ethnic coun terpoint to the Ernest Posse painting. Two popular themes in interior design these days are ethnic art and Art Deco. But together? The de signing firm of SchuleMcCarville dared the mix this belowstreetlevel apartment, and their gamble paid off. The threeroom space was a shambles, they recall, when they started. White floors, plat. formed couches covered in Art Deco fabrics and imaginative lighting were major factors in the trans formation. Lighting, of course, was particularly im portant in the belowground rooms. The designers recessed lights in counters, installed glowing tables and covered whole walls with large mirrors, which not only reflect light but create an illusion of rooms beyond. Ethnic art, in the form of kilims and oriental rugs on the floors and African artifacts, adds cm unexpected, yet completely compatible accent.",1971-04-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Eric Rohmer's 'Collectionneuse',"Eric Rohmer's ""La Collectionneuse,"" which opened yesterday at the 72d Street Playhouse, is, in terms of actual chronology, the third film that Rohmer made in his projected cycle of Six Moral Tales, all variations on the theme of the man who, in love with one woman, is momentarily attracted to another.""La Collectionneuse"" was made in 1967, before ""My Night at Maud's"" (which was supposed to be produced before ""La Collectionneuse"" but was delayed because Jean-Louis Trintignant was not available), and before ""Claire's Knee."" Although it is an early work, it has the appearance of a late work, almost of a last work, as if the manners, attitudes and interests of ""My Night at Maud's"" and ""Claire's Knee"" had been worn out, leaving the exhausted shell of parody.The film, of course, is neither a last work nor a parody, but a kind of overture to the two superb movies that were to follow it. However, because most of the criticism that was wrongly directed at ""Maud"" and ""Claire"" can be somewhat more rightly applied to ""La Collectionneuse,"" I can recommend it only to those moviegoers who are already convinced (as I am) that Rohmer is one of the most original and independent directors at work today. For the uninitiated, it will be a lovely, arid bore.The time is (once again) summer, and the setting is the south of France, a vacation villa near Saint-Tropez inhabited by Adrien (Patrick Bauchau), the film's narrator, a handsome esthete who works occasionally as an antiques dealer but who says, more accurately, that his life is his work; Daniel (Daniel Pommereulle), a painter who doesn't paint, and Hayde Hayde Politoff), a magnificently constructed young woman who sleeps around the neighborhood with an instructive, careless ease that's most disturbing to the elevated sensibilities of the two men.Adrien and Daniel tease and ridicule Hayde and nickname her ""the collector."" Adrien, whose mistress is spending the summer in London, is at first simply annoyed by Hayde's sexual presence, since she makes it difficult for him to concentrate on his vacation schedule of doing nothing well. Hayde, however, is not easily ignored, and when Daniel begins a lethargic affair with her, Adrien's defenses are such that he interprets it as part of her scheme to seduce him.Adrien is very much the early prototype for Jean-Louis of ""My Night at Maud's"" and Jerome of ""Claire's Knee,"" an intellectual with an almost obsessive distrust of idle passion, as if idle passion equals disorder, chaos and the collapse of civilization, and is, therefore, the ultimate immorality. Like Jean-Louis, Adrien is drawn, against his will, toward this other woman. This time, however, it's a very minor skirmish. His triumph  through a fortuitous accident that allows him to exercise his free choiceis of almost indecently limited application.Much of the comedy in ""La Collectionneuse,"" as in Rohmer's later films, is provided by the otherwise aware hero's elegant self-deceptions about his own motives, followed by his dimly seen perceptions of what could be another truth. In this context, it is a momentous event (and, comparatively speaking, momentously funny) when Adrien begins to have doubts about the affair of Hayde and Daniel. ""I couldn't be sure,"" he tells himself with complete seriousness, ""that their complicity was entirely for my benefit.""Almost everything in ""La Collectionneuse"" is of a slightly more gross and less interesting order than in ""My Night at Maud's"" and ""Claire's Knee."" Everything, that is, except Nestor Almendros's camerawork, which is as susual, beautiful. It's as if the film were a kind of living notebook for what Rohmer was to do later, with greater ease and refinement. It's no mere coincidence that in his last film Rohmer was able to say about all he had to say with Claire's right knee, but when he introduces Hayde, in a bikini, his camera has to make a complete inventory of herthigh, small of the back, arm, nape of the neck, and both knees.There is a certain chilliness and lack of spontaneity to all of the performances, especially Bauchau's, which, I suspect, has as much to do with the tiny scope of the film as to the actor's talents.

As the color camera peers at them closely, 20 American students, white and Negro, ranging in age from 15 to 19, lounge comfortably in a sylvan glade and exchange views primarily on self and sex. The film arrived Saturday morning at the Baronet.The youths are bright, personable and well-spoken. Much of what they say, mildly prodded by a group leader and one adult on the sidelines, is interesting and certainly revealing. There are genuinely affecting moments, as when one girl tearfully admits her inability to distinguish between emotion and thought.But with all due respect to Kent Mackenzie, the director-producer, and to Gary Goldsmith, chief of Dimension Films, the picture seems best slotted for a television featurette running 40 minutes or so. It stretches out for 90. When the film hits 65, the sound of a droning fly becomes symbolic.Television slotting would certainly call for toning down some of the language. Square as it may sound, the kids are too expressive for all that casually ""with it"" filth, which is more monotonous than offensive. Even more annoying are those repetitious ya-knows. Samples: ""Would you want your spouse, ya-know, to be a virgin, ya-know? At least theoretically, ya-know?"" A girl reminds us that, ""I'm, ya-know, a woman."" Yeah, yeah.Two blondes are absolutely endearing in their candor and thinking, especially one doll named Robin. One of the ladssee for yourselfcould use a psychiatrist. We especially liked the pert-spoken black girl named Jean, who speaks her piece succinctly and won't be intimidated. But we still think that ""Saturday Morning"" calls for compression and prime time on Saturday night TV.",1971-04-26T05:00:00+0000

Contemporary painters and sculptors often talk about closing the gap between art and life, but Kurt Schwitters did, al most 50 years ago. He literally inhabited his art. Gutting his house in Hanover, he turned it into a Merzbaua multistoried constructivist sculpture. From the inside. the Merzbau resembled a rain forest of abstreet forms, a warehouse of sur plus imagination. It was like an im mensely complicat ed lock into which Schwitters himself fitted as the key. Every night, he climbed up this gar gantuan creation and slept on top of it, as though rest ing on his achieve ment. Merz was the root name of all Schwitters's art, derived from a scrap of the word commerz in one of his collages. The Merzbau began as a sort of stalactite, com bining several Dadalike constructions with titles like Cult Pump and Gallows of Desire into a Cathedral of Erotic Misery. Composed of pieces of junk that Schwitters incessantly collected and then plastered over, it eventually became the visual poem of a man who recycled the waste products of his environment and made them into art.",1971-04-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Woody Allen Leads a 'Bananas' Revolution,"If you twist its arm (and anybody canthe movie is small), Woody Allen's new film, ""Bananas,"" proclaims that all of life is raw material for a television game show. It opens with Howard Cosell and the staff of A.B.C.'s Wide World of Sports enthusiastically covering the Assassination of the Week, that of the President of the Latin-American republic of San Marcos, whose expiration, on cue, highlights the week of festivities begun with the sacking of the United States Embassy.Some hallucinations later, the movie ends with Mr. Cosell hosting the on-camera consummation of a marriage, in the gold and white bridal suite of the Royal Manhattan Hotel, complete with instant replays and quarrelsome, post-encounter statements by the two principals.Woody Allen is incurably, hopelessly sane, and ""Bananas,"" which began yesterday at the Coronet Theater, is, without doubt the best Woody Allen comedy I've seen since his last film, ""Take the Money and Run."" It's also an indecently funny movie, on its own, and in spotsa qualification I add with some hesitation because I'm not sure that its unfunny spots are terribly important.Thirty years ago, some very perceptive critics, including James Agee and Otis Ferguson, used to grow all sad and misty in print because W. C. Fields seldom made a movie that was as funny in its entirety as it was in its individual parts. Today, it doesn't make any difference. That was the sort of movie Fields made, and now we accept the rhythm of his comic genius, since it was an indispensable part of that genius.The same may well be true of Woody Allen who, when he is good, is inspired. However, when he's bad, he's not rotten; rather, he's just not so hot.""Bananas,"" which was directed and written by Allen (with Mickey Rose), had to do with Fielding Mellish (Allen) a frail, sly New York products tester, who accidentally becomes the dictator of San Marcos, and with Nancy (Louise Lasser), the sort of new school girl who breaks engagements to participate in dock strikes and yearns for relevance in her relationships.Although it is cast in the comparatively classic, dumb-slob-who-succeeds narrative form, nothing in the story is so important that it can't be interrupted or forgotten for a visual or verbal gag, a variation on an old joke, some satire that takes reality to its outer reaches, or just a nice, crazy reference to a film classic (""Potemkin"") that has almost been loved to death.Allen's view of the world is fraught with everything except pathos, and it's a view I happen to find very funny. Here is no little man surviving with a wan smile and a shrug, but a runty, wise-mouthed guy whose initial impulses toward cowardice seem really heroic in the crazy order of the way things are. ""New York Rifle Council Declares Death a Good Thing,"" reports a headline. The comic world of Allen's Fielding Mellish, however, is more fanciful than bleak or black. When Fielding, in a reverie, hears harp music, there is a logical explanation: there's a man playing a harp in Fielding's closet.Allen is his own best actor, diffident and defensive, but I also like Miss Lasser (the former Mrs. Allen), who reminds me of a young Elaine May, and Carlos Montalban, as a Castro-like freedom fighter who, at his victory celebration, goes a little nuts and declares Swedish to be the official language.Any movie that attempts to mix together love, Cuban revolution, the C.I.A., Jewish mothers, J. Edgar Hoover and a few other odds and ends (including a sequence in which someone orders 1,000 grilled cheese sandwiches) is bound to be a little weirdand most welcome.",1971-04-29T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: Godard's Social Mix, 'Vladimir and Rosa':Chicago Conspiracy Trial Is One Item","""Vladimir and Rosa,"" wherein Jean-Luc Godard offers his thoughts and precepts relating to last year's Chicago conspiracy trial, women's liberation and black power, among other things, is the committed (some would say committable) French director's latest revolutionary film. Yet, more than anything he has done since ""Weekend,"" it recalls the work of the pre-Mao Godardmovies like ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her,"" ""La Chinoise,"" and even ""Band of Outsiders,"" although that film was made at the height of what might be called Godard's Kuomintang period (1964).""Vladimir and Rosa"" is no less an essay film than ""Wind from the East"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" (and, I assume, ""Pravda"" and ""See You at Mao,"" which I did not see), but the essay has a straightforward structure and it is played mostly in the burlesque form of a political cartoon. It is anything but obscure in its methods.The film opens with a couple of Weathermen being beaten by comic strip cops with clubs that are intended to have the heft of balsa wood. Prop blood, wiped away, reveals smooth, undamaged flesh. In the course of the trial, the Judge sits at his bench, looking like a snappish griffin, overruling the most reasonable objections of the defense, sustaining the wildest objections of the prosecution, and drawing labels (""hippies,"" ""yippies"") on the thighs and breasts of a Playboy-like centerfold.When someone representing Bobby Seale is led from the courtroom, the screen goes playfully black. (Coincidentally, the prosecution's trial procedures also are lampooned, with equal vehemence, in Woody Allen's new film, ""Bananas,"" which indicates we may be in for a season of similar rip-offs).""Vladimir and Rosa"" frequently cuts away from the trial for lettle lectures on the meaning of conspiracy, for dialogues between a pretty feminist and her lover, who, radical though he is, can't help but being a bit of a male chauvinist, and between Godard and his filmmaking partner, Jean-Pierre Gorin, on the problems of translating revolutionary theory into revolutionary film.One of these takes place on a tennis court, with the dead-panned Godard and Gorin pacing along the net as a hot game of doubles goes smashing back and forth over their heads. In spite or himself, apparently, Godard cannot resist a comic image, even one at the expense of his own politically grave image.Such moments evoke the earlier Godard films, even though distantly. The manner in which the Chicago trial is parodied is bitter, but the playing is exuberant and energetic, as childlike as the fantasies once enacted for Godard by Belmondo, Brialy, Karina and their friends.The movie, unfortunately, is a good deal more than memories. It is not only stern and didactic in ways that are either enigmatic or tirsome (and sometimes both), but it is also, quite literally, pale and fuzzy.As Godard has embraced revolution and discarded the possessions of the bourgeoisie, he has also discarded what he seems to regard as the luxury of film style. In its technical aspects, ""Vladimir and Rosa"" looks weak and undernourished, like someone who has given all his salary to The Cause and must subsist on Kool-Aid and french fries.The movie was produced by the Dziga-Vertov cooperative, which doesn't assign individual credits. I've no idea who wrote, photographed or edited the film, although Godard's hand can be detected from time to time. In addition to Godard and Gorin, I also recognized in the cast Anne Wiazemsky, as a women's liberator, and Juliette Bertho as a Weatherwoman type.In case you're wondering, the title is in reference to Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov (Lenin) (1870-1924) and Rosa Luxemburg (1870-1919), a leading German Marxist, to whom Godard and Gorin liken themselves, as theoreticians suddenly confronted with the opportunity to practice what they preach. Like all Godard titles, it has the proper touch of poetry.",1971-04-30T05:00:00+0000
