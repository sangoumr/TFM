us,Jordanians and Israelis: A History in Maps,"1918: British forces under Gen. Sir Edmund Allenby defeat the Turks in a battle south of the West Bank city of Nablus, ending Ottoman control over Palestine. 1923: The League of Nations gives Britain a mandate over Palestine, an area that includes the East Bank of the Jordan River. Palestinian leaders protest the decision and demand independence. Later that year, Britain effectively partitions Palestine, handing over the East Bank - the Transjordan - to Emir Abdullah and retaining rule, under the mandate, in the rest of Palestine, including the West Bank. 1946: The East Bank becomes the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. 1947: The United Nations, under international pressure to fulfill aspirations for a Jewish homeland, votes to end the British mandate and partitions Palestine into Jewish and Arab zones. Immediately after the decision, armed hostilities break out between Jews and Arabs. Jewish soldiers establish themselves in most areas accorded them in the partition plan. 1948: After Israel declares independence in May, Arab armies cross the border and attack the Israeli forces. The Arab Legion wins control over most lands accorded to the Arabs in the United Nations partition plan. At the same time, the Israelis gained control over lands beyond the United Nations mandate. 1950: Jordan annexes the West Bank. 1967: The Israeli Army captures Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan in the June war. It also seizes the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights, where it has long been strategically vulnerable, from Syria. 1974: Arab leaders attending a summit meeting in Rabat, Morocco, decide that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, formally divesting Jordan of this role. 1987: In December, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip begin an uprising against the Israeli occupation. 1988: King Hussein of Jordan cancels a $1.3 billion development plan for the West Bank, dissolves the house of Parliament in which the occupied lands are represented, and announces that Jordan will cut legal and administrative ties with the West Bank in favor of the P.L.O.

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"INTERNATIONAL The most sweeping trade bill in a generation was passed by the Senate, 85 to 11, and sent to the President. The legislation is intended to make the U.S. more assertive and competitive by giving the President broader powers to retaliate against unfair trading practices. The bill also seeks from foreign governments access to their markets similar to what the U.S. provides for their exports. Mr. Reagan said he would sign the bill. [ Page A1. ] Japan issued a strong protest after the bill was passed. [ D19. ] Droughts in North America and Asia are cutting sharply into world production of wheat, corn and other cereal crops, Government and private studies indicate. As a result, grain stockpiles may fall to their lowest levels since 1973. [ D1. ] Five OPEC ministers expressed concern about oil prices and overproduction but did not call for an emergency meeting of the organization. Oil prices fell further after the news. [ D1. ] Argentina needs more flexibility from foreign creditors, officials and politicians told Secretary of State Shultz. [ D2. ] THE ECONOMY The savings industry continues to pile up heavy losses and $50 billion may ultimately be required to rescue it, the head of the F.D.I.C. said. This figure was the highest yet acknowledged by a Federal regulator. [ D1. ] The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the international accord that will require banks to maintain higher levels of capital, based on the riskiness of their loans and other assets. [ D2. ] Sales of cars and light trucks fell slightly in July. Domestic manufacturers reported unexpected gains and importers showed surprising losses. [ D4. ] Movie and television producers and writers tentatively agreed to end their 22-week-old strike. [ A1. ] COMPANIES A Federal judge temporarily blocked Eastern Air Lines' planned cutbacks, in response to a suit by two unions. The airline wants to end service to 14 cities and lay off 4,000 workers. [ D1. ] G.M. warranties will be broader and shorter. The company will offer a three-year, 50,000-mile warranty instead of six-year, 60,000-mile coverage of basic engine and transmission parts. [ D4. ] The assets of one of South Florida's largest developers will be bought by Shearson, Triangle and Michael Swerdlow. [ D4. ] Coastal and the Chinese Government announced a joint venture to operate Coastal's West Coast properties. [ D4. ] MARKETS R. R. Donnelley dismissed two employees at plants where Business Week is printed, and another employee resigned. The moves came as the investigation continued into trading on advance knowledge of Business Week articles. [ D3. ] A bill setting larger penalties for insider trading was introduced in the House. [ D3. ] The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the fifth straight day, closing at 2,134.07, up 2.85 points. Trading volume increased significantly, but the market was generally calm. [ D6. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds dipped slightly in very sluggish trading, as market participants seemed to shrug off a larger-than-expected borrowing by the Treasury. [ D13. ] Coffee futures prices soared more than 9 cents a pound, reversing a recent trend. Crop and livestock futures were mixed. [ D14. ] The dollar drifted fractionally lower against most major currencies. Gold rose $1.80 an ounce, to $433.30. [ D14. ] Yields rose slowly on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds. [ D15. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS NCNB was the only bidder to obtain an I.R.S. ruling assuring that it would be able to take advantage of $5 billion in tax losses when it acquired First Republicbank's assets.

us,A Web of Corruption,"1965 John Mariotta, a tool and die maker whose parents came from Puerto Rico, establishes a small machine shop in the South Bronx: Welbilt Electronic Die Corporation, later Wedtech. 1970 With a partner, Fred Neuberger, an immigrant from Rumania, Mr. Mariotta seeks Government contracts set aside for minority-owned businesses. Late 1970's Wedtech gives more than $20,000 in campaign contributions to Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, whose office helped expedite requests for city help. 1979 The company hires the law firm of Biaggi & Ehrlich, after Representative Mario Biaggi offered its services. May 1982 Lyn Nofziger, a former top adviser to President Reagan, who left the White House in January 1982 to start a public relations concern, begins to work for Wedtech and writes to the deputy White House counsel about an Army contract. May 19, 1982 At a meeting in the White House, attended by representatives of Wedtech, the Army and the Small Business Administration, Wedtech's problems are solved. The Army agrees to pay $27.7 million for 1,300 small gasoline engines; the S.B.A. agrees to provide a $3 million grant and $2 million loan. February 1987 Four company executives plead guilty to forging invoices and other charges. They also assert Wedtech made payoffs to 20 officials, including Mr. Biaggi and Mr. Simon. February 1987 A special prosecutor, James C. McKay, is named to investigate Mr. Nofziger's links to Wedtech. The investigation is later expanded to include Mr. Meese, the former White House counsel and current Attorney General. June 1987 Mr. Biaggi, his son Richard, and five others are indicted by a Federal grand jury on charges of transforming Wedtech into a criminal racketeering enterprise. July 1987 Mr. Nofziger is indicted on charges that he illegally ''profited from the political reputation and influence'' he gained as a top White House aide, in lobbying for Wedtech. July 1988 Attorney General Meese announces he has been vindicated by the independent prosecutor's report and plans to resign later in the summer. Although Mr. McKay does not recommend criminal charges, the report finds Mr. Meese and his staff were ''instrumental'' in helping Wedtech win a $32 million Army contract that was awarded without bidding. Aug. 4, 1988 Mr. Biaggi and four of his five co-defendants are convicted of various charges.",1988-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Whereas the original 1958 model, a rolling heap of silicone, did little more than wobble and eat, the updated Blob is infinitely more advanced. It can climb to the ceiling and plop down on anyone below. It can choose its victims mischievously, rather than on its predecessor's catch-as-catch-can basis. It can play practical jokes. And it can overtake, subdue and digest its prey right before the audience's very eyes. This is progress, after a fashion. So by any reasonable standard, Chuck Russell's current ''Blob'' is new and improved. It's a more professional effort in every way. The special effects look sickeningly good, and the actors show signs of being able to act, which could not be said of any members of the original cast - not even Steve McQueen, who was Steven McQueen then and appearing in his first major film role. Yet for reasons having nothing to do with merit, the 1958 film earned a place in history. The remake, enterprising as it is, won't do the same.",1988-08-05T05:00:00+0000

Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Cafe Pierre * (July 10, 1987), Fifth Avenue at 61st Street (838-8000) - Cafe Pierre is an appealing choice for Saturday lunch in a formal, elegant setting. Murals of clouds decorate the room, along with ornate mirrors and luxurious draped fabric. A new menu includes appetizers of marinated langoustine with zucchini salad, and vegetable ''gateau'' with duck confit. A few of the lunch entrees are seafood panache on a pasta leaf; lobster and artichoke salad with orange vinaigrette; warm chicken breast with crushed pepper on seasonal greens, and braised sweetbreads with a celery-root-and-currant flan. The dessert menu offers homemade sorbets and chocolate dacquoise. Lunch prices are $7.50 to $15 for appetizers, $18.50 to $28 for main courses. Lunch hours: noon to 2:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday. David K's Cafe Diner's Journal (March 11, 1988), 1115 Third Avenue; entrance on 65th Street between Second and Third Avenues (935-1161) - A variety of intriguing Chinese dishes can be sampled at this casual cafe, one of the better East Side places for bargains. Oriental porcelain and bronze, glazed black tiles around the banquettes and bar and background music by the new-age composer Kitaro provide the atmosphere. Recommended dishes include a terrinelike combination of shredded lamb bound in gelatin, homemade noodles tossed with shredded beef and thin strips of cucumber, northern family noodles with a sauce of minced pork, dried bean curd, scallions, coriander and hoisin, superb pan-fried dumplings filled with beef and scallions, or with shrimp. Prices are $1.95 to $5.95 for appetizers, $3.95 to $9.95 for main courses. Opens for lunch at noon Saturday and serves until 1 A.M. Docks * (Feb. 6, 1987), 2427 Broadway, near 89th Street (724-5588) - This busy fishhouse sparkles with black and white ceramic tiles and a glass and brass oyster bar. Docks is an ambitious restaurant offering a changing assortment of fresh fish, and a broad sampling of oysters and clams. At lunch, start with shellfish in season, or share an order of the light, greaseless fried calamari. A variety of seafood salads are on the lunch menu, as well as steamed lobster, cold lobster cocktail, grilled swordfish and tuna, cold poached or smoked fish. Crunch fresh coleslaw and french-fried yams make excellent side dishes. Key lime and chocolate mud pies are good desserts. Prices at lunch range from $3 to $6 for appetizers, and $6.50 to $14 for entrees. Lunch served from 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Friday and Saturday. La Gauloise ** (May 29, 1987), 502 Avenue of the Americas, near 12th Street (691-1363) - A real French bistro is a place that puts one at ease. La Gauloise, a genial Village restaurant decorated with mahagony-framed mirrors and lace curtains from the Alsatian home of the owner's grandmother, fits the bill. Appetizers at lunch include lobster-stuffed ravioli, warm shrimp and sole pate, and lamb tongue salad with cornichons. Among the entrees are cold grilled salmon on a bed of endive with creme fraiche, grilled chicken, skate wing with lemon and caper sauce, and a warm vegetable plate composed of seasonal vegetables prepared several ways. Desserts include rice pudding with fresh fruit in mint-tea sauce, tarte aux pommes, and individual cheese cakes made with chevre. Prices at lunch range from $4 to $10.50 for appetizers, and $7.50 to $16.50 for entrees. Open noon to 3 P.M. for Friday and Saturday lunch. What the stars mean, page C20.",1988-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,GUIDEPOST: Finishing the Unfinished,"Summer auctions and country-furniture sales are yielding furniture that may have been stripped of its finish or sold in its natural state. All such furniture needs some kind of protective coating. Stains and dyes should be sealed by a clear finish. If the wood is attractive, a clear finish may be all that is needed. Beware of surprises: stains can react with hidden pigment in the wood to produce strange colors, and applying a coat of clear finish tends to darken the overall color. One way to avoid ending up with a muddy brown chair when you wanted pickled pine is to use a one-step finish - clear finish mixed with an appropriate color - so that what you see is what you get. These finishes are best applied with a fine-tipped foam rubber brush, whcih easily mops up extra liquid that has a tendency to gather in corners. Here are some tips for refinishing stripped furniture or raw wood. PURPOSE METHOD Clean Sand is surface is rough, then wipe with a cloth dampened with paint thinner. Stain Use a one-step finish, such as Polyshades by Minwax, which comes in several colors and high gloss or satin luster. Use it as is or mix shades to get the color you want. Seal To strengthen the finish without deepening the color, apply clear polyurethane. This is essential for furniture that is used often.",1988-08-06T05:00:00+0000

A communique issued after four days of American-sponsored talks gave no details on the accord. Page 1 A United Nations peacekeeping force of 250 members would be sent to monitor any cease-fire agreement between Iran and Iraq, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council. 3 Military analysis: American forces have not been trained to act as peacekeepers in political wars. The downing of an Iranian jetliner is the latest illustration of their deployment where the line between war and peace is unclear. 3 Palestinians who lost salaries that Jordan paid in part or in full before King Hussein cut ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank were angry over the action, but pleased at the degree of autonomy they gained. 3 American bases in the Philippines would be closed gradually, according to a plan proposed by some Filipino legislators as a compromise in a national debate over the continued presence of the bases. 4 Changing Japanese vacation habits is the aim of a Government campaign to encourage workers to use their vacation days and stagger vacation schedules. Many Japanese only take time off when their offices close. 4 A $27 million plan to aid the contras was offered by Senate Democratic leaders. The plan would provide the Nicaraguan rebels with money for food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies. 5 Spain is re-examining bullfighting, questioning whether it is a sport or cruelty to animals. Attendance at bullfights is down, and the European Parliament is considering a proposal that could lead to a ban. 5 The detention of a Rumanian citizen, Dumitru Mazilu, by Bucharest has prompted a protest from Washington for his release so that he may present a report on human rights violations to the United Nations. 26 National 6-8, 31-32 Oliver North's trial will be delayed until at least mid-November to give lawyers extra time to sort through thousands of classified documents, the judge in the Iran-contra case announced. 1 Treasury Secretary James Baker resigned to join Vice President Bush's Presidential campaign. Nicholas Brady, a former Senator from New Jersey, was named Mr. Baker's successor by President Reagan. 1 News analysis: James A. Baker 3d has earned high marks within the Republican Party as a political operative, and his success as Treasury Secretary would put him in line for a major post if Vice President Bush wins. 8 A surge in job growth for July suggests that the economy is gathering momentum that could speed up the rate of inflation, Government figures showed. Unemployment edged up from a 14-year low in June. 1 Region's unemployment at a low 32 A company will exclude employees from medical coverage if they become sick from AIDS, alcohol, drug abuse or self-inflicted wounds. The Circle K Corporation seeks to base coverage on ''life style'' decisions. 1 Many business and trade schools, which could profit from requirements that more welfare recipients get job training and work, have registered unqualified students and abused tuition aid programs, officials say. 1 Unfilled promise of training prompts suit 6 An engine test for the space shuttle Discovery will be delayed until at least late next week to give workers time to replace the valve system whose malfunction halted ignition Thursday, officials said. 6 The nominee for Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, pledged at his Senate confirmation hearing that he would be ''hypersensitive'' in avoiding the appearance of impropriety on ethical questions. 8 Politics 7 Michael S. Dukakis struck back at Vice President Bush, charging that the prospective Republican Presidential nominee lacks the skill to conduct the nation's foreign policy, and challenged him to a debate. 1 Vice President Bush is healthy and suffers only mild osteoarthritis in his hips and knees, his White House doctor said, keeping the candidates' health an issue in the Presidential campaign. 7 White supremacist guilty of threatening Jackson 7 Narrowing Bush's No. 2 choices 7 Bush seems to be planning only a token campaign in New York 7 Regional 27-30 Changing a housing plan for Yonkers as part of a compromise would pose great difficulties and require new negotiations among the city, the housing department and the plaintiffs in the case, a Federal official said. 1 Bronxville has few black families and no poor neighborhoods. Opinion in the town, which is across the parkway from Yonkers, is split over Yonkers's defiance of a court-ordered desegregation plan. 28 Mario Biaggi said he would resign from the House of Representatives and announced that he would not seek an 11th term in Congress after his conviction on corruption charges twice in the last year. 27 Loyalty to Mario Biaggi is strong in the Bronx-Westchester Congressional district he represented for 10 terms. Colleagues and friends said that loyalty was the result of his efforts on behalf of constituents. 30 Wedtech scandal is far from over 30 A black inventor's home in Queens, now scheduled for demolition, would be moved and turned into a museum under a plan proposed by descendants of Lewis Latimer, a pioneer in developing electric lighting. 27 The chief of the Metro-North police, John Esposito, was dismissed because he had failed to turn over to his superiors a copy of a videotape in which seven officers were shown clowning around Grand Central Terminal. 27 Weed-eating fish in Connecticut, valued by pond owners because they help clear stagnant water, could damage the environment, according to state officials, who are telling pond owners to kill the fish. 27 An angry former Hertz employee who had been dismissed set in motion the inquiry that ended with the company's pleading guilty to defrauding customers and insurers on collision repairs. 29 East Orange to drop limit on moving 29",1988-08-06T05:00:00+0000

Born in 1901, Michel Leiris has shirked no adventure of the French intellectual left. Surrealist writer, then ethnographer, he has worked with the giants of modern art and social thought, but his most intrepid explorations have been autobiographical. This 1961 volume, attentively translated by Richard Sieburth under the title ''Nights as Day, Days as Night,'' is an auxiliary to Mr. Leiris's more sustained enterprise of self-observation. In it, he collects nocturnal dreams, waking dreams and dreamlike incidents of waking life, all meticulously recorded over four decades. ''Dream - a scintillating mirage surrounded by shadows - is essentially poetry,'' Mr. Leiris asserts; and each brief prose episode simultaneously displays his poetic lyricism and his scientific detachment. The incidents and images are largely uninterpreted, although some readers will find the pensive essay, here published as a foreword, in which Maurice Blanchot reflects on Mr. Leiris's text to be the gem of this volume. Many of the pieces themselves are pedestrian, and the author is uncomfortably faithful to the solemnity and self-dramatization that often color dream experience. But arresting images do emerge. True to his epigraph from Gerard de Nerval - ''Dream is a second life'' - Mr. Leiris cherishes all evidence of experience, waking or sleeping, and reserves his intolerance for a post-surgical occasion of anesthesia-induced oblivion. ''It was not so much the void that bothered me, but rather the gaping fault-line represented by this truly dead time that had been cut out of my life by the stroke of an axe.''",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

(St. Martin's, $17.95) According to Clement Biddle Wood, yuppies never identify themselves as such - it is unyuppie-ish to even think the word. Mr. Wood's amusing novel about seven young urban professionals who share a summer home on Long Island's South Fork gently satirizes the mores of this tanned and limber race. The tenants of Historic Slocum House include a numbers-obsessed arbitrageur, a young writer working on her first novel, a rambunctious sports reporter, an art dealer and a sycophantic corporate lawyer who has rented the house to be near one of his firm's partners. Their vacations, made hectic by career-oriented ''workplay,'' are observed by a diminutive Russian emigre poet, Vladimir Yurevich Ouspenskiy, who tags along as housekeeper and omniscient narrator. Presented as a mock sociological treatise, complete with 81 footnotes, ''Ocean Vu, Jog to Beach'' records Vlady's fascination with the ''capitalist/consumerist summer commune.'' While this literary conceit - not to mention Vlady's frequent references to his subjects as ''Y-persons'' - soon becomes labored, Mr. Wood does create several appealing characters. Yuppies who refuse to call themselves yuppies are unlikely to want to read about yuppies, but Mr. Wood, who is also the author of ''Welcome to the Club,'' presents in his second novel the kind of light entertainment that is well suited for yuppie vacation reading.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,Equal Hazard Employment,"Some of the journalists in WOMEN OF THE WORLD: The Great Foreign Correspondents by Julia Edwards (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95) have become legends, and their stories are as dramatic as the events they recorded. But even such stars as Mary Roberts Rinehart, Dorothy Thompson, Martha Gellhorn, Margaret Bourke-White and Marguerite Higgins did not have an easy time. The book chronicles the struggle of these foreign correspondents - and others less well known - for the right to cover world events as equals to their male colleagues. In an engaging and spirited style, Julia Edwards, a foreign correspondent for 25 years, describes how American women circumvented, challenged and ignored discriminatory rules and practices in print journalism. Progress, she recounts, could be measured from war to war. In World War I, when the United States Army refused to accredit women to cover the Western Front, three American women covered the Russian Front. In World War II, women were generally relegated to rear lines. In Korea, Gen. Walton H. Walker banned women because ''there are no facilities for ladies at the front,'' a decision overruled by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Finally, in Vietnam, the Defense Department allowed women to cover combat as equals with men.

us,NONFICTION,"THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLACK THEATER IN AMERICA: From Shadows to Selves. By Leslie Catherine Sanders. (Louisiana State University, $25.) Leslie Catherine Sanders' new book has much to recommend it: thoughtful, trenchant analysis of black theater in America; informed discussions of certain black playwrights; and a deft exploration of the quest to achieve a ''black stage reality'' beyond the confines of European theatrical conventions. Unfortunately, there are omissions that speak as loudly as the works and writers she has included. Ms. Sanders, an associate professor of English at York University, Ontario, offers a broad overview of black playwrights - from Willis Richardson to Langston Hughes to Ed Bullins - and seems to understand the forces in society that have nurtured and sharpened black theater. She describes well the history of that theater, proving it was not solely a product of the 1960's and 70's. But she might have gone further. Such pivotal playwrights as Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin, and more contemporary voices like Ntozake Shange and Charles Fuller, are examined almost as afterthoughts. August Wilson, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner but no newcomer to the stage, isn't mentioned at all. Ms. Sanders has provided a solid background for black theatrical history, but one would have hoped for a more current and comprehensive study.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE PASSION. By Jeanette Winterson. (Atlantic Monthly, $16.95.) ''It was Napoleon who had such a passion for chicken that he kept his chefs working around the clock.'' So Jeanette Winterson begins her tale of Henri, who slaughters and serves those chickens, and Villanelle, the sophisticated Venetian whose fate ultimately overtakes the simple soldier's. ''The Passion'' is Ms. Winterson's second novel (after ''Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit,'' which won England's Whitbread Prize). Its concentrated, beautifully detailed prose recalls the diction of fairy tales; its plot incorporates their magic, their shrewd wit and brutality. Two first-person narratives alternate: Henri, reflective and observant, brings the reader from the quiet French farm of his youth into Napoleon's camps in France, eastern Europe and finally Russia. Villanelle, bisexual and far from honest, deftly leads us through the mazy moral and emotional ambiguities of Venice's decadent gambling casinos. Ms. Winterson's characters are as vivid and haunting as figures in a dream. They pass easily from reality to miracle, as though the normally tough (if translucent) membrane between the natural and supernatural worlds were but a thin, discontinuous and shifting veil. Her theme is passion - religious, heroic and erotic -but her writing, for all its inventiveness, is thrifty, controlled and precise. Despite an incantatory repetition of phrases that threatens to break rather than cast a spell, ''The Passion'' is on the whole a deeply imagined and beautiful book, often arrestingly so.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

At the same time this season, Garry Hynes (an Irish director and a co-founder of the Druid Theater in Galway) has made her own Stratford debut with ''The Man of Mode,'' an acerbic Restoration comedy by George Etherege. Di Trevis, by comparison an R.S.C. veteran, offers as her seasonal contribution a mainstage production of ''Much Ado About Nothing.''

Quietly, women authors have been introducing to the amateur mystery female sleuths who do more between adventures than get their nails wrapped. Now comes another sleuth, created by a male author, who can stand tall in this gathering crowd. Adele Buffington, an Indianapolis social worker, conducts herself like a mensch. She shows courage when a hulking intruder steals privileged information from the agency where she works. She uses her brains and initiative in linking the break-in to a larger pattern of events that includes, in addition to the murder of a fellow social worker, the criminal victimization of people who are too young, too old, too unsophisticated or too stupid to protect themselves. The caring heart that she wears on her sleeve also puts her in the same compassionate company as Lieut. Leroy Powder and a private eye named Albert Samson, the heroes of Mr. Lewin's two other Indianapolis crime series. For a while, it looks dicey when he sets his new heroine off on a romance with Homer Proffitt, the police detective who is assigned to the case. But, to Mr. Lewin's credit, he uses the partnership primarily for the contrast it offers between the feisty social worker's urban liberalism and the down-home cop's ''country wisdom.''",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"OUTRAGE. By Dale Dye. (Little, Brown, $17.95.) So you'd like to write a thriller. Why not skim through some old newspapers until you get an idea for a plot? Maybe something like the bombing of the United States Marine headquarters in Lebanon in 1983. Now how about some characters? Say a brave colonel, a hard-bitten gunnery sergeant and an innocent corporal. And why not add a wacky Shiite and a Palestinian psycho? And, of course, an Arab Sophia Loren for the young corporal to fall for. You'll also need a wimpy American ambassador who worries more about red tape than reds. And a few other pencil-pushers to make life tough for the marines. Since everyone knows how it all turns out, you'll need something to keep your readers from dozing off. How about a little sex and a lot of dirty dialogue? That's Dale Dye's recipe for ''Outrage.'' Mr. Dye, a former Marine captain who served as technical adviser for the film ''Platoon,'' has managed to make his marines sound like marines. Unfortunately, it would take another marine to understand them - and an army of ellipses to make them quotable. Mr. Dye trips over the facts from time to time, blurring distinctions between Arabs and Iranians, Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites. But who cares about facts? More imporant, how's the fiction? Well, the prose, to quote one of Mr. Dye's more memorable lines, makes your ''head ring like a ten-penny nail beat with a greasy ballpeen hammer.'' Mr. Dye's third novel reads like the novelization of a television movie. Which isn't all that surprising since the publisher says it's going to be made into a motion picture. My advice is to skip the book and wait for the movie.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Earlier, top-seeded Boris Becker ended the surprising run of a local hero by beating Todd Witsken, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, in the other semifinal. Becker and McEnroe will compete today for the winner's check worth $50,575. Becker used his powerful serve to dominate the 28-minute first set, allowing Witsken just 7 points in the first five games. Then Witsken, from nearby Carmel, Ind., shook off his early jitters and served a love game to open the second set. He then led, 40-15, on Becker's serve, but the two-time Wimbledon champion reached deuce with consecutive aces. The game went to deuce three more times before Witsken netted a forehand return and Becker tied the set, 1-1. Witsken, 24 years old, began hitting the lines with accurate passing shots against a charging Becker for a crucial service break that gave him a 4-3 lead. He lost his serve again at 15 as Witsken took the second set to even the match. In the third set, Witsken was broken in the seventh game when Becker punched a forehand volley deep in Witsken's backcourt. Becker then held serve at love to take a 5-3 lead. Witsken took advantage of Becker's unforced errors to win the ninth game. But Becker reached back for an ace to go up 30-15 and gained match point when Witsken's forehand sailed long. He advanced when Witsken netted a service return.(AP) Track and Field Coe Upset in 1,500 Trials: Sebastian Coe's chances of defending his Olympic 1,500-meter title hung on the decision of the British selectors after he labored to fourth place in the heats and failed yesterday to qualify for the final of the British Olympic trials. In a big upset, the two-time Olympic champion rallied from sixth place in his heat, but his finishing speed was not there as he wound up behind three of his countrymen and failed to gain a spot in today's final at the Alexander Stadium. ''At 1,100 meters there was nothing there,'' Coe said. The first two finishers in each event automatically qualify for the Olympic squad. The selectors then pick a third entry at their discretion. Coe's only chance of defending his title is if the selectors overlook the claims of the also-rans in the final. While Coe struggled, there were triumphs for Steve Ovett and Steve Cram, the other two members of Britain's famed middle-distance trio. Ovett, the 1980 Olympic 800-meter gold medalist, won his 1,500-meter heat, while Cram posted an impressive triumph in the 800 meters.(AP) Johnson Wins: Ben Johnson, the world-record holder, won the 100-meter dash finals yesterday at the Canadian Olympic Trials in Ottawa, setting up a showdown in Seoul with Carl Lewis. Johnson, who set the world record of 9.83 seconds last year at the world championships in Rome, was timed in a wind-aided 9.90 seconds. The breeze of 3.7 meters a second was well over the limit of 2.0. Johnson was sidelined for nearly three months with a leg muscle injury before winning his heat Friday night in a slow 10.38. He was timed in 10.20 in yesterday's semifinal and won the final an hour later. Lewis ran a wind-aided time of 9.78 seconds last month in Indianapolis.(AP) Golf Bradley and Rosenthal Rally: Pat Bradley and Jody Rosenthal caught the early leader, Dot Germain, with birdies on the back nine yesterday to finish with 15 points and lead the field into an 18-hole final-round shootout at the $400,000 Pat Bradley International L.P.G.A. tournament at High Point, N.C. All three won $5,000, and will be among 18 players who will compete today for a $62,500 first prize. The 36-player field in yesterday's third round was cut in half, with Janet Anderson beating Sherri Steinhauer in a playoff for the last position. Germain, a North Carolina native whose Greensboro home is 20 minutes from the Willow Creek Golf Club course, steadied her game after an erratic start. After a 39-minute rain delay, Bradley caught Germain with a birdie at the par-5 16th hole when her putt hit the back of the cup, popped into the air and landed in the hole. Rosenthal hit a sand wedge to within eight feet of the pin and made her birdie to join the tie. Three golfers were tied for second with 14 points. Heather Farr had five birdies and a bogey, while Massey opened with a bogey and came back with her five birdies. Sally Quinlan birdied two of her last three holes to join that tie. Juli Inkster was alone at 13 points. Chris Johnson and Jerilyn Britz finished at 12 points. Martha Nause, Judy Dickinson and Ayako Okamoto were all at 11. Under the modified Stableford system, golfers receive 3 points for a birdie, 5 for an eagle and 8 for a double eagle. Players lose a point for a bogey and 3 points for a double bogey. Pars are worth nothing.(AP) Mudd Takes Lead: Jodie Mudd strung together three birdies on the back nine yesterday to overtake Tim Simpson and grab a stroke lead, at 67-203, after three rounds of the $953,842 St. Jude Classic at Memphis. Mudd, a six-time runner-up seeking his first Tour victory, chopped two strokes off par on the front nine, pulled even with Simpson with birdies at the par-4 14th and par-3 15th, then grabbed the lead with a birdie on the par-5, 545-yard 16th.

At the end of the gangway, a crusty master-of-arms singled me out of the stream of shorebound sailors (most of them, I thought, with a lot more evil in their eyes than I), glared at the bag and asked me to open it. Caught red-handed, I mumbled something about my mother having sent the notebooks, an excuse dismissed immediately by the M.A., who merely pointed at Uncle's initials on the covers.

Atop Mount Canaan in Israel's northern region, it has a magnificent view of Upper Galilee's mountains and valleys. The 20th century has left few marks on the secluded town and its narrow stone-paved alleys, winding streets and ivy-draped houses built around courtyard gardens. Although Safad (also known as Zefat and Safed) is not mentioned in the Bible, it is reputed to be one of the four cities in Israel where a small Jewish population has always been present. (The other cities are Jerusalem, Tiberias and Hebron.) Artists and writers were drawn to Safad in the 1930's, but it wasn't until 1950 that a group of painters and sculptors formally established a colony in the historic Christian quarter under the auspices of the National Association of Painters and Sculptors, a professional organization. In the beginning only bona fide artists approved by the association were allowed to renovate the run-down stone houses.

The local telephone number is 605-9174. Hurstville is near Sydney. The club can advise on road conditions and the availability of gasoline in rural areas.

Here, in this entertaining, if slight, book based on conversations with Christopher Andersen, a writer and editor, she lets us in on her patrician past. ''Young Kate'' has the gushy sincerity of one of Miss Hepburn's lesser scripts. Her mother, Katharine (Kit) Houghton, orphaned granddaughter of the founder of Corning Glass and, like her own famous daughter, a tough-minded Bryn Mawr graduate, falls madly in love and marries Tom Hepburn, a dashing young surgeon from Virginia. He shrewdly parlays his wife's modest inheritance into a substantial fortune, and they settle down comfortably in a gabled Victorian cottage in Hartford, with ample servants to care for their five children, of whom Kate, born in 1907, is the second. Mother quickly grows restless, however, and goes off to embrace such controversial causes of the day as women's suffrage, birth control and socialism. Father, meanwhile, fights against prostitution and venereal disease. Ostracized because of their parents' unconventional pursuits, the children learn to think of themselves as tougher and better than those who spurn them. But a startling tragedy occurs: at the age of 13, young Kate discovers her beloved older brother hanging by a rope from his neck - a death she insists on believing accidental. After this she immerses herself in the make-believe world of acting. There is ample material here to suggest some deeply psychological connections, but they are never revealed or, perhaps, understood. Miss Hepburn's family remains her mainstay. Everyone lives happily ever after.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

As Japanese prints, albums and objects began to arrive in plenty from the East, a kind of mania set in among artists, critics, designers and collectors alike. And when Japan proudly sent a large cache of art and objects to the 1867 International Exposition in Paris, that enthusiasm began to reach a broader public. The rest, as writers so often like to say, is history, but it is a history in which art, fashion and commerce, deep understanding and superficial exploitation, invention and mimickry mingle in about equal parts. It is also a history that forms one of the most exciting chapters in the story of 19th-century art and to which several generations of scholars and curators have devoted much time and thought in both written and exhibition form.",1988-08-07T05:00:00+0000

Becker, who defeated John McEnroe in straight sets in the final of the United States Hardcourts championship in Indianapolis on Sunday, was found to have an inflammation of a fibrous tissue that runs from the heel to the toe, according to Dr. J. P. Schaman. He said Becker has a ''50-50 chance'' of healing in time for the Aug. 29 opening of the Open. Although he said he knew of no cases in which the injury required surgery, Schaman said the injury has the potential to become chronic if not treated immediately. Becker said he suffered the injury six weeks ago, but that it got better when he took time off. It resurfaced, he said, at Indianapolis from running on the hard courts. ''It sounds crazy that I beat McEnroe, 6-4, 6-2, yesterday and today I can't play,'' he said. ''But the farther I got in the tournament, the more it hurt. I woke up this morning and I said, 'I'm 20 years old and I can't walk to the bathroom. What is this?'

Nonetheless, Morton's life and work reflects many esthetic currents of the 1970's, when emerging artists struggled with the authoritative legacy of Minimalism and its non-objective offshoot, Conceptualism. Morton's activites included installations and, toward the end of her life, some painting: they touched on the rising interest in feminism, decoration and subject matter, pulling them together in ways that, while unfulfilled, were quite unusual.",1988-08-12T05:00:00+0000

us,CONSUMER'S WORLD: Guidepost; Choosing and Using Exterior Paints,"Today's outdoor paints are long lasting and easy to apply with either a brush or a roller, and most can be used on different surfaces. But anyone who is tempted even in the full heat of summer to redo the shutters or the garage door should remember that no one paint can be used for everything or under all conditions, so read instruction labels carefully. Latex paints, which are thinned with water, are the easiest to apply. But oil-base paints, thinned with solvents, bond better to some surfaces, like old paint that is dusty or chalky. Latex paints dry quickly, and two coats can often be applied in one day. They are also less likely to peel if there are moisture problems. Avoid applying latex paint when the sun is at its hottest. Latex can be applied over oil paint, and vice versa, but if the old surface is glossy, sand it. Where bare wood is exposed, prime first. SURFACE WHAT TO USE Stucco, wood, aluminum, plywood or hardwood siding Flat latex house paint Doors, windows, wood trim Glossy trim paint or semigloss oil or latex house paint Wood shingles, shakes Semitransparent oil stain, if wood is raw or previously stained. If previously painted, allow to weather; then use opaque latex shingle stain.",1988-08-13T05:00:00+0000

In the literary free-fire zone of American culture and political commentary, Hunter S. Thompson has always been on point. In his latest book, Mr. Thompson, author of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' and ''Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72,'' addresses new targets of opportunity - from Muammar el-Qaddafi and Ferdinand Marcos to a Soldier of Fortune trade show, from the George Bush campaign to handicapping the likelihood of a Democratic victory in November. His writing, ever feisty, proves again (as if it were necessary) that he is one of our most incisive, insightful and hilarious social critics. This collection, from his stint as a columnist for The San Francisco Examiner, is vintage Thompson. His celebrated gonzo style is here: facts blended with a savage embroidery of the truth. There are many swings of style and mood, but the heart of the book is disquieting. Mr. Thompson peers into the American future (so far as he is able) and is not happy. Assailing the present Administration, stockbrokers, television, newspapers and various foreign powers, he sees a sobering and profound discontent in American life. With ''Generation of Swine'' Mr. Thompson shows himself to be an outlandish, skeptical Jeremiah. But one harbors a suspicion that his is the kind of unvarnished, crazy wisdom that is valuable in these times. In moderation, of course.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

The House version would raise it by 40 cents a year until it reaches $4.55. Sar Levitan, professor of economics at George Washington University and director of the Center for Social Policy, talked with the Business Forum editor, Joel Kurtzman, about America's declining wages and the need to increase the minimum wage. Question: In the last decade, 20 million new jobs were created. Would you characterize these jobs as good jobs? Mr. Levitan: It is overstating the case to say that most of the jobs created in the last 10 years have been good jobs. A large percentage are poor-quality jobs, meaning they are low paying with few benefits. Many of these jobs are also part-time jobs. Q. Since 1983 hasn't the growth of full-time employment outpaced the growth of part-time employment? Mr. Levitan: It is misleading to use 1983 as a benchmark to examine job creation. In 1982 we had just come out of a deep recession. There is a lag between the end of a recession and the creation of new jobs. Because of that recession, 1983 still had the highest rate of unemployment since World War II.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE ADVENTURES OF TELEMACHUS. By Louis Aragon. Translated by Renee Riese Hubert and Judd D. Hubert. (University of Nebraska, $18.95.) Published in 1922, Louis Aragon's novel ''The Adventures of Telemachus'' occupies a pivotal position in which Dadaism and Surrealism overlap. A subversive Dadaist impulse certainly figured in Aragon's choice of Francois Fenelon's 17th-century prose epic ''Aventures de Telemaque'' for a parodic model, since Fenelon's earnestly moralistic retelling of Homer and Virgil provided a target rich in literary reference and high-mindedness. The tale of the search by young Telemachus for his father, Ulysses, is traditionally read as a metaphor of self-discovery. In Aragon's interpretation, however, it is a comic case of self-dismantling, replete with surrealistic imagery. Advised by his cryptic guide Mentor and wooed by the sea nymphs Calypso and Eucharis, Telemachus tries to assemble a workable view of himself and the world. Instead, confusion reigns. Telemachus appears in one set piece after another. Deliberately stagy, each one celebrates and mocks the artifice with which it has been constructed. The actual story is scant and generally irrelevant to Aragon's declarations on language, fate and the void. Made against a jerry-built backdrop of ancient myth, these pronouncements sound laughable even when one detects the slyly placed kernel of seriousness hidden beneath the carnival trappings. In this inventive first translation into English, by Renee and Judd Hubert, Aragon's farce is a funhouse of double-think and mirror readings; the wise reader enters with disbelief well suspended and a taste for the game.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

(St. Martin's, $12.95) This quirky and slight coming-of-age novel tells the story of Fergus Maguire, who is expelled from college after disappearing for a lost weekend of heroin snorting and carousing in London. He returns from this disgrace to the family home in Dublin, where his disappointed and disapproving father awaits. But after the elder Maguire dies in a swimming accident, the reading of his will reveals more anger than disappointment: Fergus's mother and sister are the only beneficiaries of the estate. The guilt-ridden young man returns to London, where he takes a job answering the mail at a television network. He gets involved with an old girlfriend, a new one and a crowd of unsympathetic friends who revive his former experiments with drugs. Of more interest, however, are Fergus's neighbors, an Indian family whose members are the victims of local terrorism that eventually leads to tragedy. In these few episodes Carlo Gebler shines, creating a portrait of London's class violence that stings with the evidence of a good writer at work. This fragment of storytelling suggests that Mr. Gebler, in his third novel, would have been better off concentrating on his own fictional vision rather than aping the recent crop of yuppie angst sagas.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

The tremors that shook world financial markets last October have been closely scrutinized, yet thus far the reams of reports have done little to reassure anxious investors. Nor have they so altered the rules of the game that professionals on Wall Street would be willing to wager against the possibility of another blowout. Martin Mayer, the highly regarded financial writer, shares that concern and in the course of ''Markets'' tells us why. His new book, Mr. Mayer says, is ''about prices and where they come from.'' The reader is swept around the world, from the New Bedford, Mass., fish market to the New York Stock Exchange to Japan. Sprinkled throughout are sketches of a rich assortment of people, mostly men, who, in the author's words, ''thrive financially and psychologically on volatility, levels of unpredictability that disturb and frighten the average sensual man.'' Not surprisingly, the changes Mr. Mayer prescribes go far beyond those suggested to date. Computer-driven trading, for example, was played down as a cause of the crash by a Presidential task force. The author is not so sure; he believes a Federal ''transfer tax'' ought to be paid by all sellers of stock to curb its use. Even if the advice is not heeded, ''Markets'' tells an important story of how financial markets, protected by more than 40 years of relative peace, can evolve and subsequently construct their own global war games.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

First, because there's an overabundance of them and, second, because there are some things rats just won't do. If we are to believe John Martel, the trial lawyer who is the author of this first novel, it's no joke. Stafford, Parrish & MacAllister is a snooty San Francisco law firm that has traditionally specialized in unexciting but lucrative fields. But the firm, led by Austin Barrington, is experiencing financial difficulties. Barrington has two choices: cut costs by lopping off several associates or risk everything by taking on a controversial case representing a town whose citizens have been poisoned by toxic waste. By choosing the latter, it would seem that Barrington is on the side of the angels. But, because of a laboratory error, he feels compelled to turn to nefarious deeds to save his case. Along for the ride are a brilliant young trial attorney, a stunning model turned lawyer and a homicide detective who's investigating several murders tied to the case. Unfortunately, Mr. Martel, who knows the ins and outs of preparing a court case and shows promise as a prose stylist, gives us stereotypical characters and then places them in overly familiar situations. This might not be fatal if ''Partners'' didn't get bogged down in the decidedly uninteresting private lives of its characters, thus deteriorating into little more than soap opera.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

To its conquerors, South America may have seemed a promised land, chockablock with cities of gold and fountains of youth, but to the bedraggled losers who first settled Salbago, the mythical island setting of this lush, lusty novel, paradise is more like a toxic-waste site. Nestled into metaphorical latitudes between the Old World and the New, the place soon becomes ''an enemy and a curse,'' a seedy way station teetering unsteadily between past and future. Worse yet, there is no escaping this fetid dump. In ''Ships Afire,'' the Spanish novelist J. J. Armas Marcelo has given us a wild world of baroque corruption and illusion, a place of devious sexuality and high irony where the history of imperial Spain has been deftly turned on its head. From a secret brothel of sea cows to a perpetually run-down cathedral that began crumbling even as it was being built, this surreal universe is filled with odd truths and odder inhabitants. Although the author is a native of the Canary Islands, his structure, style and skewed sensibility all recall Latin American fiction of the early ''boom'' period when novelists routinely performed magic tricks with time, history and language, enhancing reality by the fantasies they wove. But despite such reverberations, in this frisky translation by Sarah Arvio, Mr. Armas Marcelo shows himself to be an original, a unique voice that deserves to be heard from again.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

But it is true even of quite small dealers' exhibitions, like the survey of his prints that was mounted this summer by the Lumley-Cazalet Gallery in London. (Many was the longtime admirer of Matisse who had never before seen the prints in color that relate to his big decoration at the Barnes Collection in Merion, Pa.) The Lumley-Cazalet show is relevant in the context of the exhibition of Matisse prints owned by the Museum of Modern Art and on view there through Nov. 6. This show, first put on at the Fort Worth Museum of Art in Texas in October 1986, has been seen in five other cities on its leisurely way back to New York.

Recently the church has undergone a long and expensive structural restoration, supported in the main by the property developer and art patron Peter Palumbo, whose office adjoins the church. As part of the restoration team, George Sexton, an American architect and one of the younger generation of lighting consultants, devised a lighting plan appropriate to the building's integrity. The results provide the occasion for a consideration of light as a material component of architecture.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"Written and photographed by Lou Stoumen, who has won two Academy Awards as a producer of documentaries, JOURNEY TO LAND'S END: A Paper Movie (Celestial Arts, Cloth, $19.95; Paper, $9.95) is a hip little fable for adults that takes a sad and humorous trip to the polluted End of the World, with time out for Love along the way. ''Now playing,'' the cover proclaims, ''at a future near you.'' The tale is carried along as much by pictures as by words. Mr. Stoumen has a rhythm of his own that leaves plenty of time for digression and jump cuts. His photographs range from clever to fey to abstract, from straightforward observation to obliquely viewed oddities and surprises. The images sometimes illustrate, sometimes suggest, sometimes crack wise, but always, as in more conventional movies, pictures and text dance with each other to move the story forward. Now and then the writing becomes too obvious or too precious, and the tale is perhaps a bit forced for the kind of profound lunacy it aspires to. Still, the journey has its strong and poignant moments, both visual and verbal: ''History has turned out to be / proud angry men wrapped in flags.'' The author can also be sharp and snappy, as in a vignette about a conceptual artist who masturbates in a shop window and has herself shot in the arm, thereby winning success with a line of designer jeans, ''a Major Foundation Grant and a Rock Star Lover.'' There's a dose of sardonic charm here, and a mournful smile at Land's End.",1988-08-14T05:00:00+0000

The discount rate, which is what the Fed charges on its loans to banks, is now at its highest level since July 1986. The prime rate, which is the basis for rates on corporate and consumer loans, is in double digits for the first time since June 1985. The discount rate, last raised in September of 1987, had been lagging market rates for some time. Those rates have been rising as investors looked at the signs of a vigorous economy and saw a potential for accelerating inflation. An eventual move by the Fed had been widely expected, but the markets still seemed taken aback by the Fed's timing.

The Chesapeake, Va., driver started fifth in the 40-car lineup and hung near the front throughout the 90-lap, 219-mile event on the 2.428-mile, seven-turn road course.

Asked if he planned to try to catch on with another team, Plunkett laughed. ''I don't think there's too much demand for 40-year-old quarterbacks,'' he said. Plunkett's release indicated that Mike Shanahan, the first-year coach, intends to keep three quarterbacks, with Steve Beuerlein and Vince Evans being the top two. Plunkett joined the Raiders in September 1978 after spending the 1976 and 1977 seasons with the 49ers, who then released him. He was the first man picked in the 1971 N.F.L. draft by New England after winning the Heisman Trophy during his senior year at Stanford. Plunkett led the Raiders to two Super Bowl victories, after the 1980 and 1983 seasons, and was named the Super Bowl's most valuable player after the Raiders beat Philadelphia, 27-10, in January 1981. In his career, Plunkett had 1,943 completions in 3,701 attempts for 25,882 yards with 164 touchdowns and 198 interceptions. (AP)",1988-08-16T05:00:00+0000

''The important thing is that the players don't do anything drastic without discussing everything from a point of view which is not emotional,'' Sather, also the team's president and general manager, said in Edmonton, Alberta. Players have reportedly threatened to strike unless the owner, Peter Pocklington, sells the team. Sather called the threat ''ridiculous.'' The bottom line, he said, is that the trade to the Los Angeles Kings didn't have to happen. ''If Wayne totally wanted to stay and if Peter totally didn't want to trade him, they would have found a way,'' he said. ''I did personally go up to Wayne and tell him if he didn't want to be traded I would personally stop it.'' (AP)",1988-08-16T05:00:00+0000

As the latest evidence of a booming economy, it raised the possibility the Government will have to take steps to raise interest rates again to contain inflation. [ Page A1. ] The Government is investigating ''possible irregularities or improprieties'' involving two Navy contracts, valued at almost $900 million, with Electronic Data Systems. The company's parent, General Motors, disclosed the information to the S.E.C. [ A16. ] The Farm Credit System reported a $170 million profit for the second quarter, continuing an improvement trend based on a reduction in its provision for loan losses. The system has 37 borrower-owned banks and associations [ A2. ] Sales of cars and light trucks were strong in August but were down 6.6 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. Car sales fell 7.6 percent, while light-truck sales fell 4.9 percent. [ D5. ] COMPANIES Random House will acquire Crown Publishing, one of the last family-owned major publishing houses in the U.S. Crown has a stable of best-selling authors and is also one of the major players in the remainder market, buying overpublished books and reselling them at a discount. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. [ D1. ] A $70-a-share tender offer for Interco was begun.

The daughter of Seattle Slew and Glowing Tribute, owned by Paul Melln's Rokeby Stable and trained by Mack Miller, was keeping alive a family tradition. Her dam, Glowing Tribute, won the 1976 Diana as a 3-year-old and so did another daughter of Glowing Tribute, Wild Applause, in 1984. Glowing Honor, the lightweight in the field yesterday at 106 pounds, was one of only two 3-year-olds in the field of nine. The other, Sunny Roberta, finished second, with Graceful Darby third and Gaily Gaily fourth. Glowing Honor, who ran the mile and an eighth on the grass in 1:49 2/5 under Pat Day, paid $10 for $2 to win. Glowing Honor is now undefeated in three grass starts after losing her first three on the dirt.

us,The Parties on the Issues,"Excerpts from the party platforms. REPUBLICANS - ABORTION: ''The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.'' DEMOCRATS - ABORTION: ''The fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.'' REPUBLICANS - MINIMUM WAGE: ''As an alternative to inflationary -and job-destroying - increases in the minimum wage, we will work to boost the incomes of the working poor through the earned income tax credit . . .'' DEMOCRATS - MINIMUM WAGE: The party supports ''an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families out of poverty . . .'' REPUBLICANS - CHILD CARE: ''In returning to our traditional commitment to children, the Republican Party proposes a radically different approach: establish a toddler tax credit for pre-school children as proposed by Vice President Bush, available to all families of modest means, to help them support and care for their children in a manner best suited to their families' values and traditions . . .'' DEMOCRATS - CHILD CARE: ''We believe that Government should set the standard in recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced . . . by major increases in assistance making child care more available and affordable to low and middle income families, helping states build a strong child care infrastructure, setting minimum standards for health, safety and quality . . . .'' REPUBLICANS - AIDS: ''Those who suffer from AIDS, their families and the men and women of medicine who care for the afflicted deserve our compassion and help . . . . We must not only marshal our scientific resources against AIDS, but must also protect those who do not have the disease. In this regard, eduation plays a critical role. AIDS education should emphasize that abstinence from drug abuse and sexual activity outside of marriage is the safest way to avoid infection with the AIDS virus. DEMOCRATS - AIDS: ''The HIV/AIDS epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency requiring increased support for accelerated research on, and expedited F.D.A. approval of, treatments and vaccines, comprehensive education and prevention, compassionate patient care, adoption of the public health community consensus on voluntary and confidential testing and counseling, and protection of the civil rights of those suffering from AIDS or AIDS-related complex or testing positive for the HIV antibody.'' REPUBLICANS - BUDGET, TAXES: ''We oppose any attempts to increase taxes . . . . We will reduce to 15 percent the tax rates for long-term capital gains . . . . We call for a flexible freeze on current Government spending . . . . We call for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution . . . .'' DEMOCRATS - BUDGET, TAXES: ''We believe that it is time for America to meet the challenge to change priorities after eight years of devastating Republican policies . . . to reinvest in its people within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility . . . . Investing in America and reducing the deficit requires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and that we restrain Pentagon spending.'' REPUBLICANS - SOUTH AFRICA: ''Republicans deplore the apartheid system of South Africa and consider it morally repugnant . . . . We believe firmly that one element in the evolution of black political progress must be black economic progress; actions designed to pressure the government of South Africa must not have the effect of adversely affecting the rising aspirations and achievements of black South African entrepreneurs and workers and their families.'' DEMOCRATS - SOUTH AFRICA: ''We believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement, to declare South Africa a terrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its economy, to lead the international community in participation in these actions, and to determine a date certain by which United States corporationss must leave South Africa. REPUBLICANS - SOVIET UNION: ''Republicans are proud that it was a Republican President who extended freedom's hand and message to the Soviet Union. It will be a new Republican President who can best build on that progress, ever cautious of Communism's long history of expansionism and false promises. We are prepared to embrace real reform, but we will not leave America unprepared should reform prove illusory.'' DEMOCRATS - SOVIET UNION: ''We believe in . . . maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat . . . standing up to any American adversaries whenever necessary and sitting down with them whenever possible . . . testing the intentions of the new Soviet leaders about arms control, emigration, human rights and other issues . . .''

For much of General Zia's tenure, human rights groups criticized Pakistan for imprisoning citizens without trial. The press was also under censorship. After ending eight years of martial law in 1985, General Zia hoped to unify the country using religion -more than 90 percent of the roughly 100 million Pakistanis are Moslem - under a plan that, among other things, banned liquor and gambling. But much of the plan, including drastic punishment under religious law, was never carried out. Last May, General Zia dismissed his Prime Minister, Mohammad Khan Junejo, and Mr. Junejo's Cabinet, accusing the civilians of incompetence, corruption and indifference to Islam. Elections were scheduled Nov. 16, putting the main opposition figure, Benazir Bhutto, daughter of the late Prime Minister, at a disadvantage: She is pregnant and expects to give birth then.

Crayfish is currently on the appetizer menu. Some entrees are poached turbot with brown butter and horseradish, medallions of veal, and snow grouse served with potato-zucchini cake and lingonberries. Brambleberry sorbet adds an appropriately Scandinavian touch to the meal. Downstairs is prix fixe, $32 for lunch and $55 for dinner. A la carte menu upstairs: $12 to $18.50 for main courses. Lunch from noon to 2:30 P.M. on Fridays. Dinner, 5:30 to 10:30 P.M. Fridays and Saturdays. Closed Sundays.

The appetizer list offers a duck terrine in rich-flavored aspic, and sweetbread salad with endive and spinach. New to the menu is a carpaccio of the day's special fish, dressed with lime, lemon and mint. Recommended among the entrees are the lobster fricassee, with fresh ginger; grilled lamb chops; roast chicken with dauphinoise potatoes, and Norwegian salmon with mustard sauce. A new entree is the mignonette of beef with roasted shallots. The special house dessert is apple napoleon: a caramel-glazed pastry lid tops apple slices and pastry cream. Appetizers at dinner range from $7.75 to $11.75; entrees, $17.75 to $25.75. Lunch on Fridays from noon to 3:30 P.M.; Friday and Saturday dinner from 5:30 to 11:30 P.M. Closed Sundays until after Labor Day. Maurice ***(Dec. 19, 1986), Hotel Parker Meridien, 118 West 57th Street (245-7788) - This French restaurant is luxuriously decorated with mirrored panels, painted floral murals and Oriental-style rugs. The staff is highly professional. A winning appetizer is ravioli filled with scallops, zucchini and fresh thyme. Other selections include delicately cut smoked salmon with red and black caviar, and baked oysters with leeks. Duck Apicius is an acclaimed main course. The duck is roasted and glazed with honey, coriander, cumin, saffron and white pepper, and served with the glaze and a tart sauce. Calf's liver, smoked Maine lobster, roast quail with apples, and striped bass fillet scaled with crisp potato slices are other entree choices. The raspberry napoleon is a recommended dessert. Prix-fixe lunch is $32; prix-fixe pre-theater dinner is $36 (served from 5:30 to 6:30 P.M.). Dinner is also a la carte, at $9.50 to $17.50 for appetizers, and $23 to $35 for entrees. Friday lunch from noon to 2:15 P.M. and dinner on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 6 to 10:30 P.M. Manhattan Ocean Club *(June 10, 1988), 57 West 58th Street (371-7777) - Neither a club, nor particularly maritime in decor, this is a handsome and sophisticated midtown seafood house. The main dining room is painted in cream color and pastels, and ceramic pieces by Picasso are installed behind glass on the walls. A twisting stairway leads to an upstairs dining room. Tuna with veal mousseline, five oysters baked five ways (with Pernod, curry, peppers, pesto and oregano), and crab cakes are recommended to start. Tuna steak is charred outside, and is enhanced by a tomato-mint vinaigrette. Other good entrees are halibut with beurre blanc, farm-raised striped bass with soy and ginger sauce, and mahi-mahi with citrus butter. Desserts are copious and complex; the house special is a little chocolate shopping bag filled with white chocolate mousse and surrounded with strawberry sauce. Appetizers at dinner range from $8.50 to $11.50, and entrees from $19.50 to $26.50. Open noon to midnight on Fridays, 5 P.M. to midnight Saturdays and Sundays.

Home canning, the traditional answer to the overabundance of summer's harvest, must be done with care to avoid the risk of botulism and other toxins. Always use only the freshest, firmest unblemished fruits and vegetables. To be sure that your canned tomatoes, corn relish or blackberry jam will be both delicious and safe to eat, you can consult inexpensive publications offered by the Government. Write to the Superintendent of Documents, United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402-9325, to order these pamphlets: Home and Garden Bulletin No. 8 - ''Home Canning of Fruits and Vegetables,'' $1.50; and No. 56 - ''How to Make Jellies, Jams and Preserves at Home,'' $2.50. Here are some basic tips. Equipment Use only sterilized jars designed for home canning, fitted with new two-part lids. Do not re-use old lids. Lids and jars, with directions are at most houseware stores. Processing Use a boiling-water bath for jars containing high-acid foods (most fruits and pickles), and a pressure-canner for low-acid foods (vegetables) Sealing Check seals 24 hours after canning to see that they are tight.

But the monthly index showed prices rising a strong six-tenths of 1 percent over June, with five of seven major components posting price rises. In June, prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent.

Carlucci said. A report on the incident was released. Page 1 Military analysis: The Navy's rules of accountability for ship captains appear to have been bent by the Defense Secretary, who approved the recommendations of the Vincennes board of investigation. 1 The downing of the Iranian jetliner occurred 11 minutes from the time the Vincennes first opened fire on Iranian gunboats, according to the Pentagon's report of the incident, in which 290 people died. 5 Burma named a new leader, U Maung Maung, the Attorney General and one of two civilians in the Cabinet. People who had demonstrated against the Government appeared to remain unsatisfied. 3 Pakistanis are shocked and subdued over the death of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. In Karachi, where President Zia had few admirers, there are few displays of mourning, but no visible rejoicing. 3 The brother of the Afghan President said that the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul had little support from the Afghan people and would collapse. Sediqullah Rahi denounced his brother, President Najibullah. 2 Moscow has cleared 636 victims of Stalin's terror of the charges for which they were executed or sent to labor camps and plans to investigate the assassination of Sergei M. Kirov, the newspaper Pravda reported. 4 North and South Korean legislators met for the first time in nearly three years, but failed to agree on the agenda or number of participants in joint parliamentary talks they hope to hold later this month. 3 Middle-class Italy takes to the beach in August at places like Marina Velca, 50 miles from Rome.

The city had distributed payroll checks without a state board's review. 29 A teacher who was attacked last spring by a youth with a baseball bat says he wants to return to teaching even though he lost his right eye. Gary Smith was one of four teachers attacked in one week. 29 People who used unlicensed guns to defend themselves have generally not received prison sentences in New York City, even though they are liable to up to a year in jail, law-enforcement authorities say. 29 New York City's auxiliary police are the unpaid civilian shadow of the Police Department.

This is a collection of previously published articles by a physician who has been, as he puts it, ''privileged to share numerous crises with the peoples of the Third World.'' He was in Managua in 1972-73, running the relief program after the earthquake, and then back in Nicaragua many times - in 1987, he made clinical rounds in a tiny hospital at Puerto Cabezas that had been crippled by the United States economic embargo. He toured war-torn Lebanon in 1982: ''Armenian scholars no longer search for God in the Near East School of Theology in West Beirut. . . . The conference hall where ecclesiastical nuances were once the topic of discussion now contains two operating tables for assembly-line amputations and a bin for severed limbs.'' He has been involved with the health care system in Somalia for more than 25 years. In these essays, Kevin M. Cahill addresses United States policy in Nicaragua, Israeli policy in Lebanon and America's potential role in Northern Ireland. But the themes that recur most forcefully are the saddening reminders of how wars, embargoes and famines affect the lives of those who will never shape policy. There is regret, but there is anger as well: ''The antibiotics we take for granted do not exist in the real world of Puerto Cabezas. There mothers and babies die of treatable infections because a U.S. President wants Nicaragua to 'cry uncle.' '' Whatever his subject, Dr. Cahill, director of the Tropical Disease Center at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, commands our attention with the unmistakable authority of a journeyer returned from scenes of great suffering. As a physician, he has ministered to the afflicted, whether refugees in Somalia or AIDS victims in New York, and in his essays he is an advocate for all his patients.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

The women pictured here, for instance, have all created an individual look that is a variation on an established and elegant theme. The timeless simplicity of their long camel-colored coats signals a revival of classic American clothes for this fall and winter. In a season of choices, each woman selected this tasteful, traditional style, giving a vote of confidence to the effortless American way of dressing that emphasizes comfort, function and practicality. The dash of fashion is in the cut of the coat rather than in its color or the details of its design. It's this attention to form and function that is characterizing fashion's move into the next decade. The result is a no-nonsense look of quiet elegance that triumphs over the exaggerated silhouettes and excessive frills shown in past seasons by many top designers. Instead of choosing a garment with a limited life, women are opting for a classic that can be worn for years, whether it is a superbly fitted coat or a casual flaring one.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

When it comes to selecting innocent victims, the fertile imaginations of terrorists seem to be exceeded only by those of thriller writers. Airplanes full of tourists held for political ransom are, of course, now overly familiar. The same is true for cruise ships, hotels and conventions of business leaders. What fresh targets are left to grab the attention and awaken the sympathies of a toughened public? What will force even the most defiant government to capitulate to impossible demands? How about the capture of an exclusive boys' school, located in the hills of Rome, where members of the American elite - senators, presidents of gigantic corporations and even Mafia dons - send their sons for a veneer of Old World education? The idea certainly attracts one drug-dealing revolutionary, known as Sharif and code-named the Flaming Sword. He has his followers seize the students of St. Anselm's School, then begins issuing outrageous demands, the most extreme of which is that the Sixth Fleet never return to the eastern Mediterranean. If Sharif wins, as the American President points out, ''he'd be the biggest thing to hit the Middle East since Mohammed.'' For a plot like this to work, either in a thriller or as a terrorist action, it must be well planned, move swiftly and carry enough of a realistic edge to make the threats believable. Luckily for the student body of St. Anselm's, Sharif lacks what it takes. Unfortunately for the reader, William P. Kennedy, an advertising executive who is the author of two previous novels, is only somewhat more successful. The intricate planning of ''Toy Soldiers'' is adequate, its scenes of sudden violence well written, but page after page of boring explication slows the novel's pace to a crawl. In addition, the lack of rounded characters makes it difficult to care about what fate befalls any of them, from the most angelic child to the master of evil himself.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Of course, all these activities are good for them. Or are they? I wonder if we stop at all to think of the pressure to excel that we impose on our children.

In ''Faraway Places,'' Tom Spanbauer's promising fiction debut, images of innocence are woven into a taut, brutal narrative of three murders as witnessed by a 13-year-old named Jake Weber. The setting is Wind River, Idaho, a rural landscape where power lines hinge the alfalfa fields to the sky. The drama begins when Jake takes a forbidden swim in the river, during which he sees on shore three people he's been told to avoid - and whose murders he watches in shocked succession. As Jake gropes to comprehend these and other gruesome events, Mr. Spanbauer fills his story with analogies and associations drawn from Jake's everyday life, using everything from the boy's catechism to fairy tales, comics and movies, even the state fair. Thus seemingly mundane observations are connected, perverted by the sinister. A whirring fan, the chords of a church organ, the rustling of pigeon wings and cottonwood leaves lead the precocious Jake to recall the screams of a dying woman, a murderer's savage cursing, the hideous sound of five Doberman pinschers devouring their owner's corpse. Throughout the novel, Jake's mother's litany with her rosary beads and her assurances that ''one thing always leads to another'' feed the child's superstitious conviction that his disobedient swim has caused the violence that now haunts him. And as this conviction grows, the repetitious, incantatory quality of Jake's injured monologue, which initially seems vexing, ultimately comes to hypnotize, shimmering like the brilliant sun on the alfalfa fields.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Nicklaus appeared to have a berth in the final sewed up until he hit the par-5 17th, probably the easiest hole he designed on the Castle Pines Golf Club course. Under the modified Stableford scoring system used for this tournament, a double-bogey, and anything higher, costs a player 3 points. In Nicklaus's case, he dropped from 7 points and a berth in the 18-man final round to 4 points and out. Nicklaus finished in a four-way tie for 34th, worth $5,275 from the total purse of $1 million. That was enough to make him the first man to reach $5 million in career earnings. He is now at $5,002,825. Bruce Lietzke led the 18 qualifiers with 14 points. Jodie Mudd and Ben Crenshaw each had 13 points.(AP) Moody Grabs Second-Round Lead: Orville Moody made seven birdie putts and missed only one green in regulation yesterday, shooting a six-under par 65 to go nine under and grab the second-round lead at the $250,000 Greater Grand Rapids (Mich.) Open. Moody had a two-day total of 133 and a one-shot lead over first-day leader Chi Chi Rodriguez and Harold Henning. The defending champion, Billy Casper, and Jim Ferree, who won the tournament in 1986, were two shots off the lead.(AP) Basketball Olympians Win Again: Jeff Grayer, a 6-foot-5-inch guard from Iowa State, led all scorers with 18 points Friday night as the United States Olympic team overwhelmed a team of National Basketball Association players, 100-67, at Richfield, Ohio. Grayer was the fifth player to lead the United States team in scoring in the four games against N.B.A. opposition. Danny Manning of Kansas shared the lead with Dan Majerle of Central Michigan on Aug. 7 in Providence, R.I. The Olympic team won all four games. On Friday, Mitch Richmond of Kansas State scored 14 points, Manning 12, Willie Anderson of Georgia 11 and Hersey Hawkins of Bradley 10. David Robinson, center on the Olympic team, got into early foul trouble, picking up his fourth foul just 29 seconds into the second half. He finished with 6 points and 5 rebounds in 12 minutes.(AP) Cycling Gold Medalist Fails to Qualify: Mark Gorski, winner of the 1984 Olympic gold medal in the 1,000-meter event, lost a national championship and a berth on this year's United States Olympic team after Ken Carpenter beat him Friday night in the final of the men's match sprint at the United States track cycling Olympic trials and national championships in Houston. Carpenter, of La Mesa, Calif., pulled away from Gorski on the last lap and held on to win his first national sprint championship and a trip to Seoul. Carpenter, the 1987 Pan Am Games gold medalist, was timed in 11.49 and 11.95 seconds, beating Gorski in straight heats.

In this science-fiction thriller, the second novel by the Australian writer Richard Maynard, seven astronauts leave Earth in search of life on other planets. They have no reason to believe that their society's social and technological development will not continue to flourish. After spending 15 years in space, they know that much more time - perhaps as much as several centuries - has passed on Earth, yet still they expect a warm welcome home. Instead they discover that in their absence man has devolved to a level of prehistoric savagery. Presented as a memoir by the spaceship's captain, ''The Return'' chronicles the men's adventures as they struggle to retain a trace of civilization in a ruthless land where only the strong survive. In the process, scenes of ritual human sacrifice and cannibalism are juxtaposed with glimpses of great pastoral beauty; as the men move through the countryside, abandoned, overgrown cities loom as symbols of their lost greatness. At the same time, the astronauts' attempts to discover the cause of mankind's decline is central to the story's momentum. The solution they finally piece together is an ironic one, with a terrifying implied threat to the future of today's world. ''The Return'' is gripping in its portrayal of seven men trapped in a place that is both familiar and horrifyingly unfamiliar. More than that, it is a chilling vignette of an all too plausible fate that may await us.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Much less ambitious than the subtitle suggests, ''Your Money or Your Life: Economy and Religion in the Middle Ages'' focuses on a shift in the church's attitude toward usury over the course of the 13th century ''to show how an ideological obstacle can fetter or delay the development of a new economic system.'' Jacques Le Goff, a medievalist who is director of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, argues that ''the great controversy surrounding usury constitutes what might be called the 'labor pains of capitalism.' '' During the 13th century, the church's power was beginning to decline and the monetary economy was growing in strength. The problem was that usury, a necessary component of capitalism, was an unmitigated evil to the church. In an earlier book, ''The Birth of Purgatory,'' Mr. Le Goff said that the doctrine of purgatory reached its full development in the late 12th century. In ''Your Money or Your Life,'' purgatory is cast as the church's solution to the theological problem of usury. Before the development of purgatory, a usurer could reach heaven only by making restitution of his sinful gains, something rarely done. The advent of purgatory provided another route: ''The hope of escaping Hell, thanks to Purgatory, permitted the usurer to propel the economy and society of the thirteenth century ahead toward capitalism.'' Mr. Le Goff moves his argument forward in tiny increments, and while the translation is very readable, it is not always clear what point he is trying to make. Over all, however, the book is lucid and surprisingly engaging.",1988-08-21T05:00:00+0000

Though the intervention was broader than last week's, traders said the effects of the move might wear off quickly. The prevailing view among traders is that the dollar will climb, helped by attractive U.S. interest rates. [ Page A1. ] Program trading may not be so pervasive as some investors had feared, a detailed report from the New York Stock Exchange indicated. Traders said the amount of such computerized trading -only 10 percent of the overall volume on the Big Board last month -appeared to be off sharply from last spring. But they said it could still jolt the market. [ A1. ] Stock prices continued their pattern of listlessness, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.78 points. That brought the Dow to 1,990.22, its lowest closing level since May 27. [ D1. ] Prices of Treasury bonds and notes sagged in dull trading as participants reacted defensively in anticipation of a new report on inflation, as well as the sale this week of $25 billion of short- and intermediate-term securities. [ D12. ] Prices of soybean, corn and oat futures plummeted their permitted daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to rainfall in Iowa and slack foreign demand for American grain and soybean products. Wheat futures also closed sharply lower. [ D13. ] COMPANIES An Italian Government agency said it would comply with a Federal Reserve request for information in connection with Banca Commerciale Italiana's takeover bid for Irving Bank. The Fed said on Friday that the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale was considered a bank holding company and would be required to file a formal application. Some banking experts questioned whether Istituto would be willing to meet the Fed's requirements. It was not clear from the Istituto statement whether it was prepared to comply with all the Fed's stipulations. [ D1. ] A Seattle shipbuilding company will emerge from bankruptcy under a new name, Unimar, and the ownership of its 400 union workers. It is believed to be the largest union-led and employee-owned company on the Pacific Coast. [ D1. ] Shares of Wickes jumped sharply on the first day of trading since a management group announced plans to buy the company. Wickes stock rose $3.875, to $13.125, surpassing the $12-a-share offer announced on Sunday. [ D2. ] Apple Computer announced a sweeping reorganization that splits the company into four autonomous divisions and eliminates the position of chief operating officer. [ D4. ] I.B.M. and Carnegie Mellon will create an experimental network that will permit high-speed transmission of computer files. Its designers believe the system has the potential to alter the way office work is done because it will let people use interconnected computers at widely separated sites. [ D4. ] A management group will buy Lear Siegler's auto-interior unit for $500 million, with financing from Kidder, Peabody. [ D3. ] Alltel will buy CP National in an exchange of stock valued at about $300 million. Alltel is the nation's 13th-largest telephone system; CP National has interests in communications, energy and air traffic control equipment.

For that reason, Utah must compensate the Spanish team. Before deciding to send Ortiz to Utah, Zaragoza watched Turpin play on Saturday against a team of junior college players in Salt Lake City. He scored 23 points and grabbed 19 rebounds, but looked considerably heavier than 268 pounds. After the game, Turpin admitted he had not played basketball all summer and was out of shape.

The deal will make American farmers happy. Whether it will raise domestic food prices - as overseas grain sales did in the 1970's - is not clear. Despite the drought, the Agriculture Department said, U.S. grain stocks are adequate to provide the Soviet Union with additional grain. [ Page A1. ] A military contractor is trying to force the Navy to conduct a second competition for a contract worth an estimated $100 million. Comptek Research argues that the fraud inquiry has found illegal acts during the selection process for the contract. [ A21. ] The U.S. trade deficit shrank 14.9 percent in the second quarter, helped by a record level of exports. [ D2. ] Sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell 13.4 percent in mid-August. That was considered a strong showing. [ D5. ] MARKETS The dollar fell against all major currencies. Traders attributed the decline to continued intervention by some central banks and to a report that the Administration found the dollar's recent rise troublesome. Gold rose $2.70 an ounce on the Comex, to $434.90. [ D1. ] Stock prices rebounded strongly, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average above the 2,000 mark. The Dow climbed 37.34 points, to 2,026.67. Today marks the one-year anniversary since the Dow reached its peak of 2,722.42. [ D1. ] Prices of Treasury notes and bonds dipped modestly in sluggish trading. The highlight of the session was a $7.25 billion auction of five-year Treasury notes. [ D16. ] Corn and soybean futures prices moved sharply higher on the Chicago Board of Trade, amid fears of a frost. Wheat and oats also advanced. [ D15. ] Yields rose again on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds. [ D6. ] COMPANIES Farmers Group agreed to a merger with B.A.T. after the British company raised its offer to $75 a share in cash, or about $5.2 billion. B.A.T. wants to make financial services its fourth business line after tobacco, retailing and paper. [ D1. ] The three largest steelmakers announced price increases on sheet steel used for cans. Steel used for beverage cans will be exempted because the industry is seeking to reclaim market share from aluminum companies. [ D1. ] Ford Motor executives believe the outlook for sales is strong, despite analysts' forecasts of a slowdown. [ D5. ] Ashland Oil will pay $25 million to two former executives who claimed they were dismissed for refusing to offer or cover up bribes to foreign officials. Ashland said it would take an after-tax charge of about $25 million in its fiscal fourth quarter. [ D4. ] A proxy challenge against two Scherer directors succeeded, election auditors said. That means 5 of the 11 directors support an effort by the largest shareholder to sell the company. [ D4. ] Harcourt Brace Jovanovich is dismissing 750 workers at its six theme parks, about 10 percent of the work force.

After the 24-year-old goalie underwent five hours of microsurgery to repair three severed tendons and a sliced nerve, the team announced he was not expected back for four to six months. Vanbiesbrouck, who has been undergoing rehabilitative therapy on his wrist, fingers and arm since a cast was removed on July 11, said he received the news he would be permitted to rejoin his team when he visited the New York office of Dr. Susan Craig, who performed the surgery, on Tuesday. ''I was ecstatic,'' he said from Petoskey, Mich., where he was on a fishing holiday. ''I've tried to stay optimistic through the rehab, during which I relied heavily on Dr. Craig and Wendy Levine, my therapist. It was a long, slow process, starting with simple finger movement and then working to form a fist which took me until early August to achieve. I haven't recovered 100 percent, I must continue the therapy treatment to complete the nerve regeneration, but Dr. Craig said I've made so much progress that it's unlikely I could badly hurt my wrist or fingers again.

I've never written one entirely about my father. There are lots of reasons for that, and the most important one may be, oddly enough, that my father is very much alive. It's impossible to imagine him any other way. He is not cut out to be a wraith, a memory, a dream of life. He has a personality, which, couched in culinary terms, would be something like clam chowder - the kind with the tomatoes, not the cream, the kind that seems to have odd little bits of everything thrown together, with a good deal of pepper.

Figures are in US dollars with revenues and income of Australian and United Kingdom operations converted at the average exchange rates for each period. Each ADR represents two of the company's ordinary shares. The company said that in the quarter and full-year periods, improved results were due to gains in United Kingdom, Australia and Pacific Basin, publishing operations, acquisitions in Australia and the Pacific Basin and foreign exchange trading gains. Profitability gains were moderated by higher interest expense, lower dividend income and lower profits for television stations, and filmed entertainment operations in the United States. Throughout the year a decline in minority interests helped offset a use in interest expense. Net income and extraordinary items declined from previous year levels due principally to the absence of significant asset sales and the new business start-up costs for the Fox Broadcasting Co. US operations in 1988 accounted for 42 percent and 40 percent of consolidated revenues and operating profit, respectively; revenues and operating profit of the United Kingdom represent 28 percent and 37 percent, respectively; and the Australian and Pacific Basin operations represent 30 percent and 23 percent, respectively.",1988-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Prices are current, and only weekend hours are given. Alcala **(March 18, 1988), 349 Amsterdam Avenue, at 77th Street (769-9600) - This is a warm and inviting place, with a long marble-topped tapas bar and an elevated brick-walled dining room. It's fun to start off at the tapas bar with its assortment of appetizers. Among the more intriguing tapas (the selection varies daily) are fresh anchovies in a vinegar-laced marinade; morsels of chewy octopus in a similar dressing with pimentos; tender golden rings of fried calamari, and rosy smoked trout over sliced cucumbers with dill. Entrees $14 to $20. Dinner, 5:30 P.M. to midnight Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday. Cafe Luxembourg **(Aug. 5, 1988), 200 West 70th Street (873-7411) - This stylish and lively Art Deco dining room in the Lincoln Center area offers a seasonal menu that is cleverly orchestrated. An enticing summer starter is the lemony salad of cured red snapper brightened with a cilantro vinaigrette. Another possibility is marinated shrimp in a basil vinaigrette, served with an avocado mousse. Entrees $16 to $25. Dinner, 5:30 P.M. to 1:30 A.M. Friday and Saturday; 6 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Sunday. Coastal **(June 12, 1987), 300 Amsterdam Avenue, at 74th Street (769-3988) -Somebody in the kitchen of this serious Upper West Side fish house knows how to cook fish and season it deftly. Among the appetizers worth trying is the trio of vibrant little ceviches: salmon nuggets in tomato concasse, citrus-marinated tuna with red pepper, and red snapper paired with matchsticks of fresh coconut, scallions and Tabasco. Entrees $12.50 to $21. Dinner, 6 P.M. to midnight Friday and Saturday; 5:30 to 10 P.M. Sunday. Gotham Bar and Grill **(Oct. 4, 1985), 12 East 12th Street (620-4020) - This restaurant features a spacious and comfortable multi-tier dining room, and a cooking approach that is contemporary, but not freewheeling. The seafood salad is one of the best in town. Arranged around a pretty fanned avocado is a sparkling abundance of mixed greens replete with squid rings, lobster, scallops, octopus slices and mussels. Tiny red beads of flying-fish roe add a lovely saline edge to the assembly. The entire combination is tossed in a lively olive oil-and-lemon vinaigrette. There are also a shellfish terrine consisting of prawns, scallops and lobster topped with creme fraiche, and marinated mackerel served with yellowfin potatoes. Entrees $24 to $28. Lunch, noon to 2:30 P.M. Friday; dinner, 6 to 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday; 5:30 to 10 P.M. Sunday. John Clancy's **(March 11, 1988), 181 West 10th Street (242-7350) - This is a graceful Greenwich Village restaurant, with a step-down main dining room and bar, whitewashed brick walls and pastel garden prints. As a refreshment in these warm summer days, the chef prepares a cold whole lobster, cracked and served in its shell alongside a salad that varies from day to day: orzo, wild rice or cherry tomatoes with a scallion vinaigrette. Entrees $17.50 to $28.50. Dinner, 6 to 11:30 P.M. Friday and Saturday; 5 to 10 P.M. Sunday. The Sea Grill **(May 20, 1988), 19 West 49th Street (Rockefeller Center) (246-9201) - This restaurant offers a sophisticated subterranean setting facing a graceful outdoor cafe (the skating rink in winter). The chef's style is reflected in a sparkling appetizer called medallions of lobster tartar. The barely steamed lobster meat is coarsely chopped and arranged over spokes of endive and garnished with strips of sun-dried tomatoes and fresh tarragon, then drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and lemon. Entrees $26 to $27.50. Lunch, noon to 3 P.M. Friday; brunch, noon to 3 P.M. Saturday; dinner, 5 to 11 P.M. Friday and Saturday. Closed Sunday.",1988-08-26T05:00:00+0000

Some of it, expecially the new ornamental teak and cast-aluminum models, is sturdy, durable and made to be left outdoors. Other popular styles, though, are prone to rust or are too flimsy to withstand harsh weather. Furniture that is to be left outdoors will benefit from an end-of-season cleaning. Treat metal furniture with wax - automobile wax is fine - to protect the finish. Teak furniture will age to silvery gray if left untreated, and many people like this look. If you want to retain the original finish, though, paint these pieces with teak oil. Furniture that is to be stored indoors should also be thoroughly cleaned, to inhibit rust and mildew. Use a soft brush and mild soap and allow for thorough drying outdoors. Store in a cool, dry place, protected by a cover of old sheets or other cloth.

us,FICTION,"EYESTONE. By D. R. MacDonald. (Pushcart, $15.95.) When you pick up D. R. MacDonald's skillfully written first collection of short stories, you'll be transported to Nova Scotia, and to Cape Breton Island in particular. The time will be spring or summer. The modest houses you visit will be surrounded by wildflowers and mown hay; there will be rocky fields with small streams nearby. The people you meet will either be very old or very young, but it will be the old people who will dominate your thoughts. Laconic, proud, Gaelic-speaking and fiercely independent, they are men and women who simply have to be reckoned with. How, for example, can you forget a woman like Mrs. Corbett from the collection's title story? By nothing but sheer, cool presence she persuades her younger landlord to let her stay in his house, only to turn around and nonchalantly give it back to him. In the highly charged story, ''Of One Kind,'' you'll encounter another older woman, Mrs. MacKay, who is blind and widowed but far from fearful. When Red Donald, a handyman even older than she, comes to help with the chores, he gets caught up in the reminiscences of her youth, with results that are as sad as they are exciting. You won't find these singular old people watching television in rest homes or playing bingo at church socials. Instead, they're living out the traditions of their Scottish ancestors, sometimes railing magnificently at life and sometimes accepting even its most indelicate truths. It is an affecting experience to visit the island that is home to these difficult but exceptional people. And D. R. MacDonald, with his taut, clean and honest prose, couldn't be a better guide.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT. By Ed McBain. (Henry Holt, $16.95.) Ed McBain, the prolific, pseudonymous master of the terse, fast-paced - and formulaic - mystery novel, has once again reconstructed a classic children's story and added a sardonic twist. Jonathan Parrish, who was a homosexual and had AIDS, has been murdered at his beach-front home in the Florida Keys, and his brother Ralph, a homophobic farmer from Indiana, has been charged with the crime. Enter Matthew Hope, a middle-aged, middle-class, middle-of-the-road defense attorney who is convinced of Ralph's innocence. Naturally, the apparently simple case quickly turns Byzantine, replete with wealthy heiresses, illicit romances, sordid sex, a mysterious figure in black and a sassy private investigator called Toots Kiley. (''Who nicknamed you Toots?'' asks her new partner. ''It's not a nickname,'' she replies.) To a regular reader of Mr. McBain's books - already familiar with his one-sentence paragraphs and taut, punchy dialogue - ''The House That Jack Built'' will probably be a welcome addition to the Matthew Hope series, of which there are now eight books. A first-time reader, however, may be distracted by the author's occasional lapses in logic. (It is unlikely, for example, that a local newspaper's morgue, capable of preserving a birth announcement from 1906, would not maintain a file on one of the town's leading businesses.) Even more distracting, however, is the author's obvious manipulation of the plot.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The Yangtze River flows 3,900 miles through China from its glacial source at 20,000 feet on the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau to the East China Sea, watering regions where nearly 350 million Chinese live. Yet sections are so rugged that the world's third-longest river (after the Nile and the Amazon) was not navigated from source to mouth until 1986. These are but a few of the intriguing facts about the Changjiang, or ''Long River,'' as the Chinese call it, served up by Lyman P. Van Slyke, a professor of history at Stanford University. His book is most readable when it cites eyewitness accounts of early Chinese and Western travelers or describes the commerce in tea, rice and salt that created wealth in ancient China. He also brings alive the perilous navigating technique known as tracking, in which onshore gangs of coolies straining against heavy bamboo hawsers slowly hauled the river junks upstream against the surging white water of the gorges. When Mr. Van Slyke turns to geography, his narrative style dries up, and there are no voices from the river people caught up in the momentous economic changes today. This could have been a good book to pack along on one of the popular Yangtze cruises but for Mr. Van Slyke's insistence on rendering virtually every Chinese name in the old Wade-Giles ''romanization'' devised in the 19th century rather than in the Pinyin system used throughout China today. The author contends that ''Wade-Giles and pinyin exist side by side''; perhaps at Stanford they do, but not along the Yangtze, where the Western tourist may not understand that Mr. Van Slyke's ''Chungking in Szechwan province'' is now the city of Chongqing in Sichuan or that the spectacular Hsi-ling Gorge coming up is spelled Xiling in the guidebooks.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

By showing Alfred Stieglitz some drawings by Georgia O'Keeffe, Anita Pollitzer brought about what is perhaps the most storied conjunction in American art. Pollitzer's account of that incident in January 1916 anchors this epistolary memoir-cum-biography, written more than 30 years ago but unpublished until now because O'Keeffe, who died in 1986, refused to approve the manuscript. Pollitzer and O'Keeffe became friends while studying at Columbia University in 1914-15, and they apparently remained so until Pollitzer's death in 1975. Yet the book, which contains 40 black-and-white photographs, suggests they were closest during their student days and for the next few years. Pollitzer quotes only a few letters to her from O'Keeffe after 1917; thereafter, she relies on O'Keeffe's letters to others and references to occasional meetings. The early chapters, written as memoir, are thus the more vivid, personal and insightful. When she's required to fall back on secondary sources, her narrative tails off into warmed-over, sketchy biography. And, of course, she doesn't write critically; her portrait, as one might expect, is thoroughly affectionate and deferential. O'Keeffe was a reclusive person, and 30 years ago her correspondence might have created a stir. But with 125 of her letters (including a number to Pollitzer) published last year in the catalogue for the exhibition celebrating the centennial of her birth, this book reads like an afterthought or a footnote.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Thus, for instance, in Ellmann's posthumously published life of Oscar Wilde the story of Wilde and the history of his epoch dovetail; Mr. Frank's immensely ambitious biography-in-progress of Dostoyevsky is a fact-filled, analytical study of the novelist in the social and political context of 19th-century Russia.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

'I suppose . . . a magazine may decide to print something that hasn't any point just to get people talking.' '' The excerpts that follow are derived from the mail received by The Book Review since the publication of Judy Oppenheimer's essay last month. Evidently the passage of 40 years has not deprived ''The Lottery'' of its power to compel interpretation. To the Editor:",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

In a day when inventors of flying machines often belonged among those who claimed to transmute lead into gold or to communicate with the dead, the Wright brothers had to convince the world that their Wright Flyer was indeed worth paying for. This ''account of the efforts to exploit the Flyer is a suspense story, bearable only because we know how it came out in the end,'' Tom Ferrell said in The Book Review last year. ''The series of negotiations and frustrations, approaches and withdrawals might have maddened lesser men.''",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000
us,NONFICTION,"UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL: The Inside Story of Network Television Sports. By Jim Spence with Dave Diles. (Atheneum, $19.95.) For more than 25 years Jim Spence toiled the fields for ABC Sports, starting as a gofer and winding up as a senior vice president. So if anyone is qualified to give us the ''inside story of network television sports,'' it is Mr. Spence. Touching all bases - from ''Monday Night Football'' to behind-the-scenes financial maneuvering for various sporting events - Mr. Spence, with the able help of Dave Diles, a former broadcaster for ABC Sports, has given us a lively, entertaining and informative look at the television sports business. And make no mistake, it is a business, one that is now something of a runaway train. For instance, ABC acquired the rights to the 1976 Winter Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria, for $10 million. Contrast that figure with the $309 million paid for the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta, and you can see why the argument that money and sports have become synonymous makes sense. ''Up Close and Personal'' is conversational in tone, filled with anecdotes about touchy negotiations, backstabbing and enormous egos (Howard Cosell comes immediately to mind). Mr. Spence is wise enough to give his own voice an occasional rest while eliciting interesting commentary from some of those with whom he worked. And, to his credit, he's not afraid to take on the tough issues - such as the influence television has on sports - though the reader might not always agree with his conclusions. All in all, sports fans and people interested in the business side of television will find much to admire in this book.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

The West German mark has fallen 16 percent against the dollar in the past seven months, and the situation poses an inflationary threat in Germany.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"For all the effects of television on the country's political conscience at the time and for all the wide-screen, technicolor power of ''Platoon'' and ''Full Metal Jacket'' now, it is still the black and whites that best call up the visual memories everyone over a certain age has of America's longest war. THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN VIETNAM (Boston Publishing/Norton, $39.95), a competent illustrated history, contains many of those photographs, along with shots, in color as well as in black and white, not published before. We see again the self-immolation of a Buddhist monk on a Saigon street in 1963, the execution by a bullet to the head of a suspected Vietcong officer in 1968, the anguish of a young woman kneeling over a body at Kent State University in 1970. ''The American Experience in Vietnam'' - successor to a 25-volume set called ''The Vietnam Experience,'' which was also put together by the writers Clark Dougan and Stephen Weiss and the picture editor Kathleen A. Reidy - takes the reader from Lyndon Johnson's inheritance of the Kennedy legacy and a time when ''neutralization was unworkable, withdrawal unthinkable,'' to the commission and construction of Maya Ying Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Washington Mall and the debate over whether it stands as a ''black gash of shame.'' What the book doesn't do is match language with image. The text has a film-documentary organization that intersperses segments of conventional narrative with bites of oral history from servicemen, politicians, reporters, officers and prisoners of war. The bites have some power, sometimes; the narrative on occasion reads like the script for a voice-over. But then there are the pictures.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

Ernesto Sabato is best known for the second of his three novels, ''On Heroes and Tombs,'' a massive, intricate chronicle of murder and passion set in the Argentina of the 1950's. In his 1948 debut novel, ''The Tunnel,'' these themes are already on display, but in a simplified, almost fabulistic form. Mr. Sabato's narrator introduces himself, his crime and the object of his passion in the very first sentence: ''It should be sufficient to say that I am Juan Pablo Castel, the painter who killed Maria Iribarne.'' He then launches into an account of his affair with Maria, a married woman who first draws his attention at an art exhibit. Once their affair begins, however, her elusiveness provokes his jealousy, plunging him into a ''personal hell of analyzing and imagining.'' Does she see other men? Does she actually love her frail, blind husband? Does she love Castel himself? His attempts to answer these questions grow increasingly contorted and obsessive; finally, his crazed solipsism displaces romantic passion as the real subject of the novel. While Castel crouches, knife in hand, in the shrubbery outside Maria's weekend retreat, he makes his condition explicit: ''After all there was only one tunnel, dark and solitary: mine, the tunnel in which I had spent my childhood, my youth, my entire life.'' When it was first published in Spanish, ''The Tunnel'' won the applause of Thomas Mann and Albert Camus and was described as an existentialist classic. Some of today's readers may find Castel's descent into insanity a trifle romanticized. Still, in this fine new translation by Margaret Sayers Peden, Mr. Sabato's novel retains a chilling, memorable power.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000

This was, without a doubt, the most enjoyable vacation we have ever had. On the train, there was no radio, no newspaper, a continuous panorama and interesting people at mealtime and in the lounge car.

us,FICTION,"FOREIGN MATTER. By Robert MacLean. (Atheneum, $17.95.) Not all the mentoring goes on in the business world. Here we have an aspiring humorist receiving instructions from the dead - in this case, P. G. Wodehouse. Bounteous internal evidence in this first novel proclaims that Robert MacLean has closeted himself with a stock of Wodehouse's most representative works, from which he has abstracted archetypal Wodehousian characters and plot devices. In ''Foreign Matter,'' Mr. MacLean employs Wodehouse's basic situation, a gang of zanies assembled at a country house - but on a Greek island instead of in Shropshire. Predictably, he updates the Master with some fairly overt sex, more talked about than accomplished, and topical references like ''Set your phasers on stun.'' There are significant objects to be stolen, concealed or recovered (a horrible painting, a dead dog, a diary), an allowance to be extracted from an unwilling elder, and young lovers (better described as young lusters) to be united. The cast also includes Bertie Wooster and Jeeves figures. The former, called Toby Tucker, is devoted to sleeping, drinking and dancing. But, unlike his literary model, he is also devoted to his girlfriend, Marcie, whose vocation is shopping. The Jeeves figure, in one of Mr. MacLean's better twists, is Marcie's precocious young daughter, who thinks ''in megabytes.'' Following Wodehouse's model, Mr. MacLean puts his Bertie figure through the ritual of seeing his plans go humiliatingly awry, whereupon the Jeeves figure, with awesome intelligence and guile, saves the day at the cost of further humiliation to the Bertie figure. The Wodehouse parallels are brazenly abundant, even including that staple, the vicious dog that traps people on top of wardrobes. However, one tends to be indulgent with this upstart Canadian because his imitation makes not unpleasant light reading. And Mr. MacLean's good taste in mentors could bode well for his future.",1988-08-28T05:00:00+0000
