""They're the most important things that ever happen to people."" This Prince of Darkness, an undertaker with a fondness for Shakespeare and Tennessee Williams, is one of the citizens of the tiny Mississippi Delta town of Arrow Catcher, a lush and tragicomic place that Mr. Nordan has already visited in ""Music of the Swamp"" and ""Wolf Whistle."" Magic and loss combine with despair, futility and violence in this moving story about Hydro Raney, a sweet-tempered, simple-minded hydrocephalic boy who in self-defense kills a malevolent brother and sister as they attempt to rob Mr. William Tell's grocery store. In this steamy, swampy backwater, the sometimes quite mad people of Arrow Catcher coexist in a kind of timeless mythic wonderland, a world of outrageous Southern Gothic storytelling -- although the action is officially set in the 1950's, when the pre-remote-control dial was tuned to Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy on the brand-new Philco. People shoot watermelons and refrigerators in ""The Sharpshooter Blues."" They do it to relax; they do it to prove who they are. But most of all, they do it to prove they are real.

us,Taking the Freud Out of Mother Goose,"FROM THE BEAST TO THE BLONDE On Fairy Tales and Their Tellers. By Marina Warner. Illustrated. 463 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $35. MOTHER GOOSE makes her ambiguous entry into the world of print in the frontispiece to Charles Perrault's ""Histoires ou Contes du Temps Passe"" (1697). An old servant sits spinning by the fire with three children clustered before her. On the wall behind them hangs a signboard marked with these unforgettable words: ""Contes de Ma Mere l'Oye"" (""Mother Goose Tales""). But the picture raises as many questions as it answers. Should the old woman herself be taken for Mother Goose? Why does that name appear only in an illustration, and not on the title page? And -- most curious of all -- where can we find Mother Goose herself in the stories she purportedly tells? For she has in Perrault's pages no textual existence whatsoever, not even as a framing device. Yet the figure herself was hardly new. As the British cultural historian Marina Warner suggests, the phrase ""Mother Goose tale"" was already a proverbial equivalent to the equally proverbial old wives' tale; while under oye, or ""goose,"" a Dictionnaire of 1694 noted that a man tells Mother Goose tales ""when he says things in which there is no semblance of reason.""",1995-11-05T05:00:00+0000

In IDOLS OF THE GAME: A Sporting History of the American Century (Turner, $23.95), Robert Lipsyte, a sports columnist for The New York Times, and Peter Levine, a professor of history at Michigan State University, try to pinpoint exactly how and why Ruth and 15 other outstanding athletes metamorphosed into cultural icons. Books about the lionization of sports figures are nothing new, but Mr. Lipsyte and Mr. Levine have constructed an interesting premise: they contend that their subjects are literally symbols of different periods in 20th-century America. Arnold Palmer, Vince Lombardi and Mickey Mantle represent not only excellence on the playing field but also ""the promise of post-World War II America."" Billie Jean King and Muhammad Ali are not only great competitors but also are emblematic of ""the turbulent 60's, a time in which sports as well as the larger culture confronted the inequities of race, sex and class."" Placing coaches and athletes on cultural time lines is a risky proposition at best -- as is arguing that the contribution of a certain select group reflects the myriad forces at work in society at a particular time. There is something about sports that defies rigid classification. But one does not have to agree totally with the authors to enjoy their book. The description of John L. Sullivan's 75-round bare-knuckle championship bout against Jake Kilrain -- in 115-degree heat, no less -- is worth the price of the book in itself. CAROLYN T. HUGHES",1995-11-05T05:00:00+0000

When we read Barbra Streisand's life story, that question seems more to the point than the usual quest for celebrity dirt: affairs, drugs, her son's sexual orientation. Is she an egotist out of control or a strong, talented perfectionist in a sexist age? In STREISAND: Her Life (Crown, $25), James Spada doesn't really answer the question, but he provides detailed testimony, pro and con, and lets the reader decide. Stephen Sondheim loved her when they worked together on her ""Broadway Album,"" as did Pat Conroy when she filmed his novel ""The Prince of Tides."" Anne Francis hated her when they appeared in the movie ""Funny Girl,"" more than two decades earlier. (""She said: 'Don't touch me. I've been told that a star is never touched in a scene like this.' "") Walter Matthau, her co-star in ""Hello, Dolly!,"" said he was ""appalled by every move she made."" Mr. Spada, who has written biographies of other actresses, including Grace Kelly and Bette Davis, manages to make Ms. Streisand's largely loveless childhood and early career struggles the most fascinating parts of her story. Young Barbra carried a cot from one friend's apartment to another's because she had no place to sleep, happily accepted free dinners instead of pay and seemed amazed that people liked her voice (""I don't think I'm that good,"" she told a roommate in 1960). However, by page 79, at the age of 19, she's already difficult to get along with. The book ends on a frankly adoring note, but until then the story of the public's discovery of a genius and the genius's discovery of herself is actually thought-provoking.

But MAN RAY 1890-1976 (Ludion/ Abrams, $65) does just that, offering a trove of little-known photographs, as well as reproductions of a few paintings and works in other media. The book, which includes more than 300 pictures, covers Ray's earliest days in New York, his astonishing career in Paris in the 1920's and 30's, and his years in Hollywood, where he lived in the 40's. Bursting with photographs that are by turns sensuous, sardonic and surprising, ""Man Ray 1890-1976"" offers ample testimony to the artist's inventiveness and to the diversity of his output. His links to Surrealism are apparent in shadowy ""photograms,"" made without a lens, and in dreamy solarized nudes. But Ray also operated a commercial studio, and examples of his fashion photos are included, as are portraits of leading artists and intellectuals, among them Marcel Duchamp, Gertrude Stein and Jean Cocteau. The strength of this remarkable book is its thoroughness. But only the barest information is offered for any of the pictures; also missing are essays that might have clarified how these images fit into Ray's overall output. People familiar with his work are apt to discover fresh delights here; those who want to know more about his life and art may find the book enticing but frustrating.

This act of self-censorship by the country's most powerful and aggressive television news program sends a chilling message to journalists investigating industry practices everywhere. CBS's legal concerns over the interview were said to be based on fears that the subject of the interview, a former executive of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, had an agreement with the company not to disclose internal company matters. The CBS lawyers argued that the tobacco company, instead of claiming that it had been libeled by a false report, would simply declare that its former employee was committing a contract violation.

By the time these storms strike the jagged wall of the Wasatch, they are carrying vast quantities of weirdly light snow. But molecular bravado seems excessive in this case. For skiers, ultralight snow is the stuff of dreams, and the average annual snowfall in Little Cottonwood Canyon, just southeast of Salt Lake City, is some 500 inches -- more than 40 feet.

The park service could begin recovering costs from guide companies in 1996, and from individuals by 1997, said Ron Hooper, superintendent of the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Though the term ""high risk activities"" has yet to be fully defined, it will likely run the gamut from hiking to kayaking, he said, adding that those rescued in areas easily accessible by road will be exempt. The park service is exploring the option of allowing companies and individuals to buy insurance to cover the risks of their activities, a practice common in Europe, he said. Rescues of injured or lost tourists are a drain on the park service's resources, he said. In 1994, taxpayers paid about $581,395, based on 1.24 Canadian dollars to the United States dollar, for rescues in the Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta national parks, he said. Average cost of each rescue was $375, not including staff training, helicopter time and equipment.

us, It's a Jungle Out There,"Swamp fever, marauding leopards, armed guerrillas -- for Grace Berggren, the 7-year-old protagonist of Margaret Meyers's impressionistic and lovely first collection of stories, SWIMMING IN THE CONGO (Milkweed, paper, $13.95), life with her missionary parents along the banks of the Congo River means confronting many disquieting realities. But while Grace grows adept at sidestepping danger, she quickly begins to resent the narrow quality of her parents' religious convictions; to them, even ballet lessons are sinful and decadent. It is the late 1960's, but in their little world the atmosphere of an earlier era is emphatically preserved. Bored with ""ladies who have dining-room tables and short home-permed curls and eat Swedish meatballs,"" Grace becomes enchanted with the lush mysteriousness of the Congo, and with the hedonistic European expatriates who live nearby. (One Frenchwoman tells her that ""she was agnostique and a true believer only in chain-smoking."") Ms. Meyers, who spent much of her own youth in what is now Zaire, relates Grace's story with intelligence and restraint, while dipping knowingly into equatorial Africa's political and racial divides. Not a lot actually happens in ""Swimming in the Congo""; the book is essentially a series of small, interlocked vignettes. But Grace's ""strange hungering curiosity"" about life propels the narrative forward. When she can't find solace anywhere else, Grace walks down to the river -- and floats free.

Atop the Empire State Building, the wounded Kong takes a final, adoring look, to a poignant surge, and plunges. Way to go, man. -- Howard Thompson",1995-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,THE RICH: How They're Different;How They're Different . . . Than They Used to Be,"I've been loitering in the vicinity of rich people for nearly 15 years now, and in that time I have seen and heard a lot of strange things, but nothing as strange as what was related to me during a single brief encounter with the species in the summer of 1982. It was during a picnic in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. I was minding my own business, more or less, when a middle-aged woman appeared and introduced herself as a close relation of Pierre du Pont 5th, with whom I had just graduated from Princeton University. After she asked what I intended to do with my life, and I replied that I had no idea, she explained to me how much more difficult things were for young Pierre. In a surprisingly aggressive tone she ticked off his many achievements: Pierre had graduated with honors, she said; Pierre had ""23 job offers""; Pierre was already putting in 14-hour days at some computer company; the company was paying Pierre nearly $30,000 a year. The list was long but somehow failed to include the fact most central to Pierre's existence: the du Pont family fortune recently estimated by Forbes to be at least $10 billion, a large chunk of which he stands to inherit. Clearly, something was amiss. I had no trust fund (or job) and yet there I was having a picnic. Young Pierre was well on his way to inheriting millions, and yet there he was, a veritable human workhorse, enslaved to some dreary corporation for a pittance. The contrast was a clear confirmation of my own lassitude -- but also, I think, a small sign of the shift taking place in the imaginations of the rich: just as new money once sought to obscure itself with the trappings of ancienne noblesse, old money was now shifting its focus to achievement. The antimarket snobbery, the pursuit of useless hobbies, the preference for filigreed personalities over human ramrods, the taste for understatement -- all those qualities that had distinguished du Ponts for more than a century apparently had vanished. Old money was being buffeted not merely economically but culturally. It was uncomfortable in its own skin.",1995-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION;The Blue Note Chronicles,"Of the many independent jazz labels that flourished in the two decades after World War II, Blue Note was perhaps the most independent of all. Created in 1939 by Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff, Blue Note advanced by fits and starts into the mid-1950's, when it developed an utterly distinct style -- in sound engineering and album cover graphics as well as in music. Until it was sold in 1967, the label commanded the loyalty of a generation of jazz lovers. Lion was the producer, the one who signed artists and supervised recordings. Wolff apparently administered the business end, but he was also a photographer, and he chronicled the Blue Note sessions for 28 years, chiefly for the album jackets. Although a few Wolff portraits became instant classics, many were reduced to postage-stamp size by his art director, and the reputation of his work suffered. THE BLUE NOTE YEARS: The Jazz Photography of Francis Wolff (Rizzoli, $65), with text by the veteran record executives Michael Cuscuna and Charlie Lourie, is an opulent tribute to a photographer whose style was as individual as the music he illustrated. Roaming the studio during rehearsals, Wolff caught his subjects in meditation and in action, during performance and playback -- but always in a harsh light that freezes every hair with icy clarity. Occasionally he captured two or three musicians in one frame, but usually he went after solitary figures; in highlighting the angularity of their faces, he managed to flatter the convictions and talent of a surprisingly homogeneous group of black men. (The presence of only two women and fewer than a dozen white men is representative of Blue Note, and another aspect of its uniqueness.) The luminous assurance is pervasive in images as superficially varied as Miles Davis smiling, Art Blakey scowling, Joe Henderson smoking, Dexter Gordon laughing and Hank Mobley playing. Wolff unites them all in his light-out-of-dark vision, as though the act of recording for his record company were an act of reverence. GARY GIDDINS",1995-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Situated where the Middle East crosshatches with the Balkans, the Caucasus and the southern wastes of Russia, it has always had an outpost quality, its deceptively calm shores the whispery borderlands of colliding martial cultures. ""Like the terminal moraine of a glacier, the Black Sea shore is a place where the detritus of human migrations and invasions has been deposited for more than 4,000 years,"" Neal Ascherson, a British journalist, writes in his new book, ""Black Sea."" Both the Serbs and the Croats, as well as the Black Death, had their origins here. It was near the Black Sea that the archetypal culture clash occurred, between ""civilized"" European Greece and ""barbarian"" Asian Persia -- the classical era's analogue to the cold war. Czarist pogroms had a Black Sea backdrop. So did World War II chaos. The Nazis had three different policies for Crimea. While some German units raised Tatar militias to fight pro-Soviet guerrillas left behind by the retreating Red Army, others went farther, trying to restore the Crimean Tatars as a pro-German Kulturvolk. All this as SS units murdered tens of thousands of Tatars.",1995-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Its permutations are swift and know no truce, so numerous are those who must be made and unmade for one tribe to prosper while another languishes. Virgil is expounding on the punishment the highest wisdom metes out to misers and spendthrifts, but he might as well be speaking about the rise and fall of literary reputations. Within one generation, celebrity and commercial success are often seen to repose on small artistic merit. Thus the work of an Eugene Sue (who outsold Balzac, Dumas pere and Victor Hugo) turns into stuff to be cleaned out of an attic; at most, it survives as a historical curiosity. Or a change in taste, without diminishing the respectability of Thackeray or William Dean Howells, deprives them of readers. Conversely, just such a change may bring Trollope back into fashion and cause forgotten novels and new biographies to be published posthaste, as though news of Tolstoy's dictum -- that this was among the greatest of English novelists -- had just been received by the general public. Sometimes an entire genre (19th-century epic poetry) goes into eclipse while another is rediscovered (English metaphysical poetry) or a work later recognized as a masterpiece so offends the current critical canon that for a time it stops an author's career dead in its tracks.

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: FICTION;Life Sentence,"Like an addled senator on a drunken filibuster, the narrator of Bohumil Hrabal's DANCING LESSONS FOR THE ADVANCED IN AGE (Harcourt Brace, $14) bears no interruptions and finds no leap of logic too daunting to attempt. Fortunately, there is no need for an edgewise word. The old man is telling the tale of his life, and it is a life well lived and well told -- in a single rambling sentence that runs the length of this slim volume. To an audience of young lovelies, the narrator recalls his bawdy adventures as a soldier, brewery worker and cobbler (or, as he euphemistically puts it, an ""engineer of human feet""), but mostly talks of his undying devotion to appreciating the ""European Renaissance,"" which means, for the most part, chasing skirts. ""A real man trembles like a frog about to leap whenever he sees a beautiful woman,"" he says, ""which is why art drives so many writers mad."" As translated from the Czech by Michael Henry Heim, the anecdotes fall out like cards from a well-shuffled deck: a story about a dead Austrian officer leads to a recollection of a dream about a monkey, which leads to a remembrance of a fight between a clergyman and a drunken sexton, which leads to rumors of a Prince of Lichtenstein's sexual dysfunction. Is there a point to the old man's tale? Perhaps not, but then it is enough to be charmed by the thread of his verbosity. TOBIN HARSHAW",1995-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Still, compiling lists of the most grating sspots is irresistible, and one sure way to land onthem lately is through repetition. An ad that is merely inane at first viewing becomes unendurable the hundredth time around. Familiarity breeds exactly what it's supposed to.

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION;Colonial Views,"The pre-eminent portraitist of the colonial period, John Singleton Copley had two distinct careers as a painter -- first in his native Boston, then in England, where he fled in 1774, anticipating the Revolution. In JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY IN AMERICA (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Abrams, $75), the authors -- Carrie Rebora, an associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Paul Staiti, a professor of art history at Mount Holyoke College; Theodore E. Stebbins Jr., a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston; and Carol Troyen and Erica E. Hirshler, an associate and assistant curator there, respectively -- focus on Copley's early paintings because that work ""issued from a single, unified culture that was very different from the culture that framed his production in England."" In a cogent essay, Mr. Staiti argues that Copley ""became an indispensable producer during a consumer revolution, satisfying the demand for Anglicized cultural goods that helped the elite define who they were."" Or who they wanted to be -- for what Copley's customers often requested were idealized versions of themselves. Indeed, the props in the portraits -- the architecture, furnishings, fabrics -- were frequently items that could not have been owned by his subjects. Another example of Copley's fictionalizing is his 1765 portrait of John Hancock: a wealthy man, Hancock is depicted as poorer than he was, simpler -- a man of the people. After Boston came under siege in 1767, Copley's colors became subdued, his portraits grew increasingly sober, his commissions fell off and he eventually left the country. The anthropological approach the authors adopt toward Copley's art does not obscure his gifts as a painter, of which the lavish illustrations give ample evidence.
