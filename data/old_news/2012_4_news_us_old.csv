Such encores at the Metropolitan Opera have become such a rarity in recent decades that aficionados  and press offices  take special note.

At the end of the aria Una furtiva lagrima the audience responded with so much enthusiasm that Mr. Flrez repeated it. The encore was also heard by millions of listeners because the performance, the last show of the run, was broadcast on radio. Within hours the Met sent out a news release pointing out the encore and mentioning that Mr. Flrez was the last Met performer to offer one (in 2008) and that Luciano Pavarotti was the previous singer to do so (in 1994). The Met had banned encores in recent decades amid a more serious performance atmosphere. But the current general manager, Peter Gelb, has loosened the reins in what he has called an effort to make opera more exciting and entertaining.

I couldnt sleep, too nervous, he said. He went home with two third-place finishes in the 55-59 age group, running the 60 meters in 7.79 seconds and the 200 in 25.98. ",2012-04-02T04:03:19+0000

Though Phil, as she is widely known, has had three knee operations and recently sustained an ankle injury, she broke the world indoor record in the pentathlon in her new age group, 65-69, last month. The sprints and the hurdles are her best events. She has won more than 70 gold medals in masters world championships and is the best-known competitor in masters track. Raschker has twice been a finalist for the Sullivan Award, which honors Americas top amateur athlete, losing out in 2003 to Michael Phelps and in 2007 to Tim Tebow. These days, she trains only two or three times a week, as she is busy working as an accountant in Marietta, Ga., and traveling to Germany to care for her ailing mother.",2012-04-02T04:03:28+0000
us,"Bob Lida, 75","Lida was the Big Eight champion in the indoor 440-yard dash in 1959. Then a problem with his sciatic nerve forced him to quit track; he thought he was washed up at 22 and turned his attention to a career in advertising. At 40, he decided to start sprinting again. This time, it was a pulled hamstring that spoiled things, so he restricted himself to slower road races. But there is something special about the full-throttle locomotion of the sprints. And at 60, he returned to the dashes, and though his knees lock up every now and again, he is back to being the champion he was at Kansas. In January, he set two indoor world records in the 75-79 age bracket, running the 60 meters in 8.49 seconds and the 200 in 27.03. He credits recent advice from an observant track coach. It turns out all these years Ive been overstriding, Lida said.",2012-04-02T04:03:41+0000

Anderson (left) has come down to earth  at least a little  for his first prefall collection. Alongside straight-leg pants, pleated skirts and jewel-tone turtlenecks (including one in blue with bright green sleeves), Anderson still offers plenty of quilting: a white A-line skirt, a red-and-white checkerboard print jacket and two puffy bombers, one in black patent leather and another in brown with white sleeves and a shearling collar. I like the idea of storytelling, and for me this collection was the prequel to my fall collection, the designer says. Both collections are for the same woman and for me all the pieces work together, but I definitely aimed to design clothes that were easier and more relatable. That doesnt mean Anderson has lost touch with the avant-garde. For fall expect vinyl suiting, pillow-top apron skirts and a curious take on the deerstalker cap. ",2012-04-02T13:00:40+0000

Whats more, he does not want to get better. It just feels so wrong most of the time, the singer-songwriter and actor tells his friend Alan Licht, in a new book-length interview. Its just a waste of time, because it doesnt have anything to do with anything, and it demands a lot of time and a lot of thought, and the thought has nothing to do with anything. The book, Will Oldham on Bonnie Prince Billy, which will be published in Britain by Faber & Faber on Thursday and in the United States by Norton this fall, is one very long interview  an interview to end all interviews, the hope seems to be. And it just might work, for within the books 382 pages Oldham answers nearly every question one might wish to ask about his prolific output, which he has recorded and performed variously as Will Oldham, Palace Brothers, Palace Music, Palace Songs, Palace, Bonnie (Prince) Billy, Bonnie Billy, and Bonnie (Prince) Billy and the Cairo Gang. Longtime fans will appreciate the books generous portion of inside baseball. He wrote the song I Am a Cinematographer, for instance, after reading Robert Bressons Notes on the Cinematographer, and initially agreed to play piano on Johnny Cashs cover of his song I See a Darkness despite not knowing how to play piano. (He later fessed up and instead conducted Cash and sang back-up vocals, in a recording session he recalls as surreal: I remember it was as if I was a Colorform or paper doll that had just been pasted into that situation.) Readers may also be amused to learn that he once passed up a possible part on Doogie Howser, M.D.; took classes in the waltz, the cha-cha-cha and scuba diving; and admires the comic timing of Foghorn Leghorn and Bugs Bunny, whom he cites as an influence. Though Oldham declined to be interviewed about the interview, The Moment was delighted to mine an advance copy for some of its choicest quotations.",2012-04-03T16:30:26+0000

Discussing the individual mandate, I wrote: The provision is unpopular enough that its unlikely to survive in the long run even if Anthony Kennedy flips a coin and decides to uphold it. In reality, it depends on what you mean by survive. If Mitt Romney wins the presidency, the mandate will probably be repealed outright. If Barack Obama is re-elected, on the other hand, I would expect it to endure at least for a time, but as a poorly enforced, widely flouted, easily exploited, and generally derided aspect of American law. As it stands, the mandatealready depends on a norm of law-abidingnessto make its provisions work, because the penalty is small enough that people could actually save money over the long haul by paying the fine until they get sick and then taking advantage of guaranteed issue to buy insurance. Over time, I doubt that norm will hold (what worked in Massachusetts, a liberal state with a small uninsured population, is not necessarily going to work in a nation of 300 millions), and I doubt the penalty will ever be raised. So even if the mandate technically survives, the combination of non-enforcement, non-compliance and inflation will gradually make it all-but-meaningless as policy.",2012-04-04T15:37:18+0000

Her account highlights several prophetic works and visionaries, from Ezekiel to Paul to the ancient sect of prophesying Christians called the Montanists, and others. Pagels also discusses the afterlife of Revelation in the Christianity of late antiquity through the fourth century. Her thesis is that apocalyptic literature  visions, prophecies, predictions of cataclysm  has always carried political ramifications, both revolutionary and reactionary, liberal and conservative, from the very beginning up until today, as seen in conservative iterations of millennial dispensationalism and the hugely popular Left Behind series of novels about the end of the world.

The new report could give judges grounds to sentence Mr. Breivik, 33, to prison instead of a psychiatric hospital.

And yet Caro has spent virtually his whole adult life studying power and what can be done with it, first in the case of Robert Moses, the great developer and urban planner, and then in the case of Lyndon Johnson, whose biography he has been writing for close to 40 years. Caro can tell you exactly how Moses heedlessly rammed the Cross Bronx Expressway through a middle-class neighborhood, displacing thousands of families, and exactly how Johnson stole the Texas Senate election of 1948, winning by 87 spurious votes.

Her frozen body stays there for nine months while Bernie spends a big chunk of her fortune, millions of dollars, on assorted good deeds and indulgences, buying the people of Carthage pretty much whatever they want  cars, Jet Skis, airplanes  and pledging a new wing for the Methodist church with hardly anyone bothering to ask where he got so much money.",2012-04-12T22:38:11+0000

However, both the shrinking thickness and lack of any evidence that anyone has been caught with a dangerous laptop render all this security theater moot. The absurd hysteria that has paralyzed the United States with fear since 9/11 is the source of this multibillion dollar waste of time, money and good sense.

The minister of information, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, echoing statements by President Salva Kiir, said South Sudan cannot talk about withdrawal unless contested regions were demilitarized and international observers were put in place. Until then, Mr. Marial said, South Sudan would remain in Heglig, an oil-rich city that both Sudan and South Sudan claim and Sudan has controlled since 2005. But South Sudan has accused Sudan of using contested border regions as a springboard for attacks on its territory. Since their split last year, the two sides have been caught in a dispute over a host of issues, including citizenship, the demarcation of the border and how to share the Souths oil. On Thursday, the United Nations Security Council demanded a complete, immediate and unconditional end to all fighting between Sudan and South Sudan. ",2012-04-13T04:09:32+0000

My body-mass index placed me on the extreme low end of overweight. What followed were two years of bone scans, forced physical activity, a strict diet and endless scrutiny of my bodys changes. No attempts were ever made to make me feel that puberty was normal, because my parents were very clear that my puberty was abnormal.

As far as I can tell Trigiani has never done time, unless you count writing for TV (she worked on The Cosby Show and other sitcoms), but she did set her first three novels in the Blue Ridge Mountain town of Big Stone Gap, Va., where she grew up. Since then she has frequently turned to her Italian-American heritage for material; her 12th novel, The Shoemakers Wife, which slides onto the hardcover fiction list at No. 5, is based on the lives of her immigrant grandparents. A couple of years ago, in a conversation with the novelist Lauren Baratz-Logsted, Trigiani said she is sometimes mistaken for the actress Nia Vardalos, who wrote and starred in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Once on a plane, she said, a lady asked for my autograph. I said, Im not her.

us,TED Teams With NPR,"TED, the nonprofit group that sponsors conferences on ideas, is coming to NPR. A 10-episode series titled TED Radio Hour will begin on April 27 on NPR stations and at ted.npr.org, the two organizations plan to announce on Monday. The show, hosted by Alison Stewart, the former anchor of the PBS series Need to Know, draws from an archive of more than 1,200 TED talks, each lasting 18 minutes or so, which become the kernels for a broader conversation, Eric Nuzum, NPRs vice president for programming, said by telephone. Each episode is organized around a theme: one pairs competing talks on the cause of happiness; others look at the power of crowds and food sustainability. Chris Anderson, who runs the TED conferences, said in a phone interview that the challenge was to take material that was in some cases three or four years old and make it seem fresh and relevant by letting Ms. Stewart explore points in more depth and bring in other voices. Local stations will broadcast the program at varied times; WNYC in New York is scheduling it for the summer. NPR will wait to approve a second season, but Mr. Anderson is optimistic: I dont think the worlds going to run out of ideas any time soon, she said. I would say that curiosity is a self-fueling fire. TED is also exploring television. There are lots of conversations and discussions afoot, Mr. Anderson said, declining to provide specifics.",2012-04-15T22:06:13+0000

Mr. Salehi, above, also hinted that Iran might be willing to change its uranium enrichment policy, which is at the heart of foreign suspicions that the Iranians are secretly developing the capacity to make nuclear weapons. The first talks in 15 months on the dispute adjourned Saturday with both sides calling them constructive. Mr. Salehi told the Iranian Student News Agency that the talks were a turning point in the Iran-West dialogue. Still, neither the United States nor the European Union has indicated any intention to ease the sanctions, which their proponents call necessary to press Iran to negotiate in good faith. On Monday, United Against Nuclear Iran, a pro-sanctions group based in New York, said that Porsche AG, the German auto company, would end its business in Iran, making it the second carmaker to do so this month.

But the newest findings make it clear that this isnt just a relationship; it is the relationship. Using sophisticated technologies to examine the workings of individual neurons  and the makeup of brain matter itself  scientists in just the past few months have discovered that exercise appears to build a brain that resists physical shrinkage and enhance cognitive flexibility.

But a London publisher has nonetheless found a way to get their names onto the same project, in the form of a collaboration between descendants of Tolkien and Dickens, BBC News reported. The publisher Thames River Press said it would release two fantasy novels written by Michael Tolkien, aimed at younger readers and based on stories told to him by his grandfather, the Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien. Gerald Dickens, a great-great grandson of Dickens, will narrate the audiobook releases. BBC News said the first book, called Wish, was inspired by the Florence Bone story The Rose-Colored Wish and chronicles two children who come into possession of an evil sorcerers enchanted artifact; the second book, Rainbow, takes its inspiration from another work by Ms. Bone called The Other Side of the Rainbow.

Produced, directed and edited by the married couple Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker (Gunner Palace), Fightville gestures toward some promising subjects  men and masculinity, bread and circuses  about which it has surprisingly little to say, despite its washes of spilled blood; its ringside seat at that great, eternal fight known as hope versus desperation; and its occasional quotations from the likes of Nietzsche and Whitman. The increased popularity of M.M.A. is reflected in the uptick of attention paid to it and its practitioners in popular culture, including in movies like Steven Soderberghs thriller Haywire (which stars the female fight sensation Gina Carano) and Gavin OConnors under-seen mens melodrama Warrior (about two battling brothers, played by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, and their punishing problems). In January, MTV started its run of the reality television show Caged, about a clutch of young fighters from the Louisiana city of Minden.

The United Arab Emirates denounced the visit, calling it provocative. The Mehr News Agency quoted General Pourdastan, above, as saying that Iran has had sovereignty over these islands since old times and the Islamic republic will defend this right with full force.

By contrast, there were 37,000 measles cases last year in Europe, where resistance to vaccination is more common. ",2012-04-20T03:13:54+0000

So if one novelist reviews another, theyll often overlap in terms of tone or themes or prose style. But sometimes a counterintuitive pairing works just as well. In 1988, Anne Tyler reviewed Libra, Don DeLillos novel about the Kennedy assassination, in these pages. Tyler and DeLillo were already literary heavyweights, but you wouldnt have looked for them on the same fight card  DeLillo had a reputation as a chilly analyst of paranoia and pervasive social forces, while Tyler was known for her intimate dissections of grief and domestic estrangement. (That hasnt changed: The Beginners Goodbye, her novel about a man haunted by his dead wife, is at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list.) Still, she loved Libra, and came away persuaded that the C.I.A. could have been involved in the assassination. DeLillo must have had the same source materials available to anyone else, she wrote. But he takes the stale facts and weaves them into something altogether new. . . . That finally were interested less in the physical events of the assassination than in the pitiable and stumbling spirit underlying them proves Libra to be a triumph.

It is the idea that a language like English is a semi-stable abstract object that we learn to some degree or other and then use in order to communicate or express ideas and perform certain tasks. I call this the static picture of language, because, even though it acknowledges some language change, the pace of change is thought to be slow, and what change there is, is thought to be the hard fought product of conflict. Thus, even the revisionist picture of language sketched by Gary Gutting in a recent Stone column counts as static on my view, because the change is slow and it must overcome resistance.",2012-04-22T21:00:11+0000

us,Filmmaker Wins Case Against I.R.S.,"Documentary filmmakers can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that the producer and director Lee Storey won her case last week against the commissioner of Internal Revenue in United States Tax Court. The I.R.S. tried to disallow Ms. Storeys deduction of expenses incurred while making and marketing the film Smile Til It Hurts: The Up With People Story. The movie played the festival circuit after it was finished in 2008, but it has yet to become a moneymaker. So the tax collectors contended that Ms. Storey, who is a practicing lawyer when she is not making documentary films, was engaged in a hobby  not a business  because she enjoyed filmmaking and wasnt turning a profit despite considerable efforts to do so. That contention sent shivers through the ranks of documentary filmmakers, many of whom are in the same boat much of the time. Among the organizations that joined in a brief in support of Ms. Storeys position  that businesslike behavior and an honest effort to turn a profit, among other things, entitled her to the deductions  were the International Documentary Association, Film Independent, the National Association of Latino Independent Producers, Women Make Movies, the National Alliance for Media Art and Culture, and the University Film and Video Association. In a ruling dated April 19 the tax court saw it Ms. Storeys way. The court said that she was engaged in a real business, that her deductions were legitimate, and that she did not owe about $250,000, plus penalties, that was being claimed by the I.R.S. for 2006, 2007 and 2008.",2012-04-22T22:11:46+0000

The end of apartheid may have put an end to state-sanctioned violence, but it signaled the beginning of an epidemic of a more personal kind of violence  a reactive, frustrated, untargeted revenge.",2012-04-27T14:45:38+0000
us,Mythic Passions,"To the long catalog of odd hybrids that inhabit Greek myth  the half-human, half-equine centaurs, the birdlike Harpies with their human faces, the man-eating Scylla with her doglike nether parts  we may now add Madeline Millers first novel, The Song of Achilles. In it, Miller has taken on an (appropriately) heroic task: to fashion a modern work of literature out of very ancient stories  specifically, the tale of the Greeks at Troy, one of the oldest and most seminal of all legends in the Western tradition. The idea of recasting the Greek classics began with the ancients themselves; Virgils Aeneid is, in many ways, both a rewriting of and a commentary on the Homeric epics. More recently, it has challenged ambitious writers like Mary Renault, whose 1958 novel The King Must Die brilliantly reimagined the Theseus legend as narrated by the hero himself, and David Malouf, whose terrific 2009 novel Ransom invents a moving episode toward the end of the Iliad. But in the case of Miller, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in classics at Brown, the epic reach exceeds her technical grasp. The result is a book that has the head of a young adult novel, the body of the Iliad and the hindquarters of Barbara Cartland.",2012-04-27T14:46:02+0000

They set out to identify why AIDS emerged when it did; why Africans were so disproportionally affected; and why some countries have succeeded in reducing infection rates while others have not.

You should never ask a prisoner what he did to get put in jail, never ask a widow whether she gets lonely in bed, and never ask a freed slave what happened to her family.

On the contrary, mental conditioning has a noble lineage in the history of religion, and even (or especially) in this modern age, it can help humans flourish.

But now he decides it is dishonest to invent descriptions, dialogue, thoughts and feelings on a subject as serious as this. The best he can do, he concludes, is to provide a running commentary on the truth (or otherwise) of what he is writing.

As famous singers go, King has always seemed exceedingly nice  more Janis Ian than Janis Joplin  and her books humble granola-and-chardonnay prose is about as earnest as youd expect from the songwriter behind Youve Got a Friend. But Kings best melodies often have a dark edge, and its detectable in her autobiography too, especially in stories about her four failed marriages. One husband lost his mind to hallucinogens, and another beat her repeatedly before dying of a cocaine overdose. In hindsight, King writes, I probably should have asked Rick these two questions: Why are you living in a van? and Are you by any chance psychotic?  The music gossips not bad, either. In 1976 King and a boyfriend were watching Taxi Driver on the Upper East Side when King ran into Yoko Ono in the movie theater restroom. Ono invited the pair to spend the rest of the evening at the palatial apartment she shared with John Lennon  who had spurned King at their only previous meeting, 11 years earlier. Now she finally had a chance to ask him why. Its because I was intimidated, he said. No hard feelings, right?

The story was originally published in serialized form in 1999. Those days were hard times for Gotham City and the caped crusader: after an outbreak of disease, the city was leveled by an earthquake. The government had enough and gave the order to evacuate the city. Batman, his allies, his enemies and many residents stayed. The story, which wove through several monthly titles and was handled by several writers and artists, was compelling. The city became divided by rival factions and familiar faces were cast into different roles. (The Penguin, for example, became a supplier of goods on the black market, while the Huntress, who felt ostracized by Batman, took on a new guise.) Most superhero stories require a good helping of suspension of disbelief, and this one is no different. When No Mans Land began, fans wondered why Batmans heroic allies did not help him or the city. Theres an adventure that addresses that (in a Justice League story, they are shown protecting Gothams perimeter, but are asked by Batman to otherwise keep out), which I hope will be featured in a future volume.",2012-04-27T19:49:17+0000

Back then you could write him a worshipful letter, care of the Garden, and get back a signed black-and-white photo. Once before a home game, my friend Paul and I saw him on the street after he got out of his Rolls. We asked him for his autograph  two adoring 12-year-olds offering up a couple of pieces of lined paper  and he told us he was only signing copies of a book about him that recently had been published, and then he turned away. I still loved him. But it was hard not to harbor a grudge. And then came all those years of his jangling play-by-play commentary. But I couldnt help but feel a new sense of tenderness when he explained himself in Talk of the Town: When I was a player, I rarely read anything, unless it was about me.

The independent music scene in Brooklyn is the world capital of that culture, Bryce says. And it has a massive visual arts scene. So when the Brooklyn Academy of Music approached the brothers about putting together a program of musicians and filmmakers who live in the borough, they jumped at the chance. Many of the names on the bill, like St Vincent and the Walkmen, are friends of the Dessners; others, like the Sierre Leone-born Janka Nabay, were chosen to represent Brooklyns musical diversity. But despite being organized by a pair of musicians, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry was initially conceived of as a film festival.
