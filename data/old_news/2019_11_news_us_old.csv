Emily Dickinson is imbued with teenage angst and a vocabulary that includes words like dude and sick in this series debuting Friday as one of the first shows on Apples new streaming service. Dickinson, which stars Hailee Steinfeld as a version of the 19th-century poet, reimagines Dickinson as a patriarchy-fighting millennial who throws ragers, relentlessly pursues her creative impulses and hangs out with a personification of death played by the rapper Wiz Khalifa. She also rebels against her overbearing father and has a romance with her future sister-in-law. In a recent interview with The New York Times, the shows creator, Alena Smith, described Dickinson as a coming-of-age story about a radical young female artist who was ahead of her time. The tone calls to mind teen dramas like Riverdale. Part of the idea, Smith said, is to consider Dickinson through a modern lens. If she wasnt that well understood in her time, Smith asked, can we understand her better in ours?",2019-11-01T05:00:07+0000

Youve stood on top of all of them. And their spirit  and their souls  are in that floor. Shes talking about the Apollo Theater in Harlem, the venerated launching pad of several generations of musicians, comics and other performers. Directed by Roger Ross Williams, The Apollo digs into the theaters rich, 85-year history through a trove of archival performance footage (Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and James Brown are among those featured) and recent interviews, which it intersperses with scenes of the preparation and performance of a stage version of Ta-Nehisi Coatess Between the World and Me that debuted last year.

Falstaff, the usually rotund companion to Prince Hal (the future King Henry V), is played here by a relatively lean Joel Edgerton, opposite Timothe Chalamet as a stylish Hal-Henry. The film focuses on Hals evolution from sot to sovereign, ditching Shakespeares language in favor of a modern English script by Edgerton and David Michd, who also directs. The story builds up to a climactic Battle of Agincourt, with help from a supporting cast that includes Ben Mendelsohn, who plays an ailing King Henry IV, and Robert Pattinson. Michd has a gift for screen violence and is generally good with actors, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, yet time and again your attention drifts from Hal-Henry to the storys edges, where the supporting actors nibble at their tasty bits.

To study the effectiveness of international rules against anonymous, untraceable shell companies, Sharman and two other researchers impersonated 21 different fictitious consultants and sent 7,400 emails to 3,700 so-called corporate service providers (often law or accounting firms) in 182 countries, asking for help setting one up. Nearly half the respondents failed to comply with regulations requiring the collection of identity documents. The conclusion: It is more than three times as hard to put an untraceable shell company in an offshore tax haven than in a developed country. For anonymity, set up your company in Nevada, Delaware or Wyoming; it can be done in 10 to 40 minutes, and for as little as $200.",2019-11-07T10:00:03+0000

His growing fame brings admirers to his freezing workshop, where they wonder at his ascetic indifference to discomfort, and still more  gifted as he surely is  at his capacity for self-criticism. Not that his manhood can be in any doubt: He flaunts his ravishing young mistress before his careworn, miserable wife, who nonetheless remains his devoted slave in the fervent belief that she is the one who truly understands him. In one scene, in a fit of furious dissatisfaction, he hurls a sheaf of sketches into a flaming brazier before a group of astonished onlookers. The camera shows the horror on their faces as they watch the artworks burn, a horror it is assumed we share. It isnt just the sight of Giacomettis sketches going up in smoke that appalls us; its the fact that, to our retrospective eyes, he might as well be burning thousand-dollar bills.",2019-11-07T10:00:04+0000

us,David Byrne and David Binder on Breaking Into the Mainstream,"One measure of artistic success is the ability to move the mainstream  to bring once-unimaginable ideas to the widest possible audience. By that metric, few people have been as successful as the musician David Byrne and the producer David Binder. Byrne, of course, headlined the 80s rock band Talking Heads, which dissolved the barriers between disco and rock, conceptual art and dance pop. Even before going solo in 1989, Byrnes side projects tentacled into disparate worlds: He collaborated with similarly polymathic artists such as Brian Eno, Robert Wilson and Twyla Tharp; he starred in the writer-director Jonathan Demmes 1984 documentary Stop Making Sense; and two years later, he directed the Robert Altman-on-acid jukebox art film True Stories. In the 90s and beyond, Byrne used his fame to advance and collaborate with a wide range of artists  the world-music acts on his label, Luaka Bop; the D.J. Fatboy Slim on Here Lies Love, their 2013 musical about Imelda Marcos; the singer St. Vincent on their joint 2012 album Love This Giant. His latest act of radical pop is American Utopia, an album and touring rock show (which debuted in 2018) that wears its theme lightly but seriously reimagines space: Mobile musicians hop across a bare stage, dancing to their own music. The work opened on Broadway last month and runs through Feb. 16.",2019-11-11T11:55:12+0000

As the 25-year-old pilot of a B-24 Liberator, my grandfather flew in some of the most decisive engagements of the war, including the Battle of Anzio and the second Ploesti oil-field raids. Upon completing his tour, he was transferred to the Eighth Air Force just in time to fly bombing runs on D-Day. According to his discharge papers, he earned a Distinguished Flying Cross and two Air Medals before being sent to Texas in August 1944. He spent the remainder of the war training new bomber pilots near El Paso, a job he liked to joke was scarier than combat and in reality was hardly less dangerous. Driving through the area with my uncle several years later, he pointed to a mountain looming over the edge of town. See all those craters? he said.

Formed around a central caldera and characterized by lunar-like rock formations, it has the highest concentration of beaches in the entire island group  and yet, its delightfully untrodden compared to its more famous neighbors, Santorini and Mykonos. It was once a critical location for the mineral trade  during the Neolithic period, the ancient Minoans exported Miloss obsidian to the neighboring Aegean island of Crete, whose residents used the volcanic glass to make weapons  but the island is best known because of an event from more recent history. It was while digging near the Roman amphitheater in Klima, in 1820, that the amateur archaeologist Olivier Voutier discovered the marble statue known as the Venus de Milo. The celebrated work now lives at the Louvre in Paris, but Miloss mystique remains intact. Thanks to its serene fishing villages, secluded caves, innumerable swimming beaches (many accessible only by boat) and an abundance of locally run restaurants offering fresh catch and regional Greek wines, this tranquil island is quickly gaining appeal for travelers who want Aegean charm without the crowds.",2019-11-14T18:19:25+0000

The abrupt drop in temperatures across the Eastern United States this week may make this animated Santa origin story uncomfortably relatable, as it is set on an island above the Arctic Circle. The movie centers on Jesper, a mailman voiced by Jason Schwartzman who partners with a hermitlike toymaker named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) to deliver trinkets to children on the island. It is the first feature directed by Sergio Pablos, an animator and screenwriter whose decades-long history working with Disney informs this movies look. It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable but I can explain bit, are entirely digestible, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. These clichs inhibit Klaus from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that its worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library (not that, as a Netflix offering, it will take up any physical space).",2019-11-15T06:00:06+0000

Its a vulnerability that would seem to diminish our odds of survival, so evolutionarily speaking it must also somehow confer tremendous benefits. Yet our best guesses about what those benefits are tend to come from observing what happens when sleep is curtailed. As far as we know, all animals sleep in some way; deprive most of them of it for long enough, and they will die, but exactly why is unclear. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society published a joint statement, based on a comprehensive review of research, saying that sleeping less than seven hours per night on a regular basis  which is the case for an estimated 35 to 40 percent of Americans during the workweek  is associated with adverse health outcomes. These include weight gain and obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and stroke, depression, impaired immune function, increased pain, greater likelihood of accidents and increased risk of death. The National Institutes of Health reported last year that sleep deficits may increase the beta-amyloid proteins in the brain linked with Alzheimers disease. But when it comes to what sleep is, how much you need and what its for, says Louis Ptacek, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, we know almost nothing  other than its bad not to get enough of it. Indeed, says David Dinges, one of the statements authors and a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, All of this makes it really tough to send out simple messages to the public about when you should sleep and how much you should sleep.",2019-11-19T10:00:03+0000

Assembled in the verdant courtyard of the artist Cassandra MacLeods studio were the friends of the chef Mina Stone, who last week opened her Mediterranean-inspired restaurant Minas at MoMA PS1 with her husband, Alex Eagleton. Open bottles of natural Greek wines from the specialty Greek importer Eklektikon sat in an ice bath on a circular wooden table, alongside sliced cheese, apples and dried figs. Stone had been hard at work at MacLeods studio all week, cooking and photographing dishes for her second cookbook. Her first, Cooking for Artists (2015), was about her experience working with the art dealer Gavin Brown, at whose gallery and home she cooked large dinners after openings, as well as working with the artist Urs Fischer, for whom she prepared studio lunches.

us,The Market Line Opens in the Essex Crossing Complex,"The options for something to eat in the Essex Crossing complex are about to grow considerably with the opening of the Market Line, a culinary collection beneath the recently opened Essex Market. Three broad staircases (and two elevators) lead to a grid of wide aisles lined with food stands and larger restaurant areas, punctuated with clusters of tables and benches. Most diners and shoppers will regard the two markets as a single multistory feast, but what distinguishes the Market Line from its upstairs neighbor is the greater availability of alcohol. Theres the Grand Delancey, a 200-seat beer garden; and Peoples Wine Shop and Bar, from Jeremiah Stone and Fabin von Hauske Valtierra of Contra restaurant, with Daryl Nunn as manager. A cocktail bar will open soon. The beer garden has no food of its own, but you can order something to eat from some of the other stalls, and waiters will bring it to you. Some Schaller & Weber bratwurst with that I.P.A., perhaps? Theres a multicultural mix, offering handmade tortillas from Tortilleria Nixtamal, Veselkas Ukrainian food and Puerto Rican fare from Que Chevere, among others. There will be mushroom-based drinks from Four Sigmatic, Southeast Asian desserts from Moon Man, and Ends Meat butcher and salumeria from Industry City. At Essex Pearl, you can buy a fish, have it grilled and eat it on the spot. Theres also a branch of the nearby Tenement Museum, and the museums food tours will now terminate in the Market Line.

Theres just a lot of things to be interested in. Jackson traces that attitude back to her childhood in 1940s and 50s pre-statehood Alaska, where a certain pioneering spirit prevailed. We just did things, she remembers. She went to college at San Francisco State University at 17, studying art, drama and dance; toured South America as a ballerina; and in 1967, moved to Los Angeles, where she tooled around town in a Buick Hearse, took drawing classes from Charles White, began showing her paintings at the influential Ankrum gallery and, in 1968, opened Gallery 32, the community-minded space she ran out of her studio near MacArthur Park for two years. There, she hosted exhibitions by emerging black artists like David Hammons and Betye Saar, as well as a fund-raiser for the Black Panthers. As a single mother in her 40s with her son in tow, she earned a graduate degree in theater design at Yale, worked on productions with the Kennedy Center and the Berkeley Repertory Theater and eventually settled in Georgia in the mid-90s to teach at the Savannah College of Art and Design.

Amid the giddiness of the post-World War I period, when women began to assert themselves more at social events and Prohibition made booze alluringly naughty, dimly lit get-togethers became fashionable. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the era also saw the birth of cocktail jewelry: massive gems, both precious and semiprecious, in rings and pendants, made to be brazenly visible even in low light. By the 1940s, Tiffany & Co. was known for such oversize pieces, especially with aquamarine surrounded by diamonds. The ice-blue mineral, which, like emerald, is part of the beryl family, gets its color from traces of iron; it is among the hardest stones, resulting in larger, flawlessly clear crystal formations. This new pendant, with a 43-carat cushion-cut aquamarine dangling from a 21-inch rope of diamond rondels, is impossible to miss  glinting audaciously even in starlight or the first blush of dawn. 2019 Tiffany Blue Book Collection, price on request, (800) 518-5555.",2019-11-25T16:00:07+0000
