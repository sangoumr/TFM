On the ground floor, there are booths and tables, a semi-open kitchen and a bright prep counter. Upstairs is a marble oyster bar and more booths and tables. The menu is lengthy and divided into raw bar items, crudos, appetizers, seafood main dishes and vegetables, with a few pastas and meat dishes, like a burger and beef carpaccio. I wanted to keep it simple and use as much local seafood as I could, Mr. Vongerichten said. Locally harvested oysters, clams, fluke, mackerel, monkfish, sea scallops, lobsters and black sea bass share the menu with more far-flung catches, like Santa Barbara sea urchin, sardines, Dover sole, Icelandic cod and geoduck. Inventive sauces and garnishes, like rhubarb for sea scallops, are used throughout. The name refers to the wholesale fish market, now relocated to Hunts Point in the Bronx, where Mr. Vongerichten shopped as a young chef in the 1980s.

Some 40,000 Americans are newly infected with H.I.V. every year. Reducing that transmission rate is the key to eradicating the virus in the United States, as President Trump has vowed to do by 2030.

Mix in two-thirds cup water, then fold in 10 ounces of fresh or frozen corn kernels (almost two cups), two scallions, minced, and a finely chopped Fresno or jalapeo chile. In a saut pan or cast-iron skillet, heat an inch of vegetable oil, such as grapeseed, to 375 degrees. For 16 medium-size fritters, drop batter by heaping tablespoons into hot oil, flatten slightly and fry, turning once, until well browned. Drain on paper towels before serving.

Global conflicts are not new, but in a shrunken world, we hear of them much more quickly and in much more detail than we would have a generation ago. This means that even the casual traveler also faces an ethical dilemma when she chooses where to visit. What about a countrys treatment of minorities? What about its freedom of speech or the transparency of its government? And if we do go to a country ruled by a despot or military junta, will our currency benefit the nations citizens or only the regime that oppresses them?

This became clear to Franz when his teachers in Berlin cast stealthily malicious glances at him when Jewish characters  such as Shylock in The Merchant of Venice  came up in literature. Eh, Michalski, this exactly pertains to you, he recalls one teacher telling him through a clenched smile. Many years later, when he worked as an animal-feed trader in Hamburg, he didnt tell friends that he was Jewish and held his tongue when he heard them make anti-Semitic comments.

With Game of Thrones having heaved its last breath of dragon fire on  Sunday, many have been left looking for a new series to fill the sword-shaped void. One holier option is this medieval mystery mini-series, the adaptation of Umberto Ecos best-known novel, The Name of the Rose, by the  Italian director Giacomo Battiato. The book, which came out in 1980,  sold millions of copies, and was the basis for a 1986 film adaptation with Sean Connery. The role Connery played, a Franciscan friar named William of Baskerville, is here played by John Turturro. The plot involves  mysterious deaths at a remote abbey. When the Connery movie came out, Vincent Canby said in his review for The New York Times that it had cut out the novels scholarly asides, which cover everything from the political maneuvering within the Avignon papacy, the fight for the Holy Roman Empire and the churchs merciless suppression of heresies (Waldensian, Albigensian and Catharist, among others) to the invention of eyeglasses and gunpowder.

Gohar was born and raised in Cairo  where winters are mild, and summers come hot and quick  and makes a living creating interactive installations at fashion and art events (imagine, for example, cracking open a salt-baked pear with a wooden mallet at the recent Object & Thing design fair). Though she and her husband, Omar Sosa, one of the Barcelona-born co-founders of Apartamento magazine, have made a home for themselves in a cozy third-floor apartment on Spring Street in Manhattan, Gohar admits she still feels very much like a foreigner in the United States. Which is why, on a recent evening, she assembled some of her closest friends  including the fashion designer Maryam Nassir Zadeh, the actor and director Hailey Gates and the creative director Rafael Prieto  for dinner to celebrate an Egyptian holiday called Sham el-Nessim. The tradition, which means smelling the breeze in Arabic, is believed to be as old as the pharaohs, and celebrates the arrival of spring. Egyptians gather outdoors in public gardens, in zoos, in public spaces, on boats on the Nile and elsewhere, and feast on salted fermented fish, lettuce, beans and boiled eggs  all foods believed to be what was originally offered to the gods in ancient times. In Cairo, its a really fun day, explained Gohar.

Forty years (and nine sequels and remakes) later, John Carpenters classic slasher film got yet another update, one that reprised Jamie Lee Curtiss role as the baby sitter who survived a killing spree on Halloween night. Ignoring the narratives of the franchises other films, this reboot by David Gordon Green has our masked villain, Michael Myers (played by James Jude Courtney and the originating actor, Nick Castle), escape from a prison transfer and head straight back to Haddonfield. Hes out for Laurie, of course, who has become a paranoid, rabid grandmother with a fortress for a house.

David Milchs award-winning western series, which The New York Times recently named one of the 20 best TV dramas since The Sopranos, returns to HBO over a decade after the network unexpectedly holstered it. Deadwood: The Movie brings back most of the cast of the series, which includes Ian McShane as the hard-drinking saloon owner Al Swearengen and Timothy Olyphant as the darkly contemplative Sheriff Seth Bullock, but moves the action a decade later, with the town of Deadwood inching toward modernity. The result is not just a nostalgic exercise but a fair shorthand of what might have transpired in a fourth season, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The Times. It cant, in its abbreviated run, recreate the seriess full glory, but it does offer that glory a wistful toast. Thats more than most would have expected before plans for the movie were announced. Many fans of the canceled-too-early series until recently undoubtedly shared the view that Olyphant recently expressed to The Times: I didnt think it was ever going to happen.",2019-05-31T05:00:07+0000
