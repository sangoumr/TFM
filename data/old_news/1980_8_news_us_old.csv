us,'THE HUNTER' TRACKING FUGITIVES,"''THE HUNTER,'' which opens today at Loews State I and other theaters, is an exceptionally clumsy, unpleasant action-melodrama based on the real-life adventures of Ralph (Papa) Thorson of Los Angeles, a modern-day bounty hunter. Mr. Thorson makes his living by finding fugitives who have jumped bail. With the exception of the long-gone television series ''Wanted -Dead of Alive,'' which starred Steve McQueen, who also stars here as Mr. Thorson, bounty hunting is an occupation that's seldom been highly regarded in the mythical Old West of movies and television. Deep-down, I assume, we all think of bounty hunting as another form of flesh peddling. ",1980-08-01T05:00:00+0000

us,'BODYGAURD UNDERDOG'S COURAGE,"''MY BODYGUARD'' is a sweet little movie about characters who really seem to be people, and that sort of verisimilitude is rarer than it ought to be nowadays. Though it's no match for a movie like ''Breaking Away,'' it has a similar wry folksiness. And the fact that ''My Bodyguard'' is also set in the Middle West may explain some of its offbeat appeal. When movie teen-agers cannot be counted on to get into New York street fights or Los Angeles rollerskating contests, it becomes imperative that a director and screenwriter find them something else to do.

On the other hand, this is still a very muted movie, so ads that created an impression of general frenzy wouldn't do the trick, either.

A harmless planet, whose inhabitants appear to have wandered out of a biblical epic, is threatened by a terrifying invader. The planet sends out a volunteer to find mercenaries. He does, and they all return to fight the invader. The invaders die, and so do five of the seven mercenaries. That's the Kurosawa part. ",1980-08-09T05:00:00+0000

Phil (Ray Sharkey), who is young, Italian and ambitious, is a commercial photographer who wants to be a big success. One night, Willie and Phil meet coming out of the Bleecker Street Cinema after having seen ''Jules and Jim.'' Phil, the extrovert, wants Willie, the introvert, to ask him about his recently ended love affair. Willie does, and Phil answers, at length, thus to begin a lifelong friendship. As the film's narrator tells us, Willie and Phil share a sense of humor, a hatred for the Vietnam War and a love for the films of Francois Truffaut. ",1980-08-15T05:00:00+0000

us,MOVIE:'THE ADVENTURES OF PICASSO',"The Adventures of Picasso'' is billed as ''a lunatic comedy,'' and while it does achieve that feeling on a couple of rare occasions, for the most part it's like a bad dream. This leaden Swedish farce invents a life of slapstick and idiocy for the artist, and parenthetically lambasts everyone from Rembrandt to Toulouse-Lautrec in the process. Ernest Hemingway is seen sitting in a Parisian cafe, wearing a T-shirt that says ''Hemingway'' and knitting mittens. It's remarkable that a film can be so full of fancifulness without developing anything resembling real wit. ",1980-08-24T05:00:00+0000
