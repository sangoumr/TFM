His career in musical theater has made that possible, starting in 2000 with his delightful Broadway debut The Full Monty, a charming musical that was funnier than the 1997 movie. He has since worked in many mediums, including television and cabaret, but has written a new musical about every five years. His latest, which starts previews Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Friday, Nov. 11, is another adaptation, this time of the movie The Bands Visit, about an Egyptian group that arrives in Israel to play a show but ends up stranded in a remote village after a mix-up at the border.

If you know the early stuff, you can look forward to what happens later. What wont get you hired by the O.E.D. are moony declarations of how much you love words. Such ardor, after all, might come at the expense of being able to treat words as objects for analysis. In The Word Detective, Simpson recalls he was also wary of inveterate typers (We normally asked for handwritten letters), poor spellers (of course) and those who claim to enjoy crossword puzzles. He reserved particular opprobrium for cover letters that included the job-application clich hone (I honed my lexicographic skills through a passionate love of words and my enjoyment of crossword puzzles).",2016-11-04T16:15:30+0000

us,"Early Tom Hanks, Headed for a Raucous Party","Tom Hanks has been getting plenty of work lately, in films like Sully and Inferno and as part of a notorious Saturday Night Live election skit. The Museum of Modern Art remembers a time when he was still on his way to becoming a household name when it shows Bachelor Party, his 1984 comedy, on Sunday, Nov. 13, as part of Tom Hanks: A Tribute. Mr. Hanks played half of a couple headed toward the altar (Tawny Kitaen played his fiance) when the event of the films title disrupts things. Mr. Hankss suave smart-alecky manner owes a lot to Bill Murray, but hes funny and engaging even if he isnt doing anything new, Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The New York Times. The film shows at 5:30 p.m. At 2:30 that same afternoon, Big (1988) will be screened; on Monday, at 4 p.m., comes A League of Their Own (1992).

Turning the camera on his fares was a way to displace his rage at the inequities that come with a taxi, where the customer holds all the power and the driver does all the work. Sometimes he snapped people at the beginning of a ride, sometimes after he reached their destination. He mounted a strobe light onto the cabs sun visor using rubber bands. He wasnt fancy.

As Bill Bryson writes in his introduction to THE BEST AMERICAN TRAVEL WRITING 2016 (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $14.95), which highlights two dozen locations across the globe, travel is enriching, stimulating, seductive, pleasurable  but very often a touch compulsive, too. For an example of all these qualities, consult Gretel Ehrlichs ravishing, troubling essay about her perilous journeys by dog sled on the melting ice floes off Greenlands coast. (When I asked if we were going to die, he smiled and said, Imaqa. Maybe.) Yet some travelers do seem to have reined in their wanderlust, alert to geopolitical flux. Five years ago, I learned the prudence of such caution when friends emailed me in alarm from Damascus, where they had been lured by an article Id written about the citys beguiling old-town souk  and had landed just as Syrias civil war began. My apologies! But not everyone is deterred by warfare or global warming. A batch of new books bridges the gap between the timid and the intrepid wanderer, showing that with planning, a little luck and a modicum of attention to headlines, the worlds most arresting sights, tastes and wonders can still be yours  whether you conduct your journey in the 50 states, overseas, from the sanctuary of an armchair or from the bobbing back of a camel.",2016-11-29T16:23:42+0000

Think of the peacock thrill of being looked at that John Travolta evinces in Grease or Tom Hanks in Big or Jennifer Lawrence in anything besides The Hunger Games.

The four dances have traditional beginnings, middles and ends, but instead of a linear presentation of those sections, Mr. Young has grouped them together: All four beginnings are performed sequentially, then all four middles and, finally, all four ends. Reviewing the original production for The New York Times in 1987, Jennifer Dunning wrote that all of these forming and dissolving bits of movement were like daubs of color, making Interleaving resemble an activated Jackson Pollock painting.

In his newest, DAIDO TOKYO (Fondation Cartier Pour lArt Contemporain/Thames & Hudson, $40), he counters expectations: Half the pages are in color. His subject is Shinjuku, the neighborhood around Tokyos major train station, historically not unlike Times Square: filled with bars and love hotels, rife with low-level crime and lurid advertising. It has been gentrified somewhat in recent decades, and also features verdant parks and sleek skyscrapers, but Moriyama nevertheless locates all his favorite textures: fishnet, chain-link, steel tubing, tangled cables, broken glass, torn posters, cracked PVC, dust.",2016-11-30T20:37:08+0000
