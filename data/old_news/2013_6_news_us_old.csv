The device, known as PrePex, is the only adult circumcision method, other than conventional surgery, to gain W.H.O. acceptance. Dr. Eric P. Goosby, the United States Global AIDS Coordinator, said that it would truly help save lives and that he was prepared to use funds from the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for it. For a heterosexual man in countries where AIDS is common, being circumcised lowers the chance of getting infected by about 60 percent. In the past few years, the United States has paid for more than two million circumcisions in Africa; the W.H.O.s goal is 20 million by 2015. PrePex can be quickly put in place by a two-nurse team. The foreskin dies from the pressure of the rubber band in a grooved ring, and drops off or is clipped off a week later. The procedure uses only topical anesthesia and is safer than surgery.

Mr. Eastwood has the good sense to realize that, much as we may adore him, wed sometimes rather spend time with Ms. Adams, who somehow grows tougher, funnier, scarier and more charming with every role. The film, Mr. Scott added, may be an exhibition game, with nothing much at stake, but Ms. Adams brings the heat. She swings for the fence.

Germany, which has been deeply concerned about its rapidly dwindling population, released the results of its first census in nearly a quarter of a century on Friday and found 1.5 million fewer inhabitants than previously assumed. Chancellor Angela Merkel was already worried about the shrinking numbers of taxpayers and able-bodied workers. How future smaller generations will repay German debts, much less the mounting liabilities and guarantees meant to contain the euro-zone debt crisis, is a central question here. Germany had not conducted a single census count since reunification, not even an effort to tally those in the former East Germany after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. The disappearance of 1.5 million people, equal to almost 1.9 percent of the population, only exacerbates the longer-term downward trend.

(AMC) THE KILLING With the killer of Rosie Larsen finally revealed at the end of the second season, this series  which was canceled and then revived  returns with a new case, which the network says will be solved in a single year. And while Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos, above) is no longer working as a Seattle detective, she is drawn back into that life by her former partner Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman). During a search for a runaway girl, he discovers a string of gruesome murders seemingly connected to an investigation she headed several years earlier. Peter Sarsgaard joins the cast as Tom Seward, the psychopath who was convicted in those murders and is just weeks away from execution. Still, even with new colleagues, victims and suspects, Season 3 looks an awful lot like the first two: brooding clouds; menacing, slate-colored skies; and leaden seas are still featured players, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. The creators take a fresh start but cling to the sepulchral atmospherics that too often take the place of narrative.

So its worth saying something about the (fairly widespread) rejoinder that these numbers arent actually as bad as they look, because most young people are in school or training rather than looking fruitlessly for work.

According to Eduardo Snchez, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, the migrants were headed to the United States when they were swindled by smugglers along the border. These human traffickers, these delinquents, Mr. Snchez said, instead of taking them to the border, like they say they will, hand them over to criminal groups. The migrants, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras but including some from Mexico and India, had been held for as long as three weeks while the kidnappers called their families to demand money. On Tuesday, soldiers, acting on a tip, raided a house in Gustavo Daz Ordaz, 30 miles from McAllen, Tex. They found the migrants and detained a man who had been acting as a lookout. Mr. Snchez said that most of the migrants had received medical care and that they would be taken to a holding center in Mexico City. ",2013-06-07T02:09:08+0000

(Showtime 2) TAKE THIS WALTZ (2012) Margot, a young wife (Michelle Williams, above) in Toronto, finds herself attracted to a stranger (Luke Kirby) on a trip to Nova Scotia and is dismayed to discover, after sitting together on the flight home and sharing a cab from the airport, that he lives across the street from the charming row house she shares with her husband (Seth Rogen). She doesnt want to give up her infatuation with her handsome neighbor. But she also does not want to destroy her marriage. He merely lets her know that he is interested and available should she change her mind. That ambivalence is central to what A. O. Scott, writing in The New York Times, called Sarah Polleys honest, sure-footed, emotionally generous second feature, which he chose as a critics pick. Ms. Williams, one of the bravest and smartest actresses working in movies today, portrays a young woman who is indecisive and confused, but never passive, he said. Margots uncertainty, as she and Ms. Polley understand it, is a kind of passion in its own right. The current of her desire runs strongly in two directions: toward the man she knows and loves, and toward the stranger she wants in ways beyond her immediate understanding. He added: There is a moment about 90 minutes in that I was sure was the end, and I still think that stopping there would have made Take This Waltz perfect. But Im also willing to grant that perfection may not have been Ms. Polleys chief concern, especially since the great theme of this wonderful movie  a source of delight as well as distress  is that imperfection is all anyone ever learns from love.",2013-06-07T05:00:05+0000

Like all of Foxs writings, the difficult and painful truths that tennis exposes are laid out like a cadaver awaiting a scalpel. Fox describes how each player allows the score  and their emotions relating to that score  to influence how they play and, even more importantly, their level of motivation as they compete in the match.",2013-06-08T06:00:58+0000

And so the revelation Thursday that the U.S. National Security Agency had obtained routine access to e-mail, Web searches and other online data from many of the biggest U.S. Internet companies  whose users stretch far beyond U.S. shores  prompted hand-wringing about Americas moral authority. If the U.S. complains about foreign governments spying and then it turns out it is doing the same thing  well, what are you complaining about? said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Istanbul Bilgi University in Turkey, where anger over restrictions on civil liberties has fueled anti-government protests.

us,A New York Perfumer Finds an Unlikely Source of Inspiration,"This Saturday, a little over a year after introducing its namesake signature fragrance  a combination of rhubarb and Madagascar vetiver  the Greenwich Village boutique-turned-perfumer Aedes de Venustas will release its much-anticipated follow-up. Teaming up this time with the German perfumer Ralf Schwieger, whose clients include the likes of Frdric Malle and Herms, the brands co-owners Karl Bradl and Robert Gerstner attempted to capture the essence of a rare flower to create the unisex aroma Iris Nazarena. The inspiration was an iris that grows only in the mountains of Nazareth, said Bradl, who discovered the species through art on a postcard. It is a protected wildflower, so we could not harvest or remove the flower. Whats more, iris flowers dont actually have a scent  typically, only their roots do  so the team had to get creative. The fragrance they created, according to Bradl, is inspired by the color, texture and pattern of the blossom. The result is decidedly not floral. Instead, the eau de parfum has a powdery quality, with musky hints of clove and star anise, evoking burning incense  a signature note in the olfactory repertory of Aedes de Venustas, whose house line includes a scented room spray and candles. The effect is like a visit to an officers club from a bygone era, all smoky wood, aged leather and classic mens cologne.",2013-06-11T04:00:00+0000

(Sundance) LAMOUR FOU (2011) The French couturier Yves Saint Laurent, below, may have been surrounded by intense beauty, both in the atelier and at home, yet he was said to be joyful only twice a year: on the days a new collection was shown, usually to boisterous acclaim. But within 24 hours, the euphoria had evaporated. Pierre Berg narrates this documentary about Saint Laurent, his partner in business and in life for a half-century until the designers death in 2008. The crazy love of the title refers not so much to their relationship but to Saint Laurents obsessions with objects, from the artworks  including Picassos, Matisses, Braques and a treasured Brancusi that were sold at a 2009 Christies auction  to the perfect houses, which he collected passionately. (All of the rooms in one were named after characters from Proust.) Much of this stately, rather detached biography, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times of this documentary from Pierre Thoretton, is pornography for the eye (not the body). Of Saint Laurents depression, he added, To realize that you may have the world while still feeling as if you have nothing is to experience a closer encounter with the void than most of us are likely to have.",2013-06-11T05:00:07+0000

Official Faces Inquiry,"French prosecutors said Wednesday that Stphane Richard, the chief executive of France Tlcom, would be formally investigated for his role in a politically charged case that has already shined an uncomfortable spotlight on his former boss, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Richard has denied wrongdoing. He is being investigated on suspicion of organized fraud, according to the Paris prosecutors office. Investigators are examining a 2008 arbitration case in which Bernard Tapie, a businessman, was awarded $535 million to settle a dispute with Crdit Lyonnais, a state-owned bank. Mr. Tapie had been a career Socialist, but he switched his allegiance in 2007 to the center-right party led by the president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy. Acting on a complaint from Socialist deputies, prosecutors began an investigation to learn if Mr. Tapie might have received special treatment in the case, which Mr. Tapie denied. They are also trying to understand why government officials did not challenge the outcome despite indications of possible anomalies in the procedure. At the time of the arbitration, Mr. Richard was chief of staff to Ms. Lagarde, who was Mr. Sarkozys finance minister from 2007 to 2011.

us,F.B.I. Changes Course on Information Sharing," F.B.I. officials acknowledged Thursday that in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings they had changed procedures for sharing information about people who have been investigated for links to extremists. Under the new procedures, all case agents will be alerted when a person who is in one of the governments databases travels, regardless of whether an investigation of the person is still open. Previously, only the heads of local terrorism task forces were alerted about such travel. In the aftermath of the bombings, it was not clear whether an agent who had investigated one of the bombers in 2011 had been informed that he had traveled to Russia. F.B.I. officials have said that if the agent had been informed, it probably would not have led the agent to reopen the investigation. ",2013-06-14T01:28:11+0000

(HBO) THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012) In this final installment in the director Christopher Nolans trilogy, Christian Bale stars as Batman, who has now retreated into the shadows  and his playboy alter ego, Bruce Wayne, who has gone into seclusion at Wayne Manor years after the death of his foe Harvey Dent and the woman both men loved. Now Bane (Tom Hardy, above left, with Mr. Bales), an overmuscled brute who wears a mask that supplies him with a pain-relieving gas, is intent on destroying Gotham City. Bruce must also contend with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), a cat burglar in search of a clean slate. Gary Oldman is back as Commissioner Gordon, and Michael Caine as Alfred, the Wayne family butler. After repeatedly sending Batman down Gothams mean streets, Mr. Nolan ends by taking him somewhere new, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times, choosing the film as a critics pick. Thats precisely the point of a late sequence in which he shifts between a multitude of characters and as many locations without losing you, his narrative thread or momentum. Like the scenes-within-scenes from his last movie, Inception, she said, the controlled fragmentation works on a pleasurable, purely cinematic level. But, Ms. Dargis added, it also serves Mr. Nolans larger meaning in The Dark Knight Rises and becomes his final say on superheroes and their uses because, as Gotham rages and all seems lost, the action shifts from a lone figure to a group, and hope springs not from one but many.

(13) INSPECTOR LEWIS, SERIES VI: DOWN AMONG THE FEARFUL A new round of this show, a Masterpiece Mystery! stalwart, begins as Inspector Lewis, the long-suffering detective played by Kevin Whately  in what may be his final season as he embarks on a sabbatical  and his sidekick, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway (Laurence Fox, above center, with Mr. Whately, right, and Sanjeev Bhaskar), investigate the murder of a psychic who is an Oxford psychology fellow. Rebecca Front reprises her role as their boss, Chief Superintendent Innocent, and Clare Holman is the winsome pathologist Laura Hobson, whose languorous courtship with Lewis the show promises to resolve. Knowing that this might be the last hurrah, the writers and directors have given these episodes a valedictory quality that edges up to but doesnt cross the line of mawkishness; the final, silent fade-out is both moving and appropriately modest, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. And Lewis is always Lewis. In the first episode of Inspector Morse, he begged off a trip to the pub with his alcoholic boss because it was his night with the kids. As Inspector Lewis comes to a close, hes ready to give up the whole grind to spend more time with them.

(HBO) LOVE, MARILYN (2012) A range of actors and contemporaneous observers recite from recently discovered diaries and letters written by Marilyn Monroe, above, in what David DeWitt, writing in The New York Times, called a respectful love letter to Monroe, presented by the director Liz Garbus as a sexpot, feminist and Tennessee Williams heroine come to life, noble in her respect and need for a sensitive, considerate humanity. Some, like Glenn Close, Viola Davis and Uma Thurman nail their readings. Others, like Ben Foster, get a bit cringe-worthy, Mr. DeWitt said. But the intelligence and dynamism of Ms. Garbuss approach could hardly fail to make you appreciate Monroes growth as an actor, he added about this documentary, which includes footage of Monroe performing or giving interviews.

She was barely older than my daughter Mira. Grieving, I looked for solace in student memories. I had resisted going to a womens college at Delhi University, but a few years later at Mount Holyoke, a college for women in Massachusetts, I discovered a world where no one had to remind you to lean in because every woman already had her shoulder to the wheel and was moving the needle on everything from microbiology to challenging history with herstory. I was surrounded by women who wrote poetry, discussed politics, dismantled engines, designed buildings, managed newspapers, and danced for the joy of being able to do so. It was a world where women were not less than but equal to  a world, as the playwright Wendy Wasserstein put it, of Uncommon Women.The assault happened in New Delhi  the city of my birth and the city where I now live. It is comforting for many to believe that cultures of rape arise in war-torn places like the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now suddenly it was New Delhi that was labeled the capital of rape. The latest statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau indicate that a woman is raped in India every 20 minutes and that this horrendous statistic could well be worse because of high levels of underreporting. According to the N.C.R.B., the number of crimes against women reported to the Indian police has increased from 228, 650 in 2011 to 244,270 in 2012. Out of the 24,923 rape cases registered by the police across India in 2012, 706 cases of rape were reported in Delhi, according to the N.C.R.B. In 2011 the number of rape cases reported in Delhi was 572. ",2013-06-17T10:11:50+0000

Despite cutting among as many as four action scenes at a time, the director, Daniel Espinosa, maintains a visually coherent, narratively rational sense of time and space, no matter how fast the story shifts about, which it does with increasing speed when that same heavily armed horde that had been chasing Frost breaches the safe house, slaughtering most of the American operatives and sending Frost and Weston running, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times.

After introducing me to his star brush maker, Fermin Gil, a Mexican immigrant who can just see when a brush isnt right, Kirschner handed me a one-inch boar-bristle brush with a wooden handle.

The perennial prankster has continued to produce imagery via Toilet Paper, the salacious biannual he creates with the commercial photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari. Since its inaugural issue in 2010, the magazine has regularly published 2-D works with the same eccentric qualities as Cattelans sculptures. (An anthology was released last year.) Its spreads are scabrous and surreal, cartoonish and sublime: an eyeball staring from a mans mouth, a playing card held between a womans buttocks, a half-eaten bar of soap. Though much of the work will elicit laughter, Cattelan and Ferrari take it very seriously. Toilet Paper images are the realization of everyones most intimate, hidden and unspeakable desires and urges, Cattelan said. What makes a Toilet Paper image is the attempt to say something terrible while staying quiet.",2013-06-21T20:38:54+0000

(Starz) TO ROME WITH LOVE (2012) In this tribute to the Italian cinema of the 1950s and 60s by Woody Allen, a retired, and overly psychoanalyzed, music promoter (Mr. Allen) travels with his wife (Judy Davis) to Rome, where their daughter (Alison Pill) has lost her heart to an earnest lawyer devoted to left-wing causes (Flavio Parenti). Meanwhile in this shuffled anthology, a young newlywed loses her way to the Trevi Fountain and into the arms of a movie star while her befuddled husband tries to keep his relatives in the dark, substituting a prostitute (Penlope Cruz, above with Alessandro Tiberi) for her at dinner. An ordinary Roman (Roberto Benigni) is plunged into a swirl of media celebrity. And a fledgling architect (Jesse Eisenberg) finds his relationship with his kind, if bland, girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) blown to smithereens when her neurotic actress friend (Ellen Page) shows up for a visit. Alec Baldwin plays the older architect  a ghost? a specter of the younger mans self?  who witnesses the ordeal. One of the most delightful things about To Rome With Love is how casually it blends the plausible and the surreal, and how unabashedly it revels in pure silliness, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The limitations of To Rome With Love, as frothy as the milk atop a cappuccino, are finally inseparable from its delights. Some of the scenes feel rushed and haphazardly constructed, and the dialogue frequently sounds overwritten and under-rehearsed. But this may just be to say that we are watching late-period Woody Allen. Complaining would be as superfluous  though also, perhaps, as inevitable  as psychoanalysis.",2013-06-22T05:00:04+0000

Five maids bound by their personal struggles navigate the upstairs-downstairs attitudes of their Beverly Hills employers in this take on the telenovela Ellas Son ... la Alegra del Hogar. The story begins as one of their peers, Flora (Paula Garcs), is murdered in the home where she works during one of the years fanciest society events. Marisol, played by Ana Ortiz, works for some troubled newlyweds and tries to learn the truth about Floras death. Dania Ramrez is Rosie, who left her son in Mexico to work as a maid and nanny for a couple of uppity actors. Roselyn Snchez is Carmen, an aspiring singer who would like her pop-star employer to help jump-start her career. And Zoila (Judy Reyes) and her teenage daughter (Edy Ganem, above right with, from left, Ms. Snchez, Ms. Ramrez and Ms. Reyes) are the maids for an emotionally unstable but very wealthy woman. Writing in The New York Times, Alessandra Stanley said that despite amusing touches, the show is relentlessly arch and tongue in cheek in a way that seemed fresh when Desperate Housewives began in 2004, but now is less so. She added: There is more to these hard-working women than their laundry skills  they are called devious for a reason  but the story lines and dialogue may be a bit too cute and contrived to hold viewers interest for long. Its the cast, she said, that commands attention. ",2013-06-23T06:43:28+0000

The purpose of that order was to discourage unjustified surveillance and prevent police from peering into peoples private affairs and building dossiers on them without legitimate cause.

us,Inching Into Syria,"REYHANLI, Turkey  In the border towns where Syrian rebels recuperate and resupply, the buzz is that the long wait for Barack Obama may be near an end. The excitement is not the result of the White House announcement on June 13 that the United States will supply light weapons to the groups seeking to overthrow the homicidal regime of Bashar al-Assad. Bullets and body armor wont help much against Assads tanks, bombs and mortars. But the rebels say they see Obamas hand in some bigger, less-publicized developments: the arrival of more and better antitank weapons, and rumors of long-withheld antiaircraft weapons. The heavier ordnance is coming from Europe, the gulf and  as The Times reported Saturday  from Libya. But it seems to be flowing now with a wink and a nod from the U.S.",2013-06-24T01:36:07+0000

What arrived was an attractive salad  a white rectangular platter lined with baby arugula tossed with a light vinaigrette and topped with halved cherries, small dabs of goat cheese and a nutty pesto. Im not one for adding fruits like blueberries and cranberries to salads, but I found that I liked this combination a lot. Even sweet cherries have a tart edge to them, and the combination of their sweet/tart flavor and juicy but firm texture with the pungent arugula, creamy goat cheese and crunchy nuts worked well.

In this documentary the first-time filmmaker Jeffrey Kimball explores this phenomenon across four years through the stories of those who find joy in creatures so alive, active, varied and beautiful, says Anya, a 15-year-old birder, who is shown alongside obsessives like Jonathan Franzen, the author of Freedom (which features a cerulean warbler on its cover), and Starr Saphir, who died in February and whose renowned walking tours made her the matriarch of Central Park bird-watching. Mr. Kimball also speaks to scientists, who call the concentration of birds there the Central Park effect, and who, each Christmas season, attempt to count the birds in the park to produce the annual report of birds in decline.

The killings made headlines in Britain and France in September 2012. The man who was arrested, Zaid al-Hilli, the brother and son of two of the victims of the killings near the French-Swiss border, has repeatedly denied published reports in Britain that he was involved in a multimillion inheritance dispute with Saad al-Hilli, his younger brother, who died in the killings along with his mother and his wife. Two of the younger Mr. Hillis children, both young girls, survived the shooting, one of them with a fractured skull and a bullet wound to her shoulder. The Surrey police said that in arresting the older Mr. Hilli they had acted at the request of the French police, who had questions about Mr. Hillis whereabouts at the time of the killing and the origins of the disputed inheritance. The French police have said that their inquiries have centered on a family dispute over money originally transferred to British and Swiss banks  and properties in Britain bought with the funds  during the years when Saddam Hussein ruled in Iraq.

(TMC) SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998) Joseph Fiennes portrays Shakespeare as a struggling playwright cursed with the double whammy of writers block and a crisis of sexual confidence, and Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola, the literate, headstrong muse who inspires him to write Romeo and Juliet in this Oscar-winning film from the director John Madden. Ingenious as the films many inventions happen to be (from boatmen who behave like cabbies to its equivalent of Shakespearean outtakes  One Gentleman of Verona in the writing process), it could never have had so much energy without the right real-life Juliet to dazzle Will, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. Ms. Paltrow, in her first great, fully realized starring performance, makes a heroine so breathtaking that she seems utterly plausible as the playwrights guiding light. In a film steamy enough to start a sonnet craze, her Viola De Lesseps really does seem to warrant the most timeless love poems, and to speak Shakespeares own elegant language with astonishing ease. Shakespeare in Love itself seems as smitten with her as the poet is, and as alight with the same love of language and beauty. Ms. Paltrow won an Oscar for best actress; Judi Dench (above, with Colin Firth as Violas fianc) for best supporting actress for her role as Queen Elizabeth; Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard for best screenplay; and the film for best picture.",2013-06-25T05:00:06+0000

Or was he someone who was genuinely threatenedby an unarmed 17-year-old!and fired his gun in self-defense? Here at the Gun Report, we are rather skeptical of the defense, but notwithstanding that, the larger problem here is that laws like Stand Your Ground practically encourage vigilantism, and a Wild West mentality. The reader comments from the pro-gun advocates in this forum often stress the gun violence committed by out-and-out criminals, but what has been striking to us since we began compiling this report a month after the Newtown massacre is how many deaths are not the result of criminals bearing armshow many are accidents, or shots fired in anger, or, on occasion, George Zimmerman-style examples of vigilantism.

They do not contribute to the development of a competitive region. Mexico has largely kept quiet on the immigration debate, fearing a backlash, while privately making it known to lawmakers that it supported the idea of providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The Senate bill would provide such a path, but would also nearly double the number of border agents and complete 700 miles of fencing.

us,Lebanon: Bank Settles Case With U.S.," Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday that a Lebanese bank linked to what they described as a vast money-laundering operation by Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese Shiite organization, had agreed to a $102 million settlement. The settlement will come from $150 million impounded by the Justice Department last August from the bank, the Lebanese Canadian Bank, which is now in liquidation. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that the settlement shows that banks laundering money for terrorists and narco-traffickers will face consequences for their actions, wherever they may be located. A federal lawsuit filed in 2011 placed the bank at the center of what prosecutors and drug enforcement officials said was a scheme in which it laundered the proceeds from sales of Colombian narcotics and used cars that were exported from the United States. The lawsuit said the bank then repatriated the laundered money to Lebanon, where Hezbollah received a portion. Hezbollah dismissed the lawsuit as propaganda. ",2013-06-26T03:53:15+0000

Recently more human beings have been dying by suicide annually than by murder and warfare combined. Despite the progress made by science, medicine and mental-health care in the 20th century  the sequencing of our genome, the advent of antidepressants, the reconsidering of asylums and lobotomies  nothing has been able to drive down the suicide rate in the general population. In the United States, it has held relatively steady since 1942. Worldwide, roughly one million people kill themselves every year. Last year, more active-duty U.S. soldiers killed themselves than died in combat; their suicide rate has been rising since 2004. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans has climbed nearly 30 percent since 1999. In response to that widely reported increase, Thomas Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., appeared on PBS NewsHour and advised viewers to cultivate a social life, get treatment for mental-health problems, exercise and consume alcohol in moderation. In essence, he was saying, keep out of those demographic groups with high suicide rates, which include people with a mental illness like a mood disorder, social isolates and substance abusers, as well as elderly white males, young American Indians, residents of the Southwest, adults who suffered abuse as children and people who have guns handy.",2013-06-26T11:00:22+0000

us,After Hours | Young Jean Lees Goofy Pop Existentialism,"Last night at Chez Andr in the basement of the Standard Hotel, East Village, as part of its Standard Sounds series, the stage was occupied by the 39-year-old Korean-American writer and performer Young Jean Lee, whom The Times, in a review last year of her Untitled Feminist Play, called the most adventurous downtown playwright of her generation. Hopping up and down in a T-shirt, colorful print pants, Converse low-tops and a chronic goofy smile, Lee looked like that beloved friend from college: funny, nice, smart, a bit dorky. So it was a surprise to hear her sing  in her clear but unremarkable voice, and accompanied by the moody synth-pop riffs of her band, the scruffy hipster quartet Future Wife  such unforgiving lyrics as: When you get old, you will lose your mind and everything will hurt all the time. Or the finale: Im gonna die. Im gonna die someday. Then Ill be gone. And itll be O.K. Such is the shruggingly morbid nature of Were Gonna Die, the song cycle Lee penned, after the illness and death of her father, on the horrific but ultimately it-is-what-it-is nature of mortality. She has been performing the cycle for a few years now and will bring it back to Lincoln Center Theater from Aug. 5 through Aug. 17.",2013-06-26T18:10:34+0000

Mr. Koerner devotes most of his attention to Roger Holder, a disgruntled Vietnam vet, and Cathy Kerkow, a troubled young woman from Oregon. The pair, who hijacked a flight and took it to Algiers, eventually settled in France, where they became minor celebrities among the French left. Reviewing the book for The Times, Dwight Garner called it such pure pop storytelling that reading it is like hearing the best song of summer squirt out of the radio. In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Koerner discussed interviewing Holder, why it took so long for the authorities to increase airport security at the time and more.

For now, the right to define marriage is still reserved to the states, which means that the political battle can continue  albeit amid a flood of new lawsuits inspired by some of Kennedys argumentsin jurisdictions where the national trend toward support for gay wedlock hasnt yet overwhelmed the traditional view. This obviously matters to the hardy band of activists who still hold out hope of reversing that trend.

If thats true, then Hungtai, who looks like a hipster Wong Kar-Wai character, has a lot of experiences to draw from for his music. Hungtai was born in Taiwan but has lived and worked in such diverse places as Montreal, Queens and Berlin, where the video for I Dream in Neon  featured exclusively above  was shot. Its a moody, lo-fi single from his most recent album, Drifters/Love Is the Devil, on which many of the tracks are deliciously experimental and seem like they span decades, tiptoeing a thin line between a late 60s garage band and a New Age 80s pop group. The album, and song, is a conglomeration of all of the past work Ive done. I want people to come along for the ride, he said. The music video, which he referred to as the loosely autobiographical story of his move to Germany, where he made part of this record, cuts in and out of shots of dimly lit classic cars zipping around foreboding streets. One might expect Ryan Gosling to pop out of the shadows at any moment  not a coincidence since Hungtai is definitely obsessed with the 2011 sleeper hit Drive. I must have seen it about four times in theaters, he admitted. I have always been interested in road movies. Perhaps thats why the track seems like a trip to a dreamlike other world, not unlike his stage shows.

us,Francis Bacons Works Steal the Sale at Sothebys in London,"LONDON  Two paintings by Francis Bacon  one of the artists favorite female model and another of a man peering at the viewer from behind a pair of delicate glasses  were the stars of Sothebys sale of contemporary art here on Wednesday night.It was the second night in a week of back-to-back auctions here, and the salesroom was overflowing with collectors and dealers. Most came to watch, but many bid as well. On offer were 68 works, including other examples by British artists like David Hockney and Damien Hirst, as well as an international array of blue-chip names  Lucio Fontana, Andreas Gursky and John Currin, to name a few.But while the evening brought some solid prices, it followed a similar pattern to Christies sale on Tuesday night. Both lacked the frenzy (and the stellar selection of material) that made up the New York sales in May. Were at the end of a marathon that started in New York, then moved to Hong Kong, Venice, Basel and now back to London, said Harry Blain, a British dealer, ticking off the various events, including art fairs and auctions, that began in New York last month. Still, he added, when something is rare people fight for it.The auction totaled $116.8 million, in the middle of its $101.2 million to $144.9 million estimate. Fifteen works failed to sell. The auction was bigger than the Christies event, which totaled $108.4 million, within its $86.4 million to $112 million estimate. Of the 64 works at that auction, 13 failed to sell.(Final prices include the buyers premium: 25 percent of the first $100,000; 20 percent from $100,000 to $2 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Both Bacon canvases were being sold by William Acquavella, the New York dealer, according to several dealers familiar with the works. The best of them  Three Studies of Isabel Rawsthorne  was a 1966 triptych of Rawsthorne, an artist, who was Bacons confidante and model. Two bidders fought for the painting, which was purchased by Alex Corcoran of the Lefevre Gallery in London for $17.3 million. It had been estimated to bring $15.5 million to $23.3 million. Mr. Acquavella had bought the triptych at Christies in London nine years ago for $4.2 million. The second Bacon  Head III  a 1949 canvas of a mans head peering eerily out at the viewer, was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for $16.1 million, well above its $10.8 million high estimate.Abstract paintings have been all the rage recently and two works by Lucio Fontana commanded high prices. His Concetto Spaziale, Le Chiese di Venezia, a 1961 canvas inspired by the mosaics, frescoes, glass and stone of churches in Venice, which was expected to fetch $6.2 million to $9.3 million, went to a telephone bidder for $6.8 million. And Fontanas 1965 Concetto Spaziale, Attese, a white canvas with his signature slashes that was expected to bring $5.1 million to $7 million, sold for $6.7 million to another telephone bidder.David Hockney is always a favorite in London, especially after his blockbuster exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts here last year. Both Hockney works artist brought higher than expected prices. A Small Sunbather, from 1967, depicting one of his famed subjects, swimming pools, had belonged to Stanley J. Seeger, the celebrated collector who died in 2011. Although it was expected to bring $467,000 to $780,000, it sold to a telephone bidder for $1.7 million. Mr. Seeger had bought the painting at Christies in New York 13 years ago for $270,000. A later Hockney work, Double East Yorkshire, a colorful landscape from 1998 that had been estimated to sell for $3.1 million to $4.6 million, went to another telephone bidder for $5.3 million.The sale also included five photographs by Andreas Gursky depicting stock exchanges around the world. They were being sold by Greg Coffey, a former hedge fund manager living in London. Among the best of them was Chicago Board of Trade III, which was estimated at $935,000 to $1.2 million and went to a telephone bidder for $3.3 million.",2013-06-26T23:16:04+0000
