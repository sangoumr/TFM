Being Flynn is a much milder movie than Taxi Driver, pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas, but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niros gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.

Part of it has to do with a studio tendency toward surf tropes and clichs (Cowabunga! Hang Ten!). More of it has to do with the nature of the sport itself: it breeds localism. Not just the xenophobic, occasionally violent expressions of localism that enforce the pecking order, but, more prevalent, a fierce love of place. To learn the personality of a particular wave is to become intimate with the contours of a landscape, to map that landscape and make it yours. Surfers will say that the character of a break influences the local culture. In other words, a filmmaker who wishes to get a surf spot right by its locals has his work cut out for him.

Black and Hispanic groups sued the state over the electoral maps drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature, saying the maps discriminated against minorities.

This has already been dissected at length, so Ill keep it short, but while Myers is a No. 3 starter at best in terms of talent, he threw 439 innings over the past two years for Houston and that has a lot of value, particularly in keeping the bullpen fresh. Its also curious given that the Astros actually have some talent in the bullpen: David Carpenter, Wilton Lopez, Juan Abreu (12.0 K/9IP in Class AAA), and yes, even Brandon Lyon. Either way, this is really about the future for Houston, which apparently feels that to a contender at the trade deadline, a shut-down reliever has more value than a No. 3 or 4 starter. The Astros may be right there, but this does nothing but make it more likely that Houston drafts No. 1 over all in the 2013 draft.",2012-03-02T11:00:02+0000

Henderson  an assistant professor at Ithaca College in Ithaca, N.Y., where she lives with her husband and two sons  is no stranger to the Book Reviews cover; her own debut novel, Ten Thousand Saints (one of our 10 Best Books of 2011), was reviewed there last year. Like Dermonts book, it also delved into the confused and sometimes reckless lives of adolescent boys. One of the things that most impresses me in The Starboard Sea is Dermonts access into the experience of a teenage boy, Henderson said in a recent e-mail. I tend to be annoyed when readers get excited by a writer who crosses over into a character of the opposite gender, as though the opposite gender is some unidentified species or something. But Dermonts commitment to seeing the world through a boys eyes seems complete to me, and I think its because of her powerful crush on her own narrator, Jason. I feel the same way about Jude, the 16-year-old protagonist of my novel  in high school, I would have liked to have a boyfriend like him, as screwed up as he is.

Adams did tell a friend that the great calamities in life leave one speechless, and three years after Clover died he wrote that he was still sad, sad, sad.

Rice is as responsible as anyone for pop cultures current fascination with vampires  her 1976 novel Interview With the Vampire represented a tectonic shift and a radical innovation, as the essayist Victoria Nelson puts it in her forthcoming book Gothicka, because it was the first to tell the story from the vampires point of view. Now Rice has turned her attention to that other pop-Gothic standby, the werewolf. Her new novel once again mixes vaguely philosophical inquiries about good and evil with standard horror trappings: His fingers, or were they claws, touched his teeth and they were fangs! He could feel them descending, feel his mouth lengthening! . . . His voice was guttural, roughened. . . . His hands were thickly covered with hair! Hmmm. A growth spurt, a deeper voice, hair in new places  if youre smirking here, well, Rice knows that werewolf stories have always echoed the truly scary specter of puberty. On Amazon, where shes a prolific reviewer of other peoples work, she weighed in last June on The Company of Wolves, a 1984 movie by Neil Jordan (who also directed the big-screen version of Interview). She called it a masterpiece. Werewolf films have for decades dealt with the emerging sexuality of adolescents, she wrote. But this film outdoes them all. . . . Its in a class with films like Cocteaus Beauty and the Beast. It goes deep to the very core of what the werewolf myth has always been about.

Mr. Cuccinelli since 2010 has sought to force the university to release documents for five grant applications made by the scientist, Michael E. Mann, and related e-mails, saying he suspected that Dr. Mann used fraudulent climate data to secure grants. A lower court also denied the request, saying Mr. Cuccinelli presented nothing to back up his accusation. Dr. Mann, the author of influential research charting a marked rise in global temperatures, has long been a target of climate change skeptics like Mr. Cuccinelli. The State Supreme Court agreed with the university that Mr. Cuccinelli exceeded his authority. Today, the court effectively held that state agencies do not have to provide state-owned property to state investigators looking into potential fraud involving government funds, Mr. Cuccinelli said in a statement critical of the ruling. Dr. Mann said he was pleased, adding, Its sad, though, that so much money and resources had to be wasted on Cuccinellis witch hunt. ",2012-03-03T05:33:28+0000

us,Heroine Is Chosen for Last Williams Play,"The coming production of In Masks Outrageous and Austere  the final full-length play written by Tennessee Williams and a work that has never been produced for the stage  has found its heroine, the producers are to announce on Monday. Shirley Knight, left, a Tony, Emmy and Golden Globe award winner, will play Babe Foxworth, a wealthy Southern belle who is kidnapped. Ms. Knight has brought many of Williamss characters to life in the past, most notably Heavenly Finley, in the film version of Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), for which she received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. In a telephone interview Ms. Knight described this character as fierce and wonderful and compared her with other strong women from Williamss plays like The Glass Menagerie and Sweet Bird of Youth. She added: There is a whole other dark comedy quality to it. Its very funny. It is unique, but you know it is his voice. Its Tennessee. It couldnt be anybody else. The play is scheduled to run from April 5 to May 26 at Culture Project and is to be directed by David Schweizer. Williams wrote the manuscript over a span of four years until his death, in 1983, and it was kept out of the public eye for years by Gavin Lambert, who worked with Williams on it and to whom he entrusted the manuscript. Mr. Lambert released the play shortly before he died, in 2005, and the work eventually reached Mr. Schweizer. Ms. Knight recalled a missed opportunity in which she was meant to star in Williamss Red Devil Battery Sign, but the production fell apart after his death. She sees this casting as a second chance. I feel like somehow this came to me for a reason, she said. I was meant to do this.",2012-03-04T21:36:00+0000

Mr. Grace, 33, will play a man who once earned seven figures in corporate life but is now trying to rebuild his life after a divorce and a nervous breakdown. Starring opposite Mr. Grace will be Olivia Thirlby, below left, as a young businesswoman with her own troubles. Ms. Thirlby is perhaps best known as the friend of the title character in the 2007 film Juno, and she also played a comely campaign intern in the Off Broadway production of Farragut North in 2008. Both actors have already worked with Mr. Weitz, a writer and director who shared an Academy Award nomination for adapted screenplay for the 2002 film About a Boy. Mr. Grace starred in Mr. Weitzs film comedy In Good Company in 2004, and Ms. Thirlby is in his newest movie, Being Flynn.

In a black beanie, thin-rimmed spectacles and gray A.P.C. button-down shirt, which he purchased at half-off, Dano orders a green tea and chicken ratatouille sandwich. Fuel for a day of hustling ahead, he says. (Hustling, for Dano, is having to dine like this with reporters like me.) Its not really why I signed up to be an actor, says the 27-year-old in a thoughtful but unapologetic manner. Dano is a smart guy with an interesting face. Hes not too cocky and he still blushes from time to time, but its clear he can hold his own against even the most intimidating actors (his former co-star Daniel Day Lewis, in their Oscar-winning, nightmare-inducing film, There Will Be Blood, comes to mind). Its part of why Paul Weitz cast him opposite Robert De Niro in Being Flynn, in which Dano plays the troubled, 20-something Nick Flynn trying to cope with the reemergence of his narcissistic alcoholic father, Jonathan Flynn (De Niro). At first, I immediately got over the fact that hes Robert De Niro, says the actor of his established co-star. But there was this one day. ",2012-03-06T21:16:38+0000

Given the Republicans deep animosity to most, if not all, things French  as we recently reminded the world on Rendezvous (oops)  as well as the penchant of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican front runners, to accuse Mr. Obama of wanting to impose European-style socialism on the United States, Michael says he is certain the White House will rush right out and start making the advertisements touting Sarkos endorsement.

For men, Pilati made clothes that were dressed up, grown-up, controlled. For women, he had more fun and introduced things like tulip skirts and tunics, leading fashion into silhouettes that shocked and then lasted. (Can one count the number of tulip skirts that were made and worn between 2005 and 2007? Did the tunics that Pilati showed with leggings in his fall 2006 collection not prompt Skinny Jean Mania?). Balancing severity with sexiness, always, Pilati exits YSL with a legacy of looks for the books, from fall 06s flower-pouf capelet to fall 07s A-line tuxedo mini and the most recent chain-mail racer dress.

The wigs were fitted with identical hairlines and cuts to take the personality away, according to Palau.

Instantly, she knew something was wrong. Her chin was jutting forward uncontrollably and her face was contracting into spasms. She was still twitching a few weeks later when her best friend, Thera Sanchez, captain of one of the schools cheerleading squads, awoke from a nap stuttering and then later started twitching, her arms flailing and head jerking. Two weeks after that, Lydia Parker, also a senior, erupted in tics and arm swings and hums. Then word got around that Chelsey Dumars, another cheerleader, who recently moved to town, was making the same strange noises, the same strange movements, leaving school early on the days she could make it to class at all. The numbers grew  12, then 16, then 18, in a school of 600  and as they swelled, the ranks of the sufferers came to include a wider swath of the Le Roy high-school hierarchy: girls who werent cheerleaders, girls who kept to themselves and had studs in their lips. There was even one boy and an older woman, age 36. Parents wept as their daughters stuttered at the dinner table. Teachers shut their classroom doors when they heard a din of outbursts, one cry triggering another, sending the increasingly familiar sounds ricocheting through the halls. Within a few months, as the camera crews continued to descend, the community barely seemed to recognize itself. One expert after another arrived to pontificate about what was wrong in Le Roy, a town of 7,500 in Western New York that had long prided itself on the things it got right. The kids here were wholesome and happy, their parents insisted  cheerleaders and honor students, as one father said  products of a place that, while not perfect, was made up more of what was good about small-town America than what was bad. Now, though, the girls writhing and stuttering suggested something troubling, either arising from within the community or being perpetrated on it, a mystery that proved irresistible for onlookers, whose attention would soon become part of the story itself.",2012-03-07T11:59:02+0000

Designing Women, at the Fashion and Textile Museum, which opened March 16, focuses on the midcentury modern textile designs of Lucienne Day, Jacqueline Groag and Marian Mahler, and plays up a heroic moment of British ingenuity: three women inspired by the Bauhaus and the Secessionists rejected the chintzes and florals of the 30s and 40s and helped democratize modernism.",2012-03-07T12:00:36+0000

Actually, she was on the lam. She had been charged in the United States with distribution of a pamphlet called Family Limitation, which discussed birth control methods and pleaded for women to know their own bodies. Under the Comstock Act, passed in 1873 and still in force in 1914, this amounted to obscenity.",2012-03-07T23:40:27+0000

This display at the Grolier Club, organized by the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library, includes period maps, newspapers and other items related to the Civil War that tell the stories behind the conflict, from the tensions that led to it to the battles that defined it. (Included, above, is an 1864 Currier & Ives lithograph with Lincoln and the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis tugging on a map of the United States held by Gen. George B. McClellan, a Union Army general who unsuccessfully ran for president against Lincoln.) Other pieces include a map used by Lincoln to plot troop movements; the war itself led to a remapping of major battle areas. On Tuesday at 6 p.m. Ronald Grim, curator of the Leventhal Map Center, will talk about the significance of the maps; the talk, like the show, is free, but reservations are requested by e-mailing mbrennan@grolierclub.org, or calling (212) 838-6690. The exhibition can be seen Mondays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 47 East 60th Street, Manhattan, grolierclub.org.; it will be on view at Fords Theater in Washington, beginning in December.

But any writer with a distinctive style runs the risk of self-parody. Consider Tom Wolfe, who used exclamation points and electric Kool-Aid prose to help reinvent journalism before moving on to Technicolor zeitgeisty novels like The Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full. Wolfes new novel, Back to Blood, wont be released until this fall. But the books description on Amazon makes it sound like the sort of sprawling social novel that might have been churned out by a white-suited Tom Wolfe cyborg. Here it is: As a police launch speeds across Miamis Biscayne Bay  with officer Nestor Camacho on board  Tom Wolfe is off and running. Into the feverous landscape of the city, he introduces the Cuban mayor, the black police chief, a wanna-go-muckraking young journalist and his Yale-marinated editor; an Anglo sex-addiction psychiatrist and his Latina nurse by day, loin lock by night  until lately, the love of Nestors life; a refined and oh-so-light-skinned young woman from Haiti and her Creole-spouting, black-gang-banger-stylin little brother; a billionaire porn addict, crack dealers in the hoods, de-skilled conceptual artists at the Miami Art Basel Fair, spectators at the annual Biscayne Bay regatta looking only for that nights orgy, yenta-heavy ex-New Yorkers at an Active Adult condo and a nest of shady Russians.",2012-03-09T17:45:35+0000

Like The Help, an Oscar nominee for best picture this year, The Maids considers the problems of sorely put-upon domestics, who are routinely humiliated by their affluent, self-centered employer. But because The Maids was written by Jean Genet, one of the most subversive dramatists ever, sentimentality doesnt figure in this coruscating one-act drama from 1947. The fire of homicidal rebellion glows in the hearts of the plays title characters (who were inspired by an infamous French murder case of 1933). And they do their darnedest to fan that spark into flame by acting out fantasies of their much-loathed mistresss destruction. Jesse Berger directs this in-the-round presentation of Genets identity-bending chef-doeuvre. Ana Reeder and Jeanine Seralles portray the sisters in servitude, while the wonderful J. Smith-Cameron (of televisions True Blood and the movie Margaret) is the eminently killable lady of the house.

For the past six years, Ducklo has documented visually impaired visitors interacting with sculptures on touch tours of museums like MoMA and the Met. Monteith spent the better part of a year at the American Academy in Rome where he captured tourists looking at the citys many monumental attractions, seeking the precise moment when the artwork infiltrates the viewers imagination and the act of looking becomes an act of seeing. You dont know how they are experiencing the work, but you know how it looks like they are experiencing it, says Ducklo regarding the slippery nature of perception.

In this angry new book, Unger deplores what he sees as Washingtons obsession with security and overreliance on military and intelligence capabilities, arguing that they are dangerous perversions of the countrys Jeffersonian traditions.

Now comes Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III with a bracingly clear and bipartisan message: All the theories are bunk! According to Wilkinsons Cosmic Constitutional Theory, the theories have given rise to nothing less than competing schools of liberal and conservative judicial activism, schools that have little in common other than a desire to seek theoretical cover for prescribed and often partisan results. As a result of their cosmic theorizing, Wilkinson concludes, liberal and conservative judges and justices are too quick to second-guess the choices of legislatures, and the casualty is our inalienable right of self-governance.

That book, her first for a mainstream audience, received a mostly dismissive review in our pages from the Rev. Raymond E. Brown, a biblical scholar and Catholic priest who concluded, in his last sentence, that the gnostics chief adversary, crusty old Irenaeus, had been right, after all, to regard the gnostics as the crazies of the second century. But Pagelss analysis of the early church struck a nerve, and not just at the time. As Laura Miller noted recently in Salon, a badly garbled version turned up in The Da Vinci Code in 2003 and proceeded to blow the minds of many readers. Coincidentally (or not), 2003 is also the year Pagels scored her first New York Times best seller, Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas. Her next book, a study of Judas written with the Harvard professor Karen King, also landed here, in 2007, and now Pagels is back. Her latest effort, Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation, enters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 10. Reviewing the book in The New Yorker this month, Adam Gopnik highlighted Pagelss argument that Revelation is essentially an anti-Christian polemic . . . written by an expatriate follower of Jesus who wanted the movement to remain within an entirely Jewish context, as opposed to the Christianity just then being invented. Gopnik continued: The scarlet whores and mad beasts in Revelation are the Gentile followers of Paul  and so, in a neat irony, the spiritual ancestors of todays Protestant evangelicals.",2012-03-16T14:52:47+0000

Bruce Springsteen, of all people, used the word Twitterverse during his South by Southwest concert at ACL-Live at the Moody Theater, a 2,700-capacity room here where the public television series Austin City Limits is staged. On Thursday morning in his SXSW keynote speech he had praised the Animals, particularly the song We Gotta Get Out of This Place  about the son of a hard-working father, looking for a better life  as the source for every song Ive ever written. (The Animals didnt write the song; its by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.) Mr. Springsteen then demonstrated how similar the Animals bass line in Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood was to the one in his own Badlands, accusing himself of successful theft (although he actually switched it from a minor to a major key and changed its contour.)",2012-03-16T16:45:37+0000

But lawn care was far from Buddings mind when he invented the push mower. His original brief was to solve a mechanical problem for a clothing mill regarding the production of guardsmens uniforms. Budding was asked to come up with a way to cut all the tufts and bobbly bits off the nap of the cloth, writes Brian Radam in Lawn Mowers and Grasscutters: A Complete Guide. Budding soon realized the device had other applications. In 1830, he filed a patent for a machine that, when pushed and pulled, would cause a cylindrical blade to rotate over a stationary shear, cutting grass and collecting the clippings. The mower may have put the scythe men out of work, but it enabled the English fashion for grass carpets.",2012-03-16T17:34:28+0000

From 1998 to 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia fought over a disputed border town, killing more than 50,000 people. Relations have been poisonous since then, with Ethiopia accusing Eritrea of harboring militants who have killed tourists inside Ethiopia. On Friday, Eritreas Foreign Ministry said that Ethiopia staged the recent attack to divert attention from the border issue and Ethiopias myriad internal problems. ",2012-03-17T03:59:08+0000

For a longer version of why this shift makes sense, I recommend reading Yuval Levins Weekly Standard piece on Medicare reform; for the shorter version, suffice to say that Ryan 2.0 addresses the fairest liberal attack on the original budgets Medicare proposal, making its vision for entitlement reform more plausible as policy and politics alike.",2012-03-20T19:15:42+0000

In 1863, Dr. James Caleb Jackson, a health reformer who believed illness was rooted in the stomach, began experimenting with cold cereal to augment the mineral-spring treatments at his sanitarium in upstate New York. He baked graham flour into brittle cakes, which he then crumbled and baked again. It was not an immediate success; in fact, it was edible only when soaked in milk overnight. Even so, Jacksons granula, as he called it, would soon have competition. It was not long before Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a Michigan man with a sanitarium of his own, was also promoting a healthful cold cereal. Kellogg ran the Battle Creek Sanitarium, popular with luminaries like Amelia Earhart. He, too, was a digestive evangelist, and in the late 1870s or early 80s, Kellogg combined wheat flour, oatmeal and cornmeal into a mixture that he also called granula. Jackson sued. Kellogg duly switched the u to an o, and by 1889, he was selling two tons of granola a week. Kellogg went on to invent the cereal flake, which led to the Kelloggs cereal empire, which led to Froot Loops and Cocoa Krispies.",2012-03-23T14:00:21+0000

For Ballard, who died in 2009 at the age of 78, the true horrors of our collective future dont concern what might happen hundreds of years from now in a spaceship; rather, they reverberate in the very ordinary now-ness of freeway overpasses, sports stadiums, high-rise apartment complexes and gated communities.

us,Inside the List,"THE ICK FACTOR: For his academic research into morality, the psychologist Jonathan Haidt  his new book, The Righteous Mind, is at No. 6 on the hardcover nonfiction list  likes to ask the kind of hypothetical questions that are more commonly the province of seventh-grade slumber parties. Would you drink apple juice if you knew a sterilized cockroach had touched it? Would you sign a nonbinding contract to sell your soul? If you find your dog dead on the road, killed by a passing car, is it O.K. to carry it home and cook it up for dinner? Haidts book is a serious study of divergent moral viewpoints in politics and religion, but he obviously gets a kick out of confronting his subjects with the ick factor: If you are not a liberal or libertarian Westerner, he writes in his first chapter, you probably think its wrong  morally wrong  for someone to have sex with a chicken carcass and then eat it. Haidt doesnt say where he comes down on the chicken question, but he did tell The Boston Globe recently that his book initially stemmed from a desire to advance liberal positions. When I switched over into studying politics in 2004, he said, I did it expressly to help the Democrats beat the Republicans. I wanted to use moral psychology to help my team! But in the process of learning about all sides, and delving deeply into political psychology, I sort of lost the partisan fervor, and now Im fascinated.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that most of those laws were unconstitutional, saying that they endangered prostitutes by forcing them to work on the streets rather than in controlled circumstances indoors and prevented them from taking certain safety precautions, like hiring bodyguards. But the court did uphold laws against soliciting. The federal government is likely to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada. ",2012-03-27T05:22:55+0000

States that use sodium thiopental to render prisoners unconscious as part of their execution protocols reached out to foreign suppliers when the sole domestic manufacturer stopped producing the drug, which had not been approved for importation. The F.D.A. said it had no jurisdiction over execution drugs. Judge Leon wrote that the agency appears to be simply wrapping itself in the flag of law enforcement discretion to justify its authority and masquerade an otherwise seemingly callous indifference to the health consequences of those imminently facing the executioners needle.

Today, however, after a 20-year downward spiral, the once great Senate is polarized, paralyzed and dysfunctional. Last month, as she announced her decision to retire, Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, described a Senate that routinely jettisons regular order, serially legislates by political brinksmanship and habitually eschews full debate and an open amendment process in favor of competing, up-or-down, take it or leave it proposals.

Certainly The Marriage Plot, Eugenidess first novel since his Pulitzer Prize-winning Middlesex, was poised to receive tremendous literary interest regardless of subject matter, but the presence of a female protagonist, the gracefulness, the sometimes nostalgic tone and the relationship-heavy nature of the book only highlight the fact that many first-rate books by women and about womens lives never find a way to escape Womens Fiction and make the leap onto the upper shelf where certain books, most of them written by men (and, yes, some women  more about them later), are prominently displayed and admired.",2012-03-30T15:22:22+0000

But technology evolves, and despite some notable holdouts (Elif Batuman is one) Twitter has killed the blogging star. Now writers connect with their publics in 140 characters or fewer.
