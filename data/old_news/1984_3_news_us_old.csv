For many people, the incidents reinforced the need to alter the system by which inmates leave prison. Instead of judges dispensing flexible sentences - with the state parole board deciding when inmates should be released - Mr. Cuomo has proposed fixed sentences. Others said the shootings demonstrate a failure to prepare prisoners to return to their communities. The Week in Review last week asked Lawrence T.

The material is intended to help the arriving or departing traveler get through, shop at or stay over at each airport as easily as possible. Not all categories apply to each airport; features characteristic of the individual terminals have been stressed. London Heathrow Airport ARRIVAL Passport and Customs: Heathrow is divided into three terminals. Terminal 1 basically serves British and Irish airlines, although British Airways flights to Chicago and Miami also go through it. Terminal 2 has all the European airlines, and Terminal 3 the intercontinental flights and the Concorde. If you have any problems with walking ask for a wheelchair, since the corridors are very long and the moving walkways are split into various sections with a short walk between each section. Luggage: Baggage is slow to arrive at Heathrow. There are plenty of baggage carts and porters in brown uniforms around. A 20-pence (30-cent) tip per bag is usual although their services are technically free of charge. Currency Exchange: At Terminal 3 in the arrivals lounge there is a branch of Barclays bank open 24 hours every day. In the departures lounge it is open only from 6:30 A.M.-9:30 P.M. Terminals 1 and 2 have branches of the Midland bank open from 8 A.M.-11 P.M. every day. The airport banks charge about one percent higher commission than the city banks.",1984-03-04T05:00:00+0000

Until the advent of satellite program delivery in 1975, such hybrid station-networks could not have existed. But after Home Box Office decided to fly on ''the bird,'' it occurred to Ted Turner, the Atlanta-based entrepreneur, that by following HBO's example he could enrich the fortunes of his low-rated UHF outlet by relaying its signal to a satellite and thereby reach a nationwide audience - especially for the Atlanta Braves, the baseball team also owned by Mr. Turner.

There's definitely a continuation of the downtrend that started 20 years ago. Compliance dropped by maybe one percentage point in that year, which translates into $5 billion. I think there's a belief on the part of some taxpayers that they won't get caught. Or they think they've got a lot of company, which just isn't so.

What remained, he went on, was adoption of a constitutional amendment undoing the Supreme Court's 22-year-old ban. ''Hasn't something gone haywire when this great Constitution of ours is invoked to allow Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen to march on public property,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''but it supposedly prevents our children from Bible study or the saying of a simple prayer in their schools?''",1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000

He found in those performances ''sheer carelessness, lack of artistic conscience'' and the ''cynical conviction that nothing particularly matters in an opera so long as the singers draw good houses.'' Wagner, writing about the German Imperial Opera House, noted the same problems, referring to the ''piebald medley'' on stage, with virtuoso singers treating the rest of the opera as a ''superfluous adjunct.''",1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000

Social satire, political satire, every sort of satire seemed to be modestly thriving, and at a time when the world was rather happier than now and seemed less in need of that savage indignation which the poet Juvenal recommended to would-be members of the International Brotherhood of Parodists, Lampooners and Scurrilous Vituperators. The knives have occasionally been drawn since then - in 1973 by the National Lampoon, for instance, with its wickedly conceived Woodshuck Festival of Love, Peace and Death - but mostly they have been left to rust in their sheaths or handed over to television, which has proceeded to substitute bromide for venom at the end of the blade. So the coincidental convergence on New York of no less than three revues in recent days - ''Babalooney,'' ''Orwell That Ends Well,'' ''A . . . My Name Is Alice'' - raised nostalgic and more than nostalgic hopes. Might the odd shark or piranha turn out to be patrolling the serene theatrical waters?",1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000

His expressed intention was ''to introduce children to the enjoyment of good music, to give them factual information about music and musicians, to stir their imaginations and open new horizons, and to make them music citizens of tommorrow.'' These concerts have become an integral part of New York musical life; the conductors who have led Young People's Concerts over the years include Bruno Walter, Leopold Stokowski, Michael Tilson Thomas and, of course, Leonard Bernstein. During Mr. Bernstein's tenure as music director of the Philharmonic, from 1958 until 1969, the concerts were televised nationwide.

END OF A LINE","THERE WERE PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD who thought my father was a widower, he spent so much time with his son. ''You don't know how much ribbing I took for wheeling a baby around in a carriage,'' he told me recently. But wheel he did, and much more. He coached teams I played on as a little kid and even assisted the coaches of my high school and summer baseball teams. He was a favorite chaperone for church- group trips and dances. I never felt crowded by his presence, and as I grew older, I appreciated the attention and genuine interest he showed in me and my friends and our accomplishments. Later, visiting the homes of college friends, I was quickly struck by the absence of their fathers, not to mention the resentment it had caused. My main excuse for putting off children until my late 30's was that my own life was not settled enough to allow me to spend as much time with my own children as my father had spent with me.

In anticipation of credit demand exceeding supply, rates staged a major upward move, with long-bond yields hitting their highest levels since September 1982. Buyers all but disappeared. Economists have feared that the heated pace of economic expansion in January would continue into February, putting pressure on inflation and prompting the Federal Reserve to slow the growth by raising interest rates. Those fears were heightened on Friday as the Government reported that unemployment had again fallen to 7.7 percent in February from 7.9 percent in January and that the economy was strong enough to absorb 700,000 new jobs. Adding to the concern, the Council of Economic Advisers chairman, Martin S. Feldstein, predicted that first- quarter inflation-adjusted growth would be 6 percent, or much greater than the slowdown that was expected when the year began. Stocks were also battered for most of the week by interest rate fears. On very low trading volume, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.72 points, to 1,139.76.

BETWEEN LONDON BRIDGE AND THE TOWER, IN the oldest part of the City of London, the bit that still seems to smell of the sea, is the insurance capital of the world. Here, a stone's throw from the Bank of England and the other financial icons of the city, are clustered the offices of nearly every insurance enterprise of any size in the world - all drawn there by the long, low building on Lime Street. This is Lloyd's, where all the perils of the world, its storms and fires and floods and earthquakes, and every possible man-made calamity are systematically reduced to manageable routine. These perils are chopped up and shared out so that instead of being an unbearable risk for a few, they are a small risk for many and thus lose their terror. That is the fundamental idea of insurance: to make risks bearable by sharing them around. Lloyd's is the place where marine insurance has been written for 300 years (the earliest surviving reference to ''Mr. Edward Lloyd's coffeehouse in Tower Street'' dates to 1688), and it was around that primal function that other insurance markets have grown up.",1984-03-11T05:00:00+0000

The 15-year-old boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was being held in the Mercer County Youth House until a hearing Wednesday.","Had Just Cashed Check According to the police, Miss Manion had just cashed a $2,000 check, which she had received in settlement of a civil suit, at a downtown bank when she stepped off the curb into the side of the bus.

He worried about the language he used in his poems and once wrote that for a long time he had been ''slicking into my own words / The beautiful language of my friends.'' His resolve: ''I have to use my own now.'' His remarks below reflect not only part of the outlook of his later poetry, but some of the concerns about language that enliven many of his poems. This is an edited version of a talk Wright gave on March 30, 1977 in a series of ''Conversations'' sponsored by the Academy of American Poets. It is the first transcription taken from the academy's tape-recorded archive of American poets. Wright died four years ago on March 25 at the age of 52. HEN I was thinking about how to begin this evening, I wanted to talk about some of the authors I care most about, and I came to realize that most of them are writers of prose. Many of them are very sardonic about themselves, and some of them have a rather sour attitude toward poetry. I don't know why that should be so appealing to me. There is something about the sudden rejection of poetry (or maybe it's a rejection of a certain kind of rhetoric) which in itself can suddenly reach over into some kind of rhythm, some closeness of life.",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The first of these albums were sampler- type anthologies, designed to introduce the music to a new generation of fans, or albums by a single prolific performer. But it was soon evident that haphazard anthologizing could only lead to confusion, and relatively few of the early blues artists had made enough 78-rpm disks to fill an album. So the early blues reissue labels, principally Folkways/RBF and the Origin Jazz Library, borrowed an idea from the regional approach to jazz history - New Orleans style, Chicago jazz, and so on - and began assembling anthologies of Memphis blues, Georgia blues, Mississippi blues, and other regional styles. Subsequent reissue labels like Yazoo and Herwin boasted considerably improved sound quality, but they continued to program most of their albums along regional lines.",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000

us,ODETS'S MASTERWORK SHINES THROUGH,"When Clifford Odets pressed his fellow-members of the Group Theater to put on ''Awake and Sing!'' in 1934, Lee Strasberg lost his temper. ''You don't seem to understand, Cliff,'' he snapped. ''We don't like your play. We don't want to do your play. It has a small horizon.'' That judgment did not, of course, prevail. Within a few months, the play had opened on Broadway, and its apprentice author was being acclaimed a ''somebody'' by Walter Winchell and more modestly praised for his ''fervor and skill'' by Brooks Atkinson. But Strasberg's sneer is still instructive, at least as a reminder of the very different expectations intelligent people brought to drama 50 years ago. If he thought the horizons of ''Awake and Sing!'' small, how would he have measured some of our own day's plays about family discord? The East and West extremes of Tina Howe's undeniably talented, indisputably absorbing ''Painting Churches,'' for instance, would have to be rated the left and right sides of an average-sized shoebox.",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000

Bouis THE CELL DOOR OPENED and a lieutenant of the K.G.B. security police looked in. ''Get ready,'' he said. ''And fast.'' I had no sooner put on my jacket than the door opened again. ''Come on.'' He hurried me down the prison corridor and handed me over to the warden, who led me into his office. A tall, heavyset man stood up behind the desk and said: ''I am Chairman Andropov of the K.G.B.'' He extended his hand. I shook it and said: ''I recognized you from your pictures.'' He offered me a chair and examined me affably through his glasses. ''I've been told that you are undergoing a crisis of confidence in the K.G.B.'' ''Do you blame me?'' I replied. ''We kept our word at the trial, but the judge gave us six years each.'' The time was September 1973, nine years before Yuri V. Andropov began his short reign as the Soviet Union's top leader. The scene was Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. The Soviet human- rights movement had been in existence for eight years. For the first time in Soviet history, people had overcome their fears, spoken out and openly exposed violations of legal norms.

THE GLOOM AND DOOM IS OVERSTATED","MOBIL'S proposed acquisition of Superior Oil, in the wake of other recent announcements, has intensified the public discussion of oil company mergers. Much of the debate has dealt with the possibility that a move to fewer and larger companies would reduce competition and exploration and raise prices to consumers. But these consequences are unlikely in today's energy market. In some situations, mergers may offer benefits to companies and thus to their customers by increasing the efficiency of oil findings, production and marketing. Thus, at least part of today's debate should focus on whether or not a specific merger will achieve goals such as these. ",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000
us,NOW MOBIL ENTERS THE MERGER GAME,"The fourth multibillion-dollar oil merger in recent weeks was proposed by the Mobil Corporation, when it offered to pay $5.7 billion for all shares of the Superior Oil Company. Before making the offer public, Mobil had secretly agreed to buy 22 percent of Superior from the founding Keck family and offered to pay $45 a share for the remaining 78 percent. The merger would keep Mobil firmly ensconced as the nation's No. 2 oil concern, but more important, it would add one billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents to Mobil's reserves. The purchase also seemed calculated to avoid the kind of antitrust problems Mobil encountered earlier when it tried to acquire Marathon Oil and Cities Service. Superior has no refineries or gasoline stations. The proposed merger , nevertheless, stirred the political waters even more in Washington, touching off moves in Congress to halt temporarily big oil mergers while the consequences of such combinations could be studied. Three key senators - two Democrats and a Republican - proposed legislation that would place a moratorium on the purchase, retroactive to Feb. 28, of any company with oil reserves of 100 million barrels or more. Such a level would include the nation's 50 largest oil companies and could affect both Socal's purchase of Gulf and Mobil's acquisition of Superior. Chances for passage seemed slim, however.",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000

If you see an ugly empty lot, there's always the weird juxtaposition - a mansion directly adjoining it. There's really no harmony.

Stella, or Mrs. Pat as she also came to be known, appeared in a succession of hits and flops ranging from Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' to Shaw's ''Pygmalion.'' Shaw's choice of Mrs. Campbell for the part of the cockney charmer Eliza Doolittle reflected their passionate but platonic relationship, recorded in an exchange of letters that stretched over 30 years. The flamboyant actress is the subject of ''Mrs. Pat,'' a biography by Margot Peters, newly published by Alfred A. Knopf. In the following excerpt, as the still-unknown Stella is recovering from illness, the playwright Arthur Wing Pinero begins his search for the right actress to star in his daring new drama, ''The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.''",1984-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The officials said the envoy, Lieut. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, retired, chairman of the President's Commission on Strategic Forces, told Soviet officials when he was in Moscow two weeks ago that he had a letter from Mr. Reagan and some additional authorized comments, but they made no response. Administration officials said they could not recall a similar instance in Soviet-American relations. (Page 1, Column 1.) Major U.S. maneuvers in Honduras will begin April 1, earlier than planned, the Defense Department announced. They will take place a week after the first round of the presidential election in neighboring El Salvador. American officials in San Salvador have said they do not expect the election to result in a clear winner and that they believe a runoff election is likely, with an increase in violence during the runoff campaign. The Pentagon said the maneuvers would continue during the campaign for the second vote. (1:2.)",1984-03-24T05:00:00+0000

us,BANKS FINALLY RAISE THE PRIME,"The upward push of interest rates finally forced the nation's banks to lift the prime lending rate for the first time since last August. Bankers said the one-half percentage point increase, to 11 1/2 percent, was justified in light of the rising cost of their own funds on the credit markets. And some expressed concern that the prime could go substantially higher. If the grim predictions were to come true, it would further aggravate third world debt problems, threaten to abort current economic growth and trouble the still-shakey thrift industry. Reaction from the White House was placing the blame for rising rates on the Congress, urging adoption of President Reagan's $150 billion budget cut proposals. The prime is currently at the highest level since January 1983. Reaction in the stock market was predictable - share prices fell through most of the week as investors continued to fear the effects of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average lost almost 30 points, ending at 1,154.84. Bond prices also fell moderately.

The effort to establish democratic procedures and institutions in a country racked by leftist and rightist violence, begun with the election of a Constituent Assembly two years ago, has enjoyed the backing of the Reagan Administration but has met with skepticism in Congress and in much of Latin America, where critics have held that nothing is possible until there is a consensus to end the strife. Last week, such consensus was conspicuously absent as the insurgents sought to discourage voters up to the last moment by seizing their identity cards and by acts of violence that reached the capital and the second largest city, Santa Ana. The skepticism was reflected in a decision by the Senate, accepted by the Administration, to put off a vote on further emergency aid until after the election and to reduce the amount from $93 million to $61.75 million. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, of Massachusetts, who blocked the Administration drive for a quick vote, said the money would be better used ''when we see what kind of regime we are dealing with.'' Up to now, the Senator and other critics have seen the regime as less than democratic and as closely involved in rightist death squads. One target has been Col. Nicolas Carranza, the head of the Salvadoran Treasury Police, which has a reputation for being particularly brutal. He was said by American officials to have been in the pay, at $90,000 a year, of the Central Intelligence Agency but he denied such a connection.",1984-03-25T05:00:00+0000

The stalwart jazz lovers who sustained their faith through the lean years with an ear glued to Willis Conover's ''Music U.S.A.'' on the Voice of America or hunched over a scratchy Count Basie disk off the black market now give lectures at conservatories, write articles on jazz for Pravda and read learned dissertations on bop. Soviet musicians who jammed excitedly with Benny Goodman's sidemen during his historic visit to Moscow in 1962 now export their own brand of sophisticated jazz, and Soviet ensembles like the Vyacheslav Ganelin Trio from Lithuania have developed an admiring European following all their own. There's even an annual jazz poll compiled by Soviet critics and published each year by the Riga newspaper Sovetskaya Molodezh (Soviet Youth). This year the Ganelin Trio is expected to rate first again, followed by first-class groups like Nikolai Levinovsky's Allegro and German Lukianov's Cadence, and musicians like the pianist Leonid Chizhik, saxophonist Alexei Kozlov or the singer Larissa Dolina - and about 170 other musicians and ensembles.",1984-03-25T05:00:00+0000

Though I was not one who found this relic of the verismo style worth the time and money (reportedly $1.5 million) lavished on it by the Metropolitan, I recognize that such events can have value as studies in historical perspective. The question is how much energy and expense the Metropolitan can afford to spend on such ephemeral projects, especially in light of the recent report of its financial belt-tightening efforts.",1984-03-25T05:00:00+0000

At the turn of the century, Alberto Santos-Dumont, a wealthy young Brazilian living in Paris, captivated the populace with his daring flights in gas-filled balloons and the newly invented airplane. One evening, while sipping aperitifs at Maxim's with his good friend Louis Cartier, he complained about the difficulty of ''pulling a watch from one's waistcoat while trying to steer a dirigible being buffeted by high winds.'' Although women sometimes wore watches - set in heavy, gold bracelets encrusted with precious stones - on their wrists, men shunned them because they were considered too effeminate. Cartier reasoned that the watch, not the bracelet, should be of prime importance and he set about designing one for his friend. The resulting ''Santos'' watch with its simple gold case, white face, black Roman numerals, plain leather band and gold buckle became the world's first wristwatch for men. Some three decades later, Cartier brought forth another first. El Glaoui, Lord of the Atlas Mountains and Pasha of Marrakesh, had called him and complained, ''I like to be able to cool off in my pool and not lose track of time.'' This conversation led to the invention of the first water-resistant watch.",1984-03-25T05:00:00+0000

His announcement released American marines aboard ships offshore for duties elsewhere in the Mediterranean. The number of United States warships off Lebanon had recently been reduced from about 25 to 15. (Page 1, Col. 6.) French soldiers in Lebanon withdrew from positions along the Green Line dividing East and West Beirut. They were the last remaining contingent of the multinational force that was sent to Lebanon to restore order. As they left, shelling started again in the port area and in the mountains east of the capital, breaking a 24-hour-old cease- fire arranged by a special security committee.
