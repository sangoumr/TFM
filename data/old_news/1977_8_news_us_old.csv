And yet the Government maintains an extensive program of price supports for tobacco, currently tying up about $647 million in price stabilization loans, and costing around $10.5 million a year to administer. But it is not the cost that is most troubling; the Commodity Credit Corporation has lost only $57 million to defaults in the 43 years of the program's existence.

us,'Outrageous!' Film Merely Insidious,"""Outrageous!"" tells two stories, only vaguely connected, one about a schizophrenic girl and the other about a homosexual hairdresser. Liza, the girl, has recently escaped from a mental hospital and moved into Robin's apartment, where she chatters hysterically about how, because she is the one who was born dead, the bone-crushers are going to come and grind her bones to powder.Robin isn't much more lucid himself. One evening, after a hard day at the salon, he complains that ""these women here, they live life like it's a can of Coke and they're afraid to drink it too fast or it'll all be gone. Life isn't a can of Coke.""""Outrageous!"" is entirely sympathetic to these characters, trying to show how the rest of the world misunderstands them and why their wackiness makes them wonderful. Unfortunately, the movie winds up exploiting them in an insidious and very unpleasant way. Robin and Liza seem to define themselves through their ability to shock or at least unsettle those around them. The camera, in attempting to play along with this, merely ogles them, accentuating their freakishness without offering much insight into why, for each of them, flamboyance is so desperately important.It could be argued that ""Outrageous!,"" a low-budget Canadian production set mostly in Toronto, presents a no-holds-barred look at a certain stratum of homosexual culture and is thus noteworthy for its verisimilitude. But a film in which nobody ever seems to stop screaming unwittingly enforces stereotypes as dangerous as those favored by Anita Bryant.Craig Russell and Hollis Mc-Laren are more than convincing as Robin and Liza, but they're a little hard to watch; Miss McLaren, in particular, is either a brilliantly skittish performer or an authentic nervous wreck. Much of the film is devoted to showcasing Mr. Russell's talents as a female impersonator, because he eventually hangs up his blow dryer (""I'm sick of doing everyone else's head!"") to seek his fortune in Manhattan's homosexual nightclubs.",1977-08-01T05:00:00+0000

Avery Fisher Hall stretches the notion of the chamber rather far, even though its sound nowadays does make music far more immediate and pleasant than in the past, before last year's acoustical remodeling.

Influenced by ""Jaws,"" and up-to-date in its use of this summer's fad mammal, the killer whale, ""Tentacles"" is set on the California coast, where underwater radio waves of illegal frequency, authorized by a corrupt executive of a construction company, rile a giant octopus.Among the dozen or so victims are a baby, a boatyard worker, a very fat man and the wife of the oceanographer who ultimately solves the mystery of the deaths and settles the monster's hash with the aid of a pair of killer whales.John Huston plays the nosey reporter; Claude Akins is the local lawman who wants to keep the lid on the strange doings. Henry Fonda turns up as the industrialist initially unaware of the use of the illegal radio frequencies by his aide, Cesare Danova. Shelley Winters plays the blowsy sister of the reporter and the mother of a young boy imperiled by the monster during a children's sailboat race; and, in a generally unelectrifying cast, Bo Hopkins takes honors for torpidity with his depiction of the oceanographer.People who are immune to atrocious acting in minor roles; to occasionally poor dubbing; to a totally unoriginal story; to the sort of sloppiness that allows at least one reference to the octopus as a squid; and to a climactic sequence that looks like feeding time at the aquarium when it is at all intelligible, will cull the exceedingly minor rewards of ""Tentacles"" from some realistic underwater photography, a nicely manipulative opening sequence in which the baby vanishes; and the bobbing corpse gimmick that was more shocking than anything else in ""Jaws.""The PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) rating of ""Tentacles"" is probably attributed to its one scary sequence, involving a corpse, and to the high death toll.",1977-08-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Movies: Pryor Is Serious (and Fine),"RICHARD PRYOR isn't very funny in ""Greased Lightning,"" and if you don't think that sounds like an accomplishment, well, think again. Mr. Pryor has a gift for being almost effortlessly amusing, so much so that movie audiences often burst put laughing at the mere sight of him. The first few minutes of ""Greased Lightning"" are a little dicey for that reason, until it becomes clear that Mr. Pryor is out to give a coolly sustained dramatic performance, even a rather subtle one. After that, it's smooth sailing all the way.""Greased Lightning"" is a winning biography of Wendell Scott, the first black stock-car racing champion. Mr. Scott started out driving a taxi after World War II, learned his craft by briefly running moonshine in the backwoods of Virginia. By the mid-1960's he was a veteran driver who had won his battles with those white racetrack owners and law officers who once hoped to cramp his style.The film notes this passage of time inexpensively, mostly through everchanging car models and different amounts of talcum powder in Mr. Pryor's hair. But it lavishes a great deal of energy upon tracing Mr. Scott's evolution from a secretive figure, both frightened and exhilarated by his own ambitions, to a hero a little saddened by the fact that his triumphs are mostly behind him. Mr. Pryor is especially successful in presenting Mr. Scott as a man who guards his energy and intelligence carefully, betraying very little to his enemies and saving a great deal for the moments that matter.Michael Schultz, the erratic and innovative black director responsible for both the verisimilitude of ""Cooley High"" and the jive of ""Car Wash"" is this time at his most quietly telling, as he incorporates a warm sense of Mr. Scott's family ties into a broader, slightly harsher portrait of the era in which he came to maturity. The film perceives a symbiotic relationship between black and white cultures of the day, and it presents racism almost matter-of-factly, as a by-product of cross-cultural confusion.In one scene, Mr. Scott became so furious that he calls a white man a ""nigger."" Beau Bridges, as a white driver who taunts Mr. Scott at their first meeting, is shown to be an all-around sorehead who uses racism as a convenient outlet for his otherwise-undirected rage. He and Mr. Scott soon become fast friends, the early trouble between them apparently forgotten. In one of the film's most crowd-pleasing episodes, they use a steak dinner and a Confederate flag to hold at bay a restaurant full of white patrons, who clearly find Mr. Bridges' character the more dangerous and unsavory of the two.Mr. Bridges has been giving all the right performances in all the wrong movies lately, but this time he comes into his own; his performance here, which recalls his brother Jeff's in another movie about a racing driver, ""The Last American Hero,"" has a crackling vitality, especially when he banters with Mr. Pryor. Mr. Schultz has taken chances in his casting, with performers ranging from Julian Bond to Richie Havens, but everyone does.Cleavon Little is especially effective as Mr. Scott's friend and confidant. Pam Grier, as Mr. Scott's preternaturally patient wife, manages at times to make herself seem almost inconspicuous, which constitutes a triumph of willpower over natural assets even more impressive than that of her costar.""Greased Lightning"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), partly because of the words that are tossed around when tempers flare, and partly because of the sweet, low-key sexual chemistry that seems to exist between Mr. Pryor and Miss Grier.",1977-08-04T05:00:00+0000

Sally moons over Linus, Peppermint Patty rigs all the bunk elections and Charlie Brown worries about whether he has leadership qualities, especially after one of the local bullies declares that ""that round-headed kid is a joke."" Snoopy, ever the scene-stealer, races across the desert on a souped-up cycle, ""Easy Rider""-style, in short, everyone is up to his or her perennially adorable old tricks.This is the third of the Charlie Brown features (there have also been 16 television specials, and a 17th is in progress), but the animated ""Peanuts,"" as directed by Bill Melendez, isn't that much of a departure from Charles M. Schulz's 25-year-old comic strip. The film runs an hour and quarter and has a rambling plot about a regatta, but it seems less like a continuous story than a series of droll blackout sketches, many of them ending with the obligatory ""Good Grief!""The animation is as purposefully spare as the format, often seeming even more two-dimensional than Mr. Schulz's newspaper drawings. The net effect is that of having read the comic strip for an unusually long spell, which can amount to either a delightful experience or a pleasant but slightly wearing one, depending upon the intensity of one's fascination with the basic ""Peanuts"" mystique.",1977-08-04T05:00:00+0000

He fits in quite nicely, which is convenient, because the millionaire's good-for-nothing family is hatching a plot that will leave him in rags for real.It seems that the familya socialite daughter, playboy son, snooty brother and hypochondriac sister-in-lawhas decided that the only way to keep everybody's favorite moneybags sober is to convince him that he has already squandered his fortune. The relatives forsake their hacienda to rent a shabby apartment and don very neat work clothes, in an effort to convince him that times are rough. Their ruse doesn't workand why should it? They still sneak cream puffs when the old man isn't looking.But the millionaire comes up with a scheme of his own, and it's a wonderful success: He convinces the others that they really are poor and, as if by magic, these freeloaders learn to support themselves. Pretty soon everyone is back home in the mansion, where the snooty brother mends gilt furniture and the sister-in-law bakes bread. The lazy son decides to go back to college, and the daughter breaks off with a gigolo to marry a diligent poor boy she met in the slums. Through it all, the millionaire beams wisely. Everybody lives more than happily ever after.This story, based on a comedy by Adolfo Torrado, would have amounted only to the airiest of fluff had not Buuel taken merry advantage of the plot's several layers of deceit. The film, which has an exaggerated visual elegance to match its characters' fine manners, contains several delightful episodes in which the family's cordiality, never worth much in the first place, is worn even thinner than usual by everyone's complete uncertainty about just what everyone else is up to. But, Buuel being Buuel, politesse easily prevails at the expense of reason.",1977-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,'March or Die' Ambles Off to a Bloody Ending,"Because he has almost nothing to say, and especially because he always seems to be winking at the camera, spaghetti-western star Terence Hill is the only truly lively figure in ""March Or Die."" No one else in the film's peculiarly listless all-star cast has much to say eitherbut none of these others has the good grace to keep still.Take Gene Hackman, for instance, as a Foreign Legion major who has clearly been out in the hot sun too long; Mr. Hackman is forever muttering about ""the trenches,"" and the horrors he has seen while fighting in them. Catherine Deneuve, as a gorgeous (though slightly less gorgeous than usual) widow, likes to rattle on about amour and archeology, the latter also being a pet subject of Max Von Sydow's (he plays a scientist out on a dig). ""March Or Die"" is an extraordinarily wooden movie that, while ostensibly being about the futility of battle, actually has more to do with the futility of making movies about that futility.Dick Richards, who also directed ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" has a good eye for eccentric faces and backgrounds: he comes up with a few memorable human tableaux here, as when a bunch of legionnaires stand quietly in a sepia-toned glow, listening to a pianist play ""Plaisir D'Amour."" Unfortunately, Mr. Richards's talents are ill-suited to his material here, and the static quality of the film's better movements only calls attention to the inadequacy of its action sequences.The story is complicated, comprising a dewy-eyed love affair between Miss Deneuve and Mr. Hill, an apparent one-nighter between Miss Deneuve and Mr. Hackman, a variety of lost souls who have come to the desert to forget their grubby pasts, a Legion assignment to protect Mr. Von Sydow as he excavates a priceless tomb, and the Arabs' indignation at these intruders and their grave-robbing. Although a few of these subplots may have a romantic ring to them, the movie's general tone is as hard-boiled as its title.Blood is shed messily and often, and many vignettes are designed to illustrate what a he-man a true legionnaire must be. One particular episode, which culminates in a weakling legionnaire's suicide after the others find out he has been impotent with a whore, is aimed strictly at the sort of filmgoer who eats carpet tacks for breakfast.""March Or Die"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), and for good reason; it contains some extremely gruesome scenes of mutilation that may well bother small children.",1977-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,In Love With Severity,"TEN years ago, J. V. Cunningham described himself as a renegade Irish Catholic from the plains of Montana, upper lower class, a onetime scholar in Latin and in the English Renaissance. Twentyfive years ago, he called himself simply a Catholic bx tradition, training, and deep feeling. Further back still, he wrote a poem, Timor Dei,  to reflect upon lost beatitude and the still untranscended fear of God. I have no special information on these matters, apart from reasonable inferences culled from Cunningham's poems and essays. Evidence drawn from those sources would suggest that Cunningham rejected Catholicism because in this time it had lapsed from an original severity. Most people who abandon their Catholicism give it up because it is too hard, its morality is too strict. I suspect that this was not Cunningham's reason, but that he ceased to regard a church which no longer took seriously and strictly the Summa of Aquinas. Cunningham, a passionate man, maintains an intellectual life which is chiefly animated by the scruple attendant upon reason, mind, and truth. He loves severity of mind as other people love indulgence of body.",1977-08-07T05:00:00+0000

His hero, a professor of drawing and physical education at the pedagogical institute in K. (probably Karlovy Vary) thus transcends the grubbing, beerswilling, backstabbing, cornercutting earthly pursuits of his fellow Czechs, attaining, for a few moments, angelic purity. This is Kohout's parable for the Prague spring of 1968with Adam Juracek as a kind of anagram for Alexander Dubcek who, in a flight of transcendentalism, proclaimed that as head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia he would attempt to create socialism with a human face.

During the last year or so, the cost of living has gone up for Hungarians and, so far as hotel rates and prices in better restaurants are concerned, even more for tourists. But the atmosphere of what Khrushchev called goulash communism lingers. Soviet officials rejoice when they get an assignment to Budapest. Polish and Czech travelers, mostly in big groups, irk their Hungarian hosts by buying as much salami as they can get to take home. Eastbloc cynics call Hungary the merriest barracks in the Soviet camp, an epithet particularly true of Budapest. United States visitorsincluding those of Hungarian descent who left in the tragic days of the 1956 uprisingand their dollars are made welcome. More than 20 years after the antiCommunist rebellion that Soviet tanks crushed, the inhabitants of Budapest appear to have adjusted, some sullenly, some pragmatically, to a situation they know they can't change. Although the secret police are still around, they seem to avoid bothering people unnecessarily. With a population exceeding two million and growing, the Queen of the Danube has a mottled face: crumbling 80yearold apartment houses with crumbling wooden corsets beside entrances to a gleaming new subway and lavish marble underpasses.",1977-08-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Sandakan 8,' Japanese Film: Girl's Sold Into Prostitution","""Sandakan 8"" is a Japanese film about prostitution, narrated from what is supposed to be a feminist point of view. However feminism, in this case, only means interjecting a particularly noxious form of man-hating where the pornographic touches ordinarily might be.The film doesn't dwell on sex unnecessarily, but it's plenty lurid just the same, in a disturbingly neo-Victorian way. This kind of treatment can't pass for enlightened, not by any stretch of the imagination. It's just plain reactionary.The story is told by a saccharine middle-class woman, a feminist historian of sorts, who encounters Osaki, a former karayuki-san, a term for girls who were sold into prostitution early in the century and then shipped out to colonies all over the Pacific. Osaki, now impoverished and nearly 70, invites the historian to her hovel, where the younger woman begins behaving like Little Miss Muffet, cringing prettily at the worms in the bath water.The historian just barely manages to stifle her revulsion until the old lady decides to tell her story, which turns out not to have been worth waiting for. Sample pearl: ""Don't fall in love, no matter what. When you're in love, you're blind.""Osaki's tale, told in flashback, repeatedly illustrates what loathsome brutes men are, and the historian, in a series of senseless cuts to the present, keeps on nodding sympathetically. Along the way, there is also some mention of Japanese imperialism, and of the homeland's hypocrisy in shunning the karayuki-san when they tried to return from the colonies. But most of the film, which is artlessly shot and acted in an exaggerated, melodramatic style, concentrates on proving that there really is a fate worse than death.Yoko Takahashi and Kinuyo Tanaka, two lovely actresses who play Osaki as a young girl and an old woman, have some impressive moments, on those few occasions when Kei Kumai's direction allows for any subtlety. As the historian, Komaki Kurihara wears an impenetrably pasty smile and does more harm than good. Osaki's story might have retained some of its integrity had it not been set in flashback; this way, too many present-day ironies are allowed to interrupt it, trivialize it and blunt its power.",1977-08-08T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Satan's Brew' Is Cold and Bitter,"IF YOU HAVE any doubt that there's such a thing as being too prolific, by all means go see Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ""Satan's Brew."" Mr. Fassbinder attempting physical, almost slapstick comedy, is Mr. Fassbinder at his least funny or enlightening; and the film, a kind of ""Father Knows Best"" on acid, showcases most of the director's worst qualities without leaving room for his best. Made in Germany early last year, this is an ice-cold work, and a stubborn and difficult one. The meager rewards it delivers are no match for the enormous energy it demands.Beginning and ending with a quotation from the French avant-gardist Antonin Artaud, to the effect that thinking from a non-human point of view is a way of maintaining contact with the gods, ""Satan's Brew"" operates as something of a sicko sit-com, with a set of domestic characters nonchalantly acting out their most bestial impulses.Walter Kranz (Kurt Raab) is a beleaguered poet with a hefty wife who complains loudly about their non-existent sex life and a brother whose hobbies are exposing himself and collecting dead flies.The menagerie also includes a duplicitous whore and a bug-eyed, warty mistress (played through heavy makeup by the usually stunning Margit Carstensen). Kranz himself is hard at work pretending he is Stefan George, a German poet favored by the Nazis, and writing a new opus, to be entitled ""No Ceremony For The Fhrer's Dead Dog.""Mr. Fassbinder can be both ironic and provocative when, as in ""Mother Kusters Goes To Heaven,"" his only successful comedy, he gently contrasts people's manners with their desires. But in ""Satan's Brew"" his blunt directorial style merely exaggerates the coarseness of his characters, and his humor turns stolid and didactic. There are, for instance, a great many ponderous lessons here about the relationship between sex and money: a woman in kinky purple underwear goes into ecstasies while writing a check (at this point, her lover serenely shoots her), and the brother who collects flies tries to use them as both erotic offerings and as currency.Mr. Fassbinder also pokes fun at a wide range of perversions: one character, a masochist, has scrambled egg spat onto her face and happily lets it dry there. Also, there are repeated digs at the German national temperament, including several references to anti-Semitism and someone's scornful appraisal of death as ""the fate of the weak."" It's hard to be sure where Mr. Fassbinder stands on these or any other issues, because the film's plot is unintelligible and its directorial vantage point is somewhere off in the ozone. For all its brutishness, though, ""Satan's Brew"" is finally not vulgar enough. The film's premise calls for both precision and abandon and, while an exaggerated, reference-laden meticulousness is Mr. Fassbinder's specialty, he seems incapable of doing anything very freely. His characters follow their animal instincts, but they do so in such a careful way they might as well be trained seals. None of them flouts convention with the kind of spontaneity or enthusiasm that might have lent real wit to the film's bloodless, brittle scheme.",1977-08-10T05:00:00+0000

us,'Kentucky Fried' A Yolky Film,"ANYONE interested in the condition of humor and wit in the United States stands likely to come away depressed from ""The Kentucky Fried Movie,"" which opened yesterday at the Eastside Cinema. The first film of the Kentucky Fried Theater, a comedy group that traces its origins to the University of Wisconsin six years ago, ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" is in the tradition of ""The Groove Tube"" and ""Tunnelvision."" The range of its satire and comedy, as displayed in 22 segments running from a minute or two up to 30 minutes, is fairly narrow.Television is both an inspiration and a preoccupation, with commercials, news shows, early morning talk-news shows, talk shows and 50's-style courtroom dramas all serving as targets.Movies come next. ""Cleopatra Schwartz,"" dealing with the love of a black superwoman and a Hasidic rabbi, is this movie's comment on black exploitation films.Disaster movies, soft-core pornographic movies and martial-arts films are also the focus of a mordancy that gives the impressionparticularly in the 30-minute martial-arts segmentof being undercut by the maker's affection for the original genre. Sex records and charity appeals are also inspirations for efforts at humor in this 86-minute film, which seems at least twice as long.Reportedly made on a budget of about $1 million, ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"" is a good-looking production well performed by a large cast that includes Donald Sutherland, Henry Gibson and George Lazenby in brief appearances.Television is at once this movie's nourishment and onus. The caliber of television wit and humor has never been uniformly high, and comedy derived from it is likely to have difficulty surmounting such humble origins. It is little wonder, then, that ""The Kentucky Fried Movie,"" being freed from the restraints of television, though not from its inherent defects, occasionally descends into juvenile tastelessness (a dignified woman using four - letter words; a board game built around the assassination of President Kennedy; a charity appeal involving a child's corpse).Other episodes, such as the one involving a television newscaster Suddenly aware that he can see into the room of a lovemaking couple, last so long that the joke is dissipated by boredom; and in this case crosses the line from humor to an exercise in prurience.Lots of people will probably like ""The Kentucky Fried Movie,"" just as they like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's hamburgers. But popularity is still no reason for deifying mediocrity.",1977-08-11T05:00:00+0000

The rest of the time, Miss Foster loafs around in blue jeans, plays with her hamster, and falls so desperately in love that, when things go wrong, she can barely touch her dinner, which consists of a burger and a shake.The story, set in the obligatory New England hamlet, involves Martin Sheen as a vicious child-molester who sees in Miss Foster the things that movie audiences have been seeing in her for the last few years, and Alexis Smith, as Mr. Sheen's wicked mother. Miss Smith plays the town real estate agent and, because she wears a Valentino wardrobe and drives a Bentley, it must be quite a town.In any case, Miss Smith has rented a house to Miss Foster and her father, a Very Famous Poet who hasn't been heard from since. Every time Miss Smith drops by to make trouble, Miss Foster announces that her father is out of town or says he is working in his study and can't be disturbed. Hah!Though Mr. Sheen does a chillingly effective turn as the psycho, and Miss Smith an unduly nasty one as his mother, the film's real source of energy is Miss Foster's bout of puppy love with Scott Jacoby, who brings freshness and ingenuity to a humdrum role. The affair blossoms, and then some: the pair begins sleeping together, and Miss Foster is called to murmur sweet nothings like ""I never knew how much I needed you.""Fortunately, there's more to it than that: they also share an easy camaraderie and a number of genial, even heart-warming moments. Nicolas Gessner's direction has a correspondingly comfortable feel, but this type of story is as old as the hillsno, olderand Mr. Gessner doesn't do much to make it plausible.Filmgoers with short attention spans may find themselves wondering not where Miss Foster has been stashing all the adults in her life but, rather, why she is wearing a stiff and obvious-looking wig.""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), because of a few bloody closeups of a corpse and because of the terrible things Mr. Sheen does to a stuffed facsimile of Miss Foster's hamster.",1977-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Another 8,000 will come from camps in Thailand over the next 16 months. America's moral duty was so clear that the predicted Congressional opposition failed to materialize. But Representative Eilberg of Pennsylvania is still pressing restrictive legislation, which we hope the Administration will resist. The new program will hardly begin to solve the problem. About 1,500 Indochinese refugees are still fleeing their countries each month. There already are more than 80,000 in camps in Thailand and thousands of others have been given temporary asylum in Asian countries, Canada; Australia and Europe. But when the United States virtually closed its doors in January, after admitting about 150,000 in 1975 and 1976, other nations began to deny even temporary haven and only France continued to take substantial numbers.

us,"'Suspiria,' a Specialty Movie, Drips With Gore","Right from the start, it's clear that the Italian-made, English-language ""Suspiria"" is a specialty item: The opening credits show the title of the movie carved out of pulsating glands. Writer-director Dario Argento has an unusually horrific slant on life, to say the very least, and his film's most powerful moments have a way of making one think about open-heart surgery. But ""Suspiria,"" which opened yesterday at the Criterion Theater, does have its slender charms, though they will most assuredly be lost on viewers who are squeamish.The plot, as transparent as the pane of glass that slices up the movie's first victim, is intentionally ridiculous, and Mr. Argento's direction has the mocking, stylized simplicity of a comic strip. A strange, pouty girl named Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at a German ballet academy, and within minutes a monster is whittling away at her classmates. Nobody will level with Susy about what's going on and, in general, the students' compassion for one another leaves a lot to be desired. ""Poor David,"" remarks one, ""torn to pieces. Incredible!""The headmistress, played primly by Joan Bennett, is no help either. Though she puts up a great show of gentility in public, she secretly shrieks things like ""She must die, die, die!""The film's ostensible highlights include a bat on the rampage, a plague of white worms, ""Tubular Bells""-type music by a group called The Goblins, and a great many graphic tips on how to carve one's fellows into rib roast.However, Mr. Argento's methods make potentially stomach-turning material more interesting than it ought to be. Shooting on bold, very fake-looking sets, he uses bright primary colors and stark lines to create a campy, surreal atmosphere, and his distorted camera angles and crazy lighting turn out to be much more memorable than the carnage.""Suspiria"" is really quite funny, during those isolated interludes when nobody is bleeding.",1977-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,Italian Film About Sex Isn't Much,"The hero of ""The Sensual Man"" is crazy about women, and women are crazy about him, too. Right from the moment when Paolo (Giancarlo Giannini), then the barely adolescent scion of a Sicilian noble family, begins fooling around with the maid, his life becomes a hectic one. There are a tempestuous blonde, a rich Roman brunette with a lot of modern furniture, and a stern lady Communust who, rather inexplicably, wears black lace garters.There are the fresh-faced girl at the chemist's and the countess with the yelowish teeth. There is the pretty nurse at whom Paolo, always at the ready, makes a pass, even though the nurse is busy ministering to his dying father. There is even, very nearly, Paolo's unusually nubile Mama.The only problem is that ""The Sensual Man"" isn't a comedy, at least not intentionally. Instead, this is meant to be the long, sad story of Paolo's congenital inability to control his carnal passions (by way of an explanation, it seems it'sh ereditary; his uncle and grandfather were ladykillers, too). The tale culminates in Paolo's failure to stay married to the only woman he truly loves, a sweet young thing 20 years his junior, a creature so untainted that the very notion of sex makes her burst out crying.There isn't much of a lesson to be learned from ""The Sensual Man,"" and there isn't much to watch here, either. Marco Vicario's direction is stultifyingly banal; he favors dark rooms overdecorated with antique furniture, romantic strolls through the autumn leaves and swelling strings each time the billing and cooing begin.Giancarlo Giannini has played characters like Paolo too often to attack the role with much energy, even though he is this time confronted with an unusual difficulty. Even in 1974, when ""The Sensual Man"" was made in Italy, Mr. Giannini looked substantially older than the rapscalllion of 25 he is supposed, at least during the middle of the film, to be. As if that weren't bad enough, he also looks older than the actress who plays his mother.",1977-08-15T05:00:00+0000

So the Mayor has revised his proposal. He would now retain a lay board, but unsalaried, the members to serve at his pleasure. That is good idea. A less good idea is to have a professional chancellor manage the systemand also preside over the board. That would further obscure the central issue: how much powerand therefore responsibilitycan Mayor currently exercise over the school system and how much more does he, and should he, want? The question arises with such intensity not because it can be resolved before the election but because Mr. Beame wishes to dramatize his alleged impotence in education over the past four years. Yet he has budget power, and more, as he demonstrated in decapitating the equally independent Health and Hospitals Corporation. The public's influence over a clearly unsatisfactory school system might well be increased if elected officials bore more visible responsibility for it. But there is also sound tradition in American education for lay boards of education to uphold educational values against public officials, unions and other power centers. These considerations need to be balanced in a new structure by a new state law. The matter is Dressing but best left till after the election.",1977-08-17T05:00:00+0000

The point of the voyage is to prove that the Sumerians, the ancient people of Iraq, could have traveled as far as southern Africa and India 5,000 years ago. The 62yearold Mr. Heyerdahl's reed craft, called the Tigris, will carry a crew of 14, most of them veterans of the Atlantic crossing on the Ra papyrus boat seven years ago.

Floating around in it are large chunks of ""The Exorcist""; costumes out of all those 30's and 40's movies in which gangsters affected dinner jackets and gleaming white starched shirtfronts; a soupcon of something called ""J.D.'s Revenge,"" a summer entertainment of recent if not remarkable vintage; and a pair of eyeballs afloat in liquidthe sort of preserves usually put up by the Hammer Films folks in England.What seems to be going on around the swamp-country drive-in movie theater operated by Miss Laurie and Mr. Whitman is a lot of supernatural carnage. It seems that Nicky (Sal Vecchio), the once and future lover of Ruby (Miss Laurie), a one-time chanteuse, starlet and gang moll, has risen from his watery grave to wreak some vengeance, on the underworld colleagues he holds responsible for his demise.From time to time, he manifests his presence through Jannit Baldwin, who plays his and Ruby's silent, protuberant-eyed daughter. To provide the straight-faced mumbo-jumbo intended to lend a scientific veneer to the proceedings, Roger Davis is called in to portray Dr. Keller, a parapsychologist.The makers of ""Ruby"" apparently believe that lots of gore, hints of incest and necrophilia, skeletal embraces and those preserved eyeballs are the stuff of which adequate horror films are made.

Chances are that only a minuscule portion of the audience has seen the film in question, and those who wonder about it at all are likely to assume it to be a particularly fine example of the sort of cartoon that used to be a regular pan of Saturday afternoons at the movies.A worthwhile chance to correct that impression is now at hand in the form of a collection of 18 extraordinary animated short films grouped together under the title ""Fantastic Animation Festival.""The show, which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is a long onean hour and 47 minutesbut a good one. The worst than can be said of it is that it may be too much of a good thing, a feast of excellence that probably would be more savory could it be partaken of a little at a time rather than all at once.That cavil recorded, it should be said immediately that here at once is an opportunity to examine the state of a sophisticated art that gives to the imagination wings denied to conventional film makers. Animation offers not only a medium for telling stories, for making points about human nature and society, for speaking in metaphor and wit; it offers freedom from the bonds of literal photographic image. In animation anything is possiblejourneys far into space or deep into the mind; instantaneous transformations of the mundaneand ""Fantastic Animation Festival"" displays much of the range of these possibilities.Not all of these shorts are likely to appeal equally to everyone, but everyone is likely to find something to admire, from the drama and nostalgia of the 1941 ""Superman vs. the Mechanical Monsters"" to the succinct wit of ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" to the commentaries and humor of ""Icarus,"" ""Mountain Music,"" ""The Last Cartoon Man,"" ""Room and Board"" and ""Closed Mondays,"" an Academy Award-winner, to the sophisticated technique and evocations of ""French Windows,"" ""Light"" and the eerie and enigmatic ""Nightbird.""The PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested"") rating is probably attributable to a couple of swift depictions of the nude female body, bare female breasts and the use of the words ""crap"" and ""hell.""",1977-08-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Bunuel's Line,"""THE ILLUSION Travels by Streetcar,"" the third Mexican Luis Buuel film of the early 50's to have its American premiere at the Jean Renoir Cinema, is simultaneously the most characteristic and the most uneven of the lot. Satirical, at times almost allegorical, and full of surreal touches, it is also at times ponderous and rambling. It begins, for instance, with a somber and preachy voice-over, to the effect that life is full of small but meaningful stories and that what follows will be one of them.From there, it details the adventures of a pair of transit workers who have lovingly repaired a ramshackle old trolley, only to learn that the streetcar company has decided the car is obsolete. The two get drunk that night and steal the trolley, piloting it around Mexico City until they can safely return it the following evening.They have no set course in mind, but the car is commandeered over and over again by peculiar bands of people. An impatient schoolteacher loads her children onto the car, and soon anarchy reigns; a group of wealthy businessmen climb on board and are shocked and irritated by the crew's refusal to collect fares. In another, shabbier part of town, peasant women decide that anyone who won't take money is probably a thief.On board the trolley, the mood is deadpan and decidedly strange. A butcher climbs on and calmly sets up shop, carving meat and hanging up carcasses. Two women carrying a plaster saint wander along in the middle of the night, on their way to church to have the saint blessed??? it seems this noctu???nal urge strikes them regularly, the way the craving for chip dip affects others.This behavior is never made to seem grotesque; in fact, it hardly seems out of the ordinary. At its best, the film inhabits a cool, only slightly distorted fantasy world that has its own eccentric rules of decorum.The film ach???eves this tone effortlessly much of the time, but occasionally it strains, as when a neighborhood party includes a little morality play that casts the trainmen as God and the Devil. Occasionally it meanders??? too, and the trolley conceit begins to wear thin.But its best moments combine inspired whimsy with tight control, and make it eminently recommendable to anyone even remotely interested in Buuel's oeuvre and its evolution.",1977-08-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Bad News Bears' Make Comeback In an Effort to Go On to Japan,"Even without Walter Matthau and Tatum O'Neal, who were the stars of ""The Bad News Bears,"" there is apparently no stopping, or even slowing down, that team of pint-sized California baseball players in their spin-off movie, titled, for no particular reason except that it has a nice ring to it, ""The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training.""The film, which opened at the Forum and other theaters yesterday, is as American as Budweiser beer, Coca-Cola, Hilton Hotels and the Houston Astrodome, all of which receive such prominent plugs it seems as if the film's subsidiary purpose is to keep capitalism afloat. In this respect the film may simply be pursuing accuracy. We live in a time when it's impossible to carry on a lengthy conversation without mentioning a noun that isn't also a trademarked name.""The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training"" is manufactured comedy of a slick order, depending Almost entirely for its effects on the sight and sound of a bunch of kids behaving as if they were small adults. It's a formula that worked for Our Gang Comedy for many years, and works again here with a bright screenplay by Paul Brickman, based on Bill Lancaster's original characters, and direction of intelligent lightness by Michael Presman. He's the young man (now 26) who made a funny movie, ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase,"" out of a standard road picture earlier this year.What plot there is concerns the efforts of the Bears, whose ages run from 9 to 13 (though one or two look older), to get from California to Houston to play in the Astrodome, the winning team then to go on to play the Japanese champions. A critic is not allowed to tell you who wins the Houston game, but it's general knowledge that the next Bears film will be called something on the order of ""The Bad News Bears in Tokyo."" The story of a film such as this isn't anywhere near as important as the number of variations that the moviemakers can successfully work on a severely limited number of jokes. Mr. Pressman and Mr. Brickman do well, considering that there are only so many ways that a baseball team can be made to look like losers in order to make a succesful comeback in the final sequence.They are helped by some excellent actors, including Jackie Earle Haley who, just a couple of years ago, was the brat Donald Sutherland stomped to death in ""The Day of the Locust"" and who now looks almost 18, but is an actor of real potential. William Devane is absolutely straight as young Haley's long-lost father, the man who coaches the young pirates to victory.Some of the other Bears who are very funny are Chris Barnes, who appears to be smaller than Tom Thumb and who, like so many kids who are disadvantaged in height, is ready to fight at the merest slight; Erin Blunt, as the teams' black kid, and Jaime O. Escobedo and George Gonzales as the team's two Mexican-Americans.""The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), seeks (and finds) a number of laughs by having its young actors use vulgar four-letter words with the pounding enthusiasm of children who've just learned to speak pig-Latin.",1977-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The World's Most Splendid Existing Classical Theater,"Japan's Kabuki is by knowledgeable consensus the world's most splendid classical theater still existing in more or less pristine authenticity. The golden dramas of ancient Greece, Sanskrit India and even Elizabethan Shakespeare have been preserved as texts, but staging methods have vanished into history. For example, men no longer perform women's roles legitimately. Original accompanying music and dances, masks and costumes have pretty much disappeared into conjecture or reconstruction. And theater devices once used are inappropriate to modern times. In Japan, however, the hanamichi passageway, the revolving stage, the trap doors and lifts, and a score of other ingenious stage tricks that Kabuki invented on its own and in isolation from the rest of the world centuries ago are still integral to today's performances. After 1954 when Sol Hurok presented an allgirl troupe of Japanese dancers under the spurious guise of Azuma Kabuki, true Kabuki has since visited America at almost decennial intervals 1960, 1969 and now 1977. The inbetween time lapses have been just long enough for the uninitiated to forget what Kabuki is, for devotees to chafe for its return and for a new generation of curiosity seekers to develop.",1977-08-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Talk With Paul Scott,"Here and there in the hills of India, in towns like Ootacamund and Simla, where the air Is nicely cool and the gentle rains persuade roses to flourish, there are cottages set in careful English gardens. Through the long winters of the British reign, India was ruled from cities on the plains. But in summer, the English left the cities to the overwhelming heat, to dust and fat black flies and Indians, and moved to the temperate hills. Today, though there is no longer a season at Simla, no longer a summer whirl of ball gowns and fluttering fans and white jacketed Indians serving midnight suppers, the hill station cottages are not empty. They are home to the English who, in the phrase that was current as the reign was ending, stayed on. Independence, in 1947, caught them at the wrong moment, as it caught Tusker Smalley, the retired colonel who blusters his sad, funny way through Paul Scott's most recent novel. Like Tusker, they were too young to retire, too old and perhaps too frightened to piece together a new career at Home in England. Besides, many of them had been home on leave, and though they would never admit it aloud, those visits proved only that Home was neither as they remembered it nor as they had recreated it in the cantonments and civil lines of India. So, they have stayed on, going to the Club, discussing the servant problem, growing old. Each in his own small way helped to manage an empire. Now, there is nothing to do but the roses, and even those will be seen to by the gardener, provided there's enough slack in the pension to keep the garPaul Scott shares with Tusker Smalley a look of wearied but unmistakable Englishness. His suit, even his nose, is too large for him, as if there was a time when more of him was needed. At 57, he is not retired, and there can have been no time in his life that demanded more of him than have the last 10 years, during which he has produced five novels that encompass the decline and fall of the Jean G.

us,HONE CLINIC,"THE best way to perform a smooth job of handsanding on such flat surfaces as paneling, furniture, doors and wood trim is to use a wooden block as a backing pad and holder for the sandpaper. While there are commerciallymade sanding blocks or pads available, these are not part of everyone's tool kit, and all too often they are not quite the size desired. That is why it is often advisable to make your own. Simply cut scrap pieces of 2 by 4, 2 by 3 or similar lumber to the length needed, then fasten pieces of sandpaper to it by wrapping around the sides and securing with a staple gun as shown here. Driving the staples into the sides will keep them away from the sanding surface so there is no danger of scratching and a new piece can simply be stapled over the old one when it is needed. If a flexible backing is desired, staple a scrap piece of carpet to the block first, then wrap the sandpaper around the outside with the carpet on the underside.",1977-08-21T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'One on One' Scores for Fair Play,"HENRY STEELE (Robby Benson) is a high school basketball star who seems no more or less bright than his contemporaries but he is extremely ambitious. When, in the middle of his senior year, he is approached by university basketball scouts, Henry holds out for the best deal, which includes not only a four-year scholarship, private tutoring and various jobs to put money in his pocket, but also an automobile of his choice.That autumn, en route to the big West Coast university that has won Henry, the car of his choice starts to steam ominously. The car looks great but it's a lemon.This is pretty much the opinion that ""One on One,"" directed by Lamont Johnson (""The Last American Hero"") and written by Mr. Benson and his father, Jerry Segal, has of the high-pressure, big-business world of supposedly amateur university athletics.This is not the reason that ""One on One"" seems so decent and entertaining. The most money-grubbing movies often are insufferably high-minded about other people's ambition and money-grubbing. ""One on One"" ""never makes any of its points lightly but never is it smug, as if it had a franchise on truth, nor is it condescending to its characters.The Benson-Segal screenplay has an appreciation both for the formula of films of action (in this case, on the basketball court) and for characters of unexpected backbone. In Mr. Johnson, ""One on One"" also has a director whose best films have been concerned with competition as a dangerously important expression of American life.According to ""One on One,"" which opened at Loews State 2 and other theaters yesterday, a certain amount of competition is a healthy thingin politics as well as the fast-food businessbut the need to win at all costs is a perversion of a system that otherwise is never seriously questioned.""One on One"" is mostly about the modified awakening of Henry Steele. At first, Henry is nonplussed by the professional thoroughness of the university's athletic program but later he becomes its victim when he doesn't measure up. After he refuses to renounce voluntarily his scholarship, he elects to fight the system to become the basketball star they said he never would.In movies of mystery and suspense, predictability is fatal. In something like ""One on One,"" predictability has the effect of enriching our interest as we wait to see not what will happen but how it's brought about. A lot of the success of the ""how"" in ""One on One"" has to do with the performance by writer-actor Benson, whose clean-cut navet masks a surprising moral strength, which, even if it's not very common, is something we'd all like to believe in.Until her role becomes squeaky clean, Annette O'Toole is most winning as the beautiful, sharp-tongued young woman who is assigned to tutor the basketball star and stays on to fall in love with him. Gail Strickland is very funny as a coach's secretary, who likes to ravish her boss's players, and G.D. Spradlin is fine as her boss, a tough man who stands by the system, right or wrong.""One on One"" is the sort of pop movie that has too much music on the soundtrack and too much bright color in the photography, which, I suppose, is part of its style. Yet it also has some very good sequences that are not at all expected, including the smashing basketball game that concludes the film.""One on One,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language that you are as likely to hear outside a locker room as in one.",1977-08-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Garden' Offers Glimpses of Genius,"TO CONCLUDE its minifestival of heretofore unreleased films by the great Luis Buuel, the Renoir Cinema yesterday opened ""Death in the Garden"" (""La Mort en Ce Jardin""), a comparatively big-budget, color, Mexican-French co-production made in 1956.Like ""Fever Mounts at El Pao,"" a 1959 Mexican-French co-production that Buuel himself would like to forget. ""Death in the Garden"" is full of marvelous, uniquely Buuelian moments set in a melodramatic custard. It's not a film by which to be introduced to Buuel, but if you know and appreciate his work as I do, it's one of the few movies around that should not be missed.""Death in the Garden,"" set in the backwaters and the jungles of an unidentified South American dictatorship, is a large-scale narrative that takes on state, church, the military, society and the individual in such a way that you feel the director must have intended this primeval locale to be a kind of psychological mirror-image of the Franco Spain from which he exiled himself.Though the film's intellectual substructure is fascinating, the screenplay (by Buuel, Luis Alcoriza and Raymond Queneau) is so packed with incident that it's all that one can do to keep up with the plot, which is at war with reflection.Its principal characters are a beautiful hard-hearted whore (played by a very young Simone Signoret), a handsome, amoral young drifter (Georges Marchal), a well-meaning but ineffectual priest (Michel Piccoli, with all of his hair), an aging diamond miner (Charles Vanel) who dreams of opening a restaurant in Marseilles, and his pretty, mute daughter (Michele Girardon).Through one ruse and another, including a bloody but ineffectual rebellion, Buuel and his collaborators put the characters into the position of having to flee for their lives upstream and into the jungles. Nobody in the small party of fugitives either lives or dies by accident. Their fates are decided by a scheme that invites interpretation more than surprise.It's not the story, the performances or even the ideas (much more wittily and succinctly put in both earlier and later Buuel films), but the sudden moments in which a Buuel image or gesture comes shining through a haze of melodramatic conventions.There's an extraordinary moment when the body of a headless python, killed by the fugitives for their supper, suddenly seems to come alive again as it is attacked by an army of ants. That one image could be one entire movie. In another scene, Mr. Piccoli, the priest, recalls for no easily apparent reason a story about a fellow seminarian who once had a compulsion to eat poached eggs. In moments like this, one glimpses Buuel's appreciation for the act of disorder.At the time Buuel made ""Death in the Garden"" he had already produced such masterpieces as ""Los Olvidados,"" ""El"" and ""The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de La Cruz,"" and he was within four years of beginning his golden age that includes ""Viridiana,"" ""Simon of the Desert,"" ""Belle de Jour,"" ""Tristana"" and ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.""""Death in the Garden"" is a kind of halfway house for the film genius, made when he had yet to receive the acclaim that would give him full control of his movies, but after he had been taken seriously enough by the money men to be entrusted with an expensive movie with big stars.""Death in the Garden"" is a perfectly honorable compromise, but you won't see in it the simplicity and the clarity of technique and spirit that are so breathtaking in his best movies.A word about the film as it's being shown at the Renoir: It's a 16-mm print in which the color is not first-rate and many of the white subtitles, especially at the beginning, are virtually invisible.",1977-08-26T05:00:00+0000

The trouble. however, is that too often cheese is discarded when it becomes dry, or because pieces left from the cheese course have been ineptly cut and look unappetizing. Indeed, remnants of Camembert and Brie, once their fluent interiors slip away, do seem to lose all their charm.

You spot a free teammate off to one side, pass to him, run to him, take a return pass behind the defender, pass it back to your man as he comes running by. The motion is fluid, quick, sudden. One moment a serious attack threatens, in the next everyone is running backward, trying to catch up with a reversal of the play.

The shore runs another 30 miles or so, tacking and jibbing around Cape Ann and along the ragged edge of Ipswich Bay to Newburyport, a mellow little brick and clapboard city at the mouth of the Merrimack River. Old families, old money and the purest of Massachusetts accents prevail along the ?bore. More striking is the way its old seaports look much as they did in their heyday. For Ipswich it was the 17th and early 18th centuries, for Marblehead the decade just prior to the Revolution. Salem and Newburyport ships circled the globe in the Federal era and Gloucester schooners cornered local fisheries in the late 19th century. Wealthy BostoniansRichard Henry Dana, author of Two Years Before the Mast, is said to have been the firstbegan building summer houses in Manchester and Magnolia in the mid19th century. Up to the stock market crash of 1929 they continued to build ever more elaborate shingled, stone and brick mansions on Gloucester's Eastern Point and Marblehead Neck. A few of these ornate cottages have since been torn down, but an amazing percentage of the earlier, more modest homes survive, many of them occupied by commuting Boston bankers, brokers and lawyers descended from the original builders. If you've got ithold on to it is the prevailing attitude. Flaunting one's riches is considered neither sensible nor in good taste. Cadillacs are rare; jewels are kept in family vaults, and museums display only a fraction of their treasures.
