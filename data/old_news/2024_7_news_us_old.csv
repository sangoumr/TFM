After all, it’s a season centered around farmers’ market jewels that barely need polishing and weather that encourages languid gatherings. Lately, that sense of ease arrives in the form of chef-approved staples already dressed for the table. EAT Gohar, a new pantry suite from the home goods brand Gohar World, reads like an age-old shopping list: olive oil and tinned fish, chocolate and tea. “We partnered with the best small food producers we know, from Korea to Lebanon,” says the company’s co-founder, artist Laila Gohar. “It feels like a never-ending dinner party from around the world.” Cantabrian anchovies and Atlantic sardines with preserved lemon, sustainably sourced in collaboration with the tinned-fish brand Fishwife, come in giftable striped boxes. (Bring along a baguette in Gohar’s beribboned carrier.) And for “endless pitchers of iced tea,” Gohar and her sister Nadia offer a peppermint rose hip blend alongside citrus-spiked black tea by way of Seoul. Equally quenching is the elegant canned wine from Oona, a new label that counts chefs among its founding partners. Each release is presented with a meal’s worth of recipes, such as Natasha Pickowicz’s Eton mess, starring strawberries macerated in a barbera rosé from California’s central coast. Later this month, Oona will launch a skin-contact pinot gris for orange-wine heads. “I just went kayaking and we brought a case,” says Alexis DeBoschnek, another Oona founding partner and author of the cookbook “To the Last Bite,” noting the can’s versatility: suitable for a picnic, a rooftop or cracked open for a houseguest fresh off the ferry.",2024-07-11T09:03:59+0000

From the South American asado to the Indian tandoor, the fires are varied but often the process that surrounds them is communal. Some use raging heat, searing cuts of meat or a tangle of vegetables on a planchas or iron grate, while others smoke or braise low and slow in underground ovens, tank-style barbecues or kitted-out Green Eggs. Anything can be grilled: stone fruit, pizzas, parcels of banana-leaf-wrapped fish, bouncy cubes of mochi. It’s not air-fryer easy. Yet the effort is well worth it, say the three chefs who share their favored methods and recipes below. “There’s a romance to it — the smell of fish oil burning, mixed with wood smoke,” says the chef Jeffrey Ozawa. “It doesn’t get better than that.”",2024-07-12T20:51:34+0000

Since the Ridge had “contactless check-in,” we had received two codes to get in the front entrance and our room. When we arrived after midnight, we had no problems getting into the hotel with the first code. But we couldn’t get into our room with the second code. There were no staff on duty, so we called the hotel’s number. But the woman who answered could not help and subsequent calls went to voice mail. I also sent messages through the Booking.com app, the online travel agency with which we made the reservation, but the staff there couldn’t solve the issue. So we spent the night in the hotel’s breakfast room, where the restroom also required a code that we did not have. The next morning, the hotel staff sent an apologetic message with the right code, and promised us a refund for that night, about $215. But we never got the money, even though the hotel insists they returned it to Booking. Can you help? Roberta, Boise, Idaho",2024-07-18T09:01:53+0000

But it is perhaps better understood as a fantasy comedy because not only does it break with history, it breaks with reality: It is Tudor palace intrigue with shape-shifting, a joyful and breathless more-more-more. A lot of “Jane” adheres, happily, to genre conventions, but it is done with a well-pitched playfulness.

Also up: a history of reality TV, a novel about an emergency room worker and a quicksilver collection of essays about reading and other pursuits by the Book Review’s poetry columnist, Elisa Gabbert.

Arp had helped found the radical Dada art movement in Zurich in 1916 and went on to become a leading Surrealist, but by this stage of his career, he was most preoccupied with the forms of the natural world — a fascination that he recognized in Ptolemy’s work. Some years later, back at the artist’s studio just outside of Paris, this discovery would inform Arp’s “Ptolémée” series of abstract sculptures, including “Ptolémée II” (1958), a roughly three-foot-tall biomorphic bronze that is widely considered to be among his masterworks. If Ptolemy hoped to reveal the contours of the universe in maps and treatises, Arp, who died in 1966 at 79, sought to render them in solid, three-dimensional form.",2024-07-18T20:48:51+0000

In “The Fabelmans,” Steven Spielberg’s youthful stand-in becomes obsessed with looking at the world through a camera lens, and the film functions almost as an apology for a lifetime of always inserting the camera between himself and the world. “Roma” recreates Alfonso Cuarón’s Mexico City in the 1970s; “The Souvenir” recreates Joanna Hogg’s northern England in the 1980s; “The Cathedral” recreates Ricky D’Ambrose’s American suburbs in the 1990s.

The property’s restaurant offers three seafood-heavy, Mediterranean-inspired tasting menus, while a private cinema room can be reserved when the weather calls for some indoor time. Further east toward Cannes, in the commune of Mougins, Hôtel Le Mas Candille was recently redesigned by the architect and decorator Hugo Toro, whose hand-painted patterns appear on the curtains and carpets in the 46 rooms. Its Glow House spa has four treatment rooms, each with its own terrace, and a private swimming pool overlooking Provence. In Nice’s old town, Hôtel du Couvent opened last month within a 17th-century convent surrounded by two-and-a-half acres of gardens.

The federal court that granted his release did so on certain conditions. One of these was that he must not speak to the media.

Trifle Is the Dessert of the Summer.","In classic British fashion, the trifle — perhaps the most quintessentially English dessert — is an almost comical understatement, its name suggesting a light snack when the dish itself is an indulgent, multilayered, alcohol-soaked production. The moniker was more accurate in the 16th century, when it referred to a simple pudding made from clotted cream mixed with sugar and rosewater. But in the Victorian era, the trifle evolved into a more elaborate creation: leftover cake or biscuits piled into a generous, footed glass bowl, saturated with a fortified white wine known as “sack” and sandwiched between fresh fruit, custard, jelly (gelatin made from calves’ feet), syllabub (alcohol-infused whipped cream) and a precursor to modern-day sprinkles made from caraway seeds coated in colored sugar. According to the English food historian Ivan Day, while the exact origins of the confection are unknown, it likely evolved from an amalgamation of several desserts. “On an aristocratic table in 18th-century England you’d have a range of different sweets: biscuits, which they dipped into wineglasses, jellies, custards, syllabub and coated caraway seeds to freshen breath and aid with digestion,” he says. “Trifle became all those dishes mixed together in a bowl.”",2024-07-26T09:02:46+0000
