It was the Macedonian youth who did it. This did not come out of the blue: two days before, eight security men -- four Macedonian policemen from Bitola and four soldiers -- were killed by Albanian rebels. But these were not only Albanian shops. They were also Muslim Macedonian and Turkish. We are Macedonians too, of Islamic faith. All in all, our family lost three out of seven shops. The people who did this came back the next day, around lunchtime, and then thoroughly looted one of them. ",2001-06-01T05:00:00+0000
us,World Briefing | Europe: France: Job Hunters Increase,"In the latest sign that the buoyant French economy might be succumbing to slowing global growth, the number of people registered as seeking jobs rose in April by 5,000, to 2.3 million. The increase, the first in nine months, was evidence of spreading job cuts as French exports stall. Numerous companies in France, including the food giant Danone, the appliance maker Moulinex, and the British retailer Marks & Spencer, have announced layoffs in recent months. The announcements have so unsettled the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, that it is planning legislation to make it more expensive for companies to lay off workers.

It can be made for a whole fish, and often is. But at home you're probably better off with just two substantial fillets. It is usually sliced very thinly (a sharp slicing knife is essential) on the bias to reveal as much of the surface of the flesh as possible and then it can be served as an appetizer with a bit of salad and a slice of lemon or as an hors d'oeuvre, perhaps on wedges of toast. While this is a very simple process, the curing takes three days, so plan ahead. ",2001-06-01T05:00:00+0000

During WWII, while living in Iran, he assisted Allied Forces by helping repair a device to intercept secret messages transmitted by the Nazis.

General Butler. the troop ship was escorted by three destroyers and carried 6,000 GI's, it passed through submarine infested waters, and miraculously arrived in San Pedro, CA, on July 1st, 1944.

He lived in Los Angeles for two years before moving to New York where he lived for the remainder of his life. Always wanting to discover and expand his knowledge, Paul was a world traveler who spoke French fluently. He will be remembered as a hero, inventor, raconteur, world traveler, polyglot, punster, jewelry designer, entrepreneur and dancer.

She was a sixth generation descendant of Benjamin Vaughan, who settled in Hallowell in 1797, and whose father, Samuel, married Sarah Hallowell, daughter of Benjamin Hallowell, one of the original Kennebec Proprietors. Mrs. Gibson was born on February 27, 1918, in New York City, the daughter of Langdon Parker Marvin and Mary Vaughan Marvin, and grew up in New York, with summers spent at her mother's family's house in Hallowell, and Northeast Harbor, ME. She attended The Chapin School in New York and graduated in 1936 from St. Timothy's School in Stevenson, MD, and from Bennington College in Bennington, VT, in 1942. Musically talented, Mrs. Gibson played the bassoon with the National Orchestral Association and taught music in New York, among a variety of part-time jobs. In 1943 she joined the American Red Cross, and for the next two and a half years, during WWII, she and two other Red Cross volunteers drove a 10-wheel Clubmobile truck in England, throughout France, Luxembourg and Germany, and into Czechoslovakia. After the war, Mrs. Gibson returned to New York and pursued her life-long interests in music and in art, working at the Museum of Modern Art for several years. On November 15, 1947, she married George W. Gibson of Chestnut Hill, MA. Mrs. Gibson was a long-time member of the English Speaking Union, which her father had helped found, a Director of Scholarships, Inc., which provides special educational opportunities, and a Director of the Maternity Center, a philanthropic organization.

The area under cultivation is always increasing, and in the established beds I seem to give in to diverging urges -- to garden as intensively and organically as I can and to give more and more formality to the look of the beds themselves.

us,Asking Investor to Sell a Co-op Unit,"Q I have been a tenant in a Long Island City co-op for 20 years and was there when the building was converted. I was assembling the money to buy my apartment in 1998, when the sponsor sold all of his unsold units to an investor. I have since been trying to buy the apartment from the investor, but he refuses to sell it to me and does not give me any reasons. I even ordered an appraisal last December, to find out the market value of the apartment, and then offered to pay the appraised value. The investor says the appraisal is irrelevant and that he is not interested. What can I do to force the investor to at least quote me a price? . . .

us,"QUICK BITE/Hoboken; Where Mozzarella Is a Star, Not a Topping","John Amato, owner of Fiore's House of Quality in Hoboken, no longer gets riled when he sees the things people do to his mozzarella. ''Thirty years ago, I would've been shocked, but now I've seen everything,'' he said. ''They put mustard on it, even vinegar. You shouldn't do that because you don't want to alter its nutty, milky flavor.'' Nutty? Milky? If those adjectives never come to mind when you eat mozzarella, you've probably been eating too much of the low-grade stuff sprinkled over pizza. At Fiore's, the mozzarella ($6 a pound) is made fresh daily according to the recipe Alfonse Fiore used in 1913 when he founded the store. The process starts with whole-milk curd, which is paddled in boiling water for 20 to 30 minutes until it reaches a taffylike consistency. Cook it too long and the cheese will be rubbery; too short, and it will be bitter. How does he know when it's done? ''It's all in the feel of your hand,'' he said. Mr. Amato remembers delivering to Frank Sinatra's mother on Hudson Street. Shipments continued to the Sinatra home in Palm Springs until about a decade ago. Instead of topping mozzarella with mustard or vinegar, try it plain, with a little extra virgin olive oil, or with tomatoes and basil. Or come on Thursdays and Saturdays and order the daily special: a roast beef sandwich with fresh mozzarella ($7.20; $3.20 for a half sandwich). But come early, because lines have been known to stretch out the door. GRETCHEN KURTZ",2001-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Yesterday Mr. McCain reiterated his intention to remain a Republican amid reports that he is being pressed by some supporters to bolt the party and run for president in 2004.

An F.B.I. report found that the number of serious crimes in 2000 was nearly identical to that in 1999. The question is whether this marks a leveling off or, maybe, the start of a new upturn in crime.

Justice Bonnie Wittner of State Supreme Court in Manhattan contended that bail posted by a stranger would not ensure Mr. Baker's return to court. But yesterday, Justice Brenda Soloff ruled that nothing in state law prevented the aid of strangers and that Mr. Baker could be freed once bail was officially posted. Katherine E.

The ruling by Judge Neal P. McCurn of Federal District Court here was the first substantive action in years for a case that has sputtered along since the Mohawks filed their claim in the early 1980's, contending that state and local governments had illegally seized Indian lands 200 years ago. The Justice Department joined the case on the side of the Mohawks in 1998. In 1999, the state argued that the case should be dismissed outright because it had sovereign immunity. But Judge McCurn rejected that contention, saying that the state did not have immunity against the federal government. David W. Chen (NYT)",2001-06-06T05:00:00+0000

Mr. Lalli and The News, separately, confirmed the resignation yesterday. People at The News, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Lalli, who took over the Sunday editor's job on March 15, had clashed with some of the senior editors at the newspaper over resources and the editorial direction of the Sunday paper. Reached at his home yesterday, Mr. Lalli said: ''I've decided to move on. I've spent a lot of years in magazines. I've spent some years in newspapers. And this experience at The News has convinced me that I'm really a magazine person. I've got an idea for a magazine and I'm going to devote 100 percent of my time to developing that idea.'' Ken Frydman, a spokesman for The Daily News, confirmed last evening that Mr. Lalli had resigned, but denied that there was any friction between the outgoing Sunday editor and his colleagues. ''He's very well thought of and very well respected as an editor and a journalist,'' Mr. Frydman said. Mr. Lalli came to The News as it -- and the entire newspaper industry -- was being buffeted by the sharpest advertising downturn in a decade. Last month The News laid off several reporters. His outspoken style in meetings, two people at The News said, grated on some of his colleagues. Mr. Lalli was the editor of George Magazine when it was closed by Hachette Filipacchi in January.

And when they come, they seem to arrive in bunches like nosegays. The latest and most striking example is the staggering plan to produce sequels to ''The Chronicles of Narnia,'' C. S.

A beloved partner in the New York office of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison LLP, died Monday at the age of 46 after a battle with cancer. Jerry specialized in tax matters involving all aspects of technology and emerging growth companies. He advised clients on tax aspects of complex joint ventures, partnerships, M&A deals, corporate finance and other issues. A partner at Brobeck since 1999, Jerry was well known in the New York legal community, and authored a column on eFinance in the ''New York Law Journal'' since 1993. He also was a frequent lecturer having presented seminars on a variety of topics such as New York Limited Liability Company Law, Advising Growth and Start-up Business, and Tax Aspects of Real Estate Bankruptcy. ''Jerry was a warm, caring person and extremely talented lawyer. He fought his battle with cancer with courage and dignity that inspired us all and made us proud that he was part of our firm. We will miss him greatly'', said Ken King, Managing Partner of Brobeck's New York office. ''In every way Jerry epitomized what it means to be a Brobeck partner'', said James E. Burns, Jr., Brobeck's Managing Partner. ''He made this law firm a better place from the day he arrived, and his passing has left us with a sense of gratitude that we had the opportunity to call him one of our own.'' Jerry was born on September 7, 1954, in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Prior to joining Brobeck, he was a partner at the law firm of Brown Raysman Millstein Felder & Steiner LLP. He earned his J.D., cum laude, from Seton Hall University in 1983, and an L.L.M. in taxation from New York University Law School in 1987. He earned his B.A., cum laude, from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1976. While Jerry was an extremely accomplished lawyer, his colleagues remember him as a dear friend. ''Jerry was a wonderful person in every respect, and he had the important things in life figured out,'' said Chris Johnson, one of his partners at Brobeck. ''He was devoted to his family. He had an effusive passion for living. He listened to problems with sensitivity and empathy, but also had a side-splitting sense of humor. He was charming. He was a moral person who tried always to do the 'right thing.' Most people are lucky to have one of these qualities. Jerry had all of them.'' A Brobeck associate, John Tolpa, had similar memories: ''No matter how busy we were, Jerry always made himself available whenever I wanted to talk. He was interested in getting to know me not only as a working colleague but as a person and friend.'' Not only was Jerry an attorney of great practical business ability, but also one of tremendous integrity and decency. He was a true friend in every respect to his colleagues at Brobeck. All of our lives have been enriched by his cheerful presence.'' said Eric Simonson, another one of his partners at Brobeck. In his spare time, Jerry was an avid participant in motorcycle racing, and also enjoyed golf, working on various home improvement projects, and most importantly, spending time with his family. Jerry was well known within and without Brobeck for his sensitivity and humor. He took particular pleasure in mentoring associates thoroughly and helping his clients navigate the rough waters of rapid growth. Jerry is survived by his wife Anna, children Lauren, Aidan and Garrett and his sisters Peggy Chaplin and Veronica Gunnerson. In Jerry's honor, donations may be made to The Gerard R.

us,World Business Briefing | Asia: Thailand: Rate Increase,"Thailand's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to 2.5 percent from 1.5 percent, pressing ahead with plans to defend the nation's swooning currency, the baht, by making it less cost-effective for Thai companies to borrow money at home to pay off their loans overseas. Economists and financial analysts are nearly unanimous in their disapproval of the new monetary policy, adopted after Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra replaced the country's central banker last week. Most say higher interest rates could squelch the economic recovery by raising borrowing costs for companies, shrinking margins at struggling banks and making Thai exports more expensive overseas. But financial markets confounded the doomsayers, with the baht strengthening and bank stocks rising. Wayne Arnold (NYT)",2001-06-09T05:00:00+0000

They have felt that way since their son was 2 1/2 years old, when they saw him physically disintegrate in a matter of minutes after someone at a party fed him something that contained yogurt. Carl and Amy already knew Eric was somewhat allergic, because they had previously seen him respond to milk with wheezing and itching. Still, they weren't prepared for this: in the driveway, on the way to the car, he staggered, retching violently, and his face grew swollen. By the time they were in the car and on their way to the emergency room, they could tell from his gasping that his throat was closing up. ''You'd know that sound if you heard it,'' says Carl, a soft-spoken, precise man who then demonstrates: out of his mouth comes a noise like a sob, rasping and strained. Although he is a doctor, a research immunologist, in fact, he says he felt an unprecedented panic as he reached into the glove compartment for the syringe of adrenaline that was there in case of such a reaction. ''There probably isn't a part of the anatomy that I haven't injected a needle into,'' he says.

us,Style: Weekend; Footnotes: After the Falls,"Visiting the waterfalls that dot the landscape of upstate New York is scenic enough, but the real wonders along the Interstate are entirely man-made. Lake Luzerne, about 20 miles north of Saratoga Springs, is an ideal starting point. After enjoying the views at Rockwell Falls, cruise a few miles west to Speculator (population: 625) for a glimpse of Austin Falls. There's more to do in bustling Lake George than listen to the roar of Shelving Rock Falls. You can load up on CorningWare at the factory outlet mall, or while away an afternoon in ''The Amazing Room of Rats'' at the House of Frankenstein Wax Museum. More curiosities abound at the nearby Magic Forest amusement park: the world's tallest Uncle Sam (36 feet) and Rex, the diving horse. Driving farther into the Adirondacks, you will stumble upon Beaver Meadows Falls and Rainbow Falls in St. Huberts. Around Keene Valley, the falls (Deer Brook and Mossy Cascade) take second billing to the Noon Mark Diner, with its 25 different kinds of homemade pie. Crossing west into Saranac Lake, you'll see no falling water, but Mountain Mist Custard has been a soft-serve institution for 50 years. Polish off your blackberry custard before popping by the Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial Cottage, where on display are the author's Scottish smoking jacket and yachting cap. As you slip south of the Adirondacks and into the Finger Lakes region, make pit stops in Rome for a tour of the cheese museum and Oneida, the former home of the Oneida Community, a utopian group and the creators of Oneida tableware. In Watkins Glen, visit Hector Falls and then tour what must be the Nascar capital of the North, complete with an international race course, where speed enthusiasts (with a valid license) can learn to drive at a branch of the Skip Barber Racing School. (Skip Barber alumni include Jerry Seinfeld and Tom Cruise.) By the time you've taken in all the waterfalls surrounding Ithaca, you'll be spent. In town, you can barter with the city's own currency. But you'll have to use greenbacks for a vegetarian meal at the Moosewood Restaurant and enough gas to motor home in your new Chrysler PT convertible. Maura Egan",2001-06-10T05:00:00+0000

The specialty is grilled wraps with a choice of trimmings that include mozzarella, provolone, onions, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, avocado, tomatoes, red peppers, eggplant, zucchini, olives and sun-dried tomatoes. To wash them down, Mrs. Catania recommends her ''not-run-of-the-mill coffee.'' (There are coffee beans for sale, too.) The menu also includes homemade soups, hot pasta, cold pasta salads, plus, for breakfast, scones, bagels, crumb cake, waffles and omelets. The European touch comes with the ambience: patrons reading newspapers (for sale at a front-door rack), or magazines (available at the entrance) at six tables on the corner of Main Street and Parker Avenue, as they bite into their sandwiches or sip their coffee, within ear-and eye-shot of the George Washington Bridge.

us,And Still Living,"''A painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers or even clouds. I should like to be the Saint Francis of still life,'' Edward Manet remarked in 1875. Such reverence for tabletop arrangements of edible and decorative objects might sound odd coming from the French painter who repeatedly scandalized the art world with his confrontational portraits of prostitutes and such. Yet the art historian George Mauner persuasively argues in MANET: The Still-Life Paintings (Abrams, $39.95) that the germ of his revolutionary thinking can be located in his potent and sensuously painted images of oysters, peonies, and dead rabbits. Long considered an inferior genre to history painting by the French academy, still lifes accounts for some 20 percent of Manet's output and also appear as central elements in his figure paintings, which Mauner posits are as much still lifes with figures as the other way around. Rejecting grand narratives as ''all that rubbish,'' Manet found still life objects ripe for pure painting invested with emotion -- an idea carried on by modernists like Cezanne, Picasso and Rauschenberg. Increasingly homebound by illness before he died in 1883, Manet painted still lifes almost exclusively, in part for convenience's sake. Yet Mauner reminds us that Manet's earlier comment about fruit and flowers -- whose fleeting glories are traditional reminders of death in still life arrangements -- was anything but casual. Manet choose still life as the means to communicate most honestly as he stared down his own mortality. Hilarie M. Sheets",2001-06-10T05:00:00+0000

In the early 20th century, Edwardians had sprays of orchids dripping from their shoulders. This style turned into the corsage, which some mothers of the bride have discretely removed to the handbag. Others wear them at the waist or on the wrist. The current idea originated with Tom Ford, who made the flower choker his signature at his first Saint Laurent ready-to-wear show last fall, and women at his second show, in March, adopted the look with their daytime pantsuits.

But when the downtown is Princeton and the owner of the the building is Princeton University, the theater has a better than fighting chance. The university has paid more than $1 million to redo the interior of the Garden Theater, which opened in 1920 on Nassau Street -- the exterior is protected by rules of its historic district -- and it reopened this month. There, patrons can watch movies in stadium seating and amid surround sound, munching on popcorn with real butter. Running a downtown movie house in a multiplex world ''is not a financially viable situation in many cases,'' said Louise Stepens, whose business leases the theater.

The deal, which goes before Community Board 5 on Thursday, calls for the building to be limited to 55 stories instead of the 61 stories originally proposed by the development team, led by the Jack Parker Corporation. Councilwoman Christine A. Quinn, who oversaw the negotiations, said she would fight to restrict the height to 53 stories when the project comes before the Council. The developers' spokesman, Martin McLaughlin, said they had agreed to pay about $14 million of the projected $20 million cost to renovate the Biltmore, which has been closed since 1987.

A gentle and glowing star of stage and family, went peacefully to her rest on Friday, June 8, 2001, in Santa Monica, CA, 75. With sister Shirley, Pat starred with Olsen and Johnson from 1939 to 1948 when she became an executive at J. Walter Thompson. A ninth-generation American, she descended from Jacques Campeau, who traveled with Champlain. Pat's great-grandmother, Louise Leasia, organized the first Catholic Mass in the Saginaw Territory and spoke 11 Indian dialects. Born in Detroit to Michael Basso & Clara Louise Leasia, she was a talented dancer and inventive comedienne, who with her sister Shirley joined Olsen and Johnson in her teens and traveled with them for nine years to every city on the KeithOrpheum Circuit. After the war, Pat appeared on the Milton Berle Show and studied shorthand to land a job at J. Walter Thompson where she produced the Kraft Radio Theater, Rudy Vallee & Edgar Bergen shows. In her greatest starring role, she was mother to her beloved family. She married noted insurance lawyer M.A. ''Pete'' Cornell of Pasadena, CA, & raised her two proud boys, Peter and Christopher. Generous philanthropists, the couple became known as ''Mr & Mrs Santa Claus,'' famed for the Christmas decorations at homes in Pasadena and Huntington Harbor, CA. Pat's superb gourmet cooking and warm hospitality made every guest feel like an old friend. Pat was an anchor and harbor to her family, gentle and gracious, intuitive and insightful, centered and stable, inventive and loving. There is no measure to the sadness felt by her beloved husband Peter, her sister Shirley, children Peter and Christopher, her niece Pati, her great niece and her three grandchildren. It is tempered only by the sure knowledge that throughout her life she lived it to the fullest and gave to others far more than she received.

In May, a French court voided Schneider's original bid because the offer to holders of ordinary voting shares was 43 percent greater than that to owners of nonvoting shares, which enjoy a preferred dividend. Schneider was forced to raise the offer, reducing the premium for ordinary shares to about 20 percent, after a French association of minority shareholders, with the backing of institutional investors, took the case to court and won. The combined company, with about $11 billion of revenue, will be the world's largest manufacturer of low-voltage electrical products, from factory motor controls to household plugs and dimmers.

Paul Robert Carey was born October 18, 1962, the beloved seventh son of Former Governor Hugh L. Carey and the late Helen Owen Carey. His two brothers Hugh L. Carey, Jr. and Peter G. Carey predeceased him. He is survived by his loving family and friends including his brothers and sisters: Alexandria McManus (Hank), Christopher (Bonnie), Susan Dempsey (Marty), Michael, Donald, Marianne Hayes (Dennis), Nancy Cassidy (Tom), Helen O'Neill (Martin), Bryan (Catherine), Kevin (Mary Jo), Thomas (Amy), his loving nieces and nephews Peter Hugh, Eileen, Tom, Beth (Bryan), Erich, Kate, Susie, Ted, Maureen, Hugh, Donnie, Owen, Delia, Thomas Hugh & Elizabeth. Many loving friends, including his close friend Jackie Chorney, also survive him. Paul was a graduate of the Doane Stuart School and Colgate University. After a career in Institutional Equities, Paul joined the Clinton/ Gore 1992 Presidential Campaign, as Northeast finance director. In the new administration, he worked in the White House as Special Assistant to the President for legislative affairs, handling banking, financial services and securities matters, primarily working with the United States Senate. He also worked on judicial selection and handled Senate confirmation for many administration nominees. In 1997, Paul was nominated and confirmed to serve as Commissioner of the Securities Exchange Commission. While at the Commission Paul Carey led the Commission's efforts to provide information to lawmakers regarding the privatization of Social Security. He also served as liaison to the North American Securities Administrators Association. Paul lived life to the fullest and continued his public service each day of his life. As a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in his service in the White House administration of President Bill Clinton, Paul strived to make life better for all of those whom he touched and for those less fortunate. Paul was a man of great accomplishments, stature and elegance.

With God's grace he gave and received as much love as anyone could ever have dreamed of or desired in life. The family wishes to thank all the caregivers, nurses and doctors who cared for and treated Paul during his lengthy illness.

Alison Lurie, in her entertaining book ''Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: Subversive Children's Literature,'' offers an idea: ''Perhaps the phenomenon can be traced to the Romantic movement and the value put on childhood by writers like Blake and Wordsworth, which suggested to men and women of genius that writing for and about children was a serious and worthy occupation.'' Whatever the explanation, Allan Ahlberg's story THE SNAIL HOUSE (Candlewick, $13.99; ages 4 to 8) will take its place on the picture-book shelf of that wonderful tradition. For many years Ahlberg collaborated with great success with his artist wife, Janet, who died in 1994; together they created such delightful books as ''Each Peach Pear Plum'' and ''The Jolly Postman: Or Other People's Letters.''",2001-06-17T05:00:00+0000

us,"So Far, Not So Bad","In a poem commemorating a college roommate, now dead, John Updike writes that ''he had become a learned grump, and I / a literary Mr. Sunshine.'' And indeed Updike does often seem to be lighthearted, at least in his verse; in another poem in AMERICANA: And Other Poems (Knopf, $23), he explains how he was extracted with difficulty from ''the reluctant loins of a Pennsylvania lass'' but, once out, ''resolved to have what fun there was -- candy, / the comic strips, the opposite sex, and golf.'' Like an Oxford shirt, these poems (many of them sonnets) are lightly starched and well pressed, and there are references throughout to life's petty tribulations, the aches and aggravations all flesh is heir to, even if they come across as almost impertinent to an Anglo-Saxon Protestant male with a strong sense of privilege (especially one who has made his reputation examining the aspirations and anxieties of that set). On the whole, the sun is shining down on Updike's America, and almost everything can be seen in a way that's positive or at least amusing. The body, usually an object of an older writer's rage and contempt, is portrayed here as a better friend to us than the mind, since it's always healing. And when, in his series of poems about hotel life, he writes that ''the TV remote / waits by the bed like a suicide pistol,'' he makes death seem little more than a change of channels. There's no escaping our fate, of course; in the end, ''this world brave with hellos turns all goodbye.'' Until then, Updike says, a courtly cheerfulness would seem to be our best bet.

George was the leading agent at the Pierz Agency (Darien/Norwalk, CT) of The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and recognized as an inspiration in the industry.

The floor is poured concrete, the bar is laminated blond wood, and the ''living room'' has a spare red seating system and metal cocktail tables on which Bjork, a neighbor, has been known to tap out tunes.

But they saw who had entered, offered warm greetings, and went back to their drinks. Because at Bunny's, ''a 90-year-old grandmother walks into a bar'' isn't the setup to an old joke; it's business as usual.To celebrate his grandmother's birthday, Allan took Mathilda to her favorite place, Bunny's. She ordered a beer, a meatball sandwich and a slice of cheesecake. The staff made everyone feel welcome -- Mathilda, Allan, his wife, Jill, and even their 18-month-old daughter, Willa. Though Bunny's is close to Seton Hall University, it's not the sticky surfaces, plastic beer cups and guys in backward baseball caps that might be expected. The long, old wooden bar along the wall, the ornate tin ceiling and a string of lights along the walls create a homey feel. It's perpetually Easter, with bunny representations everywhere. Booths line the wall opposite the bar, and a larger dining area is in the back. (A separate front door leads into a smaller, more sedate dining room.) The menu features a wide range of pasta, pizza and seafood. No entrees cost more than $12.95, and most are significantly less. Like Mathilda, I had a meatball sandwich ($4.75), a pint of beer ($3) and the creamy cheesecake ($3.50). The sandwich was delicious, with fresh ground beef, rich marinara sauce and a soft roll. Thanks for the recommendation, Mathilda, and a belated happy birthday. JACK SILBERT",2001-06-17T05:00:00+0000

In the movie, a 17-year-old Ms. Jolie plays a beautiful, gun-toting, kick-boxing, lifelike super-robot who runs away from her creators when she learns she's been designed for evil purposes. Though her acting in ''Cyborg 2'' is still in it's trial-and-error stage, it contains the seeds of her performance style today. Even as a big-eyed teenager with waist-length hair, Ms. Jolie had a tough, can-do quality about her, as if she didn't have to wait for any man to get the job done. She also knew, even then, how to fill up the screen with her presence. Ms. Jolie, though, had a visceral reaction to her B-movie debut.",2001-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Juan Raul Garza will be put to death for several drug-related murders he committed a decade ago. One could argue that Timothy McVeigh's exceptional crime made him a likely candidate for execution in any society that employs the death penalty. But the Garza case forces us to confront troubling questions about not only the general fairness of a capital punishment system that has a disproportionate impact on African-Americans and Hispanics, but also the fairness of depriving Mr. Garza of a basic protection that every other federal inmate on death row has received.",2001-06-17T05:00:00+0000

Expect that checkbook to be strained again this year. ''Draw a line from San Francisco to Salt Lake City,'' says Rick Ochoa, the chief meteorologist for the National Interagency Fire Center. ''North of there, it could be a hot season.'' Typically, fire season doesn't get going until July.

Paul Robert Carey was born October 18, 1962, the beloved seventh son of Former Governor Hugh L. Carey and the late Helen Owen Carey. His two brothers Hugh L. Carey, Jr. and Peter G. Carey predeceased him. He is survived by his loving family and friends including his brothers and sisters: Alexandria McManus (Hank), Christopher (Bonnie), Susan Dempsey (Marty), Michael, Donald, Marianne Hayes (Dennis), Nancy Cassidy (Tom), Helen O'Neill (Martin), Bryan (Catherine), Kevin (Mary Jo), Thomas (Amy), his loving nieces and nephews Peter Hugh, Eileen, Tom, Beth (Bryan), Erich, Kate, Susie, Ted, Maureen, Hugh, Donnie, Owen, Delia, Thomas Hugh & Elizabeth. Many loving friends, including his close friend Jackie Chorney, also survive him. Paul was a graduate of the Doane Stuart School and Colgate University. After a career in Institutional Equities, Paul joined the Clinton/ Gore 1992 Presidential Campaign, as Northeast finance director. In the new administration, he worked in the White House as Special Assistant to the President for legislative affairs, handling banking, financial services and securities matters, primarily working with the United States Senate. He also worked on judicial selection and handled Senate confirmation for many administration nominees. In 1997, Paul was nominated and confirmed to serve as Commissioner of the Securities Exchange Commission. While at the Commission Paul Carey led the Commission's efforts to provide information to lawmakers regarding the privatization of Social Security. He also served as liaison to the North American Securities Administrators Association. Paul lived life to the fullest and continued his public service each day of his life. As a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as in his service in the White House administration of President Bill Clinton, Paul strived to make life better for all of those whom he touched and for those less fortunate. Paul was a man of great accomplishments, stature and elegance. Paul loved to travel to distant parts of the world and was well received wherever he called including a number of United States Embassies. Most recently, Paul took great joy in attending the investiture of the Cardinals in Rome, including Edward Cardinal Egan of the Archdiocese of New York. From the earliest days, Paul held an affection for the developmentally disabled. As a child, he provided loving care to the developmentally challenged at Camp Shelter Island and as a young man he worked with physically challenged skiers in Windham, N.Y. As a son, a brother, an uncle and a friend he brought a whole new meaning to the fun that life has to offer and shared it with everyone he touched. Paul's strength, love and generosity will continue with the Carey family and his friends forever. With God's grace he gave and received as much love as anyone could ever have dreamed of or desired in life. The family wishes to thank all the caregivers, nurses and doctors who cared for and treated Paul during his lengthy illness. In lieu of flowers the family wishes that Paul be remembered by donations to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021 or St. Gabriel's Spiritual Center for Youth, P.O.

Born in the year that NYC was incorporated, through three different centuries, Rosie witnessed the City evolve from the gaslights and the first car on the streets of Greenwich Village to high speed internet access through her television. A lifelong Democrat (''Tammany Hall or no hall at all''), Rosie was a poll watcher for many years and avidly followed the local and national political scenes. On her 100th birthday, she received personal messages from the President, Senator Ted Kennedy, the Governor and the Mayor and a ceremonial inscribed brick from Stuyvesant Town where she resided since it opened 50 years ago. Although she was a widow for most of her life and only had one child, the late Joseph Harold, who retired as an Army Colonel after 32 years of active duty around the world, her progeny is remarkable. She had nine grandchildren, including a career Army officer, two doctors, a business woman, a lawyer, an interior designer, a nurse, an independent film maker and a web site designer, and at last count, 25 great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren. When asked to explain her longevity, Rosie would respond ''I guess the good Lord doesn't want me and the devil is afraid I'll take his job.'' Contributions may be made in Rosie's name to the Immaculate Conception Church, where she was a parishioner for over 50 years, 414 East 14th Street, NY, NY 10009.

The company's revenues rose last year to $10.6 billion, up 30 percent over 1999. It amounts to a convincing comeback for a company that was on the rocks in the 1980s. It then gambled on the potential market for spiffy regional jets  which handily paid off in the 1990s.

But the data made it unlikely that the central bank would reduce interest rates any time soon, even though growth has slowed sharply in most European countries. The steepest increases were for food, which climbed at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, in part as a result of efforts to contain foot-and-mouth disease.

The firm also said that because of the economic slowdown, employees of its consulting arm would receive minimal pay increases and that raises would reflect individual performance. According to the e-mail announcement on salary increases that was distributed internally last week, some employees may receive no raise at all. Jonathan D. Glater (NYT)",2001-06-19T05:00:00+0000

Orlofsky of Federal District Court in Camden issued the injunction on April 19 pending the outcome of a suit filed by neighbors of the plant, said Brian Montag, a lawyer for St. Lawrence, which has its corporate offices in Mount Royal, Canada, near Montreal. On Friday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, lifted the injunction, allowing the plant to begin its operation, grinding slag into a powdery cement additive, on Monday. The appellate court is expected to rule next month on St. Lawrence's motion to dismiss the suit. If it is not dismissed, Judge Orlofsky will hold a trial to determine whether the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection violated the federal Civil Rights Act by granting a permit for the St. Lawrence plant.

The $296,873 verdict announced in April was considered a low amount for TVT Records , which had sought $8.5 million against MP3.com for copyright infringement. But after reading news accounts of the award, jurors contacted United States District Judge Jed Rakoff to say that the total was incorrect. Judge Rakoff determined that the jurors intended the award to be around $2.9 million, but that a division error by one of the jurors led to the lower amount. Judge Rakoff said a retrial was the only reasonable alternative. The retrial is rescheduled for Nov. 5, two months after Vivendi Universal is to have completed its acquisition of MP3.com for $372 million. The acquisition could change the dynamic of the conflict.

The $296,873 verdict announced in April was considered a low amount for TVT Records, which had sought $8.5 million against MP3.com for copyright infringement. But after reading news accounts of the award, jurors contacted United States District Judge Jed Rakoff to say that the total was incorrect. Judge Rakoff determined that the jurors intended the award to be around $2.9 million, but that a division error by one of the jurors led to the lower amount. Judge Rakoff said a retrial was the only reasonable alternative. The retrial is rescheduled for Nov. 5, two months after Vivendi Universal is to have completed its acquisition of MP3.com for $372 million. The acquisition could change the dynamic of the conflict. ''It's good for us to have an opposing company that values copyright as strongly as we do,'' said Steve Gottlieb, chief executive of TVT Records. Jeffrey A.

If not, the company might drop the drug. If the F.D.A. agrees with Corixa, Melacine could become the first cancer vaccine to be approved in the United States.

In New Jersey, Blossom A.

That fee was voided last year by a federal judge saying that they have been set in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Bruce Cohen, general counsel for Verizon New Jersey, said yesterday that Ms. Peretz was asking his company to ''subsidize our competitors'' by providing them access ''at a rate below our cost.'' In New York, the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, urged the Public Service Commission to adopt access-fee cuts recommended by an administrative law judge.

Please join Tom Klebba and me in a moment of reflection this weekend as we recall those who have gone too soon: Mark Fuschetti, Peter Monette, Gary Olde, Jon Flaherty, Gary Brubach, Benn Brown and Wayne Kell, Tom Bradley, Garon Douglas, Jay ''Peggy Sue'' Farrar, Dean X Johnson, Allan Kendric and Ron McSwiggen, Bob Levine, Eddie Peters, Quinton Johnson, Norman Sweet, Eddie Tilchen. ''Not a day goes by, not a blessed day...'' Sheldon, my love, know that you will always be missed and cherished. All will be remembered and celebrated as long as we live.

Travis's breakthrough album, ''The Man Who,'' also had a great sound. But at the same time it seemed derivative, leaving some wondering if Travis was supposed to be Radiohead for dummies or Oasis for smart people. On its third album, ''The Invisible Band,'' Travis proves that it's a band with staying power and takes a step toward establishing its own sound. (The band performs on Monday night at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J.; Tuesday night at the Virgin Megastore in Union Square; and Wednesday night at Jones Beach.)",2001-06-22T05:00:00+0000

From the Washington bureau, the voice of the Fox News anchor Brit Hume crackles out of a speakerphone on Ailes's desk. In short order, the discussion wends its way to George W. Bush's tax cut, which today (after meetings between Congressional negotiators and the White House) has landed at the figure of $1.35 trillion. It's the opinion of the room that somehow the Democrats are going to try to claim victory for this, as they have beaten the president down from $1.6 trillion.

At 19, he moved from Cleveland to New York, and in 1979, when he was 21, Kuper started the underground comic zine World War 3 Illustrated, which, with a childhood friend, Seth Tobocman, he has published since. SPEECHLESS (Top Shelf, $19.95), a collection of Kuper's work, documents a career dedicated to bringing the glee of a child's immersion in a picture book to adult concerns like justice, romance and freedom of speech. Though he draws comics, Kuper does not make joke books; instead he uses stencils with collage, watercolors or pencil drawings to depict urban chaos in panels astonishing for their clarity and concision. ''Speechless'' includes Kuper's illustrations for covers for Time and Newsweek, work as politically engaged as what he has done for The Village Voice. His weekly New York Minute strip for The Daily News, his DC Comics book (''The System'') and the graphic novels he has adapted from works by writers like Franz Kafka and Upton Sinclair exhibit a unity of vision and distinctive style. Since 1997, Kuper has been drawing Mad Magazine's venerable cold war comic series ''Spy vs. Spy,'' first created in 1961 by Antonio Prohias. ''It's a hoot to have them destroy each other every month,'' Kuper writes . ''Also, I've got a whole new audience of kids I can now subvert.'' Elissa Lin Meyers",2001-06-24T05:00:00+0000

The enterprise started when Elly Lee came to New Jersey in 1969 and couldn't find a job as an assistant pharmacist, a position she hadheld in her native Indonesia. So, she bought -- what else? -- a doughnut shop, and expanded it in 1973. The diner caters to construction workers from nearby sites, employees of nearby businesses and patrons of local merchants. ''Some of our customers have been coming here for years and years,'' said Miss Lee, who, with new husband, Bob, and one waiter, runs the diner. Lee's is strictly a breakfast-and-lunch place and the fare, which Miss Lee characterizes as 'the most simple stuff,'' is such customary items as eggs, French toast, breakfast sandwiches and hamburgers ($2.25 for a five-ouncer) and other basic sandwiches like tuna salad ($4.95) and a B.L.T. ($3). Plus something else a bit fancier: ''We are famous for our eggs Benedict,'' Miss Lee said (it is $4.95). And more, she said, pointing to a particular item on the menu, one that represents for her a touch of her home continent: won ton soup ($2.75 or $3.75), which to her is no more exotic than, say, eggs benedict. ''All people eat won ton,'' she said. But if you are among them, you'd better hurry: With Miss Lee in a retirement mode, a fast food outfit is casting a hungry eye on the site.

Al was a self-made man, coming from simple beginnings on the Lower East Side and rising to become a most highly regarded and respected businessman whose vision and staunch determination enabled him to see opportunity that escaped others. Al's devotion to his family was exemplary. The same man who developed, negotiated and oversaw a complex business deal, would come home that night and get down on the floor to play with his grandchildren. Al identified heart and soul with the students of Boys Town, recognizing that an excellent education, coupled with a lofty value system, represented the best hope for these young boys from limited backgrounds to emerge as young men with limitless futures. Together with his beloved Pearl, the Ginsbergs established a major endowment at Boys Town providing the gift of opportunity for disadvantaged Israeli youth. We extend heartfelt condolences to Pearl, his partner in life for over 50 years; children Liane, Larry and Hilary; grandchildren Sean, Sara, Daniel, Heather and Josh, and the entire family.

A former U.S. Ambassador and Editor and Publisher of the Santa Fe New Mexican for more than half a century, died of pneumonia Sunday night at New York Hospital. He was 90. He was a diplomat, corporate director, conservationist, veteran and poet. McKinney served by appointment to five presidents: As Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior, as U.S. Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency at Vienna, as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and held two appointments in the U.S. Treasury Department. McKinney bought the Santa Fe New Mexican in 1949. Due to health problems from the high altitude McKinney sold the company to Gannette Co. in 1976, retaining the right to continue as editor and publisher. After a protracted and celebrated court battle, which he won, McKinney resumed management of the Newspaper in 1987 and repurchased the property in 1989. At one time, he owned four newspapers: The Taos (N.M.) News, The Las Vegas (N.M.) Optic in Las Vegas, N.M., The Monte Vista (Colo.) Journal and the Santa Fe New Mexican. The Taos News is now owned by his daughter, Robin Martin, whose succeeds him as head of The New Mexican. Born in Shattuck, Okla., August 28, 1910, McKinney grew up in Amarillo, TX, the son of a minister. His father Edwin McKinney was a descendent of Colin McKinney, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. His mother, Eva, was the daughter of Robert Moody, a trader on the Santa Fe Trail. McKinney graduated from Amarillo High School and was a reporter for the Amarillo Globe News. He received a bachelor's degree, Psi Beta Kappa, from the University of Oklahoma in 1932. Upon graduation, he worked in New York City as an investment analyst at Standard Statistics, now Standard and Poors. He served as a partner in his cousin Robert Young's investment firm from 1934 to 1950 and became successful by investing in bankrupt railroad stock at the depth of the Depression. During WWII McKinney was a Lieutenant Junior Grade in the U.S. Navy. He helped develop the Tiny Tim Rocket and participated in D-Day to observe the devices piercing German tanks. In 1943, he married Louise Trigg, the daughter of a ranching family from Eastern New Mexico. Because of Santa Fe's close proximity to the National Atomic Weapons Labratory at Los Alamos, McKinney became interested in peaceful uses of atomic energy and published a five volume book on the subject. McKinney served on the board of major corporations, including the Rock Island Railroad, International Telephone and Telegraph, Trans World Airlines and Martin Marietta. He was a published poet; His book ''Hymn to Wreckage'' was rated by the New York Times as one of the ten best poetry books in 1947. Mr. McKinney was divorced from Louise Trigg in 1970 and later married Marielle De Mont Mollin who died in 1998. He is survived by his daughter, Robin McKinney Martin, her husband, Meade Martin, and grandchildren, Laura and Elliott of Nambe; step-son, Laurent De Mont Mollin of Florida; stepdaughter, Edmee Firth of New York; and grandchildren, Marie Louise Slocum and Olivia Slocum of New York and John Slocum of Newport, R.I.

At the last minute, authority was added to the bill for the districts to impose hotel taxes to help finance development.

That ruling in turn reinforced much of the legal reasoning reached by Judge Marilyn Patel of Federal District Court, who found in July 2000 that Napster had aided in copyright infringement, and issued a preliminary injunction. Yesterday's decision clears the way for the case to go back to Judge Patel for a trial, though no date for a trial has been set. Separately, the Recording Industry Association of America, which originally sued Napster on behalf of the record labels, late yesterday filed an appeal with the Ninth Circuit. It sought to overturn Judge Patel's injunction requiring the labels to provide file names of all copyrighted works before Napster would have to remove them.

But Brookfield has scared off potential buyers by telling rival developers and public officials that it has the exclusive right to develop the site. In March, the authority filed suit in State Supreme Court asking that Brookfield be barred from interfering with the sale. Although Justice Gammerman refused to issue an injunction, he set Oct. 22 as the date for a status conference on the dispute and said he hoped to schedule a trial by the end of the year.

Besides fostering new technologies for returning brownfields to productive use, the center is to offer bachelor's and master's degree programs in brownfield redevelopment. The 142-acre Utica site, whose past uses have included the manufacture of gas extracted from coal, was inherited in recent years by the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation from one of its predecessor companies, the officials said. They added that Niagara Mohawk, which is helping devise a cleanup plan for the site, is to contribute $250,000 to the SUNY center over the next three years.

She was born in India, educated in India, England and the USA, & had an interesting & distinguished career in her much loved midwifery profession. She started her midwifery career in India. Stories are told of her courage when she risked her life to see all her midwives to safety during the partition between India and Pakistan; of her trips to the villages to deliver babies, such as twins in the mud-huts of the war-torn reaches of India when medical assistance was nowhere to be found. After the war, she was appointed General Secretary of the TNAI, the 2nd Indian to hold this high-level 'British' national post. Koko studied to be a midwife tutor at London's famous Hospital, Guys, and she learned to do vacuum extractions in Sweden. She worked as a tutor in England prior to her sojourn to the USA. A pioneer midwife in the City in 1968, she forged ahead to establish the first Midwifery Program at Beth Israel Hospital where she later taught Yale midwifery students and medical students. In 1983, she obtained admitting privileges at St. Vincents' Hospital when she was working in the private midwifery practice of Maureen Rayson, CNM. She then became a Fellow of the American College of Nurse-Midwives. When she retired from delivery practice at St. Vincent's in 1990, the hospital made her Midwife Emeritus. Koko, God-fearing & energetic devoted her life to the care of mothers & babies and toward the improvement of her profession. She demanded high standards from her midwives. Active after her retirement, she attended her last birth, her grand-niece's, at home, at age 82 in 1998. Until recently, she was involved in developing the Beth Israel midwifery archives. She was an inspiration to her midwives, student doctors and clients, and was loved by us all. Her departure represents a great loss to the international midwifery community. Her spirit will live on for many generations. For funeral information, call Maureen's office in Chelsea at 646-230-7708. Maureen Rayson, CNM For the Midwifery Community",2001-06-29T05:00:00+0000

She was born in India, educated in India, England and the USA, & had an interesting & distinguished career in her much loved midwifery profession. She started her midwifery career in India. Stories are told of her courage when she risked her life to see all her midwives to safety during the partition between India and Pakistan; of her trips to the villages to deliver babies, such as twins in the mud-huts of the war-torn reaches of India when medical assistance was nowhere to be found. After the war, she was appointed General Secretary of the TNAI, the 2nd Indian to hold this high-level 'British' national post. Koko studied to be a midwife tutor at London's famous Hospital, Guys, and she learned to do vacuum extractions in Sweden. She worked as a tutor in England prior to her sojourn to the USA. A pioneer midwife in the City in 1968, she forged ahead to establish the first Midwifery Program at Beth Israel Hospital where she later taught Yale midwifery students and medical students. In 1983, she obtained admitting privileges at St. Vincents' Hospital when she was working in the private midwifery practice of Maureen Rayson, CNM. She then became a Fellow of the American College of Nurse-Midwives. When she retired from delivery practice at St. Vincent's in 1990, the hospital made her Midwife Emeritus. Koko, God-fearing & energetic devoted her life to the care of mothers & babies and toward the improvement of her profession. She demanded high standards from her midwives. Active after her retirement, she attended her last birth, her grand-niece's, at home, at age 82 in 1998. Until recently, she was involved in developing the Beth Israel midwifery archives. She was an inspiration to her midwives, student doctors and clients, and was loved by us all. Her departure represents a great loss to the international midwifery community. Her spirit will live on for many generations. For funeral information, call Maureen's office in Chelsea at 646-230-7708. Maureen Rayson, CNM For the Midwifery Community",2001-06-30T05:00:00+0000

The other offer, for $2.46 billion, came from Sir Anthony O'Reilly's Valentia Group, which is backed by George Soros. The Dutch telecommunications concern Royal KPN and Telia of Sweden, which hold a combined 35 percent of Eircom, are locked into accepting Sir Anthony's offer unless another bidder makes an all-cash offer of more than 1.355 euros a share. Mr. O'Brien's latest offer -- his eighth since bidding began last October -- is for 1.375 euros a share, of which 0.12 euro is a warrant to be redeemed in 2004.
