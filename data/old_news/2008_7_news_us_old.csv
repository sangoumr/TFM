This act was absolutely not premeditated, said Brice Robin, the state prosecutor in Montpellier. Mr. Robin said he would ask that the sergeant be charged with involuntary bodily harm. If any of the wounded die, the charge could become involuntary manslaughter. ",2008-07-01T04:00:00+0000

According to a report on Playbill.com, The Pioneer Press, a Wilmette newspaper, reported that the Wilmette Park executive director, Tom Grisamore, canceled the show out of concern that passers-by on the park grounds would be offended by a racial epithet for blacks that is used several times in the script and in the score. Ragtime, an award-winning 1998 Broadway musical, is based on the novel by E. L. Doctorow. It tells the stories of three different groups that come together in 1906, and includes an exploration of racism. Playbill.com reported that a June 17 letter to the shows licensing agent, Music Theater International, asked for changes in the script and included suggestions from Robert Bierie, performing arts supervisor of the Wilmette Park District. I find this sad and also hilarious, Lynn Ahrens, who wrote the lyrics for the show, told Playbill.com.

The bank said the United States law cannot be applied by a Russian court, that the money transfers did not amount to a crime covered by the act and that the damage claim is not supported by evidence. The bank flew a former attorney general, Richard Thornburgh, above, to Moscow to make the arguments as an expert witness.

us,Tell Us: What Ails Starbucks?,"Starbucks announced yesterday that it would close 600 stores this year and lay off 12,000 employees. It's a blow, but far from fatal for a company with more than 6,700 locations in the United States and nearly 16,000 worldwide. SBUX, as it's traded on NASDAQ, banked a $108.7 million profit last quarter -- that's a lot of lattes -- but it's down 28 percent from the previous quarter.   Put simply, Starbucks is profitable, but not as profitable as Wall Street would like.   Earlier this year, Howard Schultz retook the reins of the floundering company and was quoted in a press release as saying that Starbucks would be ""embracing our heritage, returning to our core -- all things coffee."" Starbucks bought the Coffee Equipment Company, the maker of the Clover, a high-end coffee brewer with a cult following, and then introduced Pike Place Roast, a new signature coffee blend.   The response has been lukewarm. Some take issue with the espresso machines Starbucks uses, which are known as ""super-automatics"" and need no skill or art to run. And some don't like the Pike Place Roast, which they feel is over-roasted and tastes burnt.  But in researching articles for this newspaper I've spoken to many independent roasters and cafe owners who, for all their complaints about Starbucks, also offer some high praise: that the company buys good beans at fair prices; that it treats its employees well; that it professionalized the industry; and most important, that it introduced espresso drinks to every corner of the country.   These are all admirable accomplishments. But can Starbucks really turn out high-quality coffee at almost 16,000 locations? Could any company? And will a return to ""all things coffee"" give it the profit margins shareholders demand?  More to the point, how do you see the company? Is it Starbucks, America's corner cafe, trying its hardest to make great coffee? Or is it SBUX, a publicly traded company with $7.7 billion in revenue last year that's exploring different marketing and retail strategies until it finds its footing and raises the value of its stock?

us,Save the Press,"On the lobby wall of the newspaper where I got my first reporting job are the Thomas Jefferson words that journalists like to trot out as Independence Day nears:  ""Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.""  Of course, Jefferson also said the only reliable truths in newspapers were the advertisements, and that he was happiest when not reading the papers.   But as to his iconic quote, it's no secret that we're trending toward the former. And anyone who cheers the collapse of the newspaper industry should consider why Jefferson put aside his distaste for the vitriol and nonsense of the press for the larger principle of healthy democracies needing informed citizens.   Last week, almost 1,000 jobs were eliminated in the American newspaper industry, perhaps the bloodiest week yet of a year where many papers are fighting for their lives. You read about the great names  the Baltimore Sun, the Boston Globe, the San Jose Mercury News  as if reading the obituary page. Rich cities like San Francisco can no longer support a profitable daily paper.   Columnists, reporters, editors, cartoonists and photographers  including some colleagues here at The Times  who brought to life the daily narrative of a city or region have been swept aside. What started as layoffs and buyouts is edging toward closures and bankruptcies.   And here's the great paradox: all of this bad news is coming at a time when the audience and reach of many newspapers has never been greater. The Internet may kill the daily newspaper as we know it, but it's allowed some papers to increase their readership by tenfold.   Those who revel in the life-threatening trauma that newspapers are going through, saying they brought it upon themselves by being too liberal, too sensationalistic, too banal -- choose your insult -- miss the point. People are not deserting these complex and contradictory summaries of our collective existence. Not by any stretch.   Measured purely by number of readers in all formats, many newspapers have never been more successful.   Newspaper Web sites attracted more than 66 million unique visitors in the first quarter of 2008  a record, and a 12 percent increase over a year ago, according to a Nielsen Online analysis. Forty percent of all Internet users visit a newspaper site. A visitor, it should be noted, is different from a reader, but it's the measurement of choice.   The Web is the future. And yet, because online advertising accounts for only about 10 percent of total ad revenue, newspapers are hemorrhaging money. In its present form, and even in best-case projections, the Web format will never generate enough money to keep viable reporting staffs afloat at some of the nation's biggest papers.   That's the business model crisis, an old story by now, the millstones of capitalism crushing an outdated format. Something new will emerge, a print and Web model.  In the meantime, print reporters strap on the old Webcam, charge up their podcast recorder, grab their notebook and dutifully try to cover a story that now needs to be presented in three formats, or more.   What's the alternative  the National Public Radio model? It's possible that some civic-minded nonprofits will end up owning one or two of the nation's great papers, and operating them as trusts, hands off.   But that's a limited solution, fraught with problems of control and flexibility, and it won't keep reporters at city hall in Sioux Falls or the statehouse in Santa Fe.   Another response is goodbye, and so what. Look at the auto industry numbers from this week, with General Motors slouching toward bankruptcy.   Besides, there's plenty of gossip, political spin and original insight on sites like the Drudge Report or The Huffington Post  even though they are built on the backs of the wire services and other factories of honest fact-gathering. One day soon these Web info-slingers will find that you can't produce journalism without journalists, and a search engine is no replacement for a curious reporter.   And just how much do most contributors at the The Huffington Post make? Nothing! ""Not our financial model,"" as the co-founder, Ken Lerer famously said. From low pay to no pay  the New Journalism at a place that calls itself an Internet newspaper.   Yes, the Brentwood bold-face types who grace HuffPo's home page can afford to work for free, but it's un-American, to say the least.  Long ago, I was a member of the steelworkers union, and also a longshoreman. If any of those guys on the docks heard that I was now part of a profession that asked people to labor for nothing, they'd laugh in their lunch buckets  then probably shut The Huffington Post down. Doesn't the ""progressive"" agenda, much touted on their pages, include a living wage?   We could be left with a national snark brigade, sniping at the remaining dailies in their pajamas, never rubbing shoulders with a cop, a defense attorney or a distressed family in a Red Cross shelter after a flood.   My lament this Fourth of July is to ask readers to see newspapers as not just another casualty in the churn of business. Sure, reporters say stupid things and write idiotic stories. Everyone stumbles. But on its best days, a newspaper is a marvel of style and wit, of small-type discoveries and large-type overstatements, a diary of our deeds.   We may still prove Jefferson's preference wrong: perhaps a nation can function without newspapers. But it would be a confederacy of dunces.    ",2008-07-02T23:14:59+0000

us,Getting Real,"Bill Harley, the children's singer-storyteller whose recordings once provided the in-car soundtrack for most of our family vacations, will be in Washington, D.C., next week.  Looks like I may be going alone.  Julia is at sleepaway camp, and Emilie will be in day camp. Much as she regrets it, she doesn't think she can give up a half day of painting pottery for the experience of walking down memory lane with Mom.  Funny how you cling to your children's memories long after they've moved on.   In the back of my closet, I have a box filled with baby and toddler clothes that I will never give away. I have our board book copies of ""The Runaway Bunny"" and ""Miffy Goes to School,"" and the pajamas and bathrobe  elastic waistband busted, terrycloth threadbare  that I bought for my first time on the maternity ward.   I often grow impatient with the girls for holding onto every scrap of paper that crosses their desks at school. I (secretly) plot ways to get rid of art projects, I throw out the birthday cards from not-so-good friends; I made Julia, recently, banish all her postcards and brochures and playbills into a folder I instructed her to label ""Momentoes."" (I also dictated the spelling.)   And yet, as a ""joke,"" I recently ordered a copy of Sesame Street's ""1 2 3 Count With Me"" DVD because I realized I could no longer recall all the words to the numbers song sung by The Count.  ""The Counting,"" Julia used to call him, when I used to sing her his song, on rainy days, pushing her ahead of me on a kickboard at the public pool, at a time when nearly her whole body fit on a kickboard.   The girls think it's pretty weird that I bought myself a Sesame Street DVD. They don't remember the video of it that they once had, because it had a European format and we'd had to give it away when we moved to the U.S. from France. The most painful thing about that move was the sense that we were leaving Julia's early childhood and Emilie's babyhood behind. It plunged me into something like a state of mourning. Trying to fall asleep, I would replay in my head our final days in Paris, the stroller moving up and down the sidewalks curbs, Emilie on her back looking up at the trees in the Champ de Mars while Julia stood behind her on one of those little platforms that siblings were always riding on there. With time, the mournful feeling faded. My sense of where our life was located changed. But there was no denying that that particular moment in our life was forever gone.  How cruel it is, the way children grow up.  I used to hate it, starting back around the time that I was 11, like Julia, when my father would fall into fond remembrances about my toddler years.   ""Don't you remember ?"" he would ask with a pained voice, a strained look about the eyes, the knowledge temporarily forgotten that (as he would recall himself to say, seconds later) you can't really remember things from before around the age of three.  ""Pity,"" he would say.  What was the pity? I wanted to live in the present.   When I went away to college, my mother put all the stuffed animals I'd once kept on my bed in an old suitcase. She showed them to me proudly when I came home on break.  ""What do you want me to do with them?"" I asked.  ""I don't know "" she said. ""I thought you might want to  look at them, or something.""  I did not want to see them. Because they looked old, and  it pains me even now to say it  ugly.   ""Once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always, "" the Skin Horse says in The Velveteen Rabbit.     "" You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""    The Skin Horse is a sage in the world of stuffed animals. But where humans are concerned, ""Mary Poppins"" got it right: there is only a set period of time in which you can hear the starlings speak, before your brain tunes out such exquisite perceptions and fixes instead on the attentional demands of everyday life.  (Interesting tidbit: I learned at M.I.T. the other week that, rather than being born with insufficiently developed neural pathways, babies are actually born with too many circuits, and normal development, in part, consists of winnowing them down. ""There are too many wires  it's as though the brain has been wired for too many contingencies, and they get whittled down over time,"" said Jeff Lichtman, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard. ""It's as though we're wired for what we could be."")   My daughters' very early years brought me a reprieve from the dead zone of adulthood. I could hear their voices in my head before they actually learned to speak; their thoughts, their ""words,"" coming out of my mouth, were utterly real to me, as were to all of us the stories I invented about the perfidy of our then-cat, Poochie, a Mafioso-type who had to leave France under suspicion of tax improprieties.  The girls made me tell those stories over and over. And I did it for years, and made up songs, too. But then, one morning, recounting for the nth time Poochie's escapades in the Bush White House, and neglecting to look over my shoulder, I scraped the entire length of another school mom's minivan with my car.  It was a wake-up call. I had to concentrate, inhabit the present, with all its details and demands. And so I did.   Was it at that point that they started to grow up and away from me? Or was it I, trying to be a real adult, who pulled away?  The questions haunt me these days, as I sit awaiting the mail, hoping against hope for a letter home from Julia.  ",2008-07-03T22:03:14+0000

us,The Dysfunctional Jameses,"House of Wits seems an odd title, suggesting elegant repartee and playful badinage  more Oscar Wilde or Nol Coward  for what is billed as an intimate portrait of the James family. Certainly they could be witty (Alice, the only daughter, was especially sharp); they competed as children at the family dinner table to tell the best stories, jumping from their chairs and gesticulating passionately; and two of them, the two geniuses of the family, grew up to live on their wits. But wits is not how I think of them, either before or after reading this book. House of horrors would be nearer the mark, in this version. Paul Fisher refers to the James home as a chamber of horrors, a plague ship and the James family bog. His big project is to tell the James family story as a traumatic saga of dysfunction, competition, anxiety, aspirations often thwarted, confusion, repression, breakdown and sadness, of lifelong struggles to get away and an inexorable pull back to the powerful family bond. The lives of all the children are shaped by the fathers peculiarities: The young Jameses grew up borne on the shifting currents of Henrys emotions and desires, and buffeted by them. Resenting or hating the home, driven away from it by wanderlust, ambition and desire for independence, yet always locked into it and haunted by what Alice James called ghost microbes, the Jameses were doomed, in Fishers words, to be always running away from Jameses only to collide with Jameses again.

In a speech in Brasilia in 1982, Ronald Reagan infamously offered a toast to the people of Bolivia, a gaffe that probably did him more good than harm on his home turf. Since 9/11, the days of willful ignorance about the Arab world are gone forever, or at least there is a pretense they are. Now, just when it looked as if more or less everyone, politicians included, was close to getting the Sunni-Shiite thing down, along comes Amin Maalouf with his lovely, complex memoir, Origins, to remind us that Arab identity is as fluid, unsettled and ever-changing as the Mediterranean Sea where it kisses the shores of Lebanon, his country of origin, and France, where he has lived for the last 30 years.

us,A Soaked Rider Overcomes Tourmalet,"7 hours after the end of the tape.  Today's ride: 105 soggy miles from Pau to Hautacam, along the route of next week's 10th stage of the Tour de France, up four climbs, two rated third-category in degree of difficulty and two rated ""beyond category.""   I'll be in better shape tomorrow morning to describe the whole tape experience for you in more detail -- and will post video and photos I shot during the ride to flesh it all out -- but here's what I can tell you now, in my somewhat exhausted state.  The ride was really an epic experience, in large part due to the horrible weather. It was rainy and cold throughout, particularly on the way up both of the big climbs, to the Col du Tourmalet about 60 miles in, and then to Hautacam at the end. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I was hoping to climb the mountains while being able to see them, and to descend them on dry roads, but, given that the weather in the Pyrenees is often a factor in mountain stages of the Tour de France, in a way this was probably the most appropriate way to ride the course.  The one outstanding feature of the event that made it enjoyable even when the suffering was at its most intense was the way local people lined the route from start to finish to cheer on every cyclist with the same fervor you'd expect from fans of the actual Tour.   Despite a really upset stomach from quite early on, I made it to the finish line, in the middle of a rain cloud at the top of Hautacam, in 8 hours 5 minutes -- which officially placed me 3182nd out of more than 7,500 cyclists who started the race, and 961st in my age group.   I think I probably would have done a bit better but for the stomach ailment -- which was probably caused by some combination of nerves and the failure to eat carefully enough during the last week or so (its hard to be in France and pass on the wine every night). Feeling queasy made it nearly impossible for me to eat properly during the ride (I could only force down two and a half Power Bars and about 7 gels all day).   A bit more experience with riding in the impromptu pacelines that formed again and again all throughout the course would have helped too. While I was soon both tired and desperate enough to get over my fear of riding too close to the wheels of the riders in front of me, and accepted the splattering of mud on my contacts as the price of getting some relief from the wind by drafting, a couple of times I did find myself isolated between groups on flat parts of the course, riding into the wind, and thus working harder to get to the climbs than I would've liked.  As everyone who had done it before told me, the ride was very fast at the start -- everyone treating it like a race zoomed off from the line and looked to make time before the base of Tourmalet. I shot off too, going fast, at least for me, and covered the 60 miles to Campan, where the climb really begins, in 3 hours 15 minutes. The climb of Tourmalet itself, which seemed to be much harder today than it was earlier in the week -- not surprising given 60 more miles of riding to get there plus the wind and rain -- felt like it was taking three hours, but ended up taking me only about 2 hours, from Campan, or about 15 minutes longer than it did on Tuesday. I'd chalk that up to the mad adrenaline of riding uphill surrounded by thousands of other riders.  By the way, just before I got to Tourmalet, I had the odd and very nice experience of meeting a reader of the blog who was also taking part in the Etape in the middle of a paceline, and we rode together part of the way and then also chatted at the rest stop at La Mongie -- where I did indeed stop, in a vain quest for a bathroom -- later on.   The hardest part of the day in many ways was the descent of Tourmalet, but not because -- as I'd expected and feared -- there were other riders were bombing down the hill all around me. Given the conditions, people were pretty restrained, but, since the mountain was completely shrouded in a rain cloud at the top, for much of the descent I could only see a few dozen yards and had to essentially just follow the riders in front of me on the partly invisible road toward the bends beyond which there was nothing but mist and fog.  The final climb to Hautacam was, as I'd expected, vicious, since that road snakes up the mountain in a mix of moderate and remarkably steep gradients. But, well, you know the end of the story already. Eventually I slogged my way to the top, handed in my timing transponder and got a medal.  I should also add that, except for one rider who suffered an injury, all the cyclists in the Velo Echappe group also finished the course, and that five of my fellow Tourists du Mont Blanc were on Hautacam at the same time as me (one already on his way back down). One of them, Tom, actually survived the nightmare of a puncture at high-speed on the descent of Tourmalet, and managed to repair his tire and still be standing in the line to ride back down to his car from the top of Hautacam when I got there. (Later, at the hotel, he was so unfazed by the experience that he was talking about taking on another kind of mountain climbing next: of Mont Blanc itself, with his wife.)  Phil Cavell, who built the temporary footbed that kept my toes from going numb for the first time on any ride over 30 miles, also rode the Etape and finished it nearly an hour ahead of me. (For those following the saga of my troubled right foot, the new footbed did help stave off numbness but ultimately it just wasn't broken in enough to feel totally comfortable while climbing and descending. So, I switched back to my original insoles for the ascent of Hautacam, but the lack of numbness for any part of the day obviously means that Phil has started me on the way to a permanent solution.)  I didn't see the guys from the BBC, who started close by me in the journalist peloton, after the first few miles, but I heard later that one of them had a flat that might be why only one of their names is on the list of finishers.   I'll have video and photographs for you in the morning. Thanks for the support and for all the congratulations. ",2008-07-06T21:22:51+0000

The incident has attracted widespread news coverage and commentary, including accusations that the museums decision to include a Hitler figure was in bad taste and was made only to generate publicity. A spokeswoman for Madame Tussauds told the news agency the statue would return to its place in the museums history section as soon as possible. Adolf Hitler represents a defining moment in German history that cannot be denied, she said, adding that the display was created with sensitivity and respect.

In 1991, Ms. Watson adopted Patricia Ann Spado, now 60, in Maine, where the women spent several weeks each summer at the Watson compound on the island of North Haven. The purpose of the adoption, Ms. Spado said in court documents, was to allow her to qualify as an heir to Ms. Watsons fortune. A year after the adoption, the women broke up. Now, with both of Ms. Watsons parents dead, Ms. Spado is seeking to qualify as Mr. Watsons 19th grandchild and a beneficiary of his trusts. The Watson family, including Olive, is fighting Ms. Spados claim. In April, the probate judge who granted the adoption annulled it on the grounds that the women did not meet residency requirements. Ms. Spados lawyers filed an appeal on July 2. ",2008-07-08T04:00:00+0000

us,Rebirth of the Cool,"Is your refrigerator running?  I'm not kidding -- is it?   My old refrigerator provided constant (and unpleasant) white noise throughout our house while we fretted over whether it was more ""green"" to keep it (and thus not contribute more waste to landfill) or to replace it with a more energy-efficient model. The refrigerator made the decision for us by dying a sudden death; its Energy Star replacement is silent and has cut our electricity bills significantly. Refrigerators -- and dishwashers, washers and dryers -- have gotten sleeker and more functional in recent years, the manufacturers motivated in part by late '90s legislation that mandated 30 percent increases in energy efficiency. (Though the recent appearance of televisions in refrigerator doors gives me pause.)   But another energy-sucking appliance has fallen behind: the air conditioner.   (Photo: Courtesy of Modern Fan) There are many alternatives to air conditioning, from ceiling fans (there are lots of stylish ones these days, including the high design group available at Modern Fan to good old-fashioned awnings, which you may be surprised to learn can reduce household cooling energy by as much as 26 percent in hot climates and 33 percent in cold climates.   Major corporations like Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley have ventured back even further, using blocks of ice  albeit really huge blocks of ice  to cool their corporate headquarters.   Quaint, no? But so incredibly logical. And of course, the D.I.Y. crowd are tinkering away in their respective garages to create geeky but wonderful alternatives like the one I found on the quirky site instructables.com: an air conditioner made from an ice cream box, an 80-millimeter fan and a 12-volt transformer.   But most of us simply trudge off to Best Buy or Circuit City as soon as temperatures spike and buy the most powerful thing we can afford, more concerned with sweating less than with altering the course of global warming. Air conditioners, those clunky, typically inefficient creatures, have gotten short shrift in the realm of energy efficient appliances: consumers have been well-educated about the cost- and energy-saving benefits of Energy Star-rated dishwashers, dryers and frontloading washers, but as common as central air is, the lowly air conditioner exists in our collective imagination as the hulking, droning, aesthetically challenging thing that it often still is.   A more human-centered design approach has resulted in some interesting alternatives, often focusing on maintaining a comfortable temperature for the individual rather than the whole house (or office). This approach abandons the premise of central air conditioning in favor of what is sometimes termed ""personal climate control."" Both at home, where we tend to stay in certain areas for extended periods of time, and at work, where temperature control is often among the top five worker complaints, this idea makes good sense.   DeLonghi delivers a near-anthropomorphic version with the Pinguino, a compact, portable unit designed to cool only the room you are occupying. (Photo: Courtesy of Herman Miller) Herman Miller, a furniture company known for its commitment to energy and waste reduction, earth-friendly materials and sustainable architecture (its Michigan headquarters were designed by the green building pioneer William McDonough), offers an even smaller device for workspaces designed to keep its owner cool  or warm, depending on the season.   (Photo: Courtesy of Herman Miller) Part of the company Be Collection, the tiny C2 heats and cools but uses less than 1.5 amps of AC current, which is approximately 90 percent less energy than a typical space heater.   (Photo: Courtesy of SunFrost) The award for the oddest but well-intentioned attempt (and most appropriate for use in long-haul trucks and insane asylums of yore) goes to the Sleep Genie by Sun Frost. Acknowledging the challenge of cooling in hotter climates, Sun Frost proposes installing a very small air conditioner within a very small area, like the insulated space around one's bed shown here.   Great. You may be cooler, but now you're claustrophobic.   Sun Frost's concept is not inherently different from DeLonghi's or Herman Miller's, though its execution speaks to a larger issue: a general lack of innovation. Instead of re-imagining what an air conditioner could be (something portable, something that took a different form, something that ran on an alternative energy source), they simply took the existing form and shrank it.   This seems to me indicative of so much that's happening right now with other big-ticket items like homes and cars. Lower gas prices, for example, do not solve the problem of decreasing supply and increased demand for oil. Home designs that neglect to address things like natural light and ventilation are not contributing to quality of life, let alone reducing heating and cooling costs. The gas/driving issue requires a tremendous commitment to not only alternative fuels but alternative behaviors (i.e., walking, carpooling, mass transit); as for housing, the challenges are formidable, yet a quick look back to vernacular precedents like shotgun houses that encourage ventilation, and window orientation that encourages passive heating and cooling, would help point things in the right direction.

us,An Original Confession,"(Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters) (The second part in a series celebrating Charles Darwin.)  It always happens the same way. A glance around the room to make sure no one else is listening. A clearing of the throat. A lowering of the voice to a conspiratorial tone. Then, the confession.  ""I've never read 'On the Origin of Species.' I tried, but I thought it was boring.""   Thus, a number of eminent scientists  biologists all  have spoken. Or rather, whispered.  As the first major statement on evolution and how it works, Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" not only transformed the way we humans see ourselves. It marks the beginning of modern biology. But reading it is evidently not a prerequisite for a successful career in biology  not even for those studying evolution.   Which is not surprising. The book was written almost 150 years ago, and the subject has (needless to say) evolved since then. Moreover, the central enduring idea in the ""Origin""  evolution by natural selection  can be learned from any number of textbooks.  Nonetheless, those confessions made me wonder. Does the ""Origin"" have anything fresh to say to a modern reader? Or is it simply of historical interest?   There is no doubt that the book is antiquated in several respects, and Darwin's writing is  in my opinion  patchy. In places, his prose is clear, lyrical and glorious: as good as anything ever written by anyone. One of my favorite passages concerns the fact that some flowers are pollinated only by humble-bees (or bumblebees, as we call them now):    The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr. H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that ""more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England."" Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Mr. Newman says, ""Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice."" Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!    But there are also passages that are long-winded, turgid and opaque. Often, these occur when Darwin is writing about subjects that were not understood at the time  such as what we now call genetics.  Beyond the fact that animals and plants tend to resemble their parents more than they resemble members of the population at large, Darwin knew nothing about how traits are inherited, or where genetic variation comes from. For his immediate purposes, this didn't matter much. Natural selection will operate whenever all of three conditions are met. These are: (1) some of the differences between individuals are inherited differences, not due to differences in their environments; (2) more individuals are born than can survive; and (3) part of the reason at least some of the survivors make it is owing to the traits  a longer-than-average beak, say  that they inherited from their parents. For natural selection, then, what is important is that some differences are inherited; and this, Darwin could show. The breeding of animals such as dogs clearly illustrates that some traits are inherited; if they were not, distinct breeds like Belgian shepherds and Pekingese could not exist.  Darwin's ignorance of genetics (of which he was well aware) means that many of the passages where he discusses it are tortuous, in part because he is describing a subject for which the very language did not exist. Darwin himself was the first to use ""genetic"" in a biological context; terms like ""gene"" wouldn't be coined for another 50 years, and the structure of DNA  the stuff of which genes are made  wouldn't be worked out for a further 40. He is also puzzled by observations that we can now easily explain. For example, he knew that bald dogs often have bad teeth, but was mystified as to why this should be so. (The reason is that, in the developing embryo, the same set of genes is involved in the initial formation of both teeth and hair. Mutations to those genes thus affect both traits.)  Two other factors make the ""Origin"" a demanding read today. The first is that Darwin's own knowledge of the diversity of life is immense, and he assumes the reader will be familiar with a wide range of organisms  such as Asclepias (a group of flowering plants commonly known as milkweeds, for their thick milky sap) and corncrakes (stout land-dwelling birds related to waterbirds like moorhens). This means either skating over such words and just absorbing the gist of what he is saying, or spending a lot of time looking things up. Which is fine  but as a result, getting full meaning from the text requires a certain level of prior knowledge, a large dollop of enthusiasm, a good guidebook, or participation in a discussion group.   The other thing that makes the ""Origin"" tricky is that the text is stuffed with facts and speculations, and it is hard to know which of them are still taken seriously and which are obsolete. He thinks, for example, that all chickens bred by humans are descended from the wild Indian fowl (now known as Gallus gallus gallus). This is right. However, he also says that domestic dogs have been bred from a variety of ancestors in different parts of the world; this is no longer thought to be the case. All dogs are descended from the wolf.   Yet while this is sometimes frustrating, it is also inspiring. He has so many ideas! For instance, he mentions in passing that ""it is a general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally  perhaps at very long intervals  indispensible."" This sentence alone has been the subject of countless doctoral theses; and, as far as we can tell, he's basically right. The adoption of asexuality  which is what exclusive self-fertilization amounts to  almost always leads to a rapid extinction. The book, in other words, is a treasure trove of hypotheses and conjectures, many of which still await investigation.  Moreover, parts of the ""Origin"" still hold great insights. For example, to my mind Darwin's discussion of instinctive behaviors is strikingly modern: he sees that instincts can evolve through natural selection in the same way that physical traits can. (By instincts he means behaviors that do not need to be learned  such as the tendency for a just-hatched cuckoo to heave any other eggs out of the nest it finds itself in.) He has a sophisticated view of how natural selection works, and the circumstances that make it powerful; indeed, his descriptions of the forces of nature  starvation, predation, competition and disease, to name a few  are as good as, or better than, those in most textbooks today. He appreciates that the biggest problems that most living beings face come not from features of the physical environment, such as climate, but from other organisms, whether of the same species or a different one. And in our current age of specialization, where deep knowledge of an animal or a plant often comes at the cost of broad knowledge of other members of the tree of life, it is deeply refreshing to come across writing that is so much about all of nature.  So, the difficulties notwithstanding, there are many reasons to tackle the ""Origin."" Reasons above and beyond the fact that it is one of the most important books ever written, and central to our culture. But to me, perhaps the most important is that reading the ""Origin"" is a window into a mind. A rich and fertile mind, with a holistic view of nature. One that sees the interconnectedness of living beings -- that cats can alter the number of flowers -- long before ecology existed as a formal subject. A mind that sees the brutality of the natural world  the wasps that lay their eggs in the living bodies of caterpillars (the caterpillars are then eaten alive by the growing larvae), the stupendous death rates of most creatures  and sees that from the terrible slaughter, great beauty can arise:    Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object of which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.    **********  (Note in response to a reader query: Darwin revised the text of the ""Origin"" extensively each time the book was republished in his lifetime; by the 6th (and last) edition, the text had evolved considerably.

For the origins of domestic dogs, see Wayne, R. K. and E. A. Ostrander. 2007. ""Lessons learned from the dog genome."" Trends in Genetics 23: 559-567.  Above, I say that ""Darwin knew nothing about how traits are inherited, or where genetic variation comes from. For his immediate purposes, this didn't matter much.""   There is an interesting caveat to this. At the time Darwin was writing, inheritance was believed to be a sort of blending of the two parents, almost as though the factors of inheritance were a kind of soup. Darwin knew that blending wasn't adequate to explain all of the patterns of inheritance he observed, but he was at a loss for an alternative. Under blending inheritance, populations should quickly become genetically uniform. When a population is genetically uniform, natural selection can't operate. So for blending inheritance to allow natural selection to work, new genetic variation must be continually introduced at a very high rate. Or, to speak in modern terms, the mutation rate has be exceedingly high. Where variation comes from was thus one of Darwin's major preoccupations. With the system of inheritance that actually exists  namely, genes  variation can be much more readily maintained in the population, and the problem goes away. For further discussion of blending inheritance and its implications for natural selection, and for Darwin's gropings towards a particulate theory of inheritance, see chapter one of Fisher, R. A. 1999. ""The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection: A Complete Variorum Edition"" (edited by H. Bennett). Oxford University Press.  There are many editions of the ""Origin""; I recommend the Harvard University Press facsimile of the first edition. There are also any number of readers' guides and commentaries; as a good starting point, I recommend Ridley, M. 2005. ""How to Read Darwin."" W.W. Norton.

us,Spying on Bucharest's Cool Underground,"(Photo: Young revelers enjoy a drink at La Motoare, the open-air bar atop Romania's National Theater. See the Slide Show )  About three years ago, Bucharest experienced a revolution that was entirely ignored by the international community. Granted, the coup was not as dramatic as Romania's 1989 revolution, in which Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator who had brutally mismanaged this Black Sea nation for more than two decades, was deposed and executed. Nor was it as momentous as when the country joined the European Union in 2007, along with Bulgaria, its neighbor to the south.  So subtle was the transformation, in fact, that most Bucharestians probably didn't quite realize what was going on.   Here's what happened: All around the capital, with no formal organization whatsoever, bar and restaurant owners grabbed their chairs and tables, carried them outside and  put them down gently, creating terraces and sidewalk cafes. No longer would patrons be confined to electric-lighted interiors! Now they could eat stuffed cabbage rolls and polenta in the fresh air, shaded from the sun by umbrellas advertising Ciuc beer!    (Photo: My guide, Horia Diaconescu. See the Slide Show  )  Open-air terraces may not sound like much, but according to my Bucharest-born friend Horia Diaconescu, a keen observer of the city in which he's spent his 29 years, they represent a sea change. Under Communism, he explained, public life was restricted  people simply did not go out to meet friends (or strangers) in bars and cafes. They socialized in private homes, or not at all. Now, however, ""terasas"" had become de rigueur, and streets like the cobblestoned Strada Smardan, in the heart of old Bucharest, are filled on summer nights with Romanians enjoying the cool breeze and each other's company. Viva la revolucin!   It was just this kind of innovation I had come to this city of two million to discover. For about a year, I had been hearing of interesting developments  new museums, clever art projects, a film scene garnering international acclaim  and wanted to see how they meshed with Bucharest's lingering old-world vibe and Communism-deformed mentality. It seemed in keeping with the high-culture principles of the Grand Tour, and affordable to boot, with tons of hotel rooms well below 100 euros.  Video So, from northern Cyprus, I flew to Istanbul (146 Turkish liras, or about $119 at 1.23 liras to the dollar, on the low-cost airline Pegasus (www.flypgs.com), then caught the 18-hour sleeper train onboard the Turkish State Railways (www.tcdd.gov.tr; two-bed cabin, 127.30 liras) through Bulgaria to Bucharest. (A long trip, but cheaper than a direct flight.) I arrived in the early evening, and the setting sun made this attractive city  once dubbed Little Paris  all the more beautiful.   The columned-and-domed edifices of Bucharest's pre-World War II glory days glowed in the reddening light, and even the Communist-era concrete monstrosities and newer glass-and-steel towers appeared warm and friendly. Okay, they were ugly, but they seemed to have their place.   I felt optimistic, especially after checking into my bed-and-breakfast, the nearly two-year-old Flower's (2 Strada Plantelor; 40-21-311-9848; www.flowersbb.ro), which was listed in my copy of ""In Your Pocket,"" a cheeky, well-written series of Central and Eastern European guidebooks. For 150 lei a night (about $65 at 2.30 lei to the dollar), I had a homey, top-floor room with dormer-style windows that looked out on a quiet square: old people chatting on park benches; an Orthodox church with an aluminum-topped, octagonal steeple; a weeping willow; an Art Nouveau house in need of repair.  The city's historic center was just 10 minutes away by foot. I began in full sightseeing mode, eager to get up to speed on Romanian history and art, and so I walked through Lipscani, a network of alleys that formed the ancient commercial heart of Bucharest. This used to be where traditional artisans plied their trades, but today they've mostly been replaced by modern shops and restaurants, and much of the area is pedestrian-only.   But unlike, say, the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Lipscani has yet to be taken over by international chains, and buildings like the 18th-century Stavropoleos Church, a surprisingly cozy house of worship, offer a hint of the neighborhood's past.  In the Curtea Sticlarilor  the Glass Blowers' Courtyard, a half-hidden complex down a Lipscani side street  I found a sign of Bucharest's future. It was Rozalb de Mura (9-11 Strada Selari; 40-21-311-6215; www.rozalbdemura.ro), a fashion boutique I'd heard about.  This was the avant-garde Bucharest I'd been seeking: blazers covered in carefully stitched ""scars,"" an elegant dress with multilayered lapels that would've looked great on Sean Young in ""Blade Runner."" I came close to buying a white-cotton jacket with complicated pockets, but it was 488 lei  a bargain for high fashion, but not within my budget. Even the store itself seemed like a work of art, with one room designed to look like a Communist-era den (cheap dining table, glass display case of knickknacks) and the other all-white and filled with artificial mist. The theme this season: reality and illusion.  From Lipscani, I wandered north, past a Christian Dior boutique and the Art Deco ""Telephone Palace,"" to the colossal National Museum of Art (49 - 53 Calea Victoriei; 40-21-313-3030; www.mnar.arts.ro; admission 15 lei), housed in the former royal palace. The European collection was impressive (El Greco  not bad!), but I really came to see the extensive holdings of Romanian art and to get an idea of what this country's art was all about.  In the absence of any explanatory placards, I had to do this by inference. My impression is that by the 1840s, after 600 years of mostly religious art  icons, carvings, tombstones and so on, mostly in the Byzantine tradition  Romania leapt into secular modernity with a vengeance. Wealthy businessmen and political leaders had their portraits painted, and artists turned to the natural world and nationalist themes for inspiration.   My favorites among these were C.D. Rosenthal, a Hungarian Jew who painted the iconic ""Revolutionary Romania"" (1841), and Nicolae Grigorescu, whose tense ""The Spy"" depicts the pre-dawn horseback pursuit of an Ottoman agent during Romania's 1877 war for independence. What emerges from this collection is a portrait of a small nation struggling to define itself in contrast to the powers that surround it: Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Western Europe.  Today, at least for a visitor, Bucharest is perhaps less angst-ridden. My few days there were generally filled with the kind of cool, semi-underground culture I'd been seeking. I spent one long afternoon hanging out at the 115 Digital Art Gallery (115 Strada Mihai Eminescu; 40-21-210-1969, www.115.ro), which claims to be the first gallery in Eastern Europe devoted to digitally created works of art. The current exhibition showcased Aya Kato, a young Japanese woman whose stylized images of women, dragons and imaginary worlds had been printed on huge mesh panels and hung, billboard-style, from Communist-era apartment blocks around the city.  Another afternoon, the recently begun comic-book newspaper Aooleu! held a party at the Capitol Cinema, an abandoned, decaying open-air movie theater. While rabbits hid in the foliage, Bucharest's skin-baring, sunglasses-wearing cool crowd drank lukewarm Heinekens and giggled at Aooleu!'s hand-drawn accounts of strippers in the Bucharest metro.   ""Many people say that Bucharest is the new Berlin,"" Milos Jovanovic, a Serbian expatriate who is Aooleu!'s co-editor-in-chief, told me. ""It's a place where you can do some stuff, some projects concepts that have been done all around Europe, but here never. Here there is no comics scene, so doing comics you are exotic.""  (Photo: At La Metoc, a tea house. See the Slide Show  )  And with Horia  the bearded, Alice Cooper-loving flneur I met through Couchsurfing.com  as my guide, I discovered some amazing places throughout the city. We drank beer made from tea (10 lei) at La Metoc (21 Strada Popa Rusu, 40-721-669-539), a century-old house with a lush garden, and drank normal beer at La Scena (55 Calea Calarasi, 40-21-320-3567; www.lascena.ro), a lushly restored turn-of-the-century house that doubles as an avant-garde theater.   (Photo: Sunset at Lacul Vacaresti. See the Slide Show  )  One evening, we took a 10-minute taxi ride out to Lacul Vacaresti, an unfinished artificial lake where we watched the sun set behind construction cranes and the hulking mass of the Palace of the Parliament, the Ceausescu-built neo-Classical castle that is, amazingly, Europe's largest single building.   Then we went for shawarma at the renowned Dristor Kebab (1 Boulevard Camil Ressu; 40-21-346-8100; www.dristorkebab.ro). Not only was it delicious and cheap (13 lei), but, Horia pointed out, Dristor and its ilk were run by Romanians, not by Turks as in the rest of Europe. The kebabs had been fully assimilated.  But while I was falling in love with Bucharest, I noticed something else: Everyone I spoke to was a little depressed about the city. Artists lamented the weak market, and hipsters complained about the label-obsessed mainstream. Horia told me about a recent flash mob spectacle to commemorate the Mineriada  the 1990 crushing of student protests by mine workers  in which participants, following instructions delivered by text messages, reenacted the violence using feather pillows. But no one would describe Bucharest as a dynamic capital.  (Photo: An exhibition at the National Museum of Contemporary Art. See the Slide Show)  I could see what they meant. Bucharest is still a work-in-progress. The National Museum of Contemporary Art (2-4 Strada Izvor, entrance E4, 40-21-318-9137; www.mnac.ro; admission 5 lei) is a great idea  converting one end of the Palace of the Parliament into a modern gallery  but the exhibitions were presented with little to no context. Meanwhile, the museum cafe didn't actually serve food, and simply leaving there without a car was a nightmare in the summer heat. Perhaps that was why I was the only visitor on Friday.   Everywhere I went, taxi drivers tried to rip me off, usually by pleading poverty when I handed them a 10-lei note to pay a 6-lei fare. Eating well was a challenge, partly because restaurants were stuck in ""rustic"" mode, but also because their kitchens started closing around 9:30 p.m. And by midnight, the city itself seemed to shut down.  Give it five years, or maybe 10, people told me, and Bucharest will live up to its potential, and perhaps truly be ""the new Berlin,"" as the British newspaper The Guardian dubbed it in March.   (Photo: A movie plays at La Motoare. See the Slide Show  )  But I liked Bucharest now. On Sunday evening, I was drinking cheap beers with new friends at La Motoare (40-21-315-8508), the open-air bar atop the National Theater (Piata 21 Decembrie 1989). Behind us, a Balkan movie was projected on a screen, closing out the Bucharest Film Festival, and somewhere across town Manu Chao was giving the final concert of the B'estfest music festival. And if I wanted, I could spend the rest of the night wandering the city, finding forgotten churches and secret passages that everyone else ignored.   In five or 10 years, such discoveries would be commonplace, as unremarkable as a table and chairs set out under the stars  but for now they were new, and they were mine.   Next stop: Lithuania.

us,Blogtalk: Obama's F.I.S.A. Vote,"It should come as no surprise to Senator Barack Obama that his vote today in favor of expanding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is drawing cries of outrage from many corners of the liberal blogosphere. After all, the senator's own campaign Web site had become a focal point for his supporters to express their displeasure with Mr. Obama's stance on the bill.  That was the case again today. Carl from Ft. Worth, Texas, posted a message on Mr. Obama's Web site this afternoon. The subject line read: ""Obama just lost my vote."" He continued:  ""I am disgusted. Obama will NOT receive my vote in November, regardless of whether it means McCain wins (at least HE'S being honest with us). Once again, Dems picked the wrong guy in the primaries. Time to leave the party I guess.""   Other comments struck much the same theme. Patrick in Chicago wrote ""Can I get my money back this candidate appears to be defective"" and Christopher from San Francisco put it simply ""Senator Obama, you fail.""  Ouch.  (Recall that Mr. Obama tried to calm his critics last week with a statement on his site emphasizing that his position on the surveillance plan, ""...was not an easy call."")  Armando Llorens, who blogs under the name Big Tent Democrat, at TalkLeft.com took issue with the comments Mr. Obama made yesterday saying that his support for the bill was not politically motivated, but rather represents a genuine policy disagreement with more liberal elements of the Democratic Party:  ""I do not believe Barack Obama. I will go further. I do not want to believe him. Because the alternative is worse. Because if Obama believes the BS he said about the FISA Capitulation bill, then he is not fit to be President. If Barack Obama really believes this about the FISA Capitulation bill, then he is as dangerous as George W. Bush.""   Mr. Obama's vote for the bill, which provides legal immunity for phone companies that participated in the government's wiretapping program, represents a reversal for the presumptive Democratic nominee. He previously opposed that provision. Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, was not present for the vote.   The F.I.S.A. bill passed 69 to 28 in the Senate today, and a number of prominent Democratic senators, including Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Chuck Schumer of New York, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Mr. Obama's former rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, voted against it. (Here's the official tally of individual votes.)  In a statement released by her Senate office today Mrs. Clinton said: ""While this legislation does strengthen oversight of the administration's surveillance activities over previous drafts, in many respects, the oversight in the bill continues to come up short."" The statement continues:  ""...even as we considered this legislation, the administration refused to allow the overwhelming majority of Senators to examine the warrantless wiretapping program. This made it exceedingly difficult for those senators who are not on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees to assess the need for the operational details of the legislation, and whether greater protections are necessary. The same can be said for an assessment of the telecom immunity provisions.  On an issue of such tremendous importance to our citizens  and in particular to New Yorkers  all senators should have been entitled to receive briefings that would have enabled them to make an informed decision about the merits of this legislation. I cannot support this legislation when we know neither the nature of the surveillance activities authorized nor the role played by telecommunications companies granted immunity.""    Blogging on Open Left, Matt Stoller wrote: ""It's interesting to consider how Clinton would have voted were she the nominee, and there's no way to know now."" But, he added, ""kudos to Clinton. It's ironic so far I suppose that Clinton is of late a more reliable ally than Obama, at least on this issue.""   Senator Obama received some support from the blogger HatchInBrooklyn who posted on the popular liberal site, DailyKos, that ""it's time to put the 'Obama Caved On FISA' talk to an end"":  ""The FISA bill is obviously imperfect, but I do not believe that a serious Presidential candidate can afford to vote 'no' on legislation that is intended to help prevent terrorist attacks. If Obama were to oppose the bill as a whole, he would be handing McCain -- who didn't even bother to show up and vote today -- a huge opening to scare voters and paint Obama as weak on terrorism.""   ""No. No no no no no. No,"" replied Josh Orton of MyDD. ""Democrats must always stand against Republicans on national security - because Republicans have proven miserable failures on national security, and yet still try to politically intimidate Democrats by painting them as weaklings yearning to surrender.""  Moe Lane at the conservative blog, Red State, appeared to relish Mr. Obama's stand on the F.I.S.A. bill: ""the netroots went with the equivocator. Barack Obama brazenly lied to them about his intent to filibuster FISA, and they support him anyway. And now they have to go give him some more money, so that he can lie to them some more.""

us,Words and Bridges,"""Where's that confounded bridge?""  -- Led Zeppelin, ""The Crunge""   Cloudy afternoon today, perfect weather for some more work on the song. Sometimes you see something better when the light is indirect and less intense.  I have direction on both a verse and a chorus for what's provisionally called ""It's All Talk"" and some words that are telling me where to go (maybe telling someone else where to go also). But there is something missing that I need to address soon. It'll be a part, or parts, that will help me keep my interest in the song by taking the melody and chords to a whole 'nother place, hopefully doing the same for the attention span of anyone who hears it.   Now, ""Louie Louie,"" by Richard Berry, does not have a bridge. And it's a great, maybe the great, rock and roll song. So bridges are not necessary in the pursuit of a superior song. But they can be a great aid to the songwriter who feels like there's a missing piece that can tie the song together structurally, who wants to pack more song into the song.   When I played in Rittenhouse Square as an impressionable teen rocker, I noticed that my bandmate Mitch Easter wrote tunes that inevitably had a third (or fourth) part, loosely connected to the bulk of the composition.   These sections would drive the band off into another zone entirely, eventually wending their way back to the verses and choruses. Sometimes the melody would stay the same over different chords, sometimes vice versa. Lyrically it was pretty open, too; it could shift to another person's perspective altogether, or it could plumb a different and metaphorical ""depth"" of the theme of the words. You could infuse it with tempo shifts, key changes and lead guitar breaks, and somehow return to the comfort of the established structure.   I've spent the rest of my natural-born adult career adding this fine key to progress to almost all my songs. They are often the most melodic sections, and often they've arrived simply by starting to roll the recording tape at home and seeing where my hands take the chords after the chorus. I've tried on occasion to write the bridge-free song, but I'm not real keen on what I came up with; they seem monochromatic and unfinished.  Usually, a fair amount of time goes into tweaking the front and back end of the bridge. You want to aim for a smooth takeoff and especially a soft landing with your chord progression, or the transitions will be irritating to the ear of the casual listener. Often you have to work backwards for a few chords from the end of the bridge, just to see how to try to connect them seamlessly.  The one in ""Molly Says"" was a lot different before Greg Edward, who produced ""The Sound of Music"" for the dB's in 1987, got a hold of it. It was already the second attempt at a bridge in the song, and Greg left the front alone but retooled the ending so it broke open wide and into a short backward guitar solo. I think it was very succinct, where my earlier attempts had been fussy and overcomplicated.        (""Molly"" has a dwindling structure for its verses. Each one is two lines shorter than its predecessor. So by the time the bridge comes up, it's time to send the song off on a tangent. Lyrically, I've moved to the concept of ""Molly says, in a number of ways, I remind her of her old man."" I tried to flesh it out as smartly as I could. Greg didn't feel that the bridge needed to be quite as long, so he truncated it very nicely.)  Bridges can set up nice, if temporary, modulations into other keys. And they can drag a song's momentum down to a crawl by making the drummer play half-time. A good bridge alone cannot save a bad song, but a bad bridge can ruin a good one.  That said, I am not sure what sort of bridge to put into this song that will make sense. The new regimen of odd little passing chords suggests that the bridge might want to be streamlined and free of filigree. It might benefit from some long, slow lines that iron out the choppiness of the chorus rhythm, so I'll try that. And I'd still like to try making a little ""song within a song"" and see if that's relevant.  But I'm as far away from a guitar right now as I can be -- mine's packed in a truck in New Jersey, I think. I can use my right forearm as a guitar neck if I want to make chords with my left hand's fingers -- fortunately, I'm alone in a hotel room, since it looks a little awkward. At least I don't draw the frets on my arm anymore like I did as a kid.   That kind of desperate move is not really pressing right now. Tomorrow, I'll have my road gear accessible before and after sound check, and that can be where I do my bridge construction.  ****  Meanwhile, I can do a little touch-up on the lyrics I have so far. The situation that was the impetus for the words is still ongoing, but the resolution seems predestined now, which wasn't the case when I started writing the song. Does that change the feeling of the words, now that I know what I'm doing? Maybe a little. I can write it from the end, too, like a bridge. It helps to know the end of the story, but I'd like to make sure there's some of the initial insecurity somewhere inside the first part of the lyrics.   (Photo: A plate of lyrics (Peter Holsapple)) Here are some of my keepers (transcribed from a paper plate I used while camping):   It's all talk, it's all talk What I'm hearing is all talk Take it all with a grain of salt 'Til something happens, I will  Promises made, promises broken Half of what's said is left unspoken Did I hear what I think you said Or was it something else instead?  Oh, the silences you keep Are they special, just for me? And what exactly do you do with your time That it makes it more important than mine?  It's all talk, it's all talk And when it was, it was small talk Handshake and a back pat Couldn't get any smaller than that  I'll do my job and I'll do my best It's up to you to do the rest What you see, well, that's just me But I'll try to be what you want me to be  It's what you want, it's what you have. It's what you need, you understand. It don't come easy and at a price Just come clean and try to play nice.  Well, it's a start.  Several years ago, I was let out of my contract with a major unnamed publishing company with the warning that my songs were too personal. That was a blessing to know. In my efforts to fudge the details in a lyric line, I still need to get the thought across to someone listening. This new song is highly personal, but my hope is that I can make it a little more universal. It could be anyone's situation, and I need to get that across. Anyone who has ever had to go at it with a boss should be able to relate to what I'm saying.  It's not a very sunshiny song, is it.              ",2008-07-09T22:55:35+0000

us,Mountain Madness,"(Photo: Mount McKinley. (Michael DeYoung/Alaska Stock))   For nearly two weeks, a friend of mine had been trying to reach the roof of North America, a place no bigger than a dining room rug, about 200 miles south of the Arctic circle. He's a restless soul, briskly roaming the world in search of thin air before he gets too worn and cautious in late middle-age.   Last I checked, he was pinned at high camp by the kind of storms that keep nearly half of the 1,400 people who attempt to climb Mount McKinley from succeeding. Winds, 60 to 70 miles an hour. Temperatures, even in the first weeks of summer, hovering near zero.   Then came sudden news  a 51-year-old man had died on Denali, as most Alaskans call the mountain. He made it to the top on the Fourth of July, and then collapsed  the first climber ever to die on the mountain's summit. He was buried in a frozen grave at 20,320 feet.  It took a few hours before I confirmed the name of the dead climber. I was relieved, of course, that it was not my friend, but I found no comfort in the details of the death.   The victim, James Nasti from Naperville, Ill., was an experienced mountaineer, with no history of heart trouble, and had shown no signs of altitude sickness. He belonged to a club whose members try to reach the highest point in all 50 states. For James Nasti, Denali was number 49.  Whenever anyone dies in the mountains, I have the same, inevitable conversation with climbing friends. It happened just a month ago, when a 31-year-old man died in a snowstorm during a day hike on Mount Rainier, a big volcano whose summit I've sworn off after a scary climb a couple of years ago.   We always start with this question: How did they mess up? We look for obvious mistakes and easy answers: a rope not properly attached, a crevasse that should never have been crossed and, most often, a weather forecast that went unheeded.   A wise group of Rainier climbing veterans, including some of the first Americans to make it up Mount Everest, have a saying whenever they tell war stories: There are old climbers and bold climbers, but no old, bold climbers.  With mountaineering fatalities, the cases without apparent human error are the most maddening, and troubling.   So it was on Denali. James Nasti was on a guided climb, led by world-class alpinists. By all accounts, he had been cautious, and was in great shape for his age. The weather was fine. He had done nothing foolish, taken no missteps. Having reached the highest point in North America, one of the premier mountaineering achievements in the world, he simply fell back and died, the 101st death on the mountain since 1932. An autopsy, if his body is ever removed, may yet provide some answers.   Then, on Monday, while people were still puzzling over Nasti's collapse, came word of another sudden and seemingly inexplicable death.   A 20-year-old climber from Indonesia, Pungkas Tri Baruno, died near a 17,200-foot base camp while descending from Denali's summit. He stopped walking, stopped breathing, fell to the snow and died, just like James Nasti.  These men, Baruno and Nasti, will soon join the other names on the granite memorial at Denali's base. It doesn't provide much of a consistent narrative, but it does give you a sense of the odds.   For every death on the mountain, about 500 people will make the summit. An 11-year-old boy and a 76-year-old man  the youngest and oldest summiteers  have looked out from that glorious place in the Alaska Range where you run out of earth.   Death can come from crossing the street, or eating a tomato. My first literary agent, a wonderful woman with a full life ahead of her, was killed by a bus in Manhattan. Why not experience the heightened sense of living that comes from getting closer to the edge  controlled risk, in the mountains or on a wild river? So goes my internal palaver whenever I think of what happened on Denali.   The other side of the argument is about loved ones, the people who are left behind.   In his book ""Into Thin Air,"" Jon Krakauer chronicled the deadly 1996 season on Everest, a story of hubris and tragic miscalculations that has since been told from multiple points of view, by various survivors. Climbing Everest, Krakauer wrote, is ""an intrinsically irrational act.""  One of the dead was Scott Fischer, a guide from Seattle. Fischer was charismatic, with chiseled good looks that seemed to come from the mountain gods, an alpine stud in the eyes of his clients. He also had two young kids, who went to the same elementary school as my children.   When Fischer died I saw a mountaineering death, for the first time, from a different point of view: that of the surviving children.   In reading about Jim Nasti's death on the summit of Denali, then, the thing that stayed with me were the details about his family. The calculus of risk is different for everyone. But on the Fourth of July, atop the nation's highest mountain, one man's personal glory was swiftly transformed.  He was mountaineer, a great one for a moment  and then he was a father of three boys gone, a husband no more.   ",2008-07-10T01:33:50+0000

The church's neighborhood, Lower Manhattan, has witnessed a surprising rebirth in the nearly seven years since the destruction of the World Trade Center. A new exhibition, ""Familiar Faces: Portraits of Our Neighbors,"" which opened last week and remains on view through Sept. 14, shows 16 life-size portraits of people working or living in Lower Manhattan, accompanied by their personal stories. (The accompanying slide show includes 15 of the images; one subject consented to being photographed for the exhibition but did not want his image disseminated more widely.)  Curated by Greg Goings, the exhibition was organized by the Trinity Museum inside the church. From Monday to Friday, the museum is open 9 to 11:45 a.m. and 12:45 to 5 p.m.; on Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and on Sunday, 12:30 to 5 p.m. (After Labor Day, the museum will close at 3:45 p.m. daily.)   The curator's introduction to the exhibition quotes Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who wrote, ""I have an affection for a great city. I feel safe in the neighborhood of man, and enjoy the sweet security of the streets.""  The exhibition goes on to explain:   What we found was inspirational. We learned that the barista we buy coffee from is also a writer. We met a high school student with a passion for playing guitar. And we discovered a professional boxer in action at a gym around the corner on Greenwich Street. In the 16 people represented here, there are many stories, and we know that we have only scratched the surface. We hope to meet many more of our neighbors in the future. The next time you see a familiar face in this neighborhood or the neighborhood you come from, say hello. ... you never know the stories you might hear or the friends you might make.

us,Futility Vehicle,"This is a story of selfishness and greed, of self-centeredness, envy and the ignorant folly of a person too short-sighted to realize she should count herself lucky because her college education didn't have to be paid for with the milk of a goat.   The tale could be called: I Can No Longer Afford to Drive My Car.  The vehicle in question is a Land Rover. (2004 Land Rover. Vinyl interior. 33,000 miles. No sun roof. If you're interested.)  It is a big black behemoth that stands more than six feet tall, weighs 6,724 pounds and gets, according to E.P.A. calculations, 11 miles to the gallon in the city, assuming you don't go uphill, stop at stop signs or run the air conditioning.   If you do any of these things, the gas mileage, according to my calculations, falls by about half.  ""You always exaggerate,"" my husband Max always complains.  I don't think I do.  I haven't actually made a formal study of the Land Rover's gas mileage. I've simply stopped driving the car to anywhere other than our metro stop (1.5 miles; about a quarter tank of gas) or the supermarket (.88 miles, maybe an eighth of a tank of gas) or the gas station. Last Sunday, needing to transport a camp trunk, we drove it to Virginia, which was costly (96 miles, perhaps 1,800 tanks of gas), but highly worthwhile, because the driveway leading up to the camp's welcome area was gravelly and steep.  ""She loves this terrain,"" Max said, patting the dashboard.  Why on earth did we buy a car like this?   Well, a lot of people once did. In fact, until late 2004, a lot of people went out of their way to buy precisely these monsters because - if you can believe it - the government actually offered a tax break for buying a car that weighed over 6,000 pounds if you were self-employed and needed it to transport heavy work machinery. Like farm equipment. Or a laptop.   But that's not why we bought ours.   We bought our Land Rover because our friends had one. They were fun, attractive, athletic kinds of people, and it seemed to us that that they had a fun, attractive, athletic kind of a car. A swashbuckling kind of a car. With its extra-high roof rack, its khaki-colored interior, its front end that looked like the face of a panther, their Land Rover looked like it could take you away from Safeway and out on safari.  Our car -- a 1997 Ford Explorer, grabbed on impulse right off the used car lot (wide-bodied seats! cup holders everywhere!) in our first, jet-lagged, giddy days on the ground in America after almost six years overseas -- had died.   And at a time in our lives when our greatest risk-taking consisted in eating off salad bars (Stop! Think of the girls! a voice rang out in my ears today, as my hand hovered, ever so briefly, over the shrimp salad), the Land Rover made life an adventure. The windshield was so high! The blind spot was so wide! The back window so very useless, blocked almost entirely by the spare tire that hung, jauntily, sportily, on the outside! Merely shifting into reverse was an adrenaline rush.   If the Explorer was a car for getting fat in, slurping Big Gulps as your butt expanded to fill the velvety seats, the Land Rover was a car for beating back middle age. Honked at by, say, a mean-looking guy in a convertible as you paused to let traffic pass before making a right turn on red, you could smile, approximate sight through the rear-view mirror and think, Go ahead, make my day. I could crush you like a bug. (Which you could. Which you'd nearly done to a number of smaller cars that had had the misfortune to park right behind you.)  You felt untouchable.   Oh, how are the mighty fallen now.  These days, the Land Rover spends all week in the garage next to the metro station. Every weekend, it sits outside our house, its great cat face gone dim.  I've been feeling quite sorry for it.  But last weekend, I came up with a plan.  Our friends, the friends who inspired the Land Rover purchase, recently bought a beautiful new home. It has a guest house. We're invited to come and stay anytime.   Thinking this over on the long, costly ride back from Virginia on Sunday, I suddenly had a vision: We could park the Land Rover in our backyard. We could take out the seats, put in twin beds and a mini Portosan, and, ipso-presto: we could have a guest house, too.  ""An in-law suite,"" Max enthused.  This encouraged me.  I thought on: Why not, finally, enlarge Emilie's room? We could put the car on stilts, remove the back door, line it up outside her window and give her the additional play space -- already carpeted -- that she needs. (She wants a tree house, too. Easy-peasy: Run up a ladder, and open a door.)  Alternatively: We've long wanted a larger dining room. But bumping out the back of the house is too expensive. We could, instead, ram it in. Drive the car, at top speed, into the dining room. Its trunk could be built-in buffet space. All-American, with a sporty, permanent tailgate theme.  Or: the government could just buy back our Land Rover. They could make us a gun-buyback kind of a deal. We'd bring the car in, no questions asked. Perhaps it could be recycled for use in the Iraqi desert. (""She loves the sand."") We'd get a little reward  the downpayment, perhaps, on a Prius or a Mini Cooper.  I think that these are good ideas.  I think that any one of these very visible, easily replicable, greatly inspiring, teachable examples of large-scale recycling could go a long way toward repaying our debt to society for having bought the big gas guzzler in the first place. At the very least, they should earn us a tax break.   What, you have a problem with the idea of our government subsidizing selfish, wasteful, short-sighted people?  Don't make me laugh.

The 400 or so misdemeanors will remain in Family Court. The change in law was intended to save money by transferring juvenile offenders to the state prison.

us,"Smiling Through, Part 2","The outpouring of replies to the depression column takes me by surprise. But why should it? I know that the number of sufferers is vast, but may be even more so than I thought. As the number of replies ran into the hundreds I began to think that, as with cancer, nearly everyone has been touched by it, if not personally then among relatives and friends.   Like the gay ""love that dared not speak its name,"" depression is now shouting.  As the comments neared 500, the word ""epidemic"" leapt to mind. If it's inappropriate, it can't be by much. What a lot of hellish suffering those replies represent. And those are only the ones who wrote -- always a minority.  The amount of misery reported is stunning. Humbly I thank, in turn, all those so grateful for what I wrote. That gratitude is heartwarming and makes me want to ask what more I can do for you. Or should I say, us?   I think of Tennessee Williams -- a major sufferer -- and the vast body of genius work he was so heroically able to turn out despite the company of his own ""black dog."" (He credited swimming every single day as ""one of my few reliable crutches."")   Video  ""I wasn't aware of it,"" he said on the air when I pointed out to him that in every one of his major plays a character confesses to being up against the dark wall of despair and pleads for advice and is told, in varying words, the same thing. I'll spare you my list, but in ""Streetcar,"" when Stella asks how she can be expected to continue her life -- now with the knowledge that Stanley had raped Blanche -- she is told, ""Honey, you just have to go on.""  The number of readers who have managed  and are managing  just to go on is touching.  Cold comfort, when you're in it. But it's some comfort to bear in mind the fact that depression is ""self-limiting"" -- doctor talk for ""eventually ends."" Of course, it would be nice if they could tell you if you've drawn one of the long straws or a short one.  Having dropped Tennessee's illustrious name here, why not Marlon Brando's? As a man who had entertained a kennel of black dogs in his life, he was keenly interested in the subject. I told him about a show I had done earlier that year (this was in the mid-'70s) with  brace for another whopping name  Laurence Olivier.   Arriving for taping at his and his wife Joan Plowright's suite in New York's Wyndham Hotel, I thought, ""Olivier, for God's sake! I should be jubilant -- and all I want to do is roll up in the rug.""  I knew full well that I was botching it. I'd glance at short notes I'd made with no idea what they meant. My head was saying, The Oliviers aren't stupid. They're acting like I'm okay but they can see I'm bats. I must be taking 10-second pauses, staring into space. I just knew my producer was about to whisper, ""Dick, we're going to wrap this for now. We'll get them back someday. Go on home.""  But I made it to the end, murmured some sort of goodbye to Lord O. and his Lady wife and  fogged  found my way home to bed.  Dialogue in Marlon B.'s bedroom (""Talk is the thing I do best here,"" he said):    M.B.: Did you look at that show? D.C.: God, no. Nothing could make me look at it. M.B.: Do me a favor. Look at it. D.C.: Do you know what you're asking? M.B. [with that penetrating, gnomic stare out of ""Apocalypse Now""]: Yes. But you don't.    Back in New York, with gritted teeth, I got the show out and  fortified with the aid of a Campari and orange juice (that's what Marlon drank, so now I did)  I hauled the tape out and looked at it, prepared to wince pitifully.  A shocker. I was fine. It was as if the show had been re-shot. The sleepy pauses weren't there. My eyes were bright and, at times, sparkly. I was interested. Or appeared so. I was  and still am  amazed.  (Back to the top of Mulholland Drive, chez Brando.)    D.C.: How did you know what I'd see? What was happening to me there?  M.B.: I call it ""automatic pilot."" It takes over and does for you what you can't do yourself. Performers have to have it. Almost everybody has it to some degree. It's a relative of acting.    What good does this story do you?  Since most people can't test this themselves by taping a TV show, feeling lousy during it, and then watching it, I can assure you that whether it's enduring an unwelcome house guest, your co-workers or your tax man, one of the wretched ailment's mysteries is that you are in fact coming off 10 times better than you feel. Or think you look.  Unless you are at hospitalization level, you can, as a number of people wrote, ""fool people at work."" Thanks to ""automatic pilot,"" you can do it. And they're not lying when they say, ""You seemed O.K. to me.""   Keeping that mask on, admittedly, is, exhausting. And you'll reap versions of ""You don't seem bad off.""   (Proofreading this just now, I recalled Woody Allen's asking me once, quite seriously, ""How am I supposed to know that you have depression?"")   Longwindedly, I've already gotten to where ""word count"" tells me to start winding down. So forgetting about style and literary flow, l'll just tick off some random shots on this subject, some from the mail.  **********  I've decided that the single worst thing about this illness is its terrible authority. I mean the way it thunders at you, ""This is the reality. This is how it is and how it's going to be. Any memories of fun or wellness are flukes, delusions. And will never come again. Now you have 20/20 vision and see life for the dreadful mess it really is.""  *****   Whatever wicked gods that invented this torture should come down with it.  *****  It's heartbreaking when one reader says ""I need help. Can someone please tell me what to do."" Ask your doctor to find you a good psychopharmacologist. In people talk, a pill doctor of the mind. And I don't mean an herbalist or a swami or a ""psychic"" or a Scientologist or a phrenologist, but someone with a degree in mind medicine. Your doctor can find one. If he can't, get a new doctor.  *****  Although on my PBS show I once accused the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  an endearing old coot (who developed Transcendental Meditation)  of selling water (before they actually did), I don't belittle meditation. It's good, a quickly learned discipline, and its effect is cumulative.  *****  (As close as anything on this subject can come to humor: A psychiatrist I knew tried meditation for his depression but was poorly taught -- ""All I could meditate on was my suicide."")  *****  The lady's right who pointed out that you at least do feel better when exercising. One prominent head doc urged it on me strongly, saying, ""I'm a great believer in endorphins."" Of course it may take an hour to find your shoes. And to tie them. And find the door. And...  *****  I got a huge laugh ""lecturing"" to an entire audience of shrinks at Johns Hopkins  contrasting smartly with my audience of sufferers in Omaha  when one asked, as some readers have, ""Do you recommend psychoanalysis while in depression?"" My answer: ""Mostly you don't know what's being said to you, you can't follow the line of talk, you barely know what you yourself are saying and you can't remember anything afterwards."" ""A waste of time?"" he asked. ""Not totally,"" I said, ""because you do get a tiny little rise in self-esteem from keeping the appointment."" (I was only half kidding and a bit startled by the robust laughter.)  *****  If you've got a solid case of it, I don't think you should drive. Not only do you forget to look left and right, but I remember thinking how easy it would be to pull in front of an oncoming car on the highway. Someone's alive because I didn't. When people are shocked at this it's because they can't picture being unable to assign any value to themselves, let alone some faceless stranger  who probably also knows how awful life is anyway.   *****  I looked forward to the dentist because by refusing the anesthetic needle, I'd be able to feel something.  *****  Thanks to the lady who boldly brought up sex; or rather, the death of it. As the old Dark Enemy approaches, the poor old libido throws up the white flag and -- as they used to say  ""surrenders at the first whiff of grape."" ( I assume the reference is to grapeshot.)   Someone noted that arousal is possible. It is, but with the devilish little proviso that you are invariably denied the, um, ultimate payoff. Sex in the manic phases can spring to life quite abruptly  sometimes dangerously  manifesting itself, as the ads say, ""in a variety of decorator colors.""  *****  Dear ""CAREY, US ARMY"": Do you really think that keeping guns out of the hands of the suicidal is a serious threat to your dear 2nd amendment? I may have misread you. Even Scalia, and  one assumes  his papoose, Clarence Thomas, didn't want that.  *****  Funny how people will say, ""Do celebrities get depression? I mean, they're rich and famous."" Most are famous and some still rich, but yes, they succumb like flies. As poor Hamlet said, ""O, I could tell youbut let it be.""  *****  I'll tell you one. The great actor Rod Steiger to whom Brando in ""On the Waterfront"" said, ""Charlie, I coulda been a contenda."" It was scary to hear him tell it.  In a monumental bout, which he barely survived, he said he lived in bed for months. (""If I brushed my teeth it was a big day."")  After it was over, he was able to (almost) joke that at least his suicide plan was ""thoughtful"" and showed consideration for others. He said, ""I planned to row way out off Laguna beach,. hang over the side of the boat with one arm..and blow my brains out. No one would have to find me. No one would have to clean up."" Luckily for us, he survived to make many more movies.  *****  Artistic types seem to be especially vulnerable and to suffer just as badly as the unlucky mail carrier who gets it. You can imagine how often the envied celebrity gets the criminal question: ""What reason have you got to be depressed?"" (Would these people, in an influenza epidemic, ask the shivering, chattering victim, ""What reason have you got to be sickly?"")  *****  It was good to see how, as the list of comments from readers lengthened, a sort of community seemed to form. People thanked other writers for their words and offered comfort and welcome sympathy. See, Candy Asman, RN, to the plaintive and suffering Ms. Melone. If I were Joseph Pulitzer, Candy, I would give you a prize. And a Nobel, for good measure.   *****  Deeply felt complaints about bum treatment got aired and exchanged. Dear Lisa Your therapist should be pushing a cart in the garment district.   *****  A woman friend named Aden Pryor, possessing both brains and wit  that combination so disconcerting to so many men  put the case quite brilliantly with, ""When you're in it, the brain can only process negative information.""   *****   A few admitted to resorting to booze. I almost can't type the next few words, but . . . it will make you feel better. Briefly. Then worse. And if you forget that, crochet a sampler (or get someone to make one for you) and mount it above the liquor cabinet. It should read: ""Remember: Alcohol Depresses the Central Nervous System!"" (Do we really want, just for that mere moment, to make things worse?)  **********  Sorry for the length of this. It's just an inexhaustible subject.  Closing in a lighter vein, once at Oxford a languid Brit part-time professor (and full-time fop) was cooing to me at an academic cocktail party about what he called "" this depression business.""  ""Depression,"" he announced, ""is for sniveling little neurotics.""  ""How, then,"" I asked, ""have you escaped it?  I have no memory of what happened next. ",2008-07-12T01:26:17+0000

The other object is a bronze calyx krater dating from around 340 B.C. that Greek archaeologists say was probably found in illegal excavations of a royal tomb.

us,Finding the Darkness Within the Perky," FOR a while Emily Mortimer seemed to specialize in characters not unlike herself: sweet, vulnerable, even a little scattered or ditzy. She was a neurotic, insecure actress in Nicole Holofceners Lovely and Amazing; Steve Martins hapless, bumbling assistant in the Pink Panther remake; and, in the role that probably put her on the map, the oblivious upper-class wife of the brooding Jonathan Rhys Myers character in Woody Allens Match Point. In that film her rival for Mr. Rhys Myerss attention was Scarlett Johansson, and the difference between the women told the whole story: Ms. Johansson was ripe and simmeringly sexy, while Ms. Mortimer, with her bangs and swanlike neck, was innocent and winsome in an almost Audrey Hepburnesque way. Her perkiness was both endearing and a little annoying. ",2008-07-13T04:00:00+0000

Few books have combined the historical scope and the literary skill to give the foreign reader a sense of events from a Vietnamese perspective. Le Ly Hayslips When Heaven and Earth Changed Places gave us the war through the eyes of a South Vietnamese peasant girl turned sex worker, while Nguyen Qui Ducs Where the Ashes Are told us what it was like to watch his father, a high-ranking official in Hue, be taken captive by the Vietcong.

us,Will Little Havana Go Blue?,"On the surface, political life in Cuban Miami seems unchanged. Little Havana is still partly a Disney version of a displaced Cuba and partly a genuine community hub, where families who have long since left for suburbia still come for nostalgic weekend lunches. At the Versailles Restaurant, the community newspapers preaching no compromise with Castro are all that are on offer. For almost four decades, the Versailles has been an obligatory stop for Washington politicians courting the Cuban-American community, visits that, as photographs in the restaurant attest, have often involved putting on a white guayabera, the four-pocket dress shirt that often replaces a coat and tie in the Caribbean. This familiar theater of intransigence  a staple of South Florida life at least since the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, when C.I.A.-backed Cuban exiles tried to overthrow the new Communist regime  is ubiquitous. Some Cuban-Americans point hopefully to a softening in the Spanish-language, Cuba-focused radio outlets that now dominate the South Florida market. But for an outsider, what is striking is the degree to which the hard-line stance endures, since it might have been supposed that 50 years of failure to influence events on the island might have led to the conclusion that the hard-line position needed to be reconsidered. Most officeholders in Florida and, for that matter, most national politicians continue to at least pay lip service to the dream of a post-Communist Cuba, even though, early this year, Fidel Castro succeeded in seamlessly handing over power to his brother Ral  testimony, if any was needed, to the stability of the regime.

In the Northeast alone, nearly 20,000 farms are run by women, some of whom are shown on the following pages. Whether raising heritage livestock, combing the woods for exotic morsels or coaxing delicacies from the ground, these women forge new bonds between field and table, strengthening the connection between things we love to eat and the stewardship that makes them possible.

I hope they dont party too hard at eBay not only because Tiffany is sure to appeal but also because it has lost three similar cases in Europe, brought by Rolex, Hermes and Louis Vuitton.

us,Let's Get Rid of Darwinism,"(The third part in a series celebrating Charles Darwin.)   Charles Darwin was a giant. He did not merely write ""On the Origin of Species""  one of the most important books ever written by anyone  in which he describes how evolution by natural selection works, and what some of its consequences and implications are. He also wrote  and this list is not exhaustive a treatise on the formation of coral reefs that is still thought to be correct; a definitive monograph on barnacles, both extinct and extant; a book about how earthworms make soil; a now-classic text on carnivorous plants (the ones, like Venus fly-traps, that ensnare and digest insects); a book about the strange ways that orchids get themselves fertilized; and an account of the five years he spent aboard the ship HMS Beagle, which has become a classic of travel writing.   As if that wasn't enough, he proposed sexual selection  the idea that decorations and ornaments, like peacocks' tails, evolve because females in many species prefer to mate with the most beautiful males. Sexual selection has since become a major field of research in its own right.   In short, Darwin did more in one lifetime than most of us could hope to accomplish in two. But his giantism has had an odd and problematic consequence. It's a tendency for everyone to refer back to him. ""Why Darwin was wrong about X""; ""Was Darwin wrong about Y?""; ""What Darwin didn't know about Z""  these are common headlines in newspapers and magazines, in both the biological and the general literature. Then there are the words: Darwinism (sometimes used with the prefix ""neo""), Darwinist (ditto), Darwinian.  Why is this a problem? Because it's all grossly misleading. It suggests that Darwin was the beginning and the end, the alpha and omega, of evolutionary biology, and that the subject hasn't changed much in the 149 years since the publication of the ""Origin.""   He wasn't, and it has. Although several of his ideas  natural and sexual selection among them  remain cornerstones of modern evolutionary biology, the field as a whole has been transformed. If we were to go back in a time machine and fetch him to the present day, he'd find much of evolutionary biology unintelligible  at least until he'd had time to study genetics, statistics and computer science.   Oh, there would be so much to tell him! A full list would take me weeks to write out. But the obvious place to begin would be the discoveries of genetics, especially DNA. We'd have to explain that cells in each organism contain a code describing how to build that organism, written in chemical form  DNA  that evolutionary forces are constantly rewriting. Indeed, the study of DNA allows us to see the action of natural selection on a molecule-by-molecule basis. We can see the genes where natural selection acts to prevent evolutionary change, those where it drives change and those where it has no effect at all.  Then there's the fusion of genetics with natural selection, which has enormously expanded our understanding of how natural selection can work. For example, it has led to the discovery that natural selection does not just shape individuals  the length of a beak, the color of a fin. It can also act on family groups, and thus drive the evolution of cooperation and other altruistic behaviors.   The reason is that evolutionary success can now be measured in terms of the number of genes an individual contributes to the next generation. Anyone who dies without reproducing does not directly contribute any. But because individuals have some genes in common with their family members, they can make an indirect genetic contribution if they help their relations to reproduce instead of reproducing themselves. Such ""kin selection"" is thought to have contributed to the evolution of the social insects  especially, ants, bees, wasps and termites  where only a few individuals reproduce and everyone else looks after the offspring.  We'd want to discuss evolution beyond natural selection  the other forces that can sometimes cause (or prevent) evolutionary change. For although natural selection is the only creative force in evolution  the only one that can produce complex structures such as wings and eyes  it is not the only force that affects which genes will spread, and which will vanish.   And, and, and.   What would he make of it all?   I think his reaction would be a mix of satisfaction and astonishment. Satisfaction: that natural selection has turned out to be such a powerful idea, explaining such a wide range of phenomena. Astonishment: for the same reason. He would, I think, be fascinated by the weird natural history that has been discovered in the past 150 years  such as Wolbachia, bacteria that pervert the reproduction of insects for their own ends. (Wolbachia can have a number of effects, but one of the most common is to kill all a female's sons. The reason is that sons don't transmit Wolbachia, so from Wolbachia's point of view, they are a waste of space.) I'm not sure he'd enjoy analyzing DNA sequences  he might find it a bit too abstracted from the living organism  but I think he'd be delighted to learn the results. I think he would be shocked by how much we know about the so-called model organisms  worms, toads, fruit flies, mice, humans and the bacterium E. coli  and how little we know about everything else. And I think he'd be startled by the nature of scientific research  the scale of the enterprise, the cost, the pressures to publish and the degree of specialization that results. His brand of science  20 years of thinking about a problem before publishing  could not be done today.   But I digress. To return to my argument: I'd like to abolish the insidious terms Darwinism, Darwinist and Darwinian. They suggest a false narrowness to the field of modern evolutionary biology, as though it was the brainchild of a single person 150 years ago, rather than a vast, complex and evolving subject to which many other great figures have contributed. (The science would be in a sorry state if one man 150 years ago had, in fact, discovered everything there was to say.) Obsessively focusing on Darwin, perpetually asking whether he was right about this or that, implies that the discovery of something he didn't think of or know about somehow undermines or threatens the whole enterprise of evolutionary biology today.  It does not. In the years ahead, I predict we will continue to refine our understanding of natural selection, and continue to discover new ways in which it can shape genes and genomes. Indeed, as genetic data continues to flood into the databanks, we will be able to ask questions about the detailed workings of evolution that it has not been possible to ask before.  Yet all too often, evolution  insofar as it is taught in biology classes at all  is taught as the story of Charles Darwin. Then the pages are turned, and everyone settles down to learn how the heart works, or how plants make energy from sunshine, or some other detail. The evolutionary concepts that unify biology, that allow us to frame questions and investigate the glorious diversity of life  these are ignored.  Darwin was an amazing man, and the principal founder of evolutionary biology. But his was the first major statement on the subject, not the last. Calling evolutionary biology ""Darwinism,"" and evolution by natural selection ""Darwinian"" evolution, is like calling aeronautical engineering ""Wrightism,"" and fixed-wing aircraft ""Wrightian"" planes, after those pioneers of fixed-wing flight, the Wright brothers. The best tribute we could give Darwin is to call him the founder  and leave it at that. Plenty of people in history have had an -ism named after them. Only a handful can claim truly to have given birth to an entire field of modern science.   **********  NOTES:  A full account of the range of Darwin's activities and accomplishments can be found in any biography. Many publications are guilty of the ""Was Darwin wrong?"" trope, and some of the biggest quarrels in modern evolutionary biology have concerned the validity of ""non-Darwinian"" evolution. A number of popular accounts discuss aspects of modern evolutionary biology; one of the best is ""The Ancestor's Tale,"" by Richard Dawkins. Much has been written about male-killing by Wolbachia; see, for example, Jiggins, F. M., Hurst, G. D. D., Dolman, C. E., and Majerus, M. E. N. 2000. ""High-prevalence male-killing Wolbachia in the butterfly Acraea encedana."" Journal of Evolutionary Biology 13: 495-501.

The orchestras board of directors made what it called a last-ditch contract offer that reduced a previously proposed pay cut of 40 percent to 27 percent, The Columbus Dispatch reported on Tuesday. One of the conditions, though, would have been the firing of the music director, Junichi Hirokami, and using his salary for the extra pay, according to the Dispatch report, which was confirmed Wednesday by Tony Beadle, the orchestras executive director. The musicians rejected the offer, though the two sides remain in mediation. Mr. Hirokami has been an outspoken critic of the board. Mr. Beadle has said that the conductor failed to spend enough time in Columbus to help with fund-raising or to tend to the orchestra. Some orchestra members countered that Mr. Beadle himself had not settled down in Columbus, maintaining his home and family in Boston. Im here seven days a week, Mr. Beadle responded, saying that he returns on weekends only when there are no concerts, and that his family is in Boston for personal reasons.

The decision is intended to end monopoly agreements that allow artists to collect payments only from agencies in their own countries. These monopolies have also made it difficult for online music stores to buy licenses across Europe. Rights to music in Europe are sold separately in each country, which has made it difficult for companies like iTunes to set up a single, continentwide store because they must obtain a license from each European country.

us,Paper Cuts: The New Poet Laureate,"Kay Ryan has been named poet laureate of the United States, replacing Charles Simic. According to the website of the Library of Congress, the laureate is ""the nation's official lightning rod for the poetic impulse of Americans,"" which sounds deliciously sordid and possibly painful, but mostly means that the laureate acts as Chief Diplomat for the Art. This could be a little tricky for Ryan, since she's responsible for perhaps the most hilariously skeptical article ever published about a writers' conference (although this one is pretty good too).   Anyway, Ryan's a terrific poet. She was born in California in 1945 and has published six collections; her most recent, ""The Niagara River,"" was reviewed by David Kirby for the Book Review here. Ryan has a distinctive and widely imitated style that involves steep enjambment, carefully positioned but irregular rhymes and a kind of off-kilter aphoristic wisdom. For instance, here's ""Felix Crow"":   Crow school is basic and short as a rule just the rudiments of quid pro crow for most students. Then each lives out his unenlightened span, adding his bit of blight to the collected history of pushing out the sweeter species; briefly swaggering the swagger of his aggravating ancestors down my street. And every time I like him when we meet.  You can see a bit of Marianne Moore in this, and more than a bit of Stevie Smith (about whom Ryan has written smartly and sympathetically). Any way you look at it, it's fine work. So here's to you, Kay Ryan  you won't get 100 and a butt of sack (the traditional payment for Britain's Poet Laureate), but if you're lucky, you may follow in the footsteps of former Laureate Robert Pinksy and judge a Meta-Free-Phor-All between Stephen Colbert and Sean Penn.

You hear people complaining about this approach, of course, some of which are legitimate: Apple's taking a 30 percent cut of every program sold; Apple's copy-protecting every program; Apple's maintaining veto power over programs it doesn't like (or that may compete with its products and services).   But there are some enormous benefits to this setup, too. First, the whole universe of software programs is in one place. Second, Apple says that it checks every program to make sure it runs decently (more on this in a moment).  Third, the store is beautifully integrated with the iPhone itself, making it fast, simple and idiot-proof to download and install new software morsels.  I haven't been through all 550 programs yet. But I've already got some favorites.   Some are in the category I'd call Features the iPhone Doesn't Have By Itself. For example:  * Radio. AOL Radio, for example, is a free program that delivers over 200 Internet radio stations, organized by musical genre. No charge. (The music stops when you switch to another program, but you can't have everything.)  Or go for Pandora instead. Not only does it play free Internet radio, but you can hit Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down buttons to rate the songs you're hearing. Over time, Pandora sends you more and more of the kinds of songs you like, and fewer of the ones you don't.   * Voice recording. The iPhone is a gadget with a microphone, speaker, and storage, but it can't record lectures, concerts, notes to self, and so on--at least not without the assistance of Voice Record.   * Drawing program. Etch a Sketch: just what it says. Shake the iPhone to erase your drawing.  * Instant messaging. Now there's an AIM program for the iPhone. A little buggy, but give it time.   * Video recording. The iPhone can take still pictures, but can't capture video. Or at least not until iPhoneVideoRecorder comes along. It's currently available only as a hack, but the company says that it will be listed in the App Store shortly.  I also love programs that exploit the iPhone's features in a way that would never work on any other phone. For example:  * Remote. If you use your Mac or PC as a jukebox, playing your iTunes music collection, you'll love this one. This amazing free program turns the iPhone into a Wi-Fi, whole-house remote control. It actually displays your playlists and album art--from your computer, elsewhere in the house--and lets you play, stop, change tracks, adjust volume, and so on.  * Shazam. Hold your iPhone up to a radio or TV that's playing some pop song. Marvel as Shazam identifies the song, the band, and the album, and offers a one-tap way to buy it from iTunes. (Midomi is similar, except that you can actually hum or say the lyrics of a song to have it identified.)  * Super MonkeyBall, Cro-Mag Rally. A lot of iPhone games rely on the accelerometer (tilt sensor). That is, you tip and turn the whole phone to guide your monkey/race car/whatever through the course.   Finally, I just love goofy little apps like Rotary Dialer, which lets you actually dial your iPhone by sticking your finger into the onscreen holes of an old-style, rotary dial phone. Crazy Eye and Crazy Mouth kept my youngest son occupied just about forever.  Now, a lot of this stuff is sort of buggy. Some programs crash instantly (taking you back to your Home screen); some crash the whole iPhone (taking you back to the Apple logo as the thing restarts).  It's a good idea to remember that you can force-quit a locked-up program by holding down the Home button for several seconds, or force-restart the whole iPhone by holding Home and the Sleep switch simultaneously until the phone restarts.   But that's a small price to pay for the experience of watching this phone blossom into an entirely new class of machine. ",2008-07-17T14:58:30+0000

Writing about his friendship with Robert Redford in The New Yorker, James Salter said that when I went into restaurants with Redford, eyes turned to watch as we crossed the room  the glory seems to be yours as well. But celebrity came with a cost; Salter remembered Redfords saying of movies: My presence in something is enough to give it an aura of artificiality. If people buy celebrity perfumes, it is precisely because the glory seems to be yours as well. Yet the celebrities dont make the perfumes; professional perfumers do. Celebrity inexorably lends an aura of artificiality, and not just to the celebrity scent; it extends to us as well. We are, at best, torn.The fact of the matter is that some celebrity perfumes are just as good as those from fashion designers. Others are better. We often forget that a designers name on a scent is no more logical than that of a 20-year-old singer/actress. Before Gabrielle Chanel claimed perfume for fashion designers in 1921, it had been the exclusive territory of perfumers (see: Guerlain, Daltroff, Coty). If fragrance is now to be given to Hilary Duff  whose Wikipedia entry includes the music genre bubblegum pop  and her colleagues, so be it.

But all of the 15 teams offering projections say ice extent will remain well below the average for the last quarter century and a downward trend in summer ice around the North Pole has not abated. As Ive discussed before, the sea ice around Antarctica in winter has been expanding of late (theres virtually none in the austral summer). The Antarctic sea-ice changes are consistent with expectations in a warming world, some experts say.)

us,Trust Buster,"""Viewed purely in the abstract, I think there can be no question that women should have equal rights with men,"" Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his college senior essay, in the spring of 1880.  John McCain, who last week named Roosevelt as the model for his particular maverick brand of reformist, environmentalist, Big Stick conservatism, has a very similar take on the question of women's equality.   He, too, is all for it  in the abstract.  ""I am committed to making sure that there is equal pay for equal work, that there is equal opportunity in every aspect of our society and in our economy,"" he said last Friday, capping off the presidential campaign's Week of the Woman with a ""women only"" town hall meeting in Hudson, Wisc. ""Women in America not only take care of their children, manage the household budgets and balance the pressures of work and family, they also run many of the enterprises that keep our economy running.""   He is committed, he added on his campaign bus, ""to encourage the participation of women in all walks of life and make sure that any barriers to their advancement are eliminated.""  That's all good, in the abstract.   In real life, it's another story.  McCain has opposed legislation aimed at helping women sue in cases of pay discrimination on the grounds that it could make businesses vulnerable to frivolous lawsuits. He criticized Barack Obama's latest woman-friendly proposals -- guaranteed sick days and more family leave -- as ""big-government"" extravagances. He has voted to restrict women's access not just to abortion but to birth control and affordable prenatal health care, and -- though his own memory failed him in recalling this last week -- he voted against legislation that would have required insurance companies to include contraceptives as part of their prescription drug coverage.  In other words, he has time after time put up roadblocks to any legislative measures that could help make women's abstract equality a reality. While that's standard Republican politics, it's not really the stuff of a maverick -- particularly not one who's now trying his darndest, via the surrogacy work of former Hewlett-Packard chief Carly Fiorina, to woo Hillary Clinton's most die-hard female supporters.   Teddy Roosevelt had some issues with the ladies, too.  Though he advocated legal equality, equal standing in marriage, educating women and paying them a minimum wage, and on at least one occasion spoke out for equal pay, his proto-egalitarianism ran aground upon his  much stronger, one might say, hysterical  pro-natalism. His belief, in particular, that white, Protestant women had to pop out as many babies as they physically could to fend off the threat of ""race suicide,"" pretty well delimited the range of human possibility that he afforded the female gender. ""I believe that man and woman should stand on an equality of right, but I do not believe that equality of right means identity of functions; and I am more and more convinced that the great field, the indispensable field, for the usefulness of woman is as the mother of the family,"" he once wrote. The fact that a life of nonstop child-bearing was not necessarily one in which all the other rights he defended could be exercised did not appear to unduly trouble him.  But Roosevelt was practicing politics 100 years ago.  What excuse is there, in 2008, for a politician who pretends to be a great friend to women while continuing to block any possible legislative changes that might actually improve women's lives?  The wink-wink excuse for McCain's hypocrisy, for the contradictions between his good-guy persona and not-so-good-guy politics, is that he has to hold his nose and keep his bread buttered with the religious right. Another explanation is that, like our current good-guy president, McCain is a man blinded by ideology  in this case, by that rough-rider rugged individualism thing that he so admires and that is so inimical to real, functional gender equality.  Or it could be something else, something much more basic at work, something that, I think, showed very clearly in McCain's expression last week, as he fought, more or less successfully, to suppress a joke and the naughtiest bit of a giggle after reporters demanded a response to remarks by Fiorina in which the clearly unscripted surrogate had complained about the unfairness of health insurers reimbursing Viagra but not birth control.  You could see it in his mouth, in his eyes as, for a full five seconds, McCain worked to remake a face that said, Give me a break, will you? Don't you know that I just don't care?.  Teddy Roosevelt, remembered today as a big proponent of women's suffrage, admitted in a letter once that, when it came to the woman's vote, he too didn't really care. ""Personally I believe in woman's suffrage, but I am not an enthusiastic advocate of it, because I do not regard it as a very important matter,"" he wrote from the White House in 1908. A big part of the reason: women themselves, he said, appeared to be mostly ""lukewarm"" on the issue. ""I am very certain,"" he said, ""that when women as a whole take any special interest in the matter they will have suffrage if they desire it.""  McCain, as he casts for votes among Hillary's last angry hold-outs, seems to be banking upon finding women who are similarly lukewarm to their interests.   Let's hope that he's wrong.

Ms. Heigl, 29, who plays the resident Izzie on the medical drama, said last month that she had removed herself from the running for an Emmy nomination because she felt she was not given the material this season to warrant one. The comment fueled talk that Ms. Heigl, a star of Knocked Up and 27 Dresses, wanted to leave the show to pursue movie projects. On Wednesday Mr. McPherson called the turmoil unfortunate but dismissed talk that she would leave the cast. Theres an unbelievable story line for her this year, which is really central to everything thats going to go on this season, he said.

us,"Guerras Lyrics, Translated into English"," Translations by Seth Kugel  Nigara en Bicicleta (Niagara Falls on a Bicycle)   I fainted one Sunday morning When I least expected it. I fell hard, like a soursop fruit, onto a sewer grate.  Is it my blood pressure? Or has my bilirubin level gone up?  I got a fever, And started to turn white as a mothball. They took me to a hospital of the people -- supposedly. In the emergency room, the receptionist was listening to the lottery numbers. (30,000 pesos!)  Someone take pity on me! I shouted, losing consciousness, And a nurse approached my ear and said Calm down, Bobby, calm down. [A phrase used to talk to a dog]   She caressed me with her Ben Gay hands and asked me What happened, champ? And I told her, in intimate detail, what had happened to me.  Weve got to check your blood pressure,  but the room is occupied. And, my dear, in this hospital theres no electricity for an EKG.  I opened my eyes like the full moon,  and I grabbed my head, Because its very hard  To cross Niagara Falls on a bicycle.  Dont tell me that the doctors are gone. Dont tell me that you dont have anesthesia. Dont tell me that someone drank the alcohol, And that the thread for stitches  Has been sewn into a tablecloth.  Dont tell me that the forceps are lost, And the stethoscope is off partying, That the x-ray machine has burnt out, And the serum has been used to sweeten the coffee.  I leaned on her shoulders like a lame man leans on his crutch And I told her What should I do, princess? And on a prescription slip she wrote very sweetly Im sorry, champ.  She caressed me with her Ben Gay hands and went on her way, And I heard her clearly when she said to another patient Calm down, Bobby, calm down.  I dropped my eyes to half-mast and I grabbed my head, Because its very hard  To cross Niagara Falls in a bicycle.  SPANISH  Me dio una sirimba un domingo en la maana cuando menos lo pensaba ca redondo, como una guanbana, sobre la alcantarilla ser la presin o me ha subido la bilirrubina  Y me entr la calentura y me fui poniendo blanco como bola (d)e naftalina me llevaron a un hospital de gente (supuestamente) en la Emergencia, el recepcionista escuchaba la lotera (treinta mil pesos!)  Alguien se apiade de mi! grit perdiendo el sentido y una enfermera se acerc a mi oreja y me dijo: ""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""  Me acarici con sus manos de BenGay y me dijo: ""Qu le pasa, atleta?"" y le cont con lujo de detalles lo que me haba sucedido  Hay que chequearte la presin pero la sala est ocupada y, mi querido en este hospital no hay luz para un electrocardiograma  Abr los ojos como luna llena y me agarr la cabeza porque es muy duro pasar el Nigara en bicicleta  No me digan que los mdicos se fueron no me digan que no tienen anestesia no me digan que el alcohol se lo bebieron y que el hilo de coser fue bordado en un mantel  No me digan que las pinzas se perdieron que el estetoscopio est de fiesta que los rayos X se fundieron y que el suero ya se us para endulzar el caf  Me apoy de sus hombros como un cojo a su muleta y le dije: ""Qu hago, princesa?"" y en un papel de receta me escribi muy dulcemente: ""Lo siento, atleta""  Me acarici con sus manos de BenGay y sigui su destino y o claramente cuando dijo a otro paciente: ""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""  Baj los ojos a media asta y me agarr la cabeza porque es muy duro pasar el Nigara en bicicleta  ***  La Hormiguita (The Little Ant)    ENGLISH  I met her one afternoon. With her guitar she was chasing down boleros She had on jeans And a yellow rose in her hair. What are you going to do? she asked me, smiling. Whatever you want, I responded. We went to the sea and soaked our dreams I winked at her, and a dolphin painted an undulating wave on her breast Then I laughed And we broke the ice And nibbled our fingers Like the viola during a cello solo.  [Chorus] You are like a little ant, Who kisses and nibbles me Who runs across my back  And settles in my beard to study geography.  Youre like a trapeze artist Who swings across my tongue. Your circus of flowers  Picks me up and lets me go, Losing count, Losing count.  And I wanted to weep, but only from my right eye. She spoke of the moon And of Chopin While I played Prelude to a Kiss. Then I laughed, and we broke the ice. We nibbled our fingers Like a viola during a cello solo.  [Chorus]   SPANISH La conoc una tarde con su guitarra cazaba boleros tena puesto un jean y una rosita amarilla en el pelo  Qu vas a hacer, me pregunt, sonriendo lo que t quieras, respond fuimos al mar y mojamos los sueos gui mis ojos y un delfn pint una ola rizada en su pecho  Luego re y rompimos el hielo y rompimos el hielo nos mordimos los dedos como viola en un solo de chelo  [Chorus] Eres como una hormiguita que me besa y me pica que recorre mi espalda y se acuesta en mi barba a estudiar geografa  Eres como un trapecista que atraviesa mi lengua y tu circo de flores me carga y me suelta perdiendo la cuenta perdiendo la cuenta  Y tuve ganas de llorar pero tan slo en mi ojo derecho ella hablaba de la luna y de Chopin y yo tocaba el Preludio de un beso   Si T No Bailas Conmigo (If You Dont Dance With Me)  ENGLISH  The moon with the rosemary, The dawn with a pine grove, The wind with the tide, And the wheat with the canopy.

The basil has some thyme Waiting for her in the rose garden.  Ive seen a starry sky Dancing on the sea.  Ive seen a disheveled sun Dance with a cloud. The butterfly danced With a grain of salt.  The acacia tree with the mill The grass and a thicket of bushes. If you dont dance with me, I prefer not to dance.  The cassava with ginger In a mortar for mashing  Starched each other with kisses Clutched tightly in a waltz. And even the white lily Has someone to dance with.

us,Intellectual Dishonesty on Sex Bias?,"Well, we have no shortage of debate material, thanks to the couple of hundred Lab readers who responded to my request for evidence of bias against women scientists (and my column.). Thanks for your contributions. Let's start with Yolio's complaint that I was guilty of ""intellectual dishonesty"":  For example, you cite the high proportions of female students in some fields, and neglect to follow up by mentioning the low proportion of female faculty in these same fields. It seems that you are trying to mislead your readers about the true status of women in science.  I realize that omission seems strange, because the Title Niners (as I call the advocates of applying Title IX to science) have been highlighting the percentage of female science professors ever since the much-publicized 1999 report on bias at M.I.T. (In her harsh critique of the report, Judith Kleinfeld of the University of Alaska called that statistic ""the single piece of hard evidence"" in the entire study.) It can be quite effective in a congressional hearing or press release to point out that women get 15 to 20 percent of doctorates in physics but make up just 5 percent of full professors.   But this year's Ph.D.'s do not instantly turn into full professors, and faculties do not magically turn over every year. In fact, as Gary Becker complains, low turnover has become especially problematic since universities were forced in 1994 (by a federal law banning age discrimination) to end the tradition of mandatory retirement for tenured professors at age 65. So it's taking some time for the recent surge in female students to show up in faculties.  The more relevant question (as the Title Niners acknowledge in the better reports if you read past the executive summaries) is whether there's a ""leaky pipeline"": whether female grad students go on to get doctorates and teaching positions at the same rate as male grad students.   In my column I cited the example of physics, a field that was singled out for some of first Title IX investigations on campus because it has one of the biggest gender gaps. A 2005 report by the American Institute of Physics pointed to figures (from 2002) showing that women constituted 5 percent of full professors, 11 percent percent of associate professors and 16 percent of assistant professors. The A.I.P. researchers, Rachel Ivie and Kim Nies Ray, write:   Some might look at these numbers and conclude that the pipeline is indeed leaking for women. There are fewer women at the upper levels of academic physics than at the lower levels. However, before we can determine if and where the pipeline is disproportionately losing women, we must look at the pool of available women, or at the lag time between earning a physics degree and advancing to the next level. For example, we cannot expect 20% of the physics faculty to be women if, in the past, women earned a much smaller percentage of physics Ph.D.'s.    The researchers reported that physics graduate students spent seven years, on average, to get their doctorates. When they compared students who entered graduate school in 1996 with the ones who got doctorates seven years later, they found about the same percentage of women (18 percent of the entering students; 17 percent of the Ph.D.'s.)   And when the researchers similarly adjusted for the average time lag between getting a doctorate and reaching each stage of the teaching ladder, they found that women were actually a little more likely to be get teaching jobs. Women made up 12 percent of the hiring pool for assistant professors but constituted 16 percent of the assistant professors. Among associate professors, they made up 9 percent of the hiring pool and 11 percent of the ones hired; among full professors, they were 4 percent of the pool but 5 percent of the ones hired.  That's one study and one discipline. On Monday I'll look at some other disciplines, including chemistry. Let me know if you have any thoughts on the chemistry pipeline, and whether women with chemistry doctorates are being excluded from academia or are choosing careers outside academia. I'll consider statistics from a 2006 report from the National Academy of Sciences and the 2007 Nelson Diversity Survey (recommended in a comment from Female Mathematician). I'll also be dealing with an issue raised by some readers on the pipeline into the top-rated science departments.  Let me know if you have any thoughts on those studies, or any others I should be considering. And here are a couple of other stray questions:   1) Given the slow turnover of faculty and its bad effect on opportunities for young female (and male) scientists, should advocates for more women in science be trying to eliminate tenure? (Some Title Niners have advocated its abolition.)   2) Given the consequences of the law forbidding mandatory retirement of professors, should we think twice about imposing further federal restrictions? Could Title IX become another rigid, one-size-fits-all rule that makes it harder for universities to hire the best young scientists? ",2008-07-18T14:30:11+0000

Pointing out that the court was rejecting student-assignment plans that the districts had designed to stave off de facto resegregation, Breyer wrote that to invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. By invoking Brown v. Board of Education, the courts landmark 1954 civil rights ruling, Breyer accused the majority of abandoning a touchstone in the countrys efforts to overcome racial division.

One was old, old as the Cross, and the other had aged only a few days in a gallon can. Both had the power to change men's lives. On one side of the ditch, a packed-in, pleading faithful fell hard to their knees and called the Holy Ghost into their jerking bodies in unknown tongues. On the other side, two boys, too much alike to be anything but brothers, flung open the doors of a black Chevrolet and lurched into the yard of 117 D Street, hallelujahs falling dead around them in the weeds. In the house, a sad-eyed little woman looked out, afraid it might be the law. When your boys are gone you're always afraid it might be the law. But it was just her two oldest sons, Roy and Troy, floating home inside the bubble of her prayer, still in crumpled, cattin'-around clothes from Saturday night, still a little drunk on Sunday morning. They were fine boys, though, beautiful boys. They were just steps away now, a few steps. She would fry eggs by the platterful and pour black coffee, and be glad they were not in a smoking hulk wrapped around a tree, or at the mercy of the police. She thought sometimes of walking over to the church to see it all, to hear the lovely music, but that would leave her boys and man unsupervised for too long. Her third son was eleven or so then. He could hear the piano ring across the ditch, even hear people shout, but he could smell the liquor that was always in the house on a Sunday and even steal a taste of it when no one was looking, so it was more real.

Another Picasso print, Minotaur, Drinker and Women, from 1933, and two paintings by Brazilian artists are still missing; the combined value of the four works has been estimated at $612,000. Wesley Teobaldo Barros, 30, was arrested on Friday night along with two other men not involved in the museum heist.

us,Genentech May Want More From Roche,"Will Roche need to dig deeper to win Genentech? And could its $43.7 billion takeover offer put other big biotechs in play?  Those were some of the questions swirling around Wall Street on Monday after Roche, based in Switzerland, offered cash and stock valued at $89 for each share of Genentech, whose headquarters are in South San Francisco. That's less than 9 percent above Genentech's closing price on Friday, a rather small premium for a company that has been fiercely proud of its independence -- or, perhaps more accurately, semi-independence.   Roche has held a majority stake in Genentech since 1990, and the Swiss drug giant has sometimes had an uneasy partnership with its California-based affiliate.  Back in 1999, Genentech's chief executive rallied the employees with a call to ""beat the put,"" referring to an option agreement that allowed Roche to buy the rest of the company at a certain price. Although Roche did exercise the put, it also issued new shares that lowered its stake, an unusual move that left a large chunk of Genentech still in the hands of outside investors.  With Monday's offer, some analysts think independently minded Genentech will again fight for its autonomy.  ""We expect Genentech to refuse the bid and strive to remain independent, as the company did in 1999, to preserve its culture,"" Joel Sendek of Lazard Capital Markets wrote in a research note Monday.   Separately, an analyst at Rahn & Bodmer said Genentech ""probably will not be too happy,"" because Roche's offer ""really gives rather low valuation to Genentech.""  Shares of Genentech jumped 14 percent in early trading Monday to $93.42, well above the price of Roche's bid.  Any deal must win approval from a majority of Genentech's non-Roche shareholders.  Mr. Sendek also suggested that the Genentech offer could inspire other biotech takeovers. ""A deal could put any large-cap biotech in play, given that Genentech is the biggest biotech company by market cap,"" he wrote.  Go to Article from CNBC.com>> ",2008-07-21T13:50:31+0000

First, the problem with conventional iced coffee: it's brewed hot, then cooled, resulting in a drink that's bitter and acidic. Still, it's what you find at practically every cafe and coffeehouse in the city.  Iced coffee made from coffee concentrate is another experience entirely. It is smooth and lush, and there's no acidity or bitterness because it's never heated. So you get the rich, full flavor of coffee without any of the harshness. It's the standard in New Orleans, where you can buy coffee concentrate in any supermarket.  Cold drip coffee, as it's called, is also catching on in San Francisco. But elsewhere you need to make the concentrate yourself  which is fairly easy to do. Basically, you pour cold water over coarsely ground coffee, let it steep overnight, then strain with a special strainer to make a concentrate that will keep in the fridge for several weeks. Then, to make iced coffee, you fill a glass with ice and pour in one part concentrate to three parts milk or water. You can find a detailed recipe here  in an article I wrote last year for The Times's T Magazine.   I make concentrate with a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth. But the user-friendly cold brew kit from Toddy, which costs $37.50, is foolproof. And, I've discovered, it's one of the best thank-you gifts a house guest could give during iced coffee season.   Cold drip is a coffee-changing experience, and once you've had iced coffee from concentrate it's hard to go back.  ",2008-07-21T15:25:20+0000

us,Medicating Childhood Obesity,"The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued new guidelines regarding cardiovascular health in childhood, most notably raising the possibility of drug treatment to lower cholesterol levels in kids as young as 8 years old. The resulting flurry of controversy has centered -- correctly -- on the lack of proof that taking cholesterol-lowering drugs in youth actually prevents cardiovascular events later in life, as well as on the dearth of long-term safety data regarding such treatments in children. How to incorporate cholesterol screening into clinically effective pediatric practice presents a quandary itself.   But I think all that misses the crux of the issue. The very discussion of drug treatment to lower cholesterol in kids constitutes an admission of colossal societal failure. Although our genetic makeup has not changed in the last 20 years, our collective girth has skyrocketed, and the epidemic of childhood obesity is going global. We need to look to our environment for the root cause of this sudden change in the shape of the human species, which in evolutionary terms is occurring in an instant. Rather than ""medicalizing"" childhood obesity and heart risk, we need to repair our toxic surroundings.   Another recent study, the largest ever of children and physical activity, finds that American kids experience a remarkable drop in activity levels as they reach puberty. By age 15, the wide majority of kids are moving less than one hour each weekday.  As citizens, as parents, we must strive to reinforce physical education, nutrition curricula, and encourage limitation of high-sugar beverages in schools. In too many homes, glowing television screens, computer monitors, and video game screens have supplanted the bicycles and basketball hoops of yesteryear. Our kids' meals should reflect sensible nutrition practices wherever they're served. (Many such practices were noted in the academy's report, while only one tentative paragraph discussed physical activity.) Urban planners must redouble efforts to provide the sidewalks and bike paths needed by children and adults alike for spontaneous recreation.  If we do not as a society practice effective ""primordial prevention"" now, we will pay the unacceptable price, human and monetary, in years to come.   ",2008-07-21T19:35:20+0000

""The fact is, if we had done what Senator Obama wanted to do we would have lost,'' Mr. McCain said as the 41st president stood at his side. ""And we would have faced a wider war. And we would have had greater problems in Afghanistan and the entire region. And Iran would have increased their influence.''  Mr. Bush, 84, did not veer into any political territory, although he did say against the craggy ocean backdrop that he was ""a little jealous'' of all the attention paid to Mr. Obama on his trip this week to the Middle East and Europe.   Mr. McCain was at the Bush vacation compound for a fund-raising brunch and also a 20-minute private meeting with the former president.

But that is not the reason Mr. Grassley, the senior Republican from the state, will not be voting to nominate his colleague for the presidency at the upcoming Republican National Convention.   It will be because Mr. Grassley does not have a vote.  As disclosed over the weekend by columnist Bob Novak, Mr. Grassley was passed over to be a member of the state's delegation to the convention by leaders of the state party, which is experiencing a rise in the influence of social conservatives.  Mr. Novak suggested the decision was in retribution for Mr. Grassley, who is known for his aggressive oversight of non-profit organizations, investigating some prominent televangelists, a suggestion that was denied by party leaders.  Aides to Mr. Grassley sought to downplay the rift, noting that he and other Congressional Republicans from the state would have floor privileges even if they were not voting members of the delegation. ""Senator Grassley said he'd be a delegate, like he has previously, but the more Iowa Republicans who participate in the event the better, in his view,"" a spokeswoman said.  Unlike Democrats, Republicans do not bestow automatic delegate status on their senior elected officials through the now famous superdelegate designation.  Mr. Grassley and Mr. McCain had a difficult relationship for years after a heated exchange back in 1992 over Vietnam POWs, an incident that has been revisited in recent months in stories exploring Mr. McCain's temperament. Mr. Grassley is supporting his Republican colleague.  Some analysts have suggested the distinct rightward tilt of the state party could make it harder for Mr. McCain to carry Iowa, a swing state, particularly after Democratic enthusiasm in the state helped launch Senator Barack Obama.

us,"Free the Phone, and Venture Capital Will Follow"," How much impact is the promise of the iPhone having on venture capital?  Plenty, according to Rutberg & Co., a San Francisco-based technology research firm. Venture capital investment in mobile consumer applications jumped 90 percent in the first half of 2008, to $383 million, from $202 million in the second half of 2007.  By contrast, venture investment in cell towers, networking equipment and antennas dropped $456 million to $383 million in that period. And investments in niche or regional companies seeking to compete with the likes of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint is down too, to $141 million in the first half of this year from $463 million in the second half of 2007.  There are several reasons for the shift, said Rajeev Chand, a Rutberg analyst who helped compile the data. The largest mobile virtual network operators, or MVNO's, proved to be failures last year so many investors are staying away. (One of those was Disney Mobile, which was shuttered not long after ESPN abandoned its MVNO.) Secondly, he said, as AT&T and Verizon Wireless get even bigger, there is little incentive for venture capitalists to invest in competitors.  But an equally important reason for the shift in financing is the iPhone halo effect. Mr. Chand suggested that the control wireless carriers once had over what developers could offer consumers on mobile phones is slipping, making it more desirable for venture capitalists to invest in emerging consumer applications. In the iPhone's case, AT&T does not have a say in what applications Apple makes available to consumers, a trend analysts say will be followed by other device makers.  ""The real question is what, if any, new properties come out of mobile,"" Mr. Chand said. ""If we see plenty of those, the money will follow.""  ",2008-07-21T22:07:12+0000

us,The Times and the McCain Op-Ed,"The Op-Ed section of The New York Times has decided not to publish an opinion piece submitted by Senator John McCain in response to one published last week by his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, on his plan for Iraq.  The decision occurs against the backdrop of the candidates' dueling visions on the war in Iraq and how to handle the war going forward, particularly whether there should be a timetable for withdrawal or ""time horizons"" as spoken by President Bush or a measured troop presence for the foreseeable future to maintain stability.   Mr. Obama is on center stage today with his overseas trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, and Mr. McCain is hitting back from home with attacks that he has been right all along in achieving stability in the war zone through sustained support of President Bush's troop buildup over this year.   On Mr. McCain's Op-Ed, Matt Drudge posted online what he said was the original submission by Mr. McCain. According to his post, the senator wrote about Mr. Obama: ""I am dismayed that he never talks about winning the war  only of ending it... if we don't win the war, our enemies will. A triumph for the terrorists would be a disaster for us. That is something I will not allow to happen as president.""  Tucker Bounds, a McCain campaign spokesman, issued this statement: ""John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables. Unlike Barack Obama, that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the New York Times.""  Times officials said that the decision not to publish Mr. McCain's submission should not be considered a total rejection of the article by the presumptive Republican nominee. Rather, David Shipley, editor of the Op-Ed page, kicked back the original version while offering suggestions for changes and revision.   Here's Mr. Shipley's email response on Friday to Michael Goldfarb, a member of the McCain team and frequent writer for the senator's blog, McCainreport:   Dear Mr. Goldfarb,  Thank you for sending me Senator McCain's essay.  I'd be very eager to publish the senator on the Op-Ed page.  However, I'm not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written. I'd be pleased, though, to look at another draft. Let me suggest an approach.  The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information (it appeared before his speech); while Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain, he also went into detail about his own plans.  It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama's piece. To that end, the article would have to articulate, in concrete terms, how Senator McCain defines victory in Iraq. It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels, timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate. And it would need to describe the senator's Afghanistan strategy, spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan.  I am going to be out of the office next week. If you decide to re-work the draft, please be in touch with Mary Duenwald, the Op-Ed deputy. ...   Again, thank you for taking the time to send me the Senator's draft. I really hope we can find a way to bring this to a happy resolution.  Sincerely,  David Shipley    Andrew Rosenthal, the editor of the editorial page and Op-Ed, issued this statement today about the process undergone by editors in reviewing submissions:    It is standard procedure on our Op-Ed page, and that of other newspapers, to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission.   We look forward to publishing Senator McCain's views in our paper just as we have in the past. We have published at least seven Op-Ed pieces by Senator McCain since 1996.  The New York Times endorsed Senator McCain as the Republican candidate in the pesidential primaries. We take his views very seriously.   (In full disclosure, I worked as the deputy Op-Ed editor under Mr. Shipley during the mid-to-latter part of 2004, and it was policy then not to publish direct responses to Op-Ed columns already in print. Very rarely would a direct counterpoint to an Op-Ed be published; more often the response would be directed to Letters to the Editor. But dueling candidate Op-Eds sometimes rise to a different level, when they go beyond back-and-forth or standard talking points that everyone is familiar with.   That said, I should also say there is an enormous firewall between the editorial/Op-Ed side and the news operation. We on the news side had no input, nor intelligence, per se of Mr. McCain's article, nor did we know that Mr. Shipley requested revisions. That holds true for all submissions to Op-Ed.)

us,Citizens United to Release Anti-Obama Documentary,"An independent conservative group went on the air with a new ad on Monday to be followed by a full-length documentary film that attempts to portray Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, as an over-hyped media darling.  The group, Citizens United, which also produced a film earlier this year critical of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, is spending $250,000 to run the ad on Fox News through the end of the week.  The 30-second spot features a mix of conservative voices  former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, the Rev. Joe Watkins, and commentators Tucker Carlson and Dick Morris. They accuse the press of harboring a pro-Obama bias, or as Mr. Carlson puts it in the ad, ""The press loves Obama. I mean not just love but sort of like an early teenage crush.""  The ad is a prelude to the film, ""Hype: The Obama Effect,"" which Citizens United plans to release in early September. According to the film's Web site it will ask -- and answer -- a few questions about Mr. Obama, including whether he is ""the uniter the country begs for, or a liberal divider.""  Will Holley, a spokesman for the group, said the film will be released in theaters in select markets across the country and offered for sale on DVD.  The Obama campaign declined to comment on the film.  Independent groups like Citizens United are increasingly inserting themselves into the contest between Mr. Obama and the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain. Another advocacy organization, Let Freedom Ring, plans to begin broadcasting a commercial accusing Mr. Obama of being a flip-flopper on Tuesday. The group, Vets for Freedom, is spending $1.5 million on an advertising and grassroots effort trumpeting what they say is the success of the troop buildup in Iraq.

us,An iTease: Something Cool and Cheap From Apple,"As usual, Apple didn't offer many specifics on its quarterly conference call with investors. But the company did hint that it has something really juicy to introduce before the end of September.   The tease came as Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, explained why the company expects its gross profit margin to drop from 34.8 percent in the three months ended in June to 30 percent in the next quarter. One reason is a promotion that gives free iPods to students who buy new Macs. But another is ""a future product transition, which I can't discuss today.""   Apple is widely expected to be getting ready to refresh its line of notebook computers, and there is some speculation that it may introduce a new form factor of devices that are smaller than a laptop but larger than an iPhone.    In several places, Apple executives hinted that this new product would offer price points that will beat the competition.    ""We will deliver state-of-the-art new products that our competitors just aren't going to be able to match,"" Mr. Oppenheimer said, responding to another question about the lower profit margin targets. And several times Tim Cook, the chief operating officer, repeated a bit about Apple's pricing philosophy.   ""One of the investments we make is to introduce new products that initially cost more because they delivery an entirely new level of value to the customer,"" Mr. Cook said. ""Then we ride the cost curves down with value engineering and volume manufacturing, leaving us far head of our competitors. We have some of these types of investments in front of us that I can't discuss. And we will continue to execute this strategy in the future.""    It should be noted that for years, Apple really pursued a premium pricing strategy appropriate to its status as a niche vendor. The music player business, in which Apple has the dominant market share, moved the company toward a more mainstream pricing philosophy. The executives said that Apple's computers are priced more competitively now than at any time in the last few years   Low pricing was a key factor in the revival of Apple's sales of iPods, which have been sluggish recently. The company sold 11 million iPods in the most recent quarter, up 12 percent, more than analysts had expected. But iPod revenue only grew by 7 percent because most of the increase in sales came from the low-end Shuffle model. Apple cut the base price of the Shuffle to $49 early this year.    Mr. Cook also said the new $199 price was a key reason for the vigorous sales of the new iPhone 3G. The company's surveys, he said, showed that many potential customers were put off by the $399 price of the initial iPhone.   Not surprisingly, the Apple executives declined to give any specifics on iPhone 3G sales so far, other than to repeat that the company sold 1 million in the first three days. They did say that Apple expects to sell more iPhones than in any other quarter, meaning it will beat the 2.3 million phones sold in the last three months of 2007.   When pressed by analysts about why the iPhone is sold out in so many places, Mr. Cook suggested that there was no problem in Apple's production line.    ""The demand has been staggering in almost every country we have shipped in,"" he said. ""The manufacturing ramp is right on schedule."" He said that the company was confident enough in its ability to increase production of the iPhone to increase distribution from 22 countries to more than 70 countries by the end of September.    ""I like what I'm seeing in the production ramp, and I'm confident in our ability to supply,"" he said. ""I am not going to predict when supply will equal demand.""         ",2008-07-21T23:14:27+0000

us,The MSM? It's Now 'Traditional',"Back in the early 1990s, with the rise of talk radio, conservative commentators derisively dubbed newspapers, magazines and broadcast television as the ""mainstream media."" More recently, with the run-up to the Iraq war, liberal bloggers joined in, abbreviating the term to MSM.  But now the Internet has overtaken most newspapers and broadcasts as a source of news, and some on the left say the lingo ought to reflect that.  Markos Moulitsas, founder of the DailyKos Web site, the biggest liberal hub online, wrote on Monday that the heretofore ""mainstream media"" should be called the ""traditional media."" Calling it mainstream implies that the Internet is fringe, he said, when in fact liberal bloggers, at least, are ""representatives of the mainstream, and the country is embracing what we're selling.""  In addition, he said, the term ""mainstream"" adopts the argot of the right. And, he wrote, in a gesture that may surprise his liberal followers, the term ""traditional"" is a less negative way to distinguish the old media from new media. He says the old media, er, the traditional media, does serve a useful purpose when it writes the ""truth"" and reflects reality -- something he says the right can't handle.  ""Sure, we need to keep the media honest, but as an institution, it's important they exist and do their job well,"" he wrote. ""And insulting and dismissing them out of hand, using the same language the right-wingers use, doesn't help us achieve that goal.""  As you might imagine, not everyone agrees that Kos now represents the mainstream, and some  have been mocking him (""If Moulitsas's netroots were truly the mainstream, why would they attack a MODERATE Democrat who rarely strayed from the party line?"" one asked, in reference to his debate Friday with Harold Ford, chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council.)  We also chatted about the topic with Michael Cornfield, who is vice president of media and research at 720 Strategies, a non-partisan media strategy firm for advocacy organizations. He said that whether the term was ""mainstream"" or ""traditional,"" it still accomplished the same thing: It signified a big and powerful -- and old -- media against which the left, and the right, could use to rile their partisans.

us,"For Obama, Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Looms","AMMAN, Jordan  As Senator Barack Obama arrived here on Tuesday, with his tours of Afghanistan and Iraq behind him, one of the biggest political challenges of his overseas trip was coming into view: the navigation of the Middle East peace process.  It is expected to be one of the topics at his dinner with King Abdullah, who flew back early from a visit to the United States to meet with Mr. Obama. And on Wednesday, it will be the focus of a daylong series of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.  Mr. Obama is scheduled to sit down separately with Israeli President Simon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Then, he will go to the West Bank to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.  For Mr. Obama, who struggled to win over Jewish voters during the Democratic primary, his meetings with the respective leaders are being carefully watched. His words will be closely examined by both sides, particularly after a speech last month in Washington in which Mr. Obama endorsed a two-state settlement for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but said that Jerusalem should remain, undivided, the capital of the Jewish nation.  A senior foreign policy adviser said there would be no confusion from Mr. Obama.  ""He has repeatedly said that Jerusalem is a final status issue to be negotiated by the parties,"" the adviser told reporters in a background briefing here. ""Jerusalem would remain Israel's capital. It should not be divided with barbed wire and checkpoints as it was between 1948 and 1967.""  Mr. Obama also is scheduled to visit the southern Israeli town of Sderot, located near Gaza, which has been hit by more than 2,000 rockets in the past four years. It is a must-stop destination for visiting politicians, including Senator John McCain, who toured it in March during a visit to the Middle East.   Susan Rice, a foreign policy adviser to the Obama campaign, told reporters that Mr. Obama wanted to go to Sderot because it is a ""place in which Israel's security is every day at risk and threatened."" She added, ""Senator Obama will have the opportunity to see that first hand and get a very personal feel for the everyday"" challenges.  Mr. Obama also is scheduled to visit Yad Vashem, the Israeli memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. Aides said that a stop by the Western Wall, one of the holiest places in Judaism, might also be in the works.   The Afghanistan and Iraq portions of Mr. Obama's weeklong overseas trip were part of an official fact-finding mission in his capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The campaign part of the trip officially begins on Tuesday, with a late-afternoon press conference here in Amman.  Senators Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, and Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, have made up the rest of the Congressional delegation. They, too, will be joining Mr. Obama at his campaign-organized question-and-answer session with reporters at The Citadel, a historic site that towers above downtown Amman.  After meeting the press, all three senators will have a private dinner with His Majesty, King Abdullah, at his official residence, Beit Al Urdun. Yes, Her Majesty, Queen Rania, also will be on hand.   While the Middle East peace process is a high topic in Israel, it also is a leading point of discussion here in Amman. The king was remaining neutral in the presidential race, aides said, but intrigued by Mr. Obama.   ""The way it looks from our side is that this guy has a very good chance  at least a 50-50 change  of getting to become the president of the United States,"" a senior Jordanian official said. ""In the last eight years the Middle East has changed dramatically under Mr. Bush. There are many things to attend to.""  The official adde ",2008-07-22T10:42:48+0000

us,"At Tanglewood, Elliott Carters Sketches","(Photo: Elliott Carter at the 1961 recording session of his ""Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano With Two Chamber Orchestras."" (Don Hunstein/Sony Classical)) LENOX, Mass. - For all the high-tech effort going into the Carter centenary celebrations, it turns out that the best of the nonperformance offerings so far is strikingly low tech. All Tanglewood needed was a stack of frames and picture hooks -- O.K., and some choice material from Mr. Carter's private collection and from the Elliott Carter Collection of the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. ""Carter's Century: An Exhibit Celebrating the Life and Music of Elliott Carter,"" is split between two buildings on opposite sides of the Music Shed, the Visitor Center and Highwood Manor House.  The photographs are of varying interest: after a few formal portraits and pictures of Mr. Carter standing beside other composers, you begin skipping the images in favor of the scores. But a few are worth lingering over.  A 1950 photograph from Tucson captures Mr. Carter, dressed conservatively in a tie and jacket, with Leonard Bernstein, in an ascot. Both are smiling broadly, although Bernstein was not notably a champion of Mr. Carter's work. At the time, Mr. Carter's work wasn't what we know today, and this photograph was taken at a pivotal moment: it was in Arizona in 1950 that Mr. Carter composed his String Quartet No. 1, the work in which he found the approach to rhythm and melody that he continues to pursue.  The score and sketch pages are more inherently fascinating, and frustrating.  Several of Mr. Carter's melodic and harmonic sketches show groups of note heads without stems, sometimes circles, with numbers over each grouping. Rhythmic sketches show vertical rows of rhythmic diagrams, stems without note heads, drawn in different colors. Missing on the terse descriptive cards is a hint of how these diagrams work.  Still, you can learn something about Mr. Carter's work method by spending a few moments with these penciled scores. His articulation and dynamic markings -- in some cases added in red pencil -- are as plentiful and detailed as Mahler's. In ""Mad Regales,"" a vocal work that will have its premiere on Tuesday, an asterisk indicates that a syllable is to be sung ""mouth half closed, consonants not emphasized."" Several score pages include scratch-pad areas, with everything from pitch and rhythm diagrams to mathematical calculations.  The best of this material is at the Visitor Center. There you can see a handful of letters, a couple from Mr. Carter (not all that revealing) and several to him. The oboist Heinz Holliger, in August 1987, wrote of his pleasure on receiving Mr. Carter's Oboe Concerto, or at least the solo part; he mentions that he looks forward to seeing the full score, and praises the solo line's ""very rich and expressive melodic lines, which are much more demanding for the performer than the 'technical' passages.""  And anyone who wonders whether James Levine really is the Cartermaniac he says he is needs only to read a letter he wrote to Mr. Carter (which is how he addressed him) on Jan. 28, 2003. The handwritten text, thanking Mr. Carter for the score of ""Micomicn,"" a three-minute orchestra work composed in 2002, is positively fawning. It lists a large number of works Mr. Levine planned to perform with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and an equally expansive list he would perform with the Met Chamber Ensemble.  ""This,"" he writes, ""will give us the start of an active Elliott Carter repertoire and will, I hope, help us perform your music at an ever higher standard.""  In the first of three postscripts, Mr. Levine begs for ""a personally signed"" copy of ""Micomicn."" In the third, he offers Mr. Carter a ""floating commission"" for a work ""of any length, kind, any combination of instruments, singers, etc.""  But the real gem is directly across the room from Mr. Levine's letter. In a glass case that includes a handful of baby pictures, circa 1910 and 1911, is a 1926 letter of recommendation, written to Harvard College on Mr. Carter's behalf. The author is the iconoclastic composer Charles Ives.  ""Carter strikes me as a rather exceptional boy,"" Ives wrote. ""He has an instinctive interest in literature, and especially music, that is somewhat unusual.""  ",2008-07-22T11:40:19+0000

At the Church of St. Francis Xavier, a Roman Catholic parish in Chelsea, hundreds of men, women and children gather every week for Sunday soup kitchen, some seeking a nourishing meal, others seeking relief for bodily stresses and strains.   Ten years ago, Dr. Morgenstern learned about the soup kitchen at St. Francis through a patient who worked there, and felt compelled to do something. Her mission: address the physical trauma of being homeless, a problem often overlooked.  She also began recruiting support for her vision: Chiropractic for Humanity.   Dr. Morgenstern organized a group of chiropractors in the New York area to volunteer their services at soup kitchens twice a week. After getting the leadership of St. Francis and the Church of the Holy Apostles, a nearby Episcopal parish, on board, she and her team received four chiropractic adjustment tables donated by local chiropractors -- two for the Sunday soup kitchen at St. Francis, and two for Thursday soup kitchen at Holy Apostles, one of the largest soup kitchens in the city.  Since then, several hundred homeless men and women have received chiropractic services at the soup kitchens. Dr. Morgenstern estimates that at least a few hundred have become dedicated patients, visiting the chiropractors at least once a week.  Jerry Capers, for one, has been visiting the chiropractors since the program began nearly a decade ago. His bout with homelessness and depression has been a crippling 17-year struggle. But weekly visits to Dr. Morgenstern and company, Mr. Capers said, has allowed him to persevere and maintain a sound mind and body.   I recently took a journey with Mr. Capers, collecting cans on the streets of New York, and joining him for a chiropractic adjustment.  Jonathan Schienberg is a New York-based freelance journalist.

us,Adu Moves From Benfica to Monaco on Loan,"(Photo: Freddy Adu has featured for both the U.S men's national team and will be a key member of the U.S. Olympic team this summer in Beijing. (Nacho Cubera/Reuters))   Not quite a week after being named to the U.S. men's Olympic team, midfielder Freddy Adu, the former teen phenom who has matured into a promising young player, will be loaned by Benfica in Portugal to Monaco in France's Ligue 1. Adu signed with the Lisbon club a year ago after four years in Major League Soccer. During his time with Benfica, Adu failed to get close to the starting XI, making only 21 appearances, but he scored five goals.   Before the loan deal with Monaco, Adu was offered to several Major League Soccer teams through an agent who represents some top Portuguese players and coaches. But the L.A. Galaxy, the New York Red Bulls and the Seattle Sounders (set to enter the league in 2009) all passed on Adu who, if he returned to M.L.S., would count as a designated player under the league's salary and roster rules.  If Adu was frustrated with his lack of playing time in Portugal, he hid it well. Always upbeat with reporters, Adu told Jack Bell in December he relished the competition in Europe and the fight for a first-team spot. ""The first thing about being in Europe is that you would not survive at a place like this unless you pay attention to every single detail and work hard every day,"" Adu said in a telephone interview from Lisbon last December. ""No one's place is guaranteed. You have to come to work every day, and that's what makes you a better player  constant competition.""  ""It doesn't matter whether I play 2, 5, 30 or 90 minutes, I'm still going to go out there with the same mentality,"" Adu said.  (Photo: Freddy Adu at the Espy Awards show last week. (Matt Sayles/Associated Press))   But in May, after a national team training session in New Jersey, Adu said he very much enjoys starting, especially for the U.S. national team. ""It really does help my confidence when the coach really believes in you to start the game off,"" Adu said. ""It means a lot to me."" (You can listen to audio excerpts from my interview with Adu here.)  Adu, 19, will certainly get the constant competition he seeks in France, where Monaco finished 12th last season, and that will no doubt help him earn a more regular starting spot with the U.S. national team. The open style of play in Ligue 1 should suit Adu, who enjoys having the ball at his feet, if he can build his stamina, strength and develop a more well-rounded game on both sides of the ball.   The U.S. coach Bob Bradley and his coaching staff have been careful in how they bring Adu along, trying to manage both the player's expectations and the fans'. If Adu can play regularly in France, it will no doubt bode well for the his chances to contribute more to the national team as it makes its way through qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.  Adu is expected to join Monaco after the Olympics in Beijing.   ",2008-07-22T14:33:01+0000

""We are really the only resource in the metropolitan area for superheroes,"" said Sam Potts, a designer who played a key role in the concept of the store. ""They are otherwise left to their own devices, and they might not have the time and resources to keep themselves equipped.""   To that end, the Superhero Supply store, which opened in 2004, carries several product lines, Mr. Potts explained. ""The essence of a brand, that it provides a guarantee to the consumer a certain amount of comfort and reliability. Those concerns are paramount for the modern superhero.""   Among the major brands:  Aardvark Bros.  ""They are the oldest, continually running family-owned and -operated manufacturers of superhero supplies,"" Mr. Potts said. The products in this line include Reflex, Truth Serum (which promotes trustworthiness, veracity, promptness and a rosy glow about the cheeks), Justice, Intuition, Mind Control, Magnetism and Antidote.    Mt. Fortress Superhero Apparel. The supply store has a huge line of clothing ranging from capes to tights to leotards. ""Their capes may get kind of ratty,"" said Mr. Potts. ""Cape stretching is a problem, especially for the superhero who flies fast."" The store has a cape-tester, a platform rigged with fans stationed under a 1,000-watt floodlight which can demonstrate the billowing capabilities of a cape.   Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. This is the generic store brand for basic hero needs. The products include X-Ray Vision, Speed of Light, Evil Blob containment unit, Muscle, Omnipotence, Immortality, Night Vision Goggles, and Supersonic Ears and Headphones.   Bugayenko Laboratories. This brand ""comes from somewhere inside the former Soviet Union,"" explained Mr. Potts. ""They are primarily scientific equipment because a lot of superheros are the result of science experiences gone wrong, such as the Hulk."" Products in this line include Chaos, Telekinesis, E.S.P, Elasticity, Invisibility and Black Hole.   Nakayamamoshi Industries. This is a product line that hails from Japan, a nation with a long history of large mutated creatures, like Godzilla, said Mr. Potts.  The offerings include Powdered Chromosome, Symbiote, Skree Bug, Irradiated Spiders, Hair DNA and Martian Cells.   FantastiCo! ""They are for the superhero on the budget or for the sidekick making a transition into crime fighting, the cost-conscious crime fighter,"" he said. These include Super X-Ray glasses, Slow Burning Fuse. Mylar Force Field, and Flame Camouflage. Another product is the Pretty Good Force Field. (""It's actually a net,"" he said.)   Mer Systems. ""For underwater crime fighters,"" said Mr. Potts. Underwater villain vanquishment tools include Aqualight Mask with Waterproof Headlights, Magnetic Dive Gloves, 14-Inch Underwater Periscope and Backpack with built-in water supply.  The Superhero Supply Store serves as a front, both literally and figuratively for 826NYC, a nonprofit organization that focuses on teaching writing and other art forms to inspire students' creativity. ""It also raises enough revenue to pay our rent,"" said Joan Kim, the educational director. The tutoring center is in the supply store, hidden behind a bookcase, much like the nooks and crannies in Hogwarts.  The annual operating budget for the program is now about $500,000. The free program now reaches some 2,500 students throughout the year through tutoring and workshops focusing on writing, creating films and scripts, and recording songs. More than 97 percent of the students attend the city's public schools.   The Brooklyn program is an offshoot of 826 Valencia in San Francisco, which was founded by Dave Eggers and others in 2002. There are other 826 chapters in Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle and Ann Arbor. The inspiration for the superhero supply store was the pirate supply store in San Francisco.  I asked whether the Superhero Supply store would ever consider partnering with Batman and giving him his own line -- much as Martha Stewart got her own collection at Macy's.   ""We are the distributor,"" Mr. Potts said. ""We just sell other companies' products. If Batman wanted to put something on the market, we would be happy to carry it, pending all the proper approval and testing and safety inspections. He can take all the risks he wants with his own stuff, but we have responsibility to our customers."" ",2008-07-22T14:43:59+0000

us,More Sex for Todays Seniors,"(Photo: Still close. (Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times))   The sex lives of senior citizens have improved markedly in the past three decades, according to a new study.  The data, published in The British Medical Journal, have been collected since the 1970s from 1,500 Swedish adults, all of whom were 70 years old at the time of the interview. Although the report is from Sweden, it mirrors recent research in the United States that shows many people continue to have active sex lives well into old age.  But the Swedish data are notable in that they illuminate how people's sex lives and attitudes have changed over time. Today's seniors report that they are having sex far more often and have more positive feelings associated with sex than their counterparts just 30 years ago.  From 1971 to 2000 the proportion of 70-year-olds reporting sexual intercourse increased, although interestingly, more married men say they are having sex than married women. Among married men, 68 percent were having sex, compared to 52 percent in 1971. Among married women, 56 percent were having sex, compared to 38 percent in the 1970s.   Sexual activity also has increased for unmarried seniors. Among the single, 54 percent of the men and 12 percent of the women reported having sex, up from 30 percent of men and less than 1 percent of women in the 1970s.  Among those who were sexually active, more than one in four seniors in 2000 reported having sex once or more a week, compared to only about 10 percent in the 1970s.  More than half of men and women reported very happy relationships, compared to just more than one-third in the 1970s. Overall, modern 70-year-olds reported higher satisfaction with sexuality, fewer sexual dysfunctions and more positive attitudes to sexuality in later life than those who were interviewed in the 1970s.  The researchers noted that the study wasn't designed to determine why seniors appear to be having more sex. However, the people interviewed in the 1970s were born at the turn of the century, at a time when sexuality and sexual pleasure were not discussed. The last generation of 70-year-olds interviewed for the study were in their 30s during the 1960s sexual revolution and may have had more liberal values about sex.   Modern 70-year-olds likely are more healthy as well. During the course of the study, life expectancy for Swedes jumped five years for men, to age 77, and four years for women, to age 82. Modern seniors also have access to medications like Viagra that earlier generations did not.  ",2008-07-22T15:07:28+0000

""There have been comic book biographies before, that's not new,"" said Scott Dunbier, special projects editor at IDW, which will publish the comics. ""But we're talking about a story that isn't finished: two views of the candidates, two men who are both vying for what is arguably the most important job in the world.""

(Photo: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images for The New York Times))   Video This blog post is the first in a series examining the people and places in Sadr City, the poor Baghdad neighborhood that is the center of the support for the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. Today's post focuses on the role of U.S. soldiers.  BAGHDAD -- Sadr City, long one of the most dangerous parts of the Iraqi capital, is calmer now than it has been in years. To be sure, American soldiers and Iraqi judges are still being killed here, but not at the rate of deadly attacks in 2006 and 2007.   The neighborhood is also one of the most important places to visit for people seeking to understand the mood of Shiite Muslims, long oppressed but the majority in Iraq. Beginning this month, the Baghdad Bureau blog will show you video and photographs from some of the most important sites in Sadr City and interview the soldiers, officials and civilians that will play a role determining which direction it moves in next.  Earlier this year, rockets were be fired from Sadr City into the Green Zone on a regular basis. The attacks increased in frequency during sandstorms, which prevented American helicopters from patrolling the skies. Moktada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia used the enclave to launch attacks against American troops, Sunnis and Shiites who stood against them. That changed in May when the Iraqi government, backed by 10,000 Iraqi Army troops and the U.S. military, struck a deal with Mr. Sadr for his militia to leave the neighborhood safely rather than face heavy military raids.   A concrete blast wall was built in April on Al Quds Street in the southern half of the neighborhood. Below the wall, American forces now patrol the neighborhood, its mosques and its markets. Above the wall, the Iraqi Army maintains order for more than two million residents, many of them poor.  (Photo: Iraqi pedestrians walked through an opening in the concrete barrier along Al Quds and Fallah Streets in Sadr City on May 25, 2008. Iraqi Army troops were positioned at major intersections and public buildings. (Photo: Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images for The New York Times))   The 1-68 Armor Battalion, 3rd Combat Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division was tasked with clearing roadside bombs on Al Quds Street and other roads in the southern half of Sadr City. Al Quds was formerly a four-lane major thoroughfare in Sadr City. Blocking it off allowed American forces to cut off the main entrance to the neighborhood.  The battalion used Buffalo MRAPs and other heavily armored vehicles to clear the streets of roadside bombs. A Husky mine-detecting vehicle was used to locate the explosives. Then an explosives ordnance disposal team attached to the 3rd Combat Brigade would send a robot forward to disarm the bombs, known as improvised explosive devices.  ""It was a totally different ballgame in Sadr City. It's not like when we were clearing these main routes. We'd find maybe one and it'd be like an exciting day that we found one. This, we knew they were out there,"" said First Lt. Millard Stewart. ""Not to mention that there was R.P.G.s, small arms fire and a sniper. That was every day."" (R.P.G. is the abbreviation for rocket propelled grenade, common in Iraq, powerful and deadly.)  Staff Sgt. Jonathan Williams is with the 62nd Ordnance Company. ""On May 12, my birthday, we had to clear four of the barriers,"" he said. ""We had eight detonated and we found three. Within those 100 meters there was 11 total I.E.D.s. You can imagine how stressful it is to have one go off and then go look for another one.""  The constant attacks from side streets made the job of looking for I.E.D.s even more difficult.  ""At soon as we came up at least five I.E.D.s went off in a span of seven minutes,"" said First Lt. Emily Shockley, 25, with the 62nd Ordnance Company. ""You keep getting the message to continue the mission.""  ""A sure fire way to get shot is to get out of your vehicle,"" Staff Sgt. Williams said. ""Just being outside your truck in that area is never a great thing.""  The battalion would slowly clear a portion of the road of I.E.D.s then return the next day to find that insurgents had added new explosives to the same location.  Lieutenant Stewart said that Iraqi civilians cooperated at first with the mission, but paid a price for talking to the American soldiers. ""They said, 'Hey, we don't want any problems. We saw a couple of guys digging over here, here and here,'"" he said. ""And they told us exactly where they were and there was E.F.P.s there.""   Explosively formed penetrators are a type of charge designed to shred through armor.  ""And shortly after they gave us that information there was an R.P.G. in the building that I was standing in,"" Lieutenant Stewart said. ""You know that was a show, I guess to the civilians not to talk to us, because they blew up the building."" ",2008-07-22T15:18:49+0000

us,Bush Asked to Reject Marion Jones Request,"The head of the governing body of U.S. athletics has issued an open letter to President Bush urging him to turn down the former Olympian Marion Jones's request that he commute the six-month federal prison sentence she is serving for lying to federal agents about her use of performance-enhancing drugs and a check-fraud scam.  The sharply worded letter is signed by Douglas G. Logan, C.E.O., of USA Track & Field, who writes, ""As the new CEO of USA Track & Field, I have a moral and practical duty to make the case against her request."" It appears on the organization's Web site, along with a link enabling readers to co-sign the letter.   On Saturday the Times revealed that Jones was among hundreds of convicted felons petitioning for presidential pardons and commutations. Although a record number of such requests have been made, only a handful have been granted so far.   Jones was convicted in a White Plains federal court in January and entered a Fort Worth, Tex., prison in March. She gave up the three gold and two bronze medals she won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics after admitting in October 2007 that she had taken illicit preformance-enhancing drugs.   Logan became the head of USA Track and Field last Thursday. He was the first commissioner of Major League Soccer, serving from 1995 to 1999, when he was replaced by the current commissioner, Don Garber.   ""With her cheating and lying, Marion Jones did everything she could to violate the principles of track and field and Olympic competition,"" Logan wrote. ""When she came under scrutiny for doping, she taunted any who doubted her purity, talent and work ethic. Just as she had succeeded in duping us with her performances, she duped many people into giving her the benefit of the doubt,"" he added.    On Monday readers wrote in to this blog in answer to the question of whether or not President Bush should commute Jones's sentence, which is scheduled to end in September. Comments went against a commutation by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.  Here is the text of Logan's letter:   Dear President Bush,  They say you can't always believe what you read in the papers. So, when I read that Marion Jones has applied to you for a pardon or commutation of her federal conviction for making false statements to investigators, I couldn't believe it. She lied to federal agents. She took steroids. She made false statements in a bank fraud investigation - not necessarily in that order. She admitted it. And now she apparently wants to be let off.  As the new CEO of USA Track & Field, I have a moral and practical duty to make the case against her request.  With her cheating and lying, Marion Jones did everything she could to violate the principles of track and field and Olympic competition. When she came under scrutiny for doping, she taunted any who doubted her purity, talent and work ethic. Just as she had succeeded in duping us with her performances, she duped many people into giving her the benefit of the doubt.  She pointed her finger at us, and got away with it until federal investigators teamed up with USADA and finally did her in. It was a sad thing to watch, the most glorious female athlete of the 20th century in tears on courthouse steps.  Our country has long turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of our heroes. If you have athletic talent or money or fame, the law is applied much differently than if you are slow or poor or an average American trying to get by. At the same time, all sports have for far too long given the benefit of the doubt to its heroes who seem too good to be true, even when common sense indicates they are not.  To reduce Ms. Jones' sentence or pardon her would send a horrible message to young people who idolized her, reinforcing the notion that you can cheat and be entitled to get away with it. A pardon would also send the wrong message to the international community. Few things are more globally respected than the Olympic Games, and to pardon one of the biggest frauds perpetuated on the Olympic movement would be nothing less than thumbing our collective noses at the world.  In my new job as CEO of USA Track & Field, I must right the ship that Ms. Jones and other athletes nearly ran aground. I implore you, Mr. President: Please don't take the wind out of our sails.

It's understandable: While many consider Genentech, of South San Francisco, the most successful biotech company on the planet, it doesn't quite have the brand recognition of Anheuser, which makes Budweiser beer.   But the two bids have one thing in common: In each, a foreign company made a huge play for United States assets. And Roche's offer, valued at about $43 billion, has greatly widened this year's ""deal deficit,"" as measured by the difference between the volume of deals in which American firms are the seller, and those in which they are the buyer.   This deficit is part of a larger debate over whether or not Corporate America is being sold off to foreign interests, how long such a trend might last and whether this is a problem in the first place.   The weakened dollar has made United States assets relatively cheap for foreign acquirers, and troubled Wall Street firms have been circling the globe in search of investors willing to provide much-needed capital.  According to Dealogic, United States-based companies have been on the buying end of $119 billion worth of cross-border mergers and acquisitions so far this year. They have been on the selling end of $222 billion worth of deals, including Monday's bid by Roche, which is based in Switzerland.  That means that 65 percent of cross-border bids involving American companies were ""inbound,"" and just 35 percent were ""outbound."" At the end of June, the ratio was closer to 58 percent inbound and 42 percent outbound.  Keep in mind: The Genentech bid may fail -- the 32-year-old company strongly values its independent culture -- which would close the deal deficit quite a bit.

us,Microsoft Tries to Polish Vista,"(Photo: ) Microsoft is really taking the gloves off this time. ZDNet is reporting that it will spend $500 million to make a powerful statement to its hundreds of millions of customers. I imagine the statement would have to go something like this:   Windows Vista isn't really as bad as they say. Honest. Please don't be mad at us. We promise our next operating system will be better. Pinky swear.    Those aren't exactly the words they use, but it is certainly the tone of the ad that Microsoft has started running on its site. I can't find it, but Ed Bott at ZDNet did and has a copy here. It shows a painting of a tall ship with the headline ""At one point everyone thought the Earth was flat. Get the facts about Windows Vista.""   That promotion leads to a page that acknowledges that Vista had problems:   But we know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter. Printers didn't work. Games felt sluggish. You told usloudly at timesthat the latest Windows wasn't always living up to your high expectations for a Microsoft product.   It takes a minute to figure out where to find Microsoft's response to this criticism: You need to click some arrows on the page. (Why can't Microsoft use the plus Icon popularized by Google and lots of others?)   The company asserts that it is now compatible with the vast bulk of software and hardware. It also boasts that Vista is more secure, faster, uses less energy and is even ""sexier.""   Sure, Windows Vista gets a lot of compliments on its aesthetics. But its style serves an important purpose: to put everything within a click's reach and make you more productive.   Microsoft, is probably right that Vista gets a bit of a bum rap. Lots of people find that Vista works fine and is an improvement over Windows XP. I use Vista on a home computer with little trouble. (And no, I don't hate Microsoft, despite what some commenters say. I am a big fan of Word 2007, and I even pay for Microsoft's OneCare anti-virus and backup software.)    But this is still a dreadful place for Microsoft to be. It is fighting Google on one side and Apple on the other. And both of those companies have flaws, products that don't quite work right, have gaps and disappoint users. But both Google and Apple have products that you don't need to be told to notice they are sexy. That changes how people see the more prosaic parts of their product lines and makes people far more open to considering new products.   Even if you are a big fan of Microsoft, consider which you would rather read about first: a something new from Google, Apple or Microsoft?  After spending $500 million, Microsoft might be able to convince people that Windows Vista is not awful. But just because you can show the earth is not flat, doesn't mean you will rule the new world.      ",2008-07-22T15:57:33+0000

us,Weiner Sounds Mayoral Themes,"(Photo: Representative Anthony D. Weiner. (Photo: Brendan Hoffman for The New York Times) ) In ""Keys to the City: Keeping New York City the Capital of the Middle Class,"" a 5,000-word essay he wrote and distributed Tuesday morning at a Crain's New York breakfast forum in Midtown, Representative Anthony D. Weiner outlines the challenges the next mayor of New York City will face: a faltering economy, a shaky job market, an ever-rising cost of living that threatens to extinguish its middle class.   None of it is new, of course; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has warned numerous times in recent months that the bountiful times are behind us and that the future will undoubtedly entail some pain and sacrifice.   But Mr. Weiner had little criticism for Mr. Bloomberg, the man he is vying to replace at City Hall. In fact, his vision for the city sounded a lot like Mayor Bloomberg's, and Mr. Weiner made sure to say so in his half-hour remarks to the audience -- a collection of business leaders and developers, like Alexander Durst of the Durst Organization, which is building a 54-story green office building opposite Bryant Park, and Larry A. Silverstein, who is building three towers at the World Trade Center site.   When presenting solutions to the problems that lie ahead -- what he refers in his essay as ""A Formula for Results"" -- Mr. Weiner explained that his approach ""meshes with Mike Bloomberg's way of government."" When discussing the right attitude for the next administration, he spoke of the ""spirit of innovation"" that has been a hallmark of the Bloomberg years.   ""Although we have some differences on policy, I want to make clear I appreciate the way Mike Bloomberg governs, the way he leads and leans into the problems,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""I like the ideas of reform that he brings to government every single day.""   He added: ""I do believe that in the end of the day, the question for the next mayor is, are you going to keep that spirit of innovation alive? And the answer to the next mayor has to be yes.""   At first glance, Mr. Weiner's formula seemed somewhat vague. Take this one: ""Faced with a new problem, government should face challenges head on -- rather than wait to act in the hope that circumstances will improve."" O.K., but how? Well, there was limited time to explain that at the forum, and Mr. Weiner did say that he planned to elaborate on each of his formula's five components in the months ahead, but some people were left wondering whether he was a man with big ideas who can deliver or just a man with big ideas.   One thing was clear, though. While he appreciates Mr. Bloomberg's accomplishments and style, he gave subtle yet persistent hints that he is not Mr. Bloomberg. He is a middle-class kid from Brooklyn, he said. (And Mr. Bloomberg is a multibillionaire.) He is more Flatbush Avenue than Madison Avenue, intent on helping sustain the small businesses that are the anchor and backbone of many neighborhoods in the boroughs outside Manhattan. He is a congressman, yes, but he does not have a company named after himself (though Mr. Weiner does have a Facebook page).  ""I want to be judged for who I am,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""And I am a middle-class New Yorker.""   Describing himself as ""fiscally moderate"" and ""pro-development,"" Mr. Weiner said he supported ""unfettered mayoral control"" of public schools and the redevelopment of ground zero and the West Side of Manhattan, though in this case he would have done things a bit differently than Mayor Bloomberg by splitting the contract among several developers, which he said he believed would make the project move faster.   To counter critics who may say a congressman does not exactly have the right credentials to keep on running New York as if it were a business, Mr. Weiner said: ""Have I run a 315,000-person organization before? The answer is no. But listen to my ideas, listen to how I view these things, listen to then how I pose these challenges, listen to how straight I talk about them.""   ""What's important, I think, to most New Yorkers is not that you have a solution ready-made for every problem, but that when you get up in the morning, you have the same sense of anxiety that they have,"" he went on. Which, in his view, is exactly how a middle-class guy like him would feel. ",2008-07-22T16:16:15+0000

But in between, there is not a single Chase branch on Broadway. Not one.

They call it the ""largest retail bank branch lease in Manhattan in 2008."" The branch will occupy one corner of the Zeckendorfs' full-block 15 Central Park West apartment tower and is to open later this year.  The Zeckendorfs, the third generation of a celebrated real estate family, also announced that they had signed West Elm, a home furnishing store, for 25,000 square feet of space on the first and second floors of the Broadway frontage. That store opening is planned next spring. Best Buy, an electronics and appliance store, is already open at the 62nd Street corner.  Lower Upper West Siders somehow managed to get along for years with two Chase Manhattan branches six blocks apart. But after Chase acquired the Bank of New York's retail banking business in 2006, a third branch came into the octagonal orbit.  If all these branches stay open, there will be a Chase on every block of Broadway between 61st and 64th Streets. Even in Manhattan, that is an exceptionally high C.A.R. (Chase-to-area ratio) of 1:1.  Might this be too much of a good thing? Thomas A. Kelly, a spokesman for Chase, said that the phenomenon will be short lived. Two of the existing branches will be folded into the new 61st Street office next February or March. ""We love Manhattan,"" Mr. Kelly said. ""We love having branches there. But every two blocks is just too much.""  When 15 Central Park West was under construction, the protective walkway along Broadway was covered in large renderings of the future retail storefronts.  Graffiti artists soon drew dialogue balloons sprouting from the mouths of passers-by in the rendering, with ironic comments along the lines of, ""Gee, I sure hope they put a bank branch here"" and ""Can't wait 'til they replace my local florist with a bank.""

us,Technology's Next Wave: Transforming Teamwork and Travel?,"My article today talks about how more and more companies are rethinking the face-to-face meeting -- when it makes productive sense to travel for that essential in-person experience and when that is no longer necessary, mainly because of advances in computing and telecommunications technology.   Rising fuel and travel costs are one motivation, of course. But the real issue is whether we are seeing the beginning of a deeper shift in how corporations and their employees work. Is this more a cyclical reaction to short-term economic pain or a structural phenomenon that will play out for years?   The truth is that it's too early for a definitive answer. And yes, technologies like traditional videoconferencing have been disappointing in the past. But there are several signs that something significant is underway this time.   At the high end, the new digital conferencing systems deliver a meeting experience -- dubbed telepresence -- that is eerily like real life. The images of people on screen are life-sized. At the end of meetings, participants have been known to walk to the screen to try to shake hands.  Companies like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard report brisk sales of the systems, while AT&T recently jumped into a networking, maintenance and support deal with Cisco. The Indian outsourcer Tata Consulting is going to provide telepresence rooms that businesses can rent.   For large corporations, the telepresence systems, though costly, can help curb travel, improve productivity and accelerate innovation. Procter & Gamble -- not a company in the business of adopting new technology for its own sake -- has installed 43 systems in little over a year.  But the more interesting place to look, in some ways, is the increased use and utility of more mainstream digital tools of collaboration: Web conferencing, online document sharing, wikis, group instant messaging and Internet telephony. The audio and desktop presentations in Web-based meetings, for example, are now more likely to be in sync and natural, instead of breaking up all the time. At I.B.M., Michael Littlejohn, a consultant, explained that putting together a big consulting proposal used to involve gathering eight or 10 people in one location, working for weeks. Today, he said, 75 percent of that work is done in virtual meetings, using Web-based tools.  The economics and the accumulating advances in technology may be aligned to bring another big evolutionary step in corporate work and travel patterns. There are analogies with changes in the past. The Internet itself took years, and steady investment, to become mainstream, and even then it disrupted industry after industry a decade after those predictions were made in the 1990s.  In this case, there are also environmental pressures, as the impact of business flights and car trips are recognized, and companies face the prospect that they will be held accountable for their carbon footprint before long. That motivation is already evident in Europe, where 56 percent of businesses in a recent survey said their use of collaboration and conferencing technology was influenced by concerns about climate change, according to Wainhouse Research, a consulting firm.  ""I think the inflection point will be over the next year or two, when a lot of companies, especially large ones, will look at these digital technologies for virtual meetings and teleworking, become more familiar with them and do more work this way,"" said Jonathan Koomey, a research scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

us,Paterson Criticizes M.T.A. Fare Plan,"Updated, 4 p.m. &#124; HUDSON, N.Y. -- Gov. David A. Paterson on Tuesday sternly criticized the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's proposal to increase subway, bus and commuter rail fares and called on the authority to take a second look at its finances before it formally asks for an increase. However, Mr. Paterson did not say whether he would support the authority's plea for more operating aid from the state.   Speaking to reporters after a news conference here on moderately priced housing, Mr. Paterson said that now was not the time to ask commuters, who are already feeling pinched by a rate increase earlier this year, to pay more to use the city's transit system, bridges and tunnels.  ""Another fare hike this soon after the last fare hike, just in my opinion, is not wise,"" he said. ""This just cannot become the new way that the M.T.A. solves problems. Every time there is an issue, pass along the increase.""  He added: ""Let's explore other options.""  If the authority gets permission from its board to raise fares, it will be only the second time in its history that it has raised fares in consecutive years. The last time that happened was in 1980 and 1981.  The amount of the increase has not been determined. But if the board agrees to it, fares will rise again next summer.  The authority is facing an increasingly grim financial outlook. Rising fuel costs have caused its operating costs to soar, and revenue from real estate taxes -- a major source of the authority's revenue -- are declining as the housing market falters.  Its budget gap for 2009 now stands at $900 million and is only getting bigger. Just six months ago, the authority projected a deficit of only $200 million.  Mr. Paterson said he asked the authority to re-examine its financial situation and report back to him. ""What I am asking the M.T.A. is to go back and take another look at their books.""  The authority has projected that the fare increase would bring in an additional $200 million in revenue. In addition to that, the authority would rely on the state and city to kick in $300 million in assistance.  Mr. Paterson said the authority's request for aid was ""perfectly understandable,"" but he did not say whether the state would be able to help.   Meanwhile, reaction to the M.T.A.'s financial situation continued to pour in from other quarters.  At a news conference at City Hall on Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spoke forcefully against increasing the city's financial contributions to the authority, saying that the agency ought to be able to control -- and cut -- its own expenses before it asks the city for more money while also proposing a fare increase to balance its budget.  ""Anybody that tells me they've got a $10 billion budget and can't find ways to cut 5 percent, that's just poor management,"" Mayor Bloomberg said. ""You have to be able to do that.""  He later said: ""If the state mandated that we had to put more money in, we would have to raise city taxes. There isn't any money.""  The city is facing its own budget deficit in the next fiscal year, and the mayor ordered every agency to shave 3 percent of its budget in the fiscal year that began in July, with more cuts planned for the future. Mr. Bloomberg said that until he is convinced that the authority can do more with less, and that it is able to find alternative sources of financing, like federal aid, ""we will not support a fare increase.""  ""Certainly there won't be more money coming from the city,"" the mayor said. ""We don't have it.""  Earlier in the day, at a Crain's New York breakfast forum at a Midtown hotel, Representative Anthony D. Weiner criticized the state for not doing more to finance the transportation authority and questioned why so much of the city's fate, and so much of its ability to govern itself, ""is tied up to unelected boards and agencies that more often than not are created by the State Legislature"" -- a remnant, he said, of the days when city politics was mired in incompetence and corruption.  ""In days gone by, maybe it was Albany that was the adult and we were the children,"" Mr. Weiner said. ""Now is the reverse."" He said that the city was taking the lead in handling major problems, and that ""this should be one of them.""  ""And I believe the city should fight much harder,"" he said, ""to get more control, or outright control of the M.T.A., at least as it affects our riders.""  Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider-advocacy program run by the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he welcomed Mr. Paterson's comments but was disappointed that Mayor Bloomberg was not offering to do more to help the authority.  ""The city now gives so little to a transit system that makes New York possible, it's like they are jumping the turnstile,"" Mr. Russianoff said in a statement.  The Working Families Party issued a statement urging its members to call on Mr. Paterson and Mr. Bloomberg for more governmental aid to the authority. The party said in a statement:   Investing in public transportation is a no-brainer. Subways and buses are the life blood of the city we call home. They take millions of commuters to work, school, home again, and everywhere in between daily.   But with the price of gas, housing, food -- the cost of living life itself -- skyrocketing, keeping mass transit affordable to all New Yorkers is just as important as keeping the system running strong.  That means the only good solution is more public investment in the biggest public asset we own: mass transit.  Fernanda Santos and Sewell Chan contributed reporting. ",2008-07-22T18:14:27+0000

us,"A $600,000 Deal for M.T.A. Texts","When torrential rains shut down nearly the entire subway system on Aug. 8, 2007, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was unable to provide quick information to riders. Its Web site, with its confusing layout, crashed. And other means of delivering information like cellphone alerts, downloadable maps and electronic message boards were not available.   Chastened by the criticism, the M.T.A. commissioned a study of what went wrong and proposed a bunch of fixes, including developing a system of customized e-mail and text message alerts for each subway line so riders could be informed about problems.   That notification service will be unveiled in September. The authority has signed a $600,000 contract -- $120,000 a year for five years -- with the MIS Sciences Corporation, an Internet services company, to run a text-messaging service that will provide real-time alerts about subway, bus and train disruptions to millions of commuters. (The Daily News reported some details of the new text-messaging system on Sunday.)  Under the contract, the company must be able to send out at least one million messages in five minutes, far more than what the M.T.A. can do on its own. MIS Sciences provides a similar service to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  The transportation authority currently sends out regular e-mails -- which can also be sent to cellphones -- to commuters about track work and other planned service disruptions. About 60,000 New York City Transit customers, 40,000 Long Island Rail Road customers and 26,000 Metro-North Railroad customers have signed up for those advisories, according to Christopher P. Boylan, the authority's deputy executive director for corporate and community affairs.   But the ""Big Kahuna,"" Mr. Boylan said in a telephone interview, is the new system of real-time text alerts. Customers will be able to select information for specific subway, bus or railroad lines. ""You're going to self-select what you want, how much you want and when you want it,"" Mr. Boylan said.   In addition, M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels (also known as the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority), Long Island Bus and the M.T.A. Bus Company, which do not currently offer any form of e-mail notices, will be part of the new text-alert system, he said.  During major service disruptions, Mr. Boylan explained, vast numbers of messages must be sent simultaneously from many nodes. The M.T.A.'s system, however, required that e-mail alerts be sent sequentially, ""so it took maybe an hour to get a message out to 40,000 riders,"" he said.   (Mr. Boylan acknowledged that it would impossible for riders deep inside subway tunnels to get text alerts immediately, but said the messages would aid riders deciding whether to board the subway and riders entering or waiting inside stations.)  The transportation authority is not the only public entity moving to improve its text-messaging capabilities. In December, the New York City Office of Emergency Management announced a new text-messaging program, inviting readers in certain neighborhoods to sign up for emergency alerts.

James Besser of Jewish Week, appearing at Israpundit, has a few questions of his own:   ""Overwhelmingly, Jews surveyed say Israel is less secure since Bush moved into the White House.   ""But that didn't necessarily translate into great news for Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama. Asked about their current presidential choice this year, 58 percent indicate they back Obama, with another 4 percent saying they 'lean' toward the Democrat.  ""If those numbers hold, Obama would still win a majority of Jewish votes -- 62 percent -- but fall short of recent Democratic presidential nominees. And Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP nominee, would get about 32 percent, a big increase from President Bush's 24 percent in 2004.""  So, did that clear things up?

(AP/Glenn Pinkerton))  LAS VEGAS  Even though Team USA was humbled in Athens in 2004 and stunned by Greece at the 2006 World Championships, there's not exactly a lack of confidence at USA Basketball practices here.  ""We'd have to beat ourselves for us to lose,"" Carmelo Anthony said, flatly.   And while we'll hear over and over throughout the Olympics about how other countries' national teams have academies to train their young stars and a have national team system to meld them together, there's really no excuse for this USA team lose. The core has been playing for three years, buying into Jerry Colangelo's new game plan.   But for the real reason for all that confidence, look no further than the starting five that USA Basketball will be trotting out. There'll be a lot of talk about role players and chemistry, but the bottom line why this team will win the gold is that this starting five is so appreciably better than the last two USA Basketball duds, it's scary.   A quick starting five timeline:  2004 Olympics Bronze Medal game  Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Tim Duncan, Lamar Odom, Richard Jefferson  2006 World Championship semifinal  Kirk Hinrich, Joe Johnson, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Elton Brand  2008 projected Olympic starting lineup  Jason Kidd, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard   If the 2008 starters played against the 2004 starters, it would likely have all the excitement of a jayvee-varsity scrimmage or a December guarantee game. (That remark is made with apologies to Tim Duncan, who still must have nightmares about playing with that dysfunctional bunch.)   The 2006 lineup is slightly better, but upgrading from a Hinrich/Johnson backcourt to Kidd/Bryant is like trading a Bonneville for a Bentley. Kidd is the consummate distributor a team like this needs, and Bryant is the best player in the world. Hinrich and Johnson are, to put it kindly, good N.B.A. players.   When Anthony was asked about the difference between 2004 and now, I told him I was stunned at who was on the team looking back on the roster. (Yes, that's Lamar Odom, Emeka Okafor and Shawn Marion representing USA Basketball).   ""I think everyone was stunned,"" Anthony said. ""I think that the whole world was stunned. It was like we were brought on the team and they said, 'Hey, go out there and try and win the gold medal.' In this day and age, you can't do that.""

(Stemagen via Bloomberg News))   In China for the Olympics and looking for some gene-doping? Seems you can get hold of everything you need for it, despite the country's well-publicized efforts to stamp out the production and distribution of illicit performance-enhancing drugs.   That was the experience of journalists in a report shown on the German TV network ARD on Monday. One of the journalists, posing as an American swimming coach, was offered performance-enhancing stem-cell therapy by a Chinese-speaking doctor in exchange for $24,000.   In the encounter, which took place in a Chinese hospital and was shot with a hidden camera, the doctor said that it would take two weeks to perform the performance-enhancing treatment on the American swimmer the undercover journalist pretended to be representing.   ""I recommend four intravenous doses: 40 million stem cells, perhaps twice, the more the better,"" said the doctor, whose face was blurred in the video.   The hospital encounter was part of a documentary made by the German production company Dokfilm, ""Olympia im Reich der Mittel -- Doping in China,"" produced and written by Hajo Seppelt and Jo Goll. A one-minute English-language promotional clip of the documentary is available on the Dokfilm Web site.   Patrick Diel, a gene therapy expert at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne and WADA officer, expressed astonishment that such performance enhancements were so readily available.   ""I find this shocking,"" Diel said. ""It carries enormous health risks. Quite frankly, this surpasses my worst fears."" Diel and other German experts also said there was no evidence that stem-cell injections would work as a doping treatment.  The documentary also shows evidence of a cavalier stance among some doctors and pharmacists from Chinese drug companies toward distributing illicit substances, as well as testimony from scientists and doping experts on the development and background of the drugs. An excellent summary of the program has been posted on Swimnews.com and can be found here.  POWELL BEATS BOLT In a showdown of the world's fastest sprinters, Jamaican Asafa Powell edged out countryman Usain Bolt by one one-hundredth of a second in a 100-meter dash at an IAAF meet in Stockholm on Tuesday.

Here's the race:    BID FOR RECORD EIGHTH OLYMPICS FAILS The Jamaican-born sprinter Merlene Ottey failed Tuesday in her bid to become the first athlete ever to compete in eight Olympic Games.   (Photo: Merlene Ottey in 2003. (AP/Michael Probst))  The 48-year-old Ottey, who competed in six Olympics for Jamaica before running for Slovenia in 2004, failed to hit the qualifying time in the 100 meters by 28-hundredths of a second at a meet in Maribor, Slovenia -- her final attempt to make that country's Olympic team.   Over the course of her Olympic career, which began at the 1980 Moscow Games, Ottey won three silver and five bronze medals: six individual medals in the 100 and 200 meters, as well as a silver and a bronze in the 4x100-meter relay. She also won gold medals in the 200 meters at the 1993 and '95 world championships, and a 1991 gold in the 4x100 relay.   In 1999 she tested positive for an anabolic steroid and was banned, but she denied the charge and fought to clear her name. In 2000 she was cleared of all charges, and the laboratory that tested her samples was blamed for making errors.   Ottey's Slovenian coach said that Tuesday's failure to qualify does not mean the end of Ottey's career.   ""She will still train,"" he said, ""simply because she can still run very fast.""  (Photo: Injured or being kept from his country?: Brazil's Robinho, who Real Madrid says is injured and unable to play in the Olympics. (Nelson Almeida /AFP/Getty Images))  SOCCER'S INTERCONTINENTAL OLYMPIC CONFLICT  The world's big soccer clubs are proving very unwilling to let their players go to the Olympics. The latest kerfuffle: Real Madrid's statement on Monday that Brazil star Robinho is injured and unable to play in August, a contention that the Brazil soccer federation called ""disrespectful"" to Brazilian fans in an official statement on its Web site. The Times' Jack Bell explains what the fuss is all about:  Argentina wants Lionel Messi for the Olympics. Brazil wants Robinho and Diego for the Olympics.  Barcelona does not want to release Messi. Real Madrid tried to dissuade Robinho from making the trip. Werder Bremen do not want to release Diego.  With the start of the Olympic men's soccer tournament in China on Aug. 7, the tug of war between some of the top clubs in Europe and players who want to play for a gold medal has intensified and could spill into court. According to FIFA rules, the Olympic tournament is its de facto under-23 world championship, which means clubs around the world are required to release players 23 and younger if asked. That seems clear  and it is  except that even those rules are being challenged. European clubs view the Olympic tournament, which had once been limited to amateurs, as a nonessential event that impinges on the European schedule and steals costly international players.  The real problem arises with overage players, of whom each of the 16 nations in the Olympic men's tournament is allowed to have three on their rosters. So, Barcelona balked at allowing Ronaldinho to join Brazil's team as an overage player, but Ronaldinho's new club, A.C. Milan, has agreed to release him.  Messi has every intention of joining the Argentine team, which will be defending its gold medal won four years ago in Athens. Real Madrid said on Monday that Robinho has developed a groin injury; he was dropped by Brazil's team later that day.  Werder Bremen said it is ready to go to a German sports tribunal in an effort to bar Diego, who has scored 26 goals in 63 matches for the Bundesliga club, from going to China. Late last week, Diego said he would accede to the club's request not to play for Brazil (which is seeking the only title it has never won), but then he left the club to join Brazil's team in Paris.  Another Bremen player  the Serbian Dusko Tosic  was barred by the club from joining his Olympic team. Another Brazilian playing in Germany  Rafinha  left Schalke 04 against the club's wishes to join Brazil's team.  The imbroglio between European teams and primarily players from South America is the result of a differing perspective when it comes to the Olympics, according to an article on the BBC's Web site by Tim Vickery, a difference of opinion that is nearly as old as the Olympics and older than the World Cup.

us,European V.C. Firm Arrives Stateside,"The European venture capital firm Wellington Partners opened an outpost in Palo Alto, Calif., this month, hoping that a base in the United States will help the firm and its portfolio companies scout out partners and bridge cultural divides.   The first thing the Europeans will need to learn: don't dress so well. At the San Francisco soiree celebrating the firm's arrival this month, the Europeans in their trendy glasses and designer shoes stood out among the Silicon Valley types.   The firm, with offices in London, Munich and Zurich, was behind Xing, a European version of LinkedIn that went public on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in December 2006. Wellington will continue to invest only in European companies; the Silicon Valley office will concentrate on recruiting, researching competitors, marketing, relocating start-ups stateside and finding customers and business partners. ""With the Web 2.0 technologies coming to the marketplace, the day you start you can actually attempt to attack the entire global marketplace,"" says Ram Srinivasan, the partner running the Palo Alto office.   The game is played differently in Europe and the United States. For one, he says Europeans are more risk-averse, hesitant to work at a start-up when they could join a decades-old corporation and terrified of founding a company and failing. The venture capital business is much slower as a result -- European investors financed 308 companies in the second quarter of this year while Americans investors did 1,344 deals, according to Thomson Reuters.  ""In the Valley, if you've failed a few times that's actually a mark of success -- you know you're not going to repeat these errors. In Europe, if you fail you're looked at as a failure, not as someone who tried,"" Mr. Srinivasan explains.   Recruiting presents another cultural challenge. In Europe, unlike in the United States, it's a turn-off when job applicants boast about their skills and experience or bring up compensation. When an American executive proposed a product release party at one of Wellington's German portfolio companies, the founders blanched, thinking that the launch party, a Silicon Valley staple, would be too showy.   European entrepreneurs don't shoot for big public offerings the way Americans do, says Jrg berla, a Wellington partner in Munich. The firm hopes to fuel their European entrepreneurs' ambition by expanding the startups to Silicon Valley. ""In the Valley, people know someone who has experienced a change in lifestyle due to wealth creation. That kind of thing hasn't happened in Europe, therefore the fire has not been kindled, but I think that's just a matter of time,"" Mr. Srinivasan says.   The United States may offer European start-ups customers and executives, but not many exits. The public markets are all but closed for technology companies and the weak dollar makes it hard to sell European startups to American companies. On the other hand, Mr. Srinivasan says, Wellington portfolio companies provide revenue in euros, which could attract potential suitors. ",2008-07-22T21:49:20+0000

The Karolyis have produced champions like Mary Lou Retton and Nadia Comaneci. The United States team has won 13 gold medals at the world championships and the Olympics since Martha Karolyi took over more than seven years ago.  ""I know it can be done in a healthier way physically and emotionally,"" said Moceanu, a member of the Olympic gold-medal winning team in 1996.  Moceanu, who is 26, tried to make a comeback in the sport in 2006 after retiring six years before. USA Gymnastics rejected her petition to compete at the national championships that year, saying Moceanu wasn't physically prepared to compete.  ""I feel sad,"" Karolyi said on a USA Gymnastics conference call, after hearing of Moceanu's remarks.   ""The preparation is certainly, to become an Olympic champion, is a long road. Not every single moment is an easy moment and, as we all know, only the strong ones will become Olympic champions.  ""I think the majority of the girls certainly feel very proud that they were able to train those many years and be dedicated and deal with the sacrifices.""  Jennifer Sey, the 1986 national all-around champion, also is interviewed by HBO about the brutality of elite gymnastics. She wrote the recently published book, ""Chalked Up: Inside Elite Gymnastics' Merciless Coaching, Overzealous Parents, Eating Disorders, and Elusive Olympic Dreams.""  (Photo: Bela Karolyi last month. (AP/Justin Maxon))  So, that leads us to the age-old question: Is elite gymnastics too hard on young gymnasts?   Just last week, Shayla Worley of Orlando, 17, showed up at selection camp with a sore right lower leg, still hoping to make the Olympic team. She heard a pop while warming up on the balance beam last Friday, then ended up leaving the gym on crutches  and in tears. Her sore leg turned out to be broken.  Mattie Larson, a wispy 16-year-old from Los Angeles, competed on Friday and Saturday, then learned later that her right lower leg was also broken. She had a stress fracture in her tibia, an injury doctors say probably occurred after the Olympic trials four weeks ago.   She competed at the camp with no tears.  Nastia Liukin, one of the team's top competitors, said injuries and a strict diet simply go along with being a top athlete in a tough sport.   ""We have to prepare ourselves, just like any elite athlete would,"" she said. ""It is hard on everybody's body, just like it is for runners or soccer players or other people like that.""   But how much is too much?   At the top levels of sports, are games like soccer  in which United States player Abby Wambach broke two bones in her left leg last week -- just as unforgiving? She had a titanium rod and screws inserted into that leg the next day. ",2008-07-22T22:36:26+0000

Except the Paul-ite gathering is no longer so mini.  Due to popular demand, as the saying goes, Mr. Paul had to scrap plans to hold his event at the nearly 15,000-capacity Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota. Instead, his ""Rally for Liberty"" will move to the Target Center in Minneapolis, which can hold up to 18,000.   Mr. Paul, a Texas congressman, amassed both supporters and campaign contributions while running for the Republican nomination. He declined to seek the Libertarian nomination (former Representative Bob Barr is that party's candidate), but he is not endorsing Senator John McCain and continues to try to build on the antiwar, pro-privacy, antigovernment movement he inspired during his presidential run.  Grover Norquist, the antitax icon, and the conservative pundit Tucker Carlson are among those scheduled to appear at the event on Sept. 2 in Minneapolis while Republicans meet from Sept. 1-4 in nearby St. Paul. The shadow convention follows two days of training and organizing meetings.  Jesse Benton, a spokesman for Mr. Paul's nascent Campaign for Liberty political action committee, said in a news release that the event will remind Republicans that ""there is an army of grassroots activists across the country ready to work with them if they steer back to their traditions of limited government and personal liberty.""

us,A Natural Selection,"(The fourth part in a series celebrating Charles Darwin.)  Last week, I discussed how evolutionary biology has changed since 1859, the year Darwin first published ""On the Origin of Species."" But the subject of evolution isn't the only thing that's changed since then. There's been plenty of actual evolution, too. For although we tend to think of evolutionary change as being something that only takes place over the course of millions of years, it isn't. It's going on here, now, all around us. So, this week, I thought I'd round up some examples of recent evolutionary change in nature. (What do I mean by recent? Within the last 40 years.)  I'm not intending to be comprehensive  that would take a book or two. Instead, I want to sketch a few examples of natural selection that have caught my fancy, and through them consider different aspects of evolutionary change, and what it takes to show it.   Galpagos finches. No discussion of evolution in nature would be complete without mention of the evolution of beak size in finches in the Galpagos archipelago.   Every year since 1973, large numbers of medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) living on the island of Daphne Major have been marked, weighed and measured, and so have their chicks. In these finches, survival largely depends on the ability to open seeds; this depends on beak size. Bigger beaks allow the opening of larger seeds. How many seeds there are depends on the weather; some years seeds of all sizes are abundant, and the finches thrive. In other years, most seeds are scarce, and many birds die. Large-scale death affects the genetic make-up of the population, because both beak size and body size has a large genetic component. If all the birds with smaller than average beaks die in a given year, they take their genes with them.  Over the course of 30 years, annual measurement of finches shows that both body size and beak size evolved significantly. But they didn't do so in a smooth, consistent fashion. Instead, natural selection jittered about, often changing direction from one season to the next.   As the abundance of different seeds fluctuated, so too did the beak sizes. One year, larger beaks were more successful; then it was smaller beaks. Over time, the average shape of the beak kept shifting, but it did so in an unpredictable, erratic sort of way, like a drunk man staggering about. Thus, some of the most dramatic changes were later reversed, and if beaks had only been measured at the beginning and at the end of the thirty years, the total amount of evolutionary change would have been underestimated. (Beak size has continued to evolve: the arrival on the island of a competitor for large seeds has subsequently favored small beak sizes in Geospiza fortis. Many individuals with larger beaks starved to death.)  Field mustard. Between 2000 and 2004, southern California had a severe drought. For many plants, including field mustard (a scrawny annual plant with little yellow flowers), a drought means a shorter growing season. A shorter growing season means that plants that flower earlier are more likely to leave seeds than plants that flower later  which are in danger of dying before they've finished reproducing. Since flowering time has a large genetic component, a drought  by favoring plants that flower earlier  could cause an evolutionary shift towards early flowering.   Has it?  Yes. The beauty of plants is that they make seeds  small packets of genes that can be stored for a period. This means that the genes of the past can, in principle, be compared directly with the genes of today. And an experiment in which field mustard plants grown from seeds collected in 1997 and in 2004 were planted together, under controlled conditions, showed clear differences in flowering times: the plants from 2004 flowered significantly earlier.   Moreover, in both years, seeds were collected from two sites, one where the soil is sandy and doesn't hold water well, and the other where the soil stays wet for longer. As you'd expect, plants from the dry site showed a more dramatic shift than plants from the wet site. In the course of just 7 years, then, natural selection caused the plants to evolve an earlier flowering time.  Croatian lizards. In 1971, five pairs of adult wall lizards (Podarcis sicula) were brought to the tiny Croatian island of Pod Mraru from the nearby island of Pod Kopite. These five pairs have since given rise to a thriving lizard population  and one that has developed some interesting differences from the lizards that live on Kopite.  Lizards on Mraru now have larger heads and stronger bites than those living on Kopite, and they eat far more in the way of leaves and other plant material. Whereas the diet of native Kopite lizards is only about 7 percent plant matter, Mraru lizards are much more prone to a vegetarian habit. In spring, their diet is about 34 percent from plants; in summer that almost doubles, to 61 percent.  Plants are hard for animals to digest, and most plant-eaters rely on micro-organisms to help them. They also, typically, have complicated stomachs  think of the fermentation chambers in a cow, or the enlarged crop of that strange leaf-eating bird, the hoatzin. Intriguingly, the Mraru lizards appear to have evolved something similar. Their stomachs now have cecal valves, which divide the stomach into compartments, allowing for slower digestion and fermentation. Cecal valves are rare among lizards and snakes: fewer than 1 percent of species have them. At the same time, the Mraru lizards have acquired some novel micro-organisms in their guts (but whether these are helping break down plant fibers, or are some sort of sinister parasite, remains to be seen).  This study is one of the most intriguing I've come across. It suggests that arrival in a new environment can result in dramatic changes to an organism within fewer than 40 lifetimes. But so far, the basis of these various changes remains unknown: there's an outside possibility that they are induced by leaf eating, and are thus due to the environment rather than genetics. (This seems unlikely  even lizards that are just hatched, and haven't had a chance to do much eating, have the valves. But without doing the genetics, we can't be sure; until that has been looked at, the changes cannot definitely be attributed to natural selection.) For now, natural selection for efficient plant-eating is the main suspect for this whole suite of changes, but the case is not yet closed.  Other examples. I don't have space to go into other examples in detail, but to give a sense of what else is out there, here's a partial list.   The fruit fly Drosophila subobscura has been evolving bigger wings in higher latitudes in North and South America; mosquitoes that live in pitcher plants hunker down for the winter later in the year than they used to; in a forest in southern England, great tits have been shrinking (great tits are songbirds).   Double the time frame to the past 80 years, and I'd have to add many more; of these, my favorite is the decline in head size of Australian frog-eating snakes in response to the arrival of poisonous toads in 1935 (a smaller head makes it harder to eat a deadly toad). And I haven't even begun to mention the countless examples of pests that have evolved resistance to pesticides and bacteria that have evolved resistance to antibiotics, nor the thousands of laboratory experiments showing evolution in the simple environments of test tubes and petri dishes. Also omitted: several examples of new species that are in the process of forming (I want to look at these in a future column).   In short, evolution never takes a vacation: it's going on all the time.   Yet we tend not to notice it. Why? The finches can help us here. That study tells us two things. First, from one year to the next, even the most dramatic changes are, to our eyes, small  which is to say, you have to measure them to detect them. The reason is that although birds differ from one another in their abilities to handle the various seeds, the differences are subtle. It's not as if one bird has a beak 100 times mightier than another's. When you add to this the tendency of natural selection to jerk around, it's no surprise that we often don't notice evolution as it happens. It also sheds light on why changes in the fossil record often appear to be slow: these studies show that change can be continual without really getting far from the starting point. Second, getting data as good as that is hard work. Most datasets are not so complete or robust.   At least one other lesson can be drawn from all these studies. Natural selection has its most dramatic effects when an organism's environment is perturbed in some sustained way  prolonged droughts, the arrival of species that compete for food, warmer winters, the use of pesticides. If we humans continue to increase our impact on the globe, we're likely to see lots more evolution. And soon.  **********  NOTES:  For beak size in Galpagos finches, see Grant, P. R. and Grant, B.

Or a country?   Well, nothing can do that quite like LeBron James getting injured. James sustained a mild sprain of his right ankle at USA Basketball practice here Tuesday when he stepped on the foot of Kevin Durant during a scrimmage.  James was noticeably limping around after practice. Would the reverberations of James's injury ring out from Las Vegas to his N.B.A. home in Cleveland and throughout USA Basketball?   ""I don't think that it's anything serious,"" Team USA Coach Mike Krzyzewski said.   Along with being one of the two best players in the world, James is also critical to Team USA because of his versatility. James will not only be counted on for heavy minutes at his normal wing position, he will also be counted on for his size, toughness and rebounding at the power forward slot.   Team USA has Carmelo Anthony and Carlos Boozer for that spot, but their one obvious weakness is a lack of big, physical bodies inside to adapt to the rough tenor of international play. Every time that Coach K has been questioned about Team USA's lack of size, he has used James as an example of how to compensate.  And while this injury doesn't appear significant, it does raise a question: Just how vulnerable is Team USA if James is sidelined with an injury? Drop your thoughts in the comments section.

The group is run by the Rev. John C. Hagee, a pastor who was repudiated by Senator John McCain in May after earlier incendiary remarks surfaced. Mr. Lieberman is a prominent surrogate for Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.   Mr. Lieberman was greeted by a boisterous standing ovation in a room decked out with United States and Israeli flags. ""I am your brother Joseph,"" he said.  Asserting that Mr. Hagee had worked hard to fight anti-Semitism, Mr. Lieberman said: ""I don't agree with everything Pastor Hagee has said, and I can safely say that the pastor doesn't agree with everything that I've said. But there's so much more than that that we agree on.""   Mr. Lieberman added, ""I will tell you tonight the bond that I feel with Pastor Hagee and each and every one of you is much stronger than that and I am proud to stand with you tonight.""  Mr. Hagee's support for Mr. McCain had been seen as a boon to Mr. McCain's outreach to evangelical voters until the disclosure of earlier remarks in which Mr. Hagee said, ""Hitler and the Nazis were sent by God, to chase Jews back to the land of Israel.""   Over 40,000 signatures were delivered to Mr. Lieberman's office encouraging him not to speak at the event.  Jeremy Ben-Ami, executive director of J Street, which started the ""Don't Go Joe"" campaign, said, ""The purportedly 'pro-Israel' views of Hagee and his supporters bear little to no resemblance to the consensus of the vast majority of American Jews, who strongly support a negotiated, two-state resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and active engagement by the United States to facilitate it."" The group describes itself as the ""political arm of the pro-Israel, pro-peace movement.""   In his remarks to the group, Mr. Hagee made known his intention to make no more presidential endorsements. ""What will I say when I'm asked to endorse another presidential candidate? 'Never Again!',"" he said to applause.     ",2008-07-23T02:45:28+0000

us,A Playlist by Rick Moody,"(Photo: Rick Moody (Thatcher Keats))   Rick Moody's most recent book is ""Right Livelihoods,"" a collection of novellas.   Rick Moody's July 2008 Playlist:   Some Songs I Like:  1) Wyatt's Song of Reproach, by Robin Williamson (""The Iron Stone""). Some people are skeptical about the recent work of Robin Williamson, a onetime cornerstone of the Incredible String Band, but I am not one of these people. This is folky, yes, but it has a strange, jazzy feeling to it, like it was arranged and recorded quickly, which it was. But there's a luminous, otherworldly tenderness about the adult work of Williamson, and this is a good place to start.  2) Variant I Processional March, by Frank Zappa (""Wazoo""). Eventually, this became ""Regyptian Strut,"" which was released on Sleep Dirt, after Warner Brothers deep-sixed Zappa's gigantic multi-disc album Lther, including this and many other things. Before all that, Frank was playing a few gigs with an enormous jazz orchestra that he conducted himself. This arrangement features the tambourine of late '60s rock 'n' roll, but it's also got beautiful horn charts, and, like Zappa's best work, is full of off-kilter joy.  3) Bright Phoebus, Blue Murder (""Shining Bright: The Songs of Lal and Mike Waterson""). I owe this discovery to John Wesley Harding, a k a Wesley Stace, with whom I have been singing it recently. It's from that great period of the British folk revival, the mid-'60s, the period that also brought us Martin Carthy, Jackson C. Frank (see below), and, in a way, Simon and Garfunkel.   4) Empty Cupboard, Carla Kihlstedt (""2 Foot Yard""). The most interesting and incisive violin player in America (""Tin Hat,"" ""Sleepytime Gorilla Museum,"" ""Book of Knots"") proves that she's also a really awesome singer.   5) A Sweeter Way to Say Goodbye, Hannah Marcus (""From English Planes""). You will have to take my word on this one, because it's not released. Hannah Marcus is one of the finest songwriters working today, the equal not only of Jolie Holland, Fiona Apple, Will Oldham, etc., but, on a good day, the equal of Mitchell, Cohen and, yes, that guy from Minnesota. No, not exaggerating. The lyrics here are brutal and very contemporary, and the music is timeless and understated. And if you want to hear it, you'll just have to write me or Hannah.   6) If 6 Was 9, World Saxophone Quartet (""Experience""). I really like their version of ""Mannish Boy,"" too.   7) Singing Sailors, Jackson C. Frank, Blues Run the Game. From the deluxe CD reissue of one of the finest lost albums of '60s folk music. This expanded edition has some examples of Frank's later songs, from when he had a great variety of personal problems and couldn't put his best foot forward. This song is so sad it's almost impossible to listen to. But it also tells you more about what it feels like to have your best work behind than almost anything else. Anywhere.  8) I Found You, Gene Clark (""Echoes""). With Gene Clark, best known for his time with the Byrds, the lyrics are always elusive, and you have to work hard with the songs to understand. See, for example, ""Eight Miles High."" Is it about his fear of flying? Acid? The music business? This is a more straightforward love song, of which he wrote a few, but that doesn't stop it, as in some of Brian Wilson's compositions, from hinting at so much discomfort that it shimmers with paradoxes.   9) I Will Be Sad, Billy Tipton Memorial Saxophone Quartet (""Saxhouse""). Another great sax quartet, all women, organized by Jessica Lurie and Amy Denio, two splendid and versatile musicians from the Northwest. They have made a lot of great albums since this relatively early cut, all of them quite wonderful.  10) Ghetto Raga, The Third Ear Band (""Alchemy""). I can't remember where I heard this first, but the Third Ear Band is mostly famous for having scored Roman Polanski's film of Macbeth, a movie that had a great impact on me when I first saw it in high school. The instrumentation was eccentric  percussion, violin, woodwinds  and they played mostly improvised music, which must have sounded unusual to listeners back in Swinging London. But when they got the mood right, as in this long Indian-style drone, the results were eerie and memorable.  11) First Light, Richard and Linda Thompson (""Dreams Fly Away""). There's a band version of this song on the album of the same name, but the band version scarcely hints at the spiritual ambition of the song, which needed to wait until the release of a Linda Thompson greatest hits package for its glory to be apparent. This guitar-and-voices arrangement instead displays the uncanny harmonies of these two astonishing singers at the moment of their devotion to Sufism. It's gospel of a different sort, therefore, with all the drama of that genre.   12) Horizontal Technicolor, David Grubbs (""Two Soundtracks for Angela Bullock""). Nepotism, sure, because I play with Grubbs, and have written lyrics for him, though he doesn't need the help. I admire his challenging, abstract, experimental compositions greatly, however, and this is a particularly compelling example. A long investigation of the inherent properties of the wah pedal. It verges on the terrain of the great drone-metal band Earth, but is, in a way, far more delicate. Perfect writing music.   13) Blackwater's Side, The Clancy Brothers (""In Concert""). My mother played the Clancy Brothers a lot when I was a kid. She's Irish, by derivation. This is a very melancholy ballad, something the Irish do like no one else. ""That's not a promise you made to me / When you laid upon my breast. / You could make me believe with your lying tongue / That the sun rose in the West."" They don't write them like this anymore.   14) Poppy Nogood And the Phantom Band, Terry Riley (""Poppy Nogood: All Night Flight""). A very, very early tape loop performance by one of the great masters of the form, and the man who single-handedly launched the genre of Minimalism.   15) Mexican Blues, Jolie Holland (""Springtime Can Kill You""). Jolie Holland veers between coy if stunningly virtuosic vocal mannerisms that suggest jazz and tin pan alley and much more direct compositions that come from folk, Old Time and rock 'n' roll. The latter tendency, to these ears, is devastating, and this is one such example. A love song to a friend, ""Mexican Blues"" is so haunting that it never fails to make me weep. How lucky the friend to be its recipient.  16) Are You Glad to Be In America?, James ""Blood"" Ulmer (""Odyssey""). A question still worth asking.   17) First Girl I Loved, Incredible String Band (""The Chelsea Sessions""). And now Robin Williamson (see #1, above), as a very young man, writing about when he was even younger. Certainly among the most affecting love songs in the folk music canon, presented in its demo form.   18) Hard Time Killing Floor Blues, Skip James (""Heroes of the Blues""). The whole game of lists is facetious, yes, I agree. It's something for boys to do when they have too much times on their hands. But when I am indulging in the nonsense of list-making, and it occurs to me, with utmost bravado, that it is time to name the best song ever, this is often the song I choose (although ""God Only Knows,"" by the Beach Boys, is close). I have read that Skip James was an unhappy and temperamental person. I submit that he was unhappy and temperamental because what he was able to do with just voice and guitar was so vulnerable and terrifying that it was hard for him to be alive and feel this openness to the horrors of this world. This song does what a song must do, move, edify, illuminate, and without ever being obvious or sentimental about it.  ",2008-07-23T03:16:53+0000

The cancellation follows the decision on Monday by Aflac, the insurance company, to pull its advertising from the show. On his Web site, Michaelsavage.com, the host posted a letter on Monday in which he iterated the central point he said he had been trying to make on his July 16 program: that autism is too often misdiagnosed in the cases of children, or falsely diagnosed, at least partly as a means of wringing resources. Let the truly autistic be treated, he wrote. Let the falsely diagnosed be free. On July 16, Mr. Savage, above, referred to autism as a fraud, a racket, and asserted that what 99 percent of children with autism most needed was a parent willing to tell them things like, Dont act like a moron.

us,A Wild One at Shea,"Even with Johan Santana pitching eight superb innings, even with the Mets leading by three runs heading into the ninth, and even with first place just three outs away, I think it would have been difficult to find anyone in the Shea Stadium press box who did not expect Billy Wagner's unavailability to prove an obstacle, or at least prepare for the possibility.  That is how baseball works, I've learned. It's humbled many, many a player and lowly writers like myself. Just when you think an important development of the day will play only a minor role in the outcome, you see Duaner Sanchez give up three straight hits to begin the ninth. You learn that Wagner was, despite what he suggested before the game, not even close to being an option. You realize that as soon as Shane Victorino homers in the seventh, turning a four-run deficit into a three-run deficit -- a save situation -- the baseball gods are going to interfere. And pretty soon it all happens.  Considering the Mets' lacking a true closer Tuesday, much will be made about Jerry Manuel's decision to yank Santana for a pinch-hitter after eight innings. Santana had thrown at least 105 pitches, his magic number Tuesday, in 10 other starts. Could he have pitched the ninth? Sure. I'd bet on that. And, by that point, with the Mets up by three, the benefits of lifting Santana for a pinch-hitter may not have outweighed the potential reward of him resting the bullpen and finishing off a complete game that would boost the Mets into first place. But if you're Manuel, don't you have to believe that your bullpen could get three outs before the Phillies score three runs? He said afterward that he thought so.   There was so much else I could have gotten into in my story that you'll see online, but I've always been fascinated by coincidences, recurring themes, bizarre things, patterns, etc.   For instance, the last time the Mets lost after leading by three or more runs heading into the ninth inning was on Sept. 20, 2007, in Florida ... when Wagner was unavailable because of back spasms. Or how the Mets have now lost three times when leading after eight innings, twice when Santana has pitched. Or how the Phillies have now scored in the ninth inning in three straight games with the Mets, going ahead twice and nearly winning the third time, in that unforgettable game on July 7. And yet, as I look over the box score once more, it seems a little unfair that Joe Smith, who faced one batter and gave up a fielder's choice on a play that should have yielded an out, was credited with the loss -- and not Sanchez or Pedro Feliciano. Such is baseball, yet again.  ",2008-07-23T04:33:48+0000

us,The Quad Countdown: No. 37 Notre Dame,"Location: South Bend, Ind.  Nickname: Fighting Irish. Is this nickname offensive? Discuss.  (Photo: Charlie Weis is not the only one anxiously waiting to see how Notre Dame will perform this season. (Bill Haber/Associated Press))   Quick facts: The Irish have won 10 games seven times in the last 30 seasons. Over the same time span, Fresno State also has seven seasons with at least 10 victories, Clemson has six and Air Force and Syracuse have five. I'm just trying to make a point here: outside of the tremendous teams under Lou Holtz from 1988-1993 (including the 1988 national champs), Notre Dame has been rather pedestrian. So why do so many college football fans take such delight in watching the Irish fail? Is hatred of the Fighting Irish something that is handed down from father to son, generation to generation? And why will most loyal readers of the Countdown have a conniption about Notre Dame's ranking on this list?   Tidbit: Let's just get this out of the way. How bad was Notre Dame a season ago? The nine losses were the most in program history. The 0-5 opening was the worst start in program history. The loss to Navy in early November was their first setback in the series in 44 years; Notre Dame's loss to Air Force a week later marked the first time the Irish had lost to two service academies in the same season since 1944. Those two losses contributed to a 1-6 home record, also the worst in program history. The Irish averaged 16.4 points and 242.2 yards per game, two of the worst totals in program history. O.K., we get it. It was the worse year in the long and illustrious history of Notre Dame football. Let's move on to next season.  Tidbit (positives edition): A little more than a week ago, in the Countdown's profile of Michigan, we pointed out the Wolverines' place as the winningest team (869) in F.B.S. history, as well as the program with the highest winning percentage (.743). Notre Dame is second in both victories (824) and winning percentage (.738), and has the fewest losses (279) of any team with more than 100 years' experience. The Irish have 12 recognized national championships, the most of any F.B.S. program.  Tidbit (recruiting edition): According to the good people at Rivals.com, Notre Dame Coach Charlie Weis is a huge upgrade over his predecessor, the current Washington coach Ty Willingham  at least when it comes to recruiting. Willingham's final three classes (2003-5) averaged a ranking of 28th (12th, 32nd and 40th, respectively), while Weis has averaged a ranking of sixth (eighth, eighth and second from 2006-8). On the other hand, Weis's successful two-year stretch from 2005-6 (19-6 over all) was largely accomplished using Willingham's key players, such as quarterback Brady Quinn, wide receiver Jeff Samardzija and running back Darius Walker.   Former players in the N.F.L.: 51  DE Victor Abiamiri (Philadelphia Eagles), WR Arnaz Battle (San Francisco 49ers), DE Bertrand Berry (Arizona Cardinals), OL Jordan Black (Houston Texans), LB Rocky Boiman (Philadelphia Eagles), DT Darrell Campbell (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), TE John Carlson (Seattle Seahawks), K John Carney (Kansas City Chiefs), TE Jerome Collins (Giants), S Deke Cooper (Atlanta Falcons), S Glenn Earl (Houston Texans), OL Jeff Faine (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), TE Anthony Fasano (Miami Dolphins), RB Tony Fisher (Jets), TE Marcus Freeman (Giants), DE Chris Frome (Chicago Bears), OL Mike Gandy (Arizona Cardinals), WR David Givens (Tennessee Titans), RB Ryan Grant (Green Bay Packers), OL Ryan Harris (Denver Broncos), P Ryan Hentrich (Tennessee Titans), WR Carlyle Holiday (Green Bay Packers), LB Grant Irons (Oakland Raiders), RB Julius Jones (Seattle Seahawks), DT Derek Landri (Jacksonville Jaguars), DT Trevor Laws (Philadelphia Eagles), OL Mark LeVoir (St. Louis Rams), DT Lance Legree (New Orleans Saints), OL Travis Leitko (Indianapolis Colts), OL Sean Mahan (Pittsburgh Steelers), LB Corey Mays (Cincinnati Bengals), OL Jim Molinaro (Dallas Cowboys), S Chinedum Ndukwe (Cincinnati Bengals), TE John Owens (Detroit Lions), OL Luke Pettigout (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), QB Brady Quinn (Cleveland Browns), CB Mike Richardson (New England Patriots), OL Mike Rosenthal (Miami Dolphins), CB Allen Rossum (San Francisco 49ers), OL Dan Santucci (Cincinnati Bengals), S Gerome Sapp (Baltimore Ravens), P Hunter Smith (Indianapolis Colts), OL Dan Stevenson (Houston Texans), WR Maurice Stovall (Tampa Bay Buccaneers), OL John Sullivan (Minnesota Vikings), DE Justin Tuck (Giants), RB Darius Walker (Houston Texans), DE Anthony Weaver (Houston Texans), DE Renaldo Wynn (Giants), DE Bryant Young (San Francisco 49ers), S Tom Zbikowski (Baltimore Ravens).

Team Information  Conference: Independent.  Head coach: Charlie Weis ('78 Notre Dame), 22-15 after three seasons at his alma mater. Weis was a speech and drama major as an undergraduate, perhaps the reason why his sideline outbursts are so  well, colorful. A longtime N.F.L. assistant before taking on the Notre Dame job, coaching 10 years under Bill Parcells (1990-92 with the Giants, 1993-96 with Patriots, 1997-1999 with the Jets) and another five under Bill Belichick (2000-4 with the Patriots), Weis won four Super Bowls as an assistant (1990 with the Giants, 2001 and 2003-4 with the Patriots)  including the last three as offensive coordinator  and participated in another (1996 with the Patriots). Perhaps his most acclaimed coaching job came in 2001, when Weis broke in an unproven, inexperienced quarterback (one Tom Brady) while orchestrating the Patriots offense to a Super Bowl title. When it comes to his tenure at Notre Dame, let's start with the positives: after inheriting a program in disarray following the firing of Willingham, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back B.C.S. game appearances (justified or not) en route to setting a Notre Dame record with 19 victories in his first two seasons as head coach. He created an offense, led by Quinn, that was among the best in Notre Dame history (a program-record 440 points scored in 2005). That 2005 season (a 9-3 finish) earned Weis the National Coach of the Year award. Last fall's 3-9 debacle took much of the shine off his tremendous two-year run, leaving many Irish fans wondering about the direction of the program. Another poor season would place his job firmly in jeopardy. Weis, whose gargantuan $4 million contract (the largest contract in the F.B.S., eat your heart out Kirk Ferentz) runs through 2015, is only a half game better than Willingham (21-15 from 2002-4) through three seasons. Though he is an upgrade over Willingham  especially in recruiting  that record raises some questions. Seat temperature check: humid.  2007 record: 3-9, the most losses in program history. We already rehashed the overwhelming evidence in support of 2007 being the worst season in Irish history (well, Notre Dame history; it still trails the Great Famine by a wide margin), but there were a few bright points in an otherwise forgettable campaign. The sophomore quarterback Jimmy Clausen  the player everyone seems to root against  had one of the better freshman seasons for a quarterback in N.D. history, while the Irish got solid receiving play from the underclassmen Duval Kamara, Robby Parris and George West. The defense received inspired play from end Trevor Laws, as well as typically hard-nosed action from safety Tom Zbikowski. The punting game was also strong, as Geoff Price graduated with the program's second-best career average. O.K., so we're reaching a bit. Though the season may not have begun with national title hopes, the general consensus was that the Irish were still an eight-win team; it wasn't even close, as Notre Dame flopped out of the gate with an 0-5 start, and sat at 1-9 before winning its last two games.   High point: The best of Notre Dame's three wins was a 20-6 victory over U.C.L.A. on Oct. 6, a victory that snapped N.D.'s seven-game losing streak. After losing the next four, Notre Dame beat Duke by 28-7 and Stanford by 21-14 to end the season.   Low point: The Irish lost their first five games by a combined score of 166-46, the worst being a 38-0 loss at Michigan, a game both team entered with an 0-2 record. The rivalry game with U.S.C. was also a 38-0 laugher. Two years prior, the pair played perhaps the best college football game of the decade; this one wasn't as close. The aforementioned losses to Navy and Air Force cemented the 2007 team as the program's worst.  Tidbit (winning streak edition): The Irish enter the 2008 season on a two-game winning streak, their longest streak to start a season since 1993 (seven games). How is that possible, you may ask? See below for more details.  Tidbit (bowl edition): The Irish have lost nine consecutive bowl games (dating back to 1994), the longest string of bowl ineptitude in N.C.A.A. history. Each of the last five losses have come by at least 14 points, including a 27-point loss to L.S.U. in the 2007 Sugar Bowl.   Returning starters: 15 (9 offense, 6 defense).  Key losses  On offense, the Irish only lost two starters off last year's inexperienced unit: tight end John Carlson and center John Sullivan. Carlson picked up where his predecessor, the current Miami Dolphin Anthony Fasano, left off, leading the team in receptions (40) and receiving yards (372). Carlson's three touchdown grabs were good for second on the team. The 38th overall pick in April's draft (Seahawks), Carlson was a terrific fit in Weis's pro-style offense. Sullivan, who played his high school ball in Greenwich, Conn., was a member of the Rimington Trophy watch list in both 2006-7. Despite battling injuries a senior (he missed the season's final three games), Sullivan remained among the nation's top centers, and will be missed on the interior of the Notre Dame line. A sixth-round pick of the Vikings, he is in position to apprentice one season under the All-Pro Matt Birk before battling for the starting job in 2009.  On defense, the losses are bit more severe, especially in the case of the standouts Laws and Zbikowski. Laws led all defensive lineman in the F.B.S. with 112 tackles, while also leading the Irish with four sacks. He was the team M.V.P. for the 2007 season, and deservedly so: he was the lone Notre Dame defender  and perhaps the lone player, period  who excelled week after week despite the team's disappointing results. Laws played end in the 3-4 defense, but at 6-0, 304 pounds, projects as a defensive tackle at the next level. His production, and leadership, will be sorely missed in 2008. He followed Carlson as a second-round pick (47th over all), landing with the Eagles. Though Zbikowski never seemed to recapture the tremendous play he exhibited as a sophomore, he departs South Bend as a two-time all-American and an integral part of a pass defense that allowed only 161.6 yards per game last fall. That total was the best by an Irish defense since 1996. As a senior, Zbikowski finished fifth on the team in tackles with 80, adding two picks. He again served as an asset in the return game, averaging 10.2 yards per return; as a pro, he may make an early impact on special teams. Weis and his staff will attempt to offset the loss of inside linebacker Joe Brockington (108 tackles, a team-leading 8.5 for loss) by committee, though the junior Toryan Smith seems to be the favorite for the starting spot. One underclassman who will not be playing for the Irish in 2008, though he may return next season, is the would-be junior cornerback Darrin Walls, who left school for personal reasons. Walls started 11 games in 2007, making 32 tackles and an interception. He was expected to occupy one starting corner spot.  Tidbit (N.F.L. draft edition): After going from 1998-2006 with no more than two players taken on the first day of the draft, the Irish have had three players go on Day 1 each of the last two seasons: Quinn (1st round, 22nd over all), Victor Abiamiri (2nd, 57th over all) and Ryan Harris (3rd, 70th over all) in 2007, and Carlson, Laws and Zbikowski (3rd round, 86th over all to the Ravens) in 2008.   Players to watch: It all starts at quarterback, where Clausen enters his second season as the undisputed future of the Irish program. Though he may face some competition from the incoming freshman Dayne Crist, Clausen showed enough over the last three games of the season (636 yards, six touchdowns against one pick) to justify his ranking as the best high school recruit in the country in 2007. Thrust into the starting role in the second week (no freshman Q.B. in Notre Dame history had ever started prior to the fourth game of his rookie season), Clausen went through the inevitable struggles, losing his first four starts while struggling to move the ball. While most of his early ineffectiveness can be traced to inexperience, some of the blame must fall upon Clausen's slow recovery from off-season elbow surgery. Clausen ranks second on Notre Dame's freshman quarterback list in terms of passing yards (1,254), completions (138), attempts (245) and completion percentage (56.3 percent). He may not be among the 10 best quarterbacks in the country, but Clausen's projected development in 2008 is a story line to watch. His favorite target is the lanky sophomore wideout Duval Kumara, who at 6-5, 222 pounds, certainly looks the part of an N.F.L. receiver. He played well enough as a freshman  a N.D. rookie record 32 receptions and 4 touchdowns  to project well for the next level. One receiver to remember is the sophomore Golden Tate, who caught six balls for 131 yards last fall, a 21.8 yards-per-catch average. Weis and the new offensive coordinator Mike Haywood need to find ways to get him the ball. Other productive weapons include the senior David Grimes (27 receptions, 224 yards) and the junior Robby Parris (29 for 361). Up front, the Irish return four starters, including the junior right tackle Sam Young, who has started all 25 games since arriving in South Bend in 2006. Though he has started at both tackle spots with the Irish, Young will move permanently to the right side this fall, with the senior Paul Duncan protecting Clausen's blindside. Tight end, all important in the Notre Dame offense, lost a productive senior in Carlson, but the position looks to be in solid shape in 2008 and beyond with the sophomore Mike Ragone (one reception for seven yards in 2007) and the incoming freshman Kyle Rudolph, the nation's top tight end recruit. On the defensive line, the Irish staff hopes the sophomore Ian Williams, a freshman all-American in 2007, can help replace some of Laws's lost production. His 45 tackles a season ago, sixth on the team, was the third-most by a freshman lineman in Notre Dame history. Linebacker looks like a strength, especially with the senior Maurice Crum Jr. returning in the middle: Crum, who had 84 tackles last season, enters his final season with 241 career stops and 37 career starts, most on the team. Crum will get help from the sophomore Brian Smith, who is penciled in at one of the outside linebacker spots. Smith was one of a number of freshman defenders who made an impact a season ago, recording 25 tackles, 1.5 sacks and an interception. Though Notre Dame will need to replace two starters in the secondary, they return two experienced seniors in free safety David Bruton and corner Terrail Lambert. Bruton, in addition to leading the team with three interceptions, is Notre Dame's leading returning tackler (85, 4.5 for loss). Lambert, whose 22 consecutive starts is second only to Crum's 37, has 74 tackles and 4 picks over the last two seasons. With the loss of Zbikowski, and now Walls, Lambert and Bruton will be integral to the success of the entire defense.  Position battle to watch: Losing a starting cornerback like Walls is often difficult to overcome, but corner is one position where the Irish seem to be in pretty good shape. His backups, the junior Raeshon McNeil and the sophomore Gary Gray, were battling for the nickel spot but are now in line to earn a starting job in the Irish secondary. McNeil has played in 22 games over his two seasons in South Bend (nine tackles and a sack last fall), taking snaps at both corner and safety, while Gray missed all of last season due to injury. The real issue for the Irish will be finding a consistent running game, something that eluded them through much of the 2007 season; the Irish finished 117th in the F.B.S. in rushing offense (903 yards). The junior James Aldridge is the team's leading returning rusher after a 463-yard 2007 season, including two 100-yard games. Though he enters the fall atop the depth chart, he will be pushed through camp and into the season by the sophomores Robert Hughes and Armando Allen. Hughes burst onto the scene in the season's final two games, rushing for 246 yards (7 yards per carry) and 2 touchdowns in victories over Duke and Stanford; he became the first Notre Dame freshman back to break 100 yards in back-to-back games since Allen Pinkett in 1982. Allen was second on the team with 348 yards, though he made additional contributions in the passing game (24 receptions for 124 yards) and on special teams (a team-record 704 kick return yards). One of three needs to step up and take the starting job, though Allen seems better suited as third-down or change-of-pace back. If I were Weis, I would give Hughes the rock until he shows the last two games of 2007 were a fluke.   2008 schedule:  Sept. 6 San Diego State Sept. 13 Michigan Sept. 20 @ Michigan State Sept. 27 Purdue Oct. 4 Stanford Oct. 11 @ North Carolina Oct. 25 @ Washington Nov. 1 Pittsburgh Nov. 8 @ Boston College Nov. 15 Navy (in Baltimore) Nov. 22 Syracuse Nov. 29 @ U.S.C.  Game(s) to watch: The usual rivalry games, Michigan and U.S.C. specifically. The Irish have lost the last two to the Wolverines by a combined score of 85-21, while Weis is 0-3 against the Trojans, the last two losses coming by at least 20 points. Notre Dame has to win home games against San Diego State, Stanford and Syracuse, the three most winnable games on the schedule.  Season breakdown & prediction: Like most college football fans, I don't drink the Notre Dame kool-aid. I think they are perennially over-ranked, receive undue acclaim and publicity, and are often unworthy of the attention paid to them by the college football world. The only reason I say this is to dissuade any reader who may think what I'm about to say is biased by a pro-Notre Dame agenda: I think Notre Dame is going to markedly better in 2008, perhaps even  gasp  six wins better. This is due to a number of reasons. One, the definite improvement on offense. Yes, it truly can't get any worse, but the Irish will have a healthy Clausen  who was greatly improved down the stretch  and a deeper, more experienced line, which will help the running game. Losing Laws up front hurts, but the Irish hope the potential group of Williams, the senior Justin Brown and the junior Morrice Richardson can help offset his departed production. At linebacker, an integral part of the 3-4 defense, N.D. has a standout in Crum and a number of talented, athletic underclassmen, which will help make the unit better than it was a year ago. The most important thing to remember about the Irish is that those freshman who struggled through last fall are now sophomores, and the experience they gained while struggling through a 3-9 season will pay immense dividends this coming season and beyond. Most important of all, the athletic department has presented the Irish with a workable schedule. There are a number of no-doubt wins on the docket (San Diego State, Syracuse), many probable victories (Navy, Stanford) and a grab-bag of potential victories. Unlike years past, Notre Dame fans do not look at their team's schedule and automatically project three, even four losses before the season even starts. I believe there is only one game  Southern California  that is a definite loss. As for a prediction, I see the Irish at 8-4, a great step forward after last fall and a sign that, just maybe, the program is in good hands.   Dream season: Wipe away those tears, Touchdown Jesus! The Irish finish the season 10-2, losing only at Michigan State and U.S.C., and earn their third B.C.S. bowl appearance (justified or not) under Weis.  Nightmare season: Despite an improvement on offense and an easier schedule, Notre Dame cannot make more than a two-game improvement off of its 3-9 finish of 2007.  Where do Notre Dame fans congregate: There are dozens of fan sites to comb through, but the Countdown gives you the cream of the crop. For message boards and recruiting sites, check out Irish Illustrated, Blue and Gold, Irish Eyes and Irish Envy. Other good resources include Irish Sports Report and N.D. Nation.   Who is No. 36?: This program went 2-21 from 2001-2, but has won at least eight games four of the last five seasons.   ",2008-07-23T05:29:15+0000

(Photo: Ruby Washington/The New York Times) ) Five years ago this afternoon, a New York City councilman was shot to death inside City Hall by a political rival who accompanied him to a Council meeting, pulled out a pistol and began firing in front of scores of stunned lawmakers and onlookers.   The assassination of the councilman, James E. Davis, 41, of Brooklyn, was one of the most tumultuous episodes in the 200-year history of the seat of government, which was built between 1803 and 1812.   The gunman, Othniel B. Askew, 31, had planned to challenge Mr. Davis in the fall for his seat representing central Brooklyn in the Council. Mr. Askew was apparently able to slip his gun into City Hall by accompanying the councilman, who did not have to pass through metal detectors.  (Photo: Councilman James E. Davis (Photo: Gregory P. Mango/Associated Press)) At 2:08 p.m., as they were seated in the balcony of the Council chamber, Mr. Askew fired a silver .40-caliber pistol, hitting Mr. Davis twice in the chest. Mr. Davis, a retired police officer, was carrying a weapon, but it was in its holster, The Associated Press reported at the time.  As pandemonium broke out, a plainclothes police officer, Richard B. Burt, 34, who was assigned to City Hall and was filling in as a member of the detail that protected the Council speaker, Gifford Miller, drew his service pistol and fired it six times into the balcony, striking Mr. Askew five times and killing him.  Amid the chaos, City Hall was locked down, as politicians, city workers, journalists and visitors feared that the gunman might still be loose. Subway trains were rerouted, police units descended on Lower Manhattan and in the first confused moments many New Yorkers, with the events of 9/11 less than two years in the past, wondered if another terrorist attack had occurred.   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had been in office only 18 months and was in his second-floor office when the shots rang out, remained calm through the crisis, and immediately ordered security changes that required everyone entering City Hall -- including elected officials and the mayor himself -- to go through security detectors. Previously, officials like Mr. Davis could wave through their guests, a traditional courtesy that had been extended by the police.  (Photo: Othniel B. Askew (Photo: Associated Press/WCBS-TV)) It later emerged that Mr. Askew had contacted the F.B.I. about what he said was a sustained effort by Mr. Davis to intimidate him, promising that if Mr. Askew did not challenge him, he would receive a job with medical benefits. Mr. Askew, who grew up on Long Island, served in the Air Force and worked as a model, also had told law enforcement authorities that Mr. Davis had threatened to reveal he was gay.  Five days after the assassination, Mr. Davis's body laid in state at City Hall as 7,000 mourners gathered.   Meanwhile, maneuvering began to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Davis's death. The councilman's brother, Geoffrey A. Davis, took his spot on the ballot, but in the November election, Letitia James, a Working Families Party candidate, won the seat. (Ms. James has since become a Democrat.)  The fifth anniversary of the assassination has been the occasion for some reflection. At City Hall -- where the lounge for City Council members was renamed for Mr. Davis in 2004 -- a lunch was held on Friday in Mr. Davis's memory.  On Tuesday night, a prayer vigil was held at St. James Place and DeKalb Avenue, on the edge of the Pratt Institute campus in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. At the vigil, Mr. Davis, who had won office in 2001 after several unsuccessful attempts, was remembered as something of a maverick.   ""Five years ago, almost to this moment, many of us gathered here when we heard this news,"" said Assemblyman Hakeem S. Jeffries, who organized and led the brief ceremony, which drew about 50 people.   Delia M. Hunley-Adossa, president of the 88th Precinct Community Council, read a poem in Mr. Davis's honor and invoked the African belief that ""a person never dies as long as his name is still spoken in the village,"" while Councilman David Yassky remembered Mr. Davis as a ""24/7 City Council member.""   Mr. Jeffries recited a favorite slogan of Mr. Davis's -- ""Love Yourself"" -- and the crowd shouted back, three times, ""Stop the Violence."" Then William Robinson, a member of Brown Memorial Baptist Church, began to sing ""Amazing Grace.""   In a phone interview, Ms. James, who succeeded Mr. Davis as the representative for the 35th Council District, which spans the neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Prospect Heights and Crown Heights, reflected on his legacy. ""He was a very complex figure, but one who spoke truth to power, spoke out against gun violence, could transcend race and socioeconomic status and was a man of great faith,"" she said.  Ms. James recalled that five years ago, she was a young lawyer studying for a graduate degree in public administration at Columbia and working as an aide to Representative Roger L. Green when she heard the news of the killing. She said her thoughts immediately turned to Mr. Askew -- who, she said, had spoken to her only a couple of days earlier about his dislike for Mr. Davis.   Although she ran against Mr. Davis in 2001 and against his brother in 2003, Ms. James has since patched up relations with the family. She participated in the Friday memorial lunch at City Hall and the Tuesday prayer vigil in Clinton Hill and has supported the James E. Davis Stop the Violence Foundation, founded by his brother, which opposes the sale of video games and music with violent themes.   At City Hall now, all visitors, from the mayor on down, go through security the same way.   ""Even now, some people do come into the City Council chamber and glance up at the balcony, a bit warily,"" said George Arzt, a former press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch who, as a lobbyist and political consultant now, is still a fixture at City Hall. ""If it can happen once, it can happen again.""   Mr. Arzt said he did think security at City Hall had been vastly improved over the last five years (though he thought it took too long for the city to add police protection to 250 Broadway, the office building across the street from City Hall where most Council members have their offices). ""This was the best-protected building in New York, everyone thought,"" Mr. Arzt said of City Hall. ""Now it really is.""   Annie Correal contributed reporting. ",2008-07-23T13:04:31+0000

us,Hindsight and Foresight in Iraq,"Remember when Iraq was a Vietnam-like quagmire? Things may have changed on the ground in Mesopotamia, but this week the two presidential candidates seemed stuck in the bog.   Let's start with this exchange between John McCain and CBS News's Katie Couric, in which he talks about Col. [now Brig. Gen.] Sean MacFarland a pivotal figure in the so-called Sons of Iraq rising in support of Coalition forces in Anbar province:    Couric: Senator McCain, Sen. Obama says, while the increased number of U.S. troops contributed to increased security in Iraq, he also credits the Sunni awakening and the Shiite government going after militias. And says that there might have been improved security even without the surge. What's your response to that?  McCain: I don't know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened. Colonel [MacFarland] was contacted by one of the major Sunni sheiks. Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others. And it began the Anbar awakening. I mean, that's just a matter of history. Thanks to General Petraeus, our leadership, and the sacrifice of brave young Americans. I mean, to deny that their sacrifice didn't make possible the success of the surge in Iraq, I think, does a great disservice to young men and women who are serving and have sacrificed.     Plenty of liberal bloggers feel McCain is mistaking the chicken for the egg, most pointing out this Sept. 2006 interview with MacFarland, which long predated the surge. Here's the relevant part:     With respect to the violence between the Sunnis and the al Qaeda -- actually, I would disagree with the assessment that the al Qaeda have the upper hand. That was true earlier this year when some of the sheikhs began to step forward and some of the insurgent groups began to fight against al Qaeda. The insurgent groups, the nationalist groups, were pretty well beaten by al Qaeda.  This is a different phenomena that's going on right now. I think that it's not so much the insurgent groups that are fighting al Qaeda, it's the -- well, it used to be the fence-sitters, the tribal leaders, are stepping forward and cooperating with the Iraqi security forces against al Qaeda, and it's had a very different result. I think al Qaeda has been pushed up against the ropes by this, and now they're finding themselves trapped between the coalition and ISF on the one side, and the people on the other.    ""This is not controversial history,"" adds Democracy Arsenal's Ilan Goldenberg.   ""It is history that anyone trying out for Commander in Chief must understand when there are 150,000 American troops stationed in Iraq. It is an absolutely essential element to the story of the past two years. YOU CANNOT GET THIS WRONG. Moreover, what is most disturbing is that according to McCain's inaccurate version of history, military force came first and solved all of our problems. If that is the lesson he takes from the Anbar Awakening, I am afraid it is the lesson he will apply to every other crisis he faces including, for example, Iran.""   Meanwhile, Barack Obama is still consulting his timetables, telling Couric that:    Now, keep in mind that when I talk about timetables, people say that's too specific, with respect to residual force, maybe not specific enough. I think this is an example of a tactical issue. How do you execute a mission that requires commanders on the ground to make that decision? My job as commander-in-chief would be to indicate to them here's our goal, here are the missions that we need to carry out. Now, you tell me what it is that we need in terms of boots on the ground, in terms of equipment, in terms of other capabilities that are gonna be required. The overarching strategy is not something that I can deflect to the general. That's something that I have to make a decision at of, if I am president of the United States.    Which leads Hot Air's Allahpundit into this hypothetical:    If he considers troop levels to be a tactical rather than a strategic issue and therefore something to be guided by the advice of his generals rather than dictated from the top down as C-in-C, how is he able to set even an informal timetable? Petraeus, his would-be Centcom commander, is already telling him that a timetable unmoored to conditions is a bad idea. Is that a strategic or tactical judgment? Does it matter, since he'd have the final say anyway? He's drawing an artificial distinction here in order to avoid having to commit to an estimate of the number of troops he hopes/plans to draw down. Which is fine by me, since it leaves him room to inch away from a total withdrawal later on, but presumably not so fine by the left for the same reason. Imagine, for instance, he tells Odierno that manpower is desperately needed in Afghanistan and therefore he wants to try to free up 50,000 troops by accelerating the handover of provincial security to Iraqi forces. No dice, says Odierno; we can spare 20,000, but those other 30,000 will be needed as back-up for awhile since the Iraqis aren't fully prepared yet for their lead role. 50,000 versus 20,000 is a big deal, sufficiently so to matter to voters, I'd think. We have no sense from his answer what he'd do.    ",2008-07-23T13:31:41+0000

us,Hummer for Sale  Highly Negotiable,"""So you say you're selling your house?"" The Wall Street Journal asked on July 14. ""Hey, it could be worse. You could be selling a Hummer.""  Some people are selling a Hummer. And to get a sense of how bad it is out there when you're pimpin' a big S.U.V. in the era of high gas prices, I went on Craigslist and surveyed the plaintive listings. The bottom line seems to be that if you have a Hummer H2 or even a more fuel-efficient H3 for sale, you're very negotiable. Let's talk, the ads say, but sometimes even that isn't possible.  Adam Renfroe of Troy, Ala., has posted his 2003 H2 on Craigslist for a month and hasn't gotten a single call. ""Price Still Negotiable,"" his ad reads. ""If no one calls, I'll just keep it,"" Mr. Renfroe said, admitting that the price of gas is undoubtedly an obstacle to a quick sale. For now, the white H2 is mostly parked. Mr. Renfroe was asking $25,000, but he may take $22,000, which is about Kelley Blue Book value for a private-party sale of this vehicle in excellent condition with 30,000 miles.  Leno Stenpa of Binghamton, N.Y., is offering his 2006 H3 with 19,000 miles and the luxury package on Craigslist for $26,500, and he said he thinks that after a month and a half he finally has a buyer on the hook. ""I bought it for my wife, but she says she doesn't like it because it's too big for her,"" Mr. Stenpa said. ""If I can't sell it, though, she'll have to drive it.""   Mr. Stenpa said the car isn't all that bad on gas. ""It's not much worse than the Chevy Equinox she's driving now,"" he said. ""People think the Hummer is a gas hog, but it's not  the H3 gets 20-something miles per gallon. Personally, I think this gas thing is killing our country.""  A dealer in Memphis is advertising a Hummer ""Clearance Blow-Out"" on Craigslist, with 18 vehicles to choose from. He claims he can offer ""a full list of colors and packages"" with as much as $30,000 off the manufacturers' suggested retail price.   Another Tennessee vendor, Robert (who declined to give his last name), has a deal to offer on a 2003 H2 with the luxury package, Bose stereo and a sunroof. He wants $20,999, or any reasonable offer, and will consider a trade. ""The large S.U.V. market is plunging, and it's not going to get any better,"" said Robert, whose day job is as a manager at a General Motors dealership.   Robert added that, paradoxically, he's spending his days selling mostly Avalanches, Suburbans and Tahoes. And why is that? ""The media drives it a lot,"" he said. ""They report that big S.U.V.s are taking a beating, so people come in to our dealership looking for great deals.""  And, of course, he added, those customers aren't wrong: G.M.'s recent incentives for large S.U.V.s have included 72 months of zero-percent financing, or $6,000 in cash incentives.   So it may not be such a bad time to buy (or sell) a Hummer after all. ",2008-07-23T14:15:40+0000

us,Elliott Carters Neo-Classical Roots,"(Photo: The ""Carter's Century"" exhibition at Tanglewood includes photographs and sheet music from his earlier years. (Michael J. Lutch for The New York Times)) LENOX, Mass. -- Two unusual items in the ""Carter's Century"" exhibition at Tanglewood got me thinking about a side of Elliott Carter's work that we don't hear much about, even at a lavish festival like the one taking place here.  On the wall over the glass case with the Charles Ives letter at the Visitor Center is a page from Mr. Carter's incidental score for a Harvard Classics Club production of Sophocles' ""Philoctetes,"" dated 1931. The score, written neatly in ink, includes the Greek text under a gently wavering vocal line with a graceful oboe accompaniment. Nearby is a page from an orchestral march, part of another incidental score, this time for a planned but canceled production of Plautus' ""Mostellaria"" in 1936.  Very little of Mr. Carter's music from before 1950 is performed, and pieces like these incidental scores are scarcely mentioned. I was always under the impression that Mr. Carter had disowned or suppressed most of this early music, allowing only a few representative scores -- the Symphony No. 1 (1942), the ""Three Poems of Robert Frost"" (1943), the ""Holiday Overture"" (1944), the rugged Piano Sonata (1946) and a few others -- to represent his early period.  He has, after all, always described his 1950 trip to Arizona as a kind of artistic rebirth. It was there that he hit on the approach to melody and rhythm that propels his String Quartet No. 1 and became his hallmark for the next half century.  But at a Tuesday afternoon panel discussion that brought together three authors of authoritative books about Mr. Carter's music -- David Schiff (""The Music of Elliott Carter""), Jonathan W. Bernard (""Elliott Carter: Collected Essays and Lectures, 1936-95"") and John Link (""Elliott Carter: A Guide to Research"") -- it emerged that Mr. Carter's attitude toward these works might not be so clear-cut. Mr. Bernard, after beginning his remarks with a passionate defense of them, said that when he told Mr. Carter that he liked his early music, Mr. Carter responded: ""So do I. I didn't used to like it, but now I like it again.""  (Mr. Carter, who has attended most of the festival events, was not at the symposium either to elaborate or to demur.)  Mr. Carter has offered several reasons for having abandoned his early, neo-Classical, style. One was philosophical: after World War II, he came to believe that if music was to reflect the human condition and psyche, it had to abandon the charm and navet of the prevailing neo-Classical, neo-Romantic and folk-rooted styles. Another was that the technical discoveries he had made during his Arizona sojourn struck him as the only way to continue.  Mr. Bernard proposed a third reason, which embraces these others: Mr. Carter's style change was a necessary career move. Early works like the ""Pocohontas"" ballet score (1939) had established him as a second-tier Copland, and he knew that he had to develop a style of his own before that reputation began to stick.  The performances at the festival show that it is a simplification to think of the String Quartet No. 1 as a decisive break. Charles Rosen's illuminating performance of the Piano Sonata on Monday pointed up a structural, gestural and spiritual kinship between this work and late Beethoven, but also a harmonic rigor that was pointing to the path Mr. Carter would later take. And the trim, light-textured Sonata for Flute, Oboe, Cello and Harpsichord, in a lively reading by a student ensemble on Tuesday evening, demonstrated that two years after the pivotal quartet, Mr. Carter was still drawn to neo-Classicism.  It gets stranger. Mr. Carter's most recent works, though as technically demanding as ever, have shed much of the harmonic acidity, the stark contrasts and the polyrhythmic complexity that were among his hallmarks between 1950 and 2000. And heard from a certain perspective, some of these new pieces -- ""Catnaires"" (2006), for example, a perpetual-motion solo piano work given a stunningly virtuosic performance by Sandra Gu on Tuesday afternoon, and ""Mad Regales"" (2007), a set of six-voice madrigals that had its premiere on Tuesday evening -- can seem like Mr. Carter's stealthy return to his neo-Classical roots.  That makes the revival of the forgotten early works an even more compelling prospect: if Mr. Carter's work is coming full circle (after a fashion), we might as well understand the starting point.

us,Sweet Cupcakes in Washington,"(Photo: (Photo: Dayna Smith)) I returned from a quick trip to Washington, D.C., recently with two happy eating memories, two suggestions to pass along. And that isn't always the case with food and with Washington, which can delight and disappoint in pretty much equal measures.  I'll start with the cupcakes. They were some cupcakes. They came from Georgetown Cupcake, which bills itself, on its web site, as ""D.C.'s first and only cupcakery."" I relate that because I love that word: cupcakery. I shall henceforth be calling a popular breakfast spot near my apartment a pancakery, and any plant milling uranium oxide for potentially bellicose purposes a yellowcakery.   In any case I can't say enough good things about this cupcakery. It opened in February. Lucky for me it opened just three blocks from the friend's house where I stay whenever I visit D.C. Even luckier for me she discovered it right away, latched onto it, visits it all the time and had a box of a dozen assorted cupcakes waiting for me when I arrived. I'm not sure that last part makes me lucky, exactly. I think it just makes me, or rather made me, fat.  I initially told her I didn't want one of the cupcakes. I refused to try one. She made me. It was the mocha flavor, with a chocolate-covered coffee bean on top, and it was out of this world. I ate all of it.  Then she told me I had to try the carrot cupcake, and by now I was hearing and heeding her in a whole new way, and after that she told me I had to try the key lime cupcake, and I again followed orders. I would like to say in my defense that I had only a quarter of each of those cupcakes. I would like to say that they were so fine that stopping at a quarter qualifies me for some kind of medal of valor.  These cupcakes beat Magnolia Bakery's by miles and miles. The cake itself is moist and rich, and remains so even after the cupcakes have been sitting around for a day, and the frosting is as creamy and buttery as you could ask frosting to be without becoming so intense it sort of lays waste to you, the way some frostings can. There was a generous amount, but nothing out of control, and each different cupcake was beautifully colored and decorated prettily but sparely.   My friend tells me these cupcakes have become something of a rage in D.C. and that there are often lines out the door of the shop. When I poked my head in there wasn't a line, but there were stacks and stacks of boxes of cupcakes --- in chocolate banana and chocolate hazelnut and chocolate coconut, in lemon berry and lemon --- awaiting pick-up. My friend isn't the only one buying them by the dozen.  My other happy eating experience was at a restaurant. I'll deal with that in one of my next few posts.   ",2008-07-23T15:23:16+0000

us,Shipyards to Sheratons in Gdansk,"(Photo: Modern sculptures stand out against the restored Gothic architecture of Gdansk's Main Town. See Slide Show )  It was threatening rain when I walked unchecked into the Gdansk shipyards last Friday, my eyes focused on the beautiful jungle of industrial machinery up ahead. Elaborate steel cranes, painted green, loomed over the rusty carcasses of half-built ships, and inside the sagging brick warehouses, I imagined, were heavy and mysterious tools. My camera batteries were fully charged, and I was hoping to spend the day photographing these historic shipyards, birthplace of the Solidarity movement, which brought down Polish Communism in the 1980s, and now nearly bankrupt.  The security guard running after me had other ideas. I was only a couple of hundred yards into the vast complex when he stopped me and explained, in vociferous Polish that didn't need translation, that I wasn't welcome. And so I turned around and walked away from the Gdansk of my imagination  a postindustrial nightmare wrought in concrete and steel  and toward the Gdansk of reality, a much brighter place.   Gdansk is centered on the Main Town, a neighborhood of arched passageways, gilded ornamentation and stately brick buildings that testify to the city's wealth in the 16th and 17th centuries. Church bells ring out the hours, buskers embark on indie-folk careers in the cobblestone streets and children slurp ice cream cones and clutch helium balloons along the waterfront promenade. Gdansk, it turns out, is a tourist haven, the anchor of three Baltic Sea towns  Sopot and Gdynia are the others  that make up what might well be termed the Polish Riviera. Outside of Poles and a few Germans, who knew this was such a hot spot?   You, my readers, did. Of the 24,000 who voted on my destination this week, more than 56 percent chose Gdansk over Copenhagen and Hamburg (thanks in part to Trojmiasto.pl, a local Web guide that rallied the pro-Gdansk crowd). ""It's a delightful place, full of old world charm, that hasn't been American-ized yet like many other parts of Europe,"" wrote Moe. Others extolled its ""wonderful architecture"" and ""interesting history"".   Gdansk was also, many of you noted, inexpensive  though that, too, is changing. Since Poland joined the European Union on May 1, 2004, the Polish currency has been steadily gaining strength, going from 4.9 zlotys to the euro to 3.22. (That's 2.03 zlotys to the dollar, down from 4 zlotys.) Unfortunately, this meant that many of the quaint and comfortable hotels near the Main Town were no longer in my price range.   The ""In Your Pocket"" guidebook, whose Gdansk edition I downloaded as a PDF from inyourpocket.com (and which I read during my overnight Eurolines bus trip from Vilnius, for 135 Lithuanian lita, or about $62 at 2.17 litas to the dollar), directed me to the Willa Jolanta (www.willajolanta.pl), a modern house in a residential quarter about a mile from the Main Town. My spacious apartment, one of six with kitchenette, satellite TV, Wi-Fi and private bathroom, lacked Old World charm, but cost just 180 zlotys a night, or 162 with a discount for staying a full week. And the owners did my laundry  free!   (Photo: A fruit stand.  See Slide Show )  That milelong trek to the Main Town might seem like a lot, but walking it day after day got me familiar with the city. On my way down Kartuska Street, I'd stop at a cukiernia (bakery) for a pczek (jelly doughnut, 1.50 zlotys) or a 4 zloty basket of blackberries from a sidewalk fruit vendor. If I was in a hurry  or if, as was often the case, it was raining  I'd just hop the creaky but reliable tram (3 zlotys per ride, 12 zlotys for a 24-hour pass), and five minutes later I'd be soaking up Gdansk's 1,011-year history and culture.  Walk through the Highland Gate and you'll pass the city's most important treasures along the Royal Way. A former prison now houses twin museums, one devoted to amber, the other to torture (26 Targ Wglowy; 48-58-301-4733; admission 10 zlotys). The towering brick Town Hall is home to the Gdansk History Museum (46/47 Ulica Dluga; 48-58-767-9100; www.mhmg.gda.pl; admission 8 zlotys). And the 1549 bronze fountain statue of Neptune has become a popular meeting place. Even among the throngs of souvenir-seeking tourists, it's easy to be amazed that all these glories have survived centuries of change and turbulence.  Except that they haven't. The Main Town should not to be confused with the Old Town, which was leveled and rebuilt, Soviet style, after World War II. The history museum had numerous photos of what Gdansk looked like in 1945, after the Nazi invasion and years of Allied bombing: near-total ruin. Ninety percent of Gdansk's Main Town was rubble, and it took decades of craftsmanship to achieve the historic-looking neighborhood visitors see today. How exactly that was achieved was left unclear by the museum, which had minimal English translations.   Video In fact, Gdansk's history seemed more a buoyant atmosphere than a scholarly pursuit, a backdrop for the city's surprisingly vibrant cultural life. The week I visited, the International Street & Open-Air Theatres Festival (FETA) was taking place, and troupes from 14 countries, including Canada and Iran, were performing comedic, pyrotechnic and just plain abstract shows (mostly free!) all around the Main Town. Les Sages Fous, the Canada duo, had a particularly arresting act in which they steered a steampunk boat down Ulica Dluga, encountering a baffling array of deep-sea puppet creatures. And Teatr Wybrzeze (2 Ulica Sw. Ducha; 48-58-301-7021; www.teatrwybrzeze.pl; tickets 20 to 30 zlotys) featured a production of ""The Tin Drum,"" by the Nobel winner Gnter Grass, who was born in Gdansk, then known as the Free City of Danzig.   For a moment, Gdansk felt as it might have in the 16th century, when Shakespearean companies would swing through town, entertaining the masses  and the occasional Grand Tourist.  High culture aside, Gdansk was a fine place simply to eat, drink and make merry. I spent one happy evening at the cozy Caf Kamienica (37/39 Ulica Mariacka; 48-58-301-1230; www.olipar.pl) enjoying a brandy-spiked latte (12 zlotys) while rain slicked the narrow sidewalks outside. Another evening, I cuddled up with a plate of pork chops, cabbage salad and a dark beer (20 zlotys) in Jadalnia Pod Zielonym Smokiem's festive, smoky basement (125 Ulica Szeroka; 48-58-320-7865; www.jadalnia.com.pl).   (Photo: Lunch at Bar Mleczny Turystyczny.See Slide Show )  For lunch, I went for chicken cutlets and mashed potatoes (13 zlotys) at the bargain-basement Communistic cafeteria Bar Mleczny Turystyczny (8/10 Ulica Szeroka; 48-58-301-6013).   (Photo: My kielbasa toast. See Slide Show )  Another time, at a waterfront stand near a future Hilton hotel, I ate toast smeared with lard and topped with sauted onions, kielbasa and sliced pickles. It was the best  and most disgusting  thing I've ever eaten, and it only cost 9.50 zlotys.  Gdansk also served as a gateway to maritime pleasures. Sopot, a small beach resort about 20 minutes north by SKM train (skm.trojmiasto.pl; round trip 6.20 zlotys), is the party spot, where Poles sun themselves during the day by the Baltic (shockingly calm when I saw it), then indulge in beer, vodka and fried fish when it gets dark.   But even Sopot has its touch of history: like other classic spa towns in northern Europe, it was founded in the early 19th century for the wealthy. And up through World War II, it was a favored getaway for German officers, whose affection for it might have earned it a reprieve from destruction. Its fortunes, however, declined after the war, and by 1994, when reader Diana visited, ""Sopot had the ghostly feel of a European vacation spot that was once glorious.""  Now, like Gdansk, Sopot is resurgent. A 93 million-euro project to redevelop the city center means construction cranes and torn-up streets are as common as bikini thongs and Belgian waffles. A high-end Sheraton (www.sheraton.pl/sopot) just opened alongside the Free City-era Grand Hotel (which counted Hitler and de Gaulle among its guests, and is now a Sofitel). At the end of Europe's longest wooden pier, the 1,690-foot Molo, you can hear pounding dance music emanating from the beachside Copacabana club  the beat of progress.  (Photo: The cafe Jzef K.  See Slide Show )  And yet Sopot also has an intellectual, bohemian side. At Jzef K. (4/1b Ulica Kosciuszki; 48-58-550-49-35; www.jozefk.pl), a cafe named for Kafka's luckless protagonist, the dcor captured perfectly Kafka's world: typewriters and antique TVs hid in the corners, a tree sprouted from a table, and flea market paintings were adorned with cartoon thought bubbles. Over several hours, I nursed a dark beer and flipped through a Taschen book on the history of art from the cafe library.  Around the corner was Galeria Kinsky (10 Ulica Kosciuszki; 48-695-95-1743), a two-story bar in what was once the home of Klaus Kinski, the Sopot-born German actor. Surrounded by red velvet curtains, threadbare Victorian divans and two Polish women I met on Couchsurfing.com, I could easily imagine that not much had changed since the mad movie star's death in 1991.  Still, after days of indulging in history and nights of indulging in less ennobling activities, I desperately wanted to get close to the shipyards. The multimedia Solidarity Museum (1 Ulica Doki; 48-58-769-2920; www.fcs.org.pl; admission, 6 zlotys) offered a great primer on the shipyard protests of the 1980s, after an electrician by the name of Lech Walesa led workers in a strike that created the Solidarity movement, forced concessions from the government and knocked the first cracks in Polish Communism. But it didn't sate me.  So, on Sunday, after another jelly doughnut breakfast, I took to the water, renting a red kayak (15 Ulica Zabi Kruk; 48-58-305-7310; www.kajakiempogdansku.pl; two hours, 20 zlotys) and paddling down Gdansk's waterways, past the promenade and its restored facades, which I saw from below, much as an ancient Baltic trader might have.  (Photo: The shipyards. See Slide Show )  Farther downstream, the canal opened wide, and there, across the wind-rippled waters, were the shipyards. The rusty cranes looked like families of prehistoric animals, with monstrous specimens looming over babies that themselves perched over sheds and gas tanks. I considered crossing the small bay and going ashore, but given that this was probably illegal, I simply snapped a few zoomed photos and turned southeast, toward the narrower channels.  (Photo: A family of swans. See Slide Show )  Soon I was floating through canals shrouded in reeds, paved with lily pads and populated with waterfowl. There were tiny black ducks with bright orange beaks, mottled gray-and-white birds and a brood of swans whose patriarch circled me threateningly until I'd put some distance between myself and his flock. This was not exactly the Gdansk I'd planned on seeing, but it didn't really matter anymore  that figment of my imagination paled in comparison to the real Gdansk, the one I wouldn't have found without my readers to guide me.

us,"A Roman Holiday, With Granita di Caffe","I'm leaving today for a two-week trip that will eventually take me through Rome, where I already have my morning coffee planned at the legendary Caffe Tazza d'Oro, the eternal rival of Sant'Eustachio for the best espresso in town.   It has been a few years since I was last at Tazza d'Oro, and I'm hoping that the granita di caffe, sugary espresso frozen into a crystalline slush and served with a generous dollop of panna, lives up to my memories. The granita should be so cold the panna freezes where it touches the coffee, turning into little bits of solid cream.   It might sound hubristic, but I've experimented with making granita di caffe, and I think I've improved upon Tazza d'Oro's already perfect version.  Instead of using cooled espresso, I use cold-drip coffee concentrate.  On Monday, I wrote about cold-drip coffee, the smooth and rich concentrate you make by soaking grounds overnight in cold water. It's easy to make and easy to turn into a granita.   Just mix eight cups of coffee concentrate with two to four cups of simple syrup (one part sugar dissolved in one part water warmed over low heat). Then chill as you would any granita by freezing in a clean ceramic or metal baking dish, being sure to scrape it with a fork every 20 minutes so that crunchy crystals form.   The result is a transcendent granita di caffe, as full-flavored and caffeinated as espresso but without any of the harshness or acidity that comes from cooling hot coffee.   I like my granita intense and on the sweet side, topped with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream. But you should sample it as it freezes, and feel free to add more simple syrup or cut it with plain water as your taste buds dictate.   Then share it. Every Labor Day I make a batch for a post-cookout pick-me-up, and it's exactly what you want in the middle of a hot afternoon after you've just finished your third portion of grilled pork shoulder confit.  (A quick word for a reader named Frank, who posted a comment yesterday saying that he had made cold-drip coffee and found it bitter. Be sure to use beans that aren't over-roasted. Properly roasted coffee beans should look matte. If they're oily they were roasted too long, the unfortunate style of many roasters. This will be the subject of a future posting.)

We have a new Times Topics blog on issues in the news and the post on Hurricane Dolly is by Hugh Willoughby, formerly the head of hurricane research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and now a professor at Florida International University. He notes that this one is mainly a warmup, given that storms like this one, below Category 3, comprise 80 to 90 percent of those that hit land but cause only 15 to 20 percent of hurricane damage. As Prof. Willoughby put it, ""Dolly is a nice refresher training exercise for the forecasters and emergency response crews. It's also a good 'baptism of wind' for Bill Read, in his new job as director at the Hurricane Center.""  Brian McNoldy, a hurricane expert at Colorado State, provided more detail on the storm in an e-mail update:    Dolly has strengthened overnight, and is now just miles from the coast (at 16Z) and is a Category 2 hurricane... 85kts and 964mb. Though only 40 miles or so offshore, the eyewall (the engine that drives the rest of the machine) is still over very warm Gulf water. As such, the storm can still continue to strengthen while the entire western half of the storm is over land. The eye is presently located 40 miles ENE of Brownsville, TX, and is ~23 miles across.  Rainfall totals could reach one foot. Storm surge is in the 4-6 foot ballpark. It's still too early to know the full aftermath, as it's still in progress. Buoy 42020, offshore between Brownsville and Corpus Christi, is reporting 22' waves, and the worst is still coming.   It's moving very slowly (about 6kts) and is now heading nearly parallel to the coast, which means Dolly could still have several hours over water.   ",2008-07-23T16:26:17+0000

Smith, former governor of New York and former presidential candidate, gave Prime Minister Pierre Laval of France a tour of the Empire State Building in 1931. (Photo: Times Wide World Photo)) When Gov. Alfred E. Smith ran for president in 1928, his candidacy was derailed in large part by anti-Catholic prejudice. It has been nearly 48 years since John F. Kennedy became the first (and so far only) Roman Catholic president, but experts say that anti-Catholic sentiment -- much of it originating in, or as a response to, immigrants in New York -- remains an enduring force in American culture.   That was the consensus of a panel assembled at the Museum of the City of New York on Tuesday night to consider the question, ""Is Anti-Catholicism Dead?""   The panel is part of the exhibition, ""Catholics in New York, 1808 to 1946,"" which runs through Dec. 31.  Like the exhibition, the 90-minute discussion -- moderated by Paul Baumann, editor of Commonweal magazine, a Catholic biweekly opinion journal -- was heavy on history, but the speakers also raised questions of contemporary significance.   Mr. Baumann noted the role that Catholics have played in fundamental debates in American public life -- in immigration, education, nationalism, the family, sexual morality and freedom of conscience.   George J. Marlin -- an investment banker, amateur historian, onetime mayoral candidate and former executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- offered a rapid-fire overview of anti-Catholic sentiment in New York.   From colonial times, he said, tolerance has co-existed uneasily with prejudice. In debates over the New York State Constitution of 1777, Gouverneur Morris argued with John Jay, who was ardently anti-Catholic, on the issue of religious toleration.  Fears of Catholic conspiracies to take over the government endured from the 1820s to 1840s, prompting deadly riots in cities like Boston and Philadelphia. (In 1844 -- the same year New York elected a nativist mayor, John Harper -- John J. Hughes, who was New York's Catholic archbishop from 1842 to 1864, got the authorities to cancel a nativist rally by warning that New York would become a ""second Moscow,"" as in, burned to the ground by its own citizens, if a single Catholic church were burned.)  Mr. Marlin also went through other milestones of anti-Catholic prejudice: the Know-Nothing Party (founded by a New Yorker, Charles Allen) in the 1850s, the American Protective Association in the 1890s, the eugenics movement in the early 20th century, Paul Blanshard's anti-Catholic writings in The Nation in the 1950s.   The next speaker, James P. McCartin, a historian at Seton Hall University, said that ""anti-Catholicism in a sense is at the center of Western modern history,"" emerging from the ""crucible of violence and hatred"" that characterized the religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries. Among the major themes of anti-Catholic sentiment, he said, were a revulsion toward that violence; a ""long memory of real and imagined Catholic oppression""; a persistent anti-clericalism; and a prurient interest in the sexuality of nuns and priests.  Sister Mary C. Boys, a Catholic theologian at Union Theological Seminary and an authority on Jewish-Christian relations, noted that Catholic schools have long been a target of anti-Catholic movements.   Alarmed by the influence of Catholic schools, some states, like Oregon, tried to mandate that children attend public schools. (Such laws were declared unconstitutional in a 1925 Supreme Court decision, Pierce vs. Society of Sisters.)   ""What these cases reveal is that anti-Catholicism is not a singular phenomenon,"" Professor Boys said. ""Rather I think of it as a kind of amalgamation of ideologies and perspectives in which regional differences and cultural shifts give anti-Catholicism, if you will, a kind of kaleidoscopic character.""   At the same time, Professor Boys said that Catholics too ""have a long history of denigration of the religious other, particularly the vilification of Judaism for almost 2,000 years"" -- a tradition exemplified, in modern times, by the Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, the antisemitic priest who was a popular radio figure of the 1930s.   Professor Boys argued for a ""textured particularism,"" a humble immersion in Catholic practices, teaching and history, and for greater tolerance among Catholics of differences in their ranks. ""I have received more hate mail from Catholics than I ever have from people who are not Catholics,"" she noted.  The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus -- a leading conservative intellectual, a former Lutheran pastor and the editor of the leading Catholic journal First Things -- offered a surprising view on the question.   ""To be a Catholic is not to be refused positions of influence in our society,"" he said. ""Indeed, one of the most acceptable things is to be a bad Catholic, and in the view of many people, the only good Catholic is a bad Catholic.""   Father Neuhaus dismissed the notion that anti-immigrant sentiment was related to anti-Catholicism, since many Latino immigrants to the United States are Catholic. (But he did note that the church, which has been strongly pro-immigrant, could be seen as having a vested interest in the immigration debate, since immigrants are a major source of members.)  He added that anti-Catholicism was as likely to come from the left -- sometimes from commentators who believe that a ""threatening theological insurgency is engineered and directed by Catholics,"" with evangelical Protestants merely as the movement's ""foot soldiers.""  Peter Steinfels, a Fordham professor who writes the Beliefs column for The Times, spoke last.   Like Professor McCartin, he attributed anti-Catholic sentiment to long-standing historical traditions, including English nationalism that vilified the papacy and Catholic powers like Spain, and the anti-Catholic polemics of the Enlightenment, particularly in France. (The first tradition gave us the controversial Christian evangelical pastor John C. Hagee, and the second the television talk-show host Bill Maher, Mr. Steinfels quipped, to laughter.)  ""American society loses whenever Catholic wisdom is excluded form the national dialogue thanks to anti-Catholic reflexes, images and instant dismissals,"" Mr. Steinfels said.   ""And I'm not referring to the faith-based wisdom about the eternal word made flesh,"" he said, ""but the human wisdom about human nature and conduct that the church as gained over many centuries, undeniably mixed with its own flaws and prejudices, but nonetheless of enormous relevance to the fundamental problems humanity now confronts.""  He added, however, that ""untruths and half-truths"" make it harder for Catholics to transmit their teachings to the next generation.   It was only during the question-and-answer session that the church's child sexual-abuse scandal came up. Mr. Steinfels said the scandal put fundamental issues about ""sexuality, celibacy and the priesthood"" before the public, while Father Neuhaus received applause when he said that Catholic bishops should have responded early in the scandal by acknowledging the extent of the scandal and begging for forgiveness.

us,M.T.A. Wants to Speed Fare Increases,"At a contentious meeting at its Midtown headquarters, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board provided new details about its plan to plug a gaping hole in its finances. Not only is it seeking an 8 percent increase in revenue from fares and tolls, to take effect July 2009, but it also is requesting an additional 5 percent to take effect by January 2011 -- for a cumulative increase of 13.4 percent over 18 months.   In presenting its preliminary budget for the 2009 fiscal year on Wednesday morning, the authority made no attempt to conceal what it considers to be its worst fiscal situation since the economic downturn that followed 9/11. When fares last went up, in March, the authority's plan was not to have another fare increase until January 2010, with future increases every two years thereafter. Now that entire schedule has been moved forward -- by six months for the initial increase and by a year for the projected future increases. (Jeremy Soffin, an authority spokesman, said after the meeting that the 2011 increase might be pushed ahead a few months to get as close as possible to the goal of two years between increases.)   The authority's leaders said the fare and toll increases are necessary by the confluence of soaring energy prices and a plunge in revenue from real-estate transactions, which are a prime source of the authority's revenue. The authority is struggling to pay the interest on billions of dollars in debts that have accumulated since the 1980s, but exploded since 2000, to pay for expensive equipment upgrades; debt service alone is expected to consume one-fifth of all authority spending by 2012.  Speaking before a packed hearing room at the authority's headquarters on Madison Avenue, the authority's leaders portrayed the plan as difficult and unpopular, but necessary. ""Nobody wants to increase the fares,"" said H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the authority's chairman, adding, ""We're human beings, like the rest of you.""   Several board members, however, expressed dissent, saying that despite internal spending reductions already proposed by the authority's leadership, more should be made before asking riders for more fares and tolls. Some argued that those reductions could be made without affecting service.  ""When I look at this budget, I don't think that we have nearly made the cuts that we need to make,"" said Andrew M. Saul, a board member who represents Westchester County. He urged lawmakers to reexamine legislation that he said would restructure the authority and streamline its operations. ""There needs to be fundamental change,"" he said, adding, ""and until that's done, there's going to be fare increase after fare increase.""   Several members of the public called for more city and state aid was needed -- a position with which several board members are quietly sympathetic, though as political appointees, they have been reluctant to publicly call on the governor and mayor for new assistance.  At least a dozen witnesses brandished signs urging, ""Mayor Bloomberg: Help the Riders"" and ""Governor Paterson: Help the Riders.""   While some board members, like Mr. Saul, called for long-term restructuring of the authority's finances, others said the authority needed to make cuts urgently.  Jeffrey A. Kay, who oversees municipal operations at City Hall and is one of four representatives of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on the board, said, ""Before we go out and ask for higher fares, we need to find every dollar we can.""   ",2008-07-23T16:49:43+0000

us,Pocket Guide to China-U.S. Relations,"To help American journalists headed to the Beijing Olympics strike more of a balance between what ""we"" think and what ""they"" think, UCLA's Asian American Studies Center has released a brochure it calls a ""U.S.-China Media Brief,"" which contains pertinent statistics and concise explanations of the major issues confronting the two countries as the Olympics approach. The brief was prepared by the center's staff, UCLA faculty and scholars from other institutions in California and elsewhere.   However, the brief isn't just for journalists -- it's a handy guide for anyone to peruse, available as a pdf  or in greater depth at www.uschinamediabrief.com. For example, did you know that the United States has 9 cities with a population of more than one million, but China has 160 such cities? Here are some more revealing facts:  ECONOMY AND TRADE As of 2008, 460 of the U.S. Fortune 500 companies have operations in China.  Average annual income, U.S.: $41,000 Average annual income, China: $4,091  Number of billionaires in U.S.: More than 400 Number of billionaires in China: 42  GDP growth rate, U.S.: 2.2% GDP growth rate, China: 11.4%  FOOD 1987: The first American fast food company, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), opens in China. There are currently more than 2,200 KFC outlets -- not to mention 104 Wal-Marts, more than 800 McDonald's and more than 300 Starbucks.  The biggest Chinese restaurant chain in the U.S. is Panda Express with more than 700 outlets.  MEDIA Highest grossing Chinese-language film in U.S.: ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ($128 million) Highest grossing English-language film in China: ""Titanic"" ($48 million)   The brief also offers incisive overviews of Sino-American relations in areas such as overseas trade (U.S. companies made $4 billion in profits in China in 2007, 50 percent more than they made in 2006, but China has $1.2 trillion invested in U.S. Treasury bills) and the environment (China surpassed the U.S. in greenhouse gas and sulfur dioxide emissions in 2008, yet 99 percent of the households in Rizhao city, pop. 246,000, use solar water heaters).   Perhaps most useful is the brief's concise explanation of the Sino-American argument over human rights. While Western observers look at China's record in terms of what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights calls ""civil and political rights"" (right to life and liberty, freedom of expression, equality before the law, and freedom to elect leaders), China emphasizes the huge strides it has made in what the declaration calls ""economic, social and cultural rights"" (right to work, right to food, right to education, right to participate in culture).  There is much more in the UCLA brief, concisely explained and presented, but all governed by a featured quote from a consulting scholar, the writer Helen Zia: ""The world will be safer if China, the United States and other countries can address human rights and other critical issues in the community of nations and peoples, not in isolation.""

us,McCain Touts His Support of Israel,"WILKES-BARRE, Pa. -- As Senator Barack Obama met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the Middle East on Wednesday, Senator John McCain talked up his own support of Israel a half-world away. ""I look you in the eye, and I tell you, as the United States once said, and will say again and again, we will never allow a second Holocaust,'' Mr. McCain told a crowd at a town-hall meeting here.  Mr. McCain was speaking in a far-less exotic locale than Mr. Obama, in a downtown Wilkes-Barre auditorium on a gray, sodden day, but he refrained, at least on this issue, from criticizing his rival for a presidential-like trip to the Middle East. Instead, Mr. McCain said that he was more concerned than ever about the security of Israel.  ""They are probably in many respects under greater threat than they have been since their independence,'' Mr. McCain said, then mentioned, as he frequently does, the danger from Iran, whose president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has called for Israel to be ""wiped off the map.''  ""And they have the means to do it,'' Mr. McCain said. ""You can imagine what the United States would feel if we were in a similar situation.'' Nonetheless, he said, ""I believe that we can resolve this by putting sufficient pressure on the Iranians diplomatically, economically and every other way.''  Mr. McCain also said that the status of Jerusalem should be ""the subject of negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israel government,'' which is the longstanding U.S. position. In June, Mr. Obama insisted on his first day as the presumptive Democratic nominee that Jerusalem should remain undivided as the capital of the Jewish nation. Mr. Obama's remarks were immediately criticized by Palestinian leaders in the West Bank, and he has since retreated from them.  ",2008-07-23T18:12:22+0000

us,A McCain Iraq Chronology in Question,"Updated &#124; 4:25 p.m. In an interview Tuesday night with Katie Couric, Senator John McCain scolded Senator Barack Obama for getting his history wrong. But it appears that Mr. McCain might himself have inaccurately described the timing of a scene-changing development in Iraq.  Mr. McCain has been critical of Mr. Obama for refusing to acknowledge that the troop buildup had stabilized conditions in Iraq. Rather, Mr. Obama credited the ""awakening,"" a movement of Sunni Iraqis patrolling their own neighborhoods to root out extremists and members of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The initiative, backed by the United States, began in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, and has since spread throughout the country, including Baghdad.  Here's the transcript of the exchange in question:   Ms. Couric: Senator McCain, Senator Obama says, while the increased number of U.S. troops contributed to increased security in Iraq, he also credits the Sunni awakening and the Shiite government going after militias. And says that there might have been improved security even without the surge. What's your response to that?   Mr. McCain: I don't know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened. Colonel McFarland was contacted by one of the major Sunni sheiks. Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others. And it began the Anbar awakening. I mean, that's just a matter of history.    But the history appears to be slightly different. The Times's own reporting suggests the ""awakening"" began in Anbar in late 2006  well before President Bush proposed the troop buildup in January 2007 and the arrival of the first extra troops later that month.  The National Security Network, a liberal foreign policy group, has put together a timeline of the awakening and the buildup.   In responding to questions about the interview, Mr. McCain's aides have focused on the buildup's role in enabling and sustaining the awakening.   ""Democrats can debate whether the awakening would have survived without the surge,"" Tucker Bounds, a McCain spokesman, told The Associated Press late Tuesday. ""But that is nothing more than a transparent effort to minimize the role of our commanders and our troops in defeating the enemy, because to credit them would be to disparage the judgment of Barack Obama and praise the leadership of John McCain.""  And in a McCain campaign conference call with reporters today, Randy Scheunemann, a top foreign policy adviser, said that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, had credited the buildup with ""enabling"" the awakening.   ""Well, sir, the Sons of Iraq are individuals that -- it really dates all the way back to Anbar province and the first awakening, which, to be fair, took place -- it started before the surge, but then was very much enabled by the surge because that enabled us to clear areas over time, General Petraeus said during Congressional testimony in April. ""But it started with a sheikh in Anbar province coming to a brigade commander in Ramadi and saying back in October, 2006, would you support us if we turned our weapons on al Qaeda instead of on you?""  Representative Pete Hoekstra, also on the call, recounted his visit with some Sunni tribal leaders in the fall of 2006.  ""They wanted to move over and partner with the Iraqi government; they wanted to partner with the Americans, but one of the concerns they had was that there would be sufficient American forces that the American and Iraqi forces would be able to bring security to Al Anbar province,"" he said.  Still, no one directly addressed Mr. McCain's assertion that the awakening ""began"" as a result of the buildup, and an e-mail message to Mr. Bounds requesting that he do so has yet to be returned.  By the way, if you didn't click on this link above to a report by The Times about the awakening, you should. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama praise the movement, but it appears to have its own set of complications.   Update: In an interview that will air on ABC's ""World News Tonight with Charlie Gibson,"" David Wright gave Mr. McCain an ""opportunity to correct something that you said yesterday."" His reply:   Actually, the surge is a strategy. And Colonel McFarland, who I briefed with in December of 2006, had already started employing that strategy, going into Ramadi, clearing, and holding. And some of the sheiks were asking for our protection. General Petraeus has said, without the additional brigades, then the Anbar Awakening wouldn't have succeeded.   It's very clear. It's more than having (ph) number of troops. It's a strategy. Colonel McFarland was employing that strategy. And that strategy was having some limited success, but it needed additional troops, which were then made available as a result of the increase in troops, which was part of the surge. Anybody that knows anything about Iraq and the situation knows that.   Also, CBS is facing some criticism for not airing the response in question during the broadcast last night (though they did make a transcript available and post the original interview online). The network showed Ms. Couric's original question, but the response from Mr. McCain came from a different question. ""As all news organizations do with extended interviews, last night's Obama and McCain interviews were edited to fit the available time and to give viewers a fair expression of the candidates' major differences,"" said a statement from CBS News. ""The full transcript and video were and still are available at cbsnews.com."" ",2008-07-23T18:34:17+0000

But Posada is not yet ready to concede the rest of this season, even if it means that his recovery would cost him part of 2009.  (Photo: After rehab on his injured shoulder, Jorge Posada will decide whether to have surgery now or wait until after the season. (Kathy Willens/Associated Press))   As recently as two days ago, Posada was privately convinced that his season was over, no matter how much the Yankees might have wanted him to continue. But he told reporters Wednesday that while he will not catch the rest of this season, he will use the next two weeks to determine if he can hit without restrictions.  If he can, Posada said he would return as a designated hitter and first baseman and put off the surgery until the winter.  ""It's not about me; it's about the team now,"" Posada said. ""How can I help the team? That's why I'm going through rehab. If I'm able to hit, then I'm going to try to do that. If I'm not able to hit, I'm going to have surgery.""  Posada said he hoped that by not throwing, his shoulder could be strong enough to make him a viable hitter. He has not helped much on offense this season, with three homers and a slugging percentage of .411, his lowest mark since becoming the regular catcher in 2000.  Manager Joe Girardi said Posada still wanted to contribute now, even if it means missing time next season. Tthe operation will require six months of recovery.  ""There's a risk-reward, yes,"" Girardi said. ""It could run into next year if he had the surgery November 1, absolutely.""  But Girardi added that the risk could be worth it if Posada helps the Yankees win a championship.  ""If a player were to say, 'We have a chance to win the World Series,' what do you think the player would say?"" Girardi said. ""That's something Jorge has to wrestle with. Jorge has to weigh the risk and reward. You can't make a player do something, that's the bottom line. This is something we're all discussing over the next two weeks.""  Posada, who turns 37 next month, is signed through 2011 at $13.1 million per season. Since 1940, only four players have caught 100 games in a season at age 38 or older: Brad Ausmus, Bob Boone, Carlton Fisk and Benito Santiago. ",2008-07-23T18:59:24+0000

us,Bashir Returns to Darfur,"Sudanese President Bashir had the gall to begin a campaign-style swing through Darfur today. It is striking that for all the alarm about the risk that an indictment of Bashir would lead to retribution against humanitarians and peace-keepers, the opposite has happened. The humanitarians have had just about their best week so far.   The reason is simple: Bashir is under pressure, and he wants support from African and Arab countries, as well as from China and Russia, for a delay of any action by the International Criminal Court. This is permitted under Article 16 of the Rome Statute of the ICC (not of the Genocide Convention, as I originally wrote here in a scatterbrained moment). So he has been on his best behavior, and the lesson is that Bashir respects force and strength rather than pleas to behave better.  The international community has resisted a no-fly zone for the same reason it was leery of an indictment. But my hunch is that if the no-fly zone were accompanied by a warning that if he retaliated, he would also have aircraft destroyed in Khartoum, then he would be very polite about it. And in the effort to end the no-fly zone, he just might make concessions necessary to achieve a peace deal. For example, one of the obstacles to any peace deal is Bashir's refusal to unify the three Darfur states into a single larger state; it's absurd that such a matter should stand in the way of peace and a no-fly zone might nudge him to make such concessions.

us,"Wikipedia, Meet Googles Knol","(Photo: The Knol entry for Barbecue.)  Seven months after Google began testing a service called Knol, a Wikipedia competitor, the company on Wednesday finally introduced it.  The search expert Danny Sullivan aptly describes Knol as ""Like Wikipedia, With Moderation."" Articles on various topics are penned by individuals, and in many cases, experts -- not collectively by the anonymous masses. Knol authors can choose to benefit from the ""wisdom of the crowds"" by letting others edit or supplement their articles. But those changes make it into Knol entries only with the author's permission.   Knol, which, by the way, is short for knowledge, is making some people uneasy because it further transforms Google from a search engine that helps people find content into a site that helps people create and publish content.   Even though it will make money on many Knol pages with its AdSense program, Google promises that the objectivity of its search engine will not be compromised.   ""We will treat Knol pages as we treat other Web pages,"" said Cedric Dupont, a Google product manager. ""If there is a Knol that is the first place in search results, it deserves that place.""  Of course, on many searches, it is Wikipedia's ad-free pages that show up at the top of search results.   Mr. Dupont dismissed speculation that Knol was designed as a Wikipedia killer: ""Google is very happy with Wikipedia being so successful. Anyone who tries to kill them would hurt us.""   There is a striking similarity between one aspect of the two sites. The text of Knol articles uses the same font as Wikipedia. Mr. Dupont said that is simply coincidence, as it is a commonly used font.   (Photo: The Wikipedia entry for Barbecue.)   For now, Knol has only a few hundred articles, compared to the nearly 2.5 million in Wikipedia's English language version. And for now, the best place to follow the debate on whether or not Knol is a Wikipedia killer is on the Knol entry on, where else, Wikipedia.    ",2008-07-23T19:04:44+0000

More than a hundred thousand people were killed, the infrastructure was obliterated and the country became an open battlefield for terrorists from everywhere to settle their scores with the Americans. We never heard of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia before, but now they are there. We never heard of car bombs or I.E.D.s, but they are still killing us every day. There is no horrible way of death that we haven't seen since 2003, and for what?  After five years, Baghdad still has no reliable electricity, no clean water or any kind of services. Recently, sandstorms struck the city for five days and people had to lock themselves inside their houses, with the temperature at about 120 degrees F. and no electricity, not enough water and a big fuel crisis.   Who can live in such conditions? You need to buy fuel for your generator on the black market, but that costs $25 for 4 gallons that won't last for one night, and you are jobless and have no money. Can anyone imagine that this is happening in an oil producing country? These are just a few examples of what is happening in Iraq, and how the Iraqis now live after they were overwhelmed with freedom and democracy.   So my question is, what should the Americans do before leaving?   If I put a bomb in someone's house and destroy it, then I cannot just simply say ""sorry"" and leave. I have a responsibility to fix what I have broken, I have to rebuild the man's house and bring it back at least to what it was.  The politicians have been talking about reconstructing Iraq for five years now, but I as an Iraqi, haven't seen any. We used to hear about all the good things that we would get after ""liberation"" -- factories, beautiful houses, fancy restaurants, movie theaters and playgrounds. ""Baghdad will be more beautiful than Dubai,"" a Western journalist said to me back in 2003, and the funny part is that the looting was still going on and half of Baghdad was on fire.   But what have we got? After five years of ""liberation,"" Iraqis still barely get electricity. People have started to make jokes about it, calling it ""holy electricity"" or ""Ayatollah electricity,"" because you have to pray to get it. One hour of electricity every day and sometime every three or four days  what a blessing!  And what about the hospitals, schools, factories, all the museums and libraries, the lives of the Iraqis who were killed since the invasion? I remember one of the Iraqi politicians who came back to Iraq in 2003 saying that ""Iraq under Saddam was floating over a sea of mass graves."" But I never heard him say a word about the mass graves we have now.   If you say to the Iraqis, ""Look, we are leaving but we want to build the country for you and to fix the mistakes that we have done, but we need your help,"" then every Iraqi will do it. Millions of Iraqis became jobless after the invasion, but the reconstruction companies do not hire them.   You are not only responsible for building back the country but also to build back its army and to have it as strong as it was. You cannot leave Iraq defenseless, and you know who is trying to take over after you leave.  Don't give us anything fancy. Bring Iraq as it was before your liberation, just as it was, and then leave. The rest will be our responsibility. ",2008-07-23T19:11:42+0000

us,San Francisco Mayor to the e-Rescue,"(Photo: Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco. (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Associated Press))   Updated, 7:19 PM  More than a week ago, a computer technician decided to take out his frustrations on his employer, the city of San Francisco. Terry Childs's alleged handiwork, as officials soon found out, was disturbing.   Using his digital keys to the kingdom, he locked out everyone else at an administrative level from a network holding e-mails, city payroll files, confidential law enforcement documents and jail inmates' bookings, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. Tracing the deed to the saboteur proved to be relatively easy. Getting him to reveal the passwords to reverse his digital spell proved far more difficult.   Until Gavin Newsom, the city's popular and telegenic mayor, entered the fray, that is. On Monday, Mr. Newsom came face to face with the rogue programmer, 43, following his arrest on four felony counts of computer tampering.   If only The Chronicle could sell this news to Hollywood:   The San Francisco computer engineer accused of withholding access codes to the city's network surrendered the password during an unusual jailhouse visit by Mayor Gavin Newsom, authorities said Tuesday.  [...] Childs' defense attorney Erin Crane contacted the mayor's office, setting in motion the secret visit.  The visit was so secret that the mayor did not tell District Attorney Kamala Harris' office or police about it. Newsom decided on his own to accept Crane's invitation, mayoral spokesman Nathan Ballard said.  Wired's Threat Level blog reported more details on the second half of the story, when the nine-day-long episode ended:   ""We were able to regain complete control of the network Tuesday,"" said Ron Vinson, the deputy director of the city's Department of Technology Information Services.  [...] ""The mayor showed up unexpectedly at the data center and provided the engineers and forensic experts on the case on site with the passcodes that Mr. Childs had provided the mayor,"" Vinson said.  What precisely happened when the mayor walked into that jail? There were precious few details so far about their 15 minutes together, even though the Chronicle hinted that Mayor Newsom might have built trust with a widely quoted remark that Mr. Childs was clearly ""very good at what he did"" as the city struggled to fix the problem.  As the imagination stirs about high-stakes deals behind closed doors -- and maybe even a little danger for the city's leader -- Nathan Ballard, the mayor's spokesman, played down the superhero angle just a bit.   ""Childs is not a Boy Scout,"" he said, according to the Chronicle. But ""he's not Al Capone either.""  Update, 7:19 PM In response to statements from authorities, Mr. Childs's lawyer contends that his client has done nothing wrong, and was acting in the best interests of the city. ""This was not a danger to the public,"" the lawyer told The Chronicle. Certainly, many things remain unanswered in this case, as one commenter thoughtfully outlined. ",2008-07-23T19:20:51+0000

us,Sugar Leaves the NBC Suite,"UPDATED 7/23/08 5:58 p.m.  (Photo: A screen shot of the Sugar Network's TeamSugar Web site)   NBC Universal has lost one of its women's blog channels, the Sugar Network, a week after it added female blog network BlogHer to its ranks.   NBC had been selling ads across the 17 Sugar blogs, which cover celebrity gossip, fashion, cooking and more, since June 2007, when it led a $10 million investment round in Sugar Inc. Lauren Zalaznick, president of NBC Universal Women and Lifestyle Entertainment Networks, will stay on the board, but Sugar will take over its own advertising from NBC.   ""We've grown so much that it seemed silly to have a big piece of revenue flow through NBC,"" says Sugar's chief executive and publisher Brian Sugar. NBC took a 50 percent cut of ad revenue. Last year that cost Sugar about the same as employing an ad sales team, he says, but the Sugar blogs have been growing faster than he expected and the equation changed. The Sugar Network had 4.6 million unique visitors worldwide in June, up 121 percent from 2.1 million a year ago, according to comScore. ""It's about margins and the only way we're going to make money is if we sell our own ads,"" says Mr. Sugar. ""We're all grown up now.""   Striking out on its own won't necessarily be easy. NBC's core women's sites, led by iVillage, got 30 million unique visitors in June, more than six times as many as the Sugar sites.   Sugar began in April 2006, a year after Lisa Sugar, editor in chief and Mr. Sugar's wife, started the celebrity gossip blog PopSugar as a hobby and quickly garnered an avid following. Two-thirds of its revenue comes from advertising and the rest from commissions and revenue sharing from ShopStyle, the e-commerce site Sugar acquired last September. The Sugars plan to hire 20 ad sales staff people.   On July 16, NBC announced a female-targeted digital ad sales network, which gives advertisers space across all of NBC's women's sites with a single ad buy. NBC is starting to look more like its competitor Glam Media, which sells ads across a network of blogs for which it does not produce content. But with Sugar moving on, NBC lost a piece of its new ad network. Links to the Sugar blogs no longer appear on NBC's women's properties iVillage, Oxygen.com and BravoTV.com, though those sites now feature content from BlogHer's 2,200 blogs.   Peacock Equity, a joint venture between NBC Universal and GE Commercial Finance, invested $5 million in BlogHer alongside venture capital firm Venrock last week. ",2008-07-23T19:25:41+0000

us,"Sex, Bias and Data","Debra Rolison, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory, gave a talk eight years ago at the National Academies of Science. It was called, ""A Title IX Challenge to Academic Chemistry: Isn't a Millennium of Affirmative Action for White Men Sufficient?"" Now that her proposal to actively apply Title IX to physical sciences and engineering has been adopted at federal agencies (as I wrote in my Findings column), I've been looking at the evidence for bias against women in science. After considering physics last week, let's examine chemistry and some other fields.   You'll find sweeping assertions of discrimination in academia against female scientists if you read the executive summary of the National Academy of Sciences' 2006 report, which was issued by a committee led by Donna Shalala. But if you look in the report for evidence of bias, you find studies showing that female graduate students in general (and those without children in particular) are as likely as men to finish their studies, and that they're as likely to have mentors and assistantship support. According to the report, there were some differences in productivity -- male graduate students published more than female students, and tenured male professors published about 8 percent more than female tenured professors -- but when men and women were up for tenure, they received it at similar rates.   The report singled out chemistry for a case study and concluded: ""A comparison of the number of men and women faculty members who received their doctorates during the same years indicates that the growth in the number of women faculty members has mirrored that of men who received their doctorate in the same time interval."" That seemed to be the case in other fields, too, particularly among the more recent graduates.   The report presented charts (in Figure 1.2) comparing the percentage of female professors in 2003 with the percentage of women in the potential hiring pool (those who had earlier received Ph.D.'s during the relevant period).   Among assistant and associate professors, women were underrepresented in psychology, the life sciences and economics, but overrepresented in chemistry, the physical sciences, mathematics and the social sciences. They came out more or less even in math and computer science. In engineering, they were overrepresented among assistant professors but underrepresented about associate professors. Among full professors of science and engineering, women were underrepresented in most disciplines, but the differences were generally fairly small -- as were most of the differences either way in all the charts.  So where's the evidence of widespread bias against women in science? Well, the N.A.S. report did find that female Ph.D.'s were less likely than male Ph.D.'s to get positions in chemistry at leading research universities. And it pointed to evidence of disparities in other fields between Ph.D.'s and professors in surveys of the top 50 departments by Donna Nelson, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma.   I spoke with Dr. Nelson and looked over the figures in her latest report, the 2007 Nelson Diversity Survey. She said her surveys show less favorable outcomes for women because, whereas the N.A.S. report compared faculty members who got their doctorates in America, she included professors who had gotten their doctorates abroad, and that group has an especially high preponderance of men.  ""We're starting to get more women with Ph.D.'s from abroad, but the proportion is still much smaller than among American Ph.D.'s,"" Dr. Nelson told me. ""Women just aren't as mobile as men.""  Dr. Nelson said her method gives a better picture of the gender balance of the faculty, which is true. But as a result, she's not making an exact apples-to-apples comparison of the hiring pool versus the faculty: The hiring pool in her charts consists of only Ph.D.'s from American universities, whereas the faculty also includes a disproportionate number of male Ph.D.'s. from foreign universities, so you wouldn't expect to find the exact same gender ratio in the pool as in the faculty -- you'd expect a lower ratio of women on the faculty. You could argue that it's more useful, as the N.A.S. did, to compare just female and male students who get their Ph.D.'s in America. That fact that more male Ph.D.'s than female Ph.D.'s come from abroad looking for faculty jobs here isn't necessarily an indication of bias in American academia; it could have more to do with foreign cultures and the motivations of foreign students.   But let's accept Dr. Nelson's methodology and consider her analysis of the top 50 departments of science and engineering in 15 disciplines. She compared the percentage of women who got Ph.D.s. in the previous decade with the percentage of women in the ranks of assistant professors. She found the numbers are about equal (within a percentage point) in three fields: math, chemical engineering and economics. She found that women were underrepresented in these seven fields:  Chemistry (32.4 percent of hiring pool versus 21.7 percent of assistant professors) Computer Science (21.2 v. 19.5) Political Science (38.9 v. 35.9) Sociology (60.8 v. 57.9) Psychology (67.8 v. 44.8) Biological Sciences (46.3 v. 36.0) Earth Sciences (31.8 v. 28.6)  Meanwhile, Dr. Nelson found that women were overrepresented in these five fields:  Astronomy (22.7 percent of hiring pool vs. 25.3 percent of assistant professors) Physics (14.3 vs 17.5) Civil Engineering (22.0 vs 25.3) Electrical Engineering (12.3 vs 14.5) Mechanical Engineering (8.4 vs 18.2)   Do these numbers suggest widespread bias against women? Not to me. I wouldn't expect the numbers to balance out exactly in every field at the top 50 universities. In biology or chemistry, for instance, women may be attracted to the many jobs elsewhere in academia or in industry. (See, for instance, the comment posted by a female Ph.D. in chemistry who left academia for a job in industry that meshed better with her family responsibilities.) What I find most interesting about these numbers is the overrepresentation of women in engineering and physical sciences -- the fields that were selected for Title IX compliance reviews because they were supposedly so problematic for women.  I was also interested to see Dr. Nelson's comparable figures for white males, because it certainly looks as if their ""millennium of affirmative action"" has ended. Dr. Nelson found that white male Ph.D.'s are overrepresented among assistant professors in just three disciplines: chemistry, biological sciences and psychology. They roughly break even in two other fields, political science and sociology. And they're underrepresented in everything else -- 10 of the 15 disciplines surveyed by Dr. Nelson.   I am not, of course, arguing for Title IX protection for white men. Nor am I trying to suggest that women have it easy in science. Although I don't think the data show widespread bias against women studying for Ph.D.'s and faculty jobs, there are obstacles that keep women from wanting to study science in graduate school or pursue a career in academia. Along with Lab readers like Tamara and Oliver Young (and some of the Title Niners), I suspect the chief one is the difficulty of balancing their careers with with family responsibilities, particularly childrearing. What could be done -- and what has been done -- to address that problem? I welcome your suggestions.  ",2008-07-23T19:38:03+0000

us,The Bush-McCain Dance at the G.O.P. Convention," Update &#124; 6:45 p.m.:  WASHINGTON  The White House has made it official: President Bush will address the Republican convention in St. Paul on its opening night, Labor Day -- an appearance that could mean he will not cross paths with the party's presidential nominee, Senator John McCain.  Dana Perino, Mr. Bush's press secretary, let that tidbit slip a few weeks ago in an interview with The New York Times. On Wednesday, Ms. Perino used her regular briefing to announce on camera that Mr. Bush would speak to the convention on Monday, Sept. 1, ""which is traditionally when the incumbent speaks.''  The big question, however, is not when Mr. Bush will speak, but whether he will be seen at the convention with Mr. McCain.  When the president's father, the first President Bush, became the Republican nominee in 1988, White House aides orchestrated a very careful handoff from the outgoing president, Ronald Reagan, to the elder Mr. Bush. Mr. Bush arrived in New Orleans, the convention city, on the morning after Mr. Reagan spoke, and the two met briefly on the tarmac before Mr. Reagan left on Air Force One.  There was no word Wednesday from either the White House or Republican Party officials on whether the incumbent President Bush and Senator McCain are making similar plans -- but it seems unlikely. Mr. McCain's advisers have said there are no plans for the men to appear together before the election.  But the two do have experience with tarmac encounters; they had one in Phoenix recently, when Mr. Bush traveled to Arizona to headline a fundraiser for Mr. McCain. It marked the first time and only time the president and the senator have appeared in public together since Mr. Bush endorsed Mr. McCain in the White House Rose Garden in March.  Later, Ms. Perino said in an e-mail message that the president will leave St. Paul after his speech, without spending the night. ""After the president speaks,"" she wrote, ""it's McCain's spotlight and we intend to let it shine fully on him.""    ",2008-07-23T20:06:18+0000

us,Secrets Gays Keep From Their Doctors,"A survey of 452 New York City men who had had sex with other men within the past year found that 39 percent had not disclosed their sexual orientation to their doctors, a problem particularly acute among black, Hispanic and Asian men, the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene announced on Wednesday.   Health officials said the survey results had troubling implications for H.I.V. prevention. The survey found, for example, that men who disclosed their sexual activity with other men were twice as likely as men who did not to have been tested for H.I.V. (63 percent versus 36 percent).  The survey found a striking distinction: While 78 percent of the men who had sex with men and identified themselves as homosexual said they had discussed their sexuality with their doctors, none of the men who had sex with men but identified themselves as bisexual had told their doctors.   The survey also found wide racial and ethnic variation in disclosure rates. Sixty percent of black men who had sex with other men said they had not discussed their sex lives with their doctors, compared with 48 percent of Hispanic men, 47 percent of Asian men and 19 percent of white men.   Other differences in disclosure were also observed. Men who were 28 or older were more like than younger men (69 percent vs. 52 percent) to be out to their providers. Those born in the United States were more likely than immigrant men to disclose their practices, and those who were better educated disclosed at higher rates than the less educated.  Dr. Monica Sweeney, the assistant health commissioner for H.I.V. prevention and control, said the findings reflected a strong stigma against homosexuality in minority communities. (About three-quarters of the men in the survey who described themselves as bisexual were black and Hispanic.)   ""There is a frequent phenomenon in the black community in which a man who is gay, by the conventional ways that we all know to identify somebody as gay, identifies himself as bisexual,"" Dr. Sweeney said, referring to the phenomenon known as the ""down low.""  The survey results, published this month in The Archives of Internal Medicine, examined data from the National H.I.V. Behavioral Survey conducted in 2004-5 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The New York segment of the study involved data from 452 men who were interviewed anonymously at gay bars and clubs, tested for H.I.V., and offered medical and social services as needed.   Officials not only urged patients to be forthcoming about their sexual behavior, but also urged doctors to ask about sexual history.   ""Health care providers should screen patients routinely for H.I.V.,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Begier, director of H.I.V. epidemiology at the health department. ""They should also ask their patients about behavior that may put them at risk. And New Yorkers shouldn't hesitate to talk openly with their health care providers.""  In a phone interview, Dr. Sweeney said that doctors are often squeamish about asking personal questions.   ""When the doctor initiates the subject, no matter how sensitive, most people talk about these things,"" said Dr. Sweeney, who is trained in internal medicine and geriatrics. She added that she was not surprised by the survey findings; if anything, she said, she was surprised that the overall disclosure rate -- 61 percent -- was as high as it was.  Marjorie J. Hill, chief executive of Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit advocacy group, offered a similar assessment in a phone interview. ""While distressed, I am not at all surprised,"" she said of the findings. ""Medical providers are not sufficiently trained in outreach and engagement with gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people.""  Outside of obstetrician-gynecologists, she said, ""doctors are not encouraged to have conversations about sex."" ",2008-07-23T20:24:29+0000

us,Cellphone Only? It Holds Little Sway in Polls,"With cellphone use on the rise, pollsters have been facing questions since before the 2004 presidential campaign about whether polls can be truly representative if they do not include people who are exclusively or primarily reached through their cellphones.   A handful of polling organizations, including The New York Times/CBS News Poll, Gallup and the Pew Research Center, have disclosed that they are now routinely including cellphone samples in their surveys to try to gain an accurate representation of the nation at large.   That's good because that part of the population is growing. The number of Americans with only a cellphone and no landline (""cellphone only"") reached 14.5 percent of all adults during the last six months of 2007, according to U.S. government figures. Another 22.3 percent of all adults say they have both a cellphone and a landline, but that their cellphones are primarily used. This group is often referred to as ""cellphone mostly.""   Both groups were the subject of a poll conducted by The Pew Research Center June 18-29, which included an oversample of respondents interviewed on cellphones. The report concluded that there was a modest effect on voter preference for president depending on whether or not cellphone respondents were included.   Pew found that the opinions of the ""cellphone only"" segment of the population differ significantly from the general public while the ""cellphone mostly"" adults mirrored the general public fairly closely.   Support for Senator Barack Obama, the presumed Democratic nominee, among the ""cellphone only"" crowd was notably higher than the electorate at large, but those who rely solely on cellphones were also significantly less likely to be registered to vote than their ""cellphone mostly"" counterparts and the public at large. Thus, in pre-election polls that are looking to gauge the opinions of voters, there is less of a chance that the ""cellphone only"" group would be underrepresented.  Overall, compared to all land line respondents, the cellphone users are younger, more male and less likely to be white. Pew also found differences between the ""cellphone only"" and ""cellphone mostly"" groups: Those who are ""cellphone mostly"" are more educated, more likely to be married, have children, be a homeowner, and earn more money than ""cellphone only"" adults.

us,Iraq Veteran Takes on McCain in New Ad,"The independent group, VoteVets, will begin running a new television ad this week that features an Iraq war veteran who asserts that if elected, Senator John McCain ""would occupy Iraq indefinitely,"" against the wishes of the Iraqi people.  The veteran, Brandon Woods of New York, says in the ad: ""What did we fight for in Iraq? I have some idea. I fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And 'freedom' means when the Iraqi people and their Prime Minister ask us to make a plan to leave, we do.""  In a statement the chairman of VoteVets, Jon Soltz  also an Iraq war veteran  noted that Mr. McCain once said that the United States should pull troops out of Iraq if asked to do so by the Iraqis.   ""Senator McCain now either has to back off his refusal to set a plan to leave Iraq, as Prime Minister Maliki requested, or tell the American and Iraqi people why he would overrule Iraq's government and make our troops into an indefinite occupying force,"" Mr. Soltz said. He also expressed support for Senator Barack Obama's plan to redeploy troops from Iraq to Afghanistan.   The 30-second spot will go on the air across the country on CNN and MSNBC starting on Friday through most of next week. The group is spending $100,000 to broadcast the ads.    Responding to the ad, Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant released the following statement:  ""Barack Obama voted against funding for the very troops this ad claims to represent. By continuing to oppose the surge strategy and rejecting the advice of General David Petraeus, Obama is putting political expedience ahead of victory,"" Mr. Conant said. ""Rather than attacking John McCain for listening to General Petraeus, this group should ask why Obama lacked the strength to stand up for our troops during a time of war.""   And the independent group, Vets for Freedom, which has mounted a $1.5 million advertising and grassroots campaign making the case for a continued American troop presence in Iraq, also directed criticism today at Mr. Obama, who has been on an overseas tour of Iraq, Afghanistan, the Middle East and Europe.  Vets for Freedom Chairman Pete Hegseth said in a statement that Mr. Obama supports a ""a dangerous policy of irreversible withdrawal.""  ""In formulating his Iraq policy, Senator Obama seems to value ideological consistency above military victory,"" Mr. Hegseth added. ",2008-07-23T21:36:52+0000

us,The Voluntary Spirit?,"""A relatively new group, Service Nation, is planning to kick off a campaign with a Summit for ""National Service"" on September 11,"" reports Jim Lindgren of the legal site Volokh Conspiracy.   ""Time Magazine has signed on to promote the effort. The website trumpets its training of 'Change Agents' in cooperation with 'Change, Inc.' Its blog is called ChangeWire. Does this theme sound familiar? The website makes it clear that it is not just calling for individuals to get involved, but it is calling for a new National Service Act that will involve the government in transforming American society...""  (You can see the group's manifesto here.)  Not surprisingly, the effort is setting off alarm bells among the libertarians at Reason. Here's Radley Balko's take on the ""creepy new push for national service"":    The campaign appears to be pretty Obama-friendly, jibing with his recent call for a national service bureaucracy that's ""just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded"" as the military. Of course, McCain has certainly expressed an appreciation for the ""a cause greater than yourself"" mindset too, including a fondness for--quite literally--the sight of uniformed cadres of young people preparing for a day of service with calisthenics in the public square.  The Service Nation Summit kickoff event is getting promotional help from Time magazine, whose Managing Editor Rick Stengel is a co-chair. Seems like an odd undertaking for a newsweekly, doesn't it? But then, Time has an annoying habit of crossing over into advocacy on issues its editors have deemed too important to leave to impartial reportage.  Lindgren points out that though the campaign is couched in terms that make it appear oriented toward merely encouraging volunteerism, some of its top officials have a history of supporting a more coercive definition ""service,"" including support for Rep. Charlie Rangel's (D-N.Y.) bill to bring back conscription. Most ominously, one of the group's stated goals is to ""[l]aunch a debate about why and how America should become a nation of universal national service by 2020.""  Note the absence of the word ""if.""    Volunteers, anybody?  (Note: The Volokh Conspiracy's Ilya Somin has an update on Service Nation's stance on voluntary vs. mandatory;; like Somin, the Opinionator finds that Service Nation's efforts to clarify only leave things more muddied.)

us,Obama Bets $5 Million on Olympic Viewers,"Senator Barack Obama's campaign will spend $5 million on advertisements during NBC's coverage of the Summer Olympic Games next month, an NBC spokeswoman confirmed on Wednesday.  The candidate's commercials will appear on both the NBC network and on the company's cable channels that are also showing the games.  National broadcast advertising buys are highly unusual for presidential candidates. Campaigns usually order TV ad time in local markets (most often in contested states) and sometimes supplement it with cable television buys.  ""Both the scale and the scope makes Obama's buy unprecedented,"" said Evan Tracey, the chief operating officer of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks advertising spending. ""This is going beyond the battleground states; this is coverage that the entire country sees. It sort of validates his 50-state posture.""  Both Mr. Obama and Senator John McCain, his Republican rival, are setting new records for television advertising spending during the campaign. Mr. Tracey said both Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain are spending close to $6 million a week on TV commercials.  The Obama campaign declined to comment on the advertising buy. But the campaign's ability to spend $5 million is a direct outgrowth of his ability to raise a lot of money -- $52 million in June. It also reflects the intensity of the advertising efforts in this presidential election.  The Obama campaign has shown an interest in ""event television"" advertising before, buying air time in 24 states during the Super Bowl in February. But the Olympics ads, unlike the one in February, will be true national buys.  The trade publication Ad Age, which first reported the Obama campaign ad buy, said ""the last network TV spot apparently was a single multi-minute ad Republican Bob Dole ran in 1996.""

us,Clinton Supporters Try One More Tack,"(Photo: Part of an advertisement placed in Wednesday's Chicago Tribune by the Denver Group.) CORRECTED &#124; As many have been saying all along, Senator Barack Obama is only the presumed Democratic nominee. And that fact has given heart to some of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's supporters, who are investing tens of thousands of dollars to pressure the party to put her name to a binding vote at the convention next month.  The Denver Group, founded by two political novices who have been frustrated with the treatment of Mrs. Clinton since February, ran full-page ads on Wednesday and two weeks ago in The Chicago Tribune and Congressional Quarterly calling for Mrs. Clinton to be placed ""in nomination"" in Denver. They contend that because neither candidate has enough elected delegates to claim the nomination, Democratic Party rules call for a process to begin that could result in her name being presented for possible nomination at the convention.   Wednesday's ad cited Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who won the nomination on the fourth round of balloting. (Here is their earlier ad.)  ""Contentious politics is not losing politics,"" said Marc Rubin, a television and movie writer. He and the co-founder of the Denver Group, Heidi Li Feldman of the Georgetown Law Center, say that a perceived forced unity imposed by party leadership is likely to alienate Clinton supporters and ultimately cost the eventual nominee the election.   Howard Dean, the Democratic Party chairman, has said Mrs. Clinton will be ""on the ballot"" at the convention.The group is urging him to allow the process that could bring her nomination up for a vote to go forward.  Calls to the Democratic National Committee were referred to the Obama campaign, and Bill Burton, a spokesman said: ""We're working out the details of the convention, and we'll let people know when the specifics are worked out.""   But for the Denver Group, there is nothing to ""work out.""   In a post on her personal blog, Professor Feldman compares ""being on the ballot"" to throwing the ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game, while being placed in nomination is akin to being added to the team roster. The group is considering running advertisements to explain the distinction.  What is clear is that some of Mrs. Clinton's supporters are not ready to give up the fight. The Denver Group, established in late June, has already collected approximately $30,000, and hopes to at least double that and buy time on CNN. Its success reflects a lingering sense among some Democrats that party leaders are trying to block Mrs. Clinton from the nomination.   ""I don't know which way it'll go and neither does he,"" said Professor Feldman of Mr. Dean. ""If he knew, he would just allow it to happen.""  Mr. Rubin admits that a Clinton victory in convention balloting would be a long shot -- at least 175 superdelegates would have to reverse their public positions, should her name be placed in nomination and the matter be put to a vote -- but ""the potential is there.""  CORRECTION &#124; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Professor Feldman believes that Democratic Party rules require Mrs. Clinton's nomination be put to a binding vote. In fact, according to Professor Feldman, the rules only require that a process be started that could result in a nominating vote. ",2008-07-24T00:14:33+0000

Richards/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images))   JERUSALEM -- Senator Barack Obama made a pre-dawn visit here Thursday to the Western Wall, arriving in the Old City as a clear moon helped illuminate a still-dark sky.   Mr. Obama, wearing a white yarmulke, made his way down a walkway toward the Wall. He was escorted by the Rabbi of the Wall, Shmuel Rabinovich, and surrounded by many other followers at one of the holiest sites in Judaism.  As the rabbi quietly read from Psalm 122, both he and Mr. Obama flipped through a Holy book on a wooden stand. The moment unfolded as a lone man standing about 10 yards away yelled over and over, ""Obama, Jerusalem is not for sale! Obama, Jerusalem is not for sale!""  After the prayer, Mr. Obama walked a final few paces to the Wall and followed the custom of placing a personal prayer between the stone cracks, with his note left alongside hundreds of others. He placed his hand on the Wall, bowed his head and stood in quiet contemplation for a few moments.   The heckler continued his chant as Mr. Obama walked away from the Wall. Several other men tried to drown out his voice with chants of, ""Obama, Obama, Obama.""  ""It was a little rowdier than the last time I was there,"" Mr. Obama said later.  Dozens of people cheered and reached out to grab the senator's hand as he walked away from his final appearance of the day in Jerusalem. With this symbolic image captured, Mr. Obama set off for Germany.  (Photo: After his visit to the holy site, Mr. Obama, center, was headed to Germany.

us,As German as ... America,"BERLIN  When one thinks of beer and bratwurst, one tends to think of either faraway Germany -- or Milwaukee in the heartland.   That quirk of culinary geography says a lot about why Barack Obama can give a public speech in Berlin without catching the kind of flak that a similar outing under the Eiffel Tower would garner.  As the Obama campaign searched for a location here for his public address before a crowd that is expected to reach at least into the tens of thousands, a great deal of attention was paid to the backdrop within the city. Little was paid to the choice of country itself.  Yet Germany is an easy call for a number of reasons. It is the site of two of America's most cherished victories, over the Nazi regime in World War II and the Soviets in the Cold War. And for the Obama campaign, comparisons to President Kennedy are always welcome as long as they do not appear too overtly sought after. Do not expect to hear Mr. Obama claim, auf deutsch, that he is a Berliner.  But a broader combination of social, historical and even demographic factors make Germany a hit for American politicians going abroad, whether it be Mr. Obama or President Bush, who in 2006 enjoyed a hearty meal of barbecued pig on a spit with Chancellor Angela Merkel.   Campaigning abroad means delving into American perceptions and stereotypes about foreign countries, even among allies. No political operative could forget the way French became pejorative shorthand for elitism against John Kerry in the 2004 campaign.  One might think that the French would have a leg up in the public-relations game, thanks to Lafayette and de Tocqueville. Yet an appearance in Germany brings few of the dangers that a campaign speech before cheering throngs in the land of pinot and foie gras might. While plenty could go wrong, and a backlash is still possible, one thing is clear: There is little danger of being labeled effete in the home of Oktoberfest and oom-pah bands.   Germany can be, well, pretty American sometimes. And often overlooked is just how German the United States really is.   As the American ambassador noted when opening the new embassy to Germany on the Fourth of July, in the 2000 census the number of Americans reporting German ancestry was nearly 43 million, the highest tally of any group. That's more than Irish or English or Italian, some five times the number claiming French roots and roughly the same number as African-American and Mexican combined.  The same debates that take place today over Latino immigrants and the Spanish language once centered around the German communities, which had their own newspapers, schools and theaters. At the peak of German migration to the United States 1.8 million came between 1880 and 1893, according to Klaus Bade, a professor at the University of Osnabrck and founder of the Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies.   To put that in perspective, that came at a time when the population of the United States was only around 50 million, or one-sixth of what it is today. That enormous influx left a lasting influence on American culture. It was -- and still is -- particularly powerful in the heartland. The Census Bureau said that every state in the Midwest reports Germany as the largest share of ancestry, with 44 percent in North Dakota and 43 percent in Wisconsin.  The identification with German ancestry in America receded in the 20th century for a couple of reasons. First, according to Professor Bade, the wave of immigrants came to an unusually abrupt halt as Germany went from having too few jobs to too many.   The other reason is a little more obvious: Germany's place as America's enemy in two consecutive world wars.  Yet the significant American role in rebuilding and defending West Germany after the war led to what in some ways amounted to the largest exchange program in history, even if the leading edge was soldiers instead of students. That meant new contacts and even more chances for cross-pollination.  ""There are an enormous number of organic connections between Germans and Americans,"" said Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington, an independent think tank. He said that between 14 million and 16 million Americans were stationed in Germany since the 1940s, especially military families and their dependents.   The transformation of Germany from violent dictatorship to peaceful democracy stands as one of the great accomplishments in American history, a significant point of pride for the country. That may be why, even at the nadir of relations, Germany never caught the same degree of criticism as France for opposing the Iraq invasion. Though former Chancellor Gerhard Schrder was against the war in Iraq, it was cheese-eating surrender monkeys, not schnitzel-eating surrender monkeys.   Senator Obama may not say, ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" this summer, but he need have no fear diving into a few frankfurters or hamburgers at an American picnic. The meat and potato Germans, their cuisine, and a lot of their culture, is as American as apple struedel, er, pie. ",2008-07-24T10:18:45+0000

(Photo: Jens Wolf/European Pressphoto Agency)BERLIN  Senator Barack Obama arrived in Germany on Thursday amid high anticipation for an evening speech he is poised to deliver here in the Tiergarten, the German capital's equivalent of Central Park. As he held meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel and other officials, he sought to tackle another task: lowering expectations.  ""I doubt we're going to have a million screaming Germans -- let's tamp down expectations here,"" Mr. Obama told reporters as he flew here from Tel Aviv, joking that he only recently learned that his audience was expected to be so large. ""We're sort of on the high-wire all of the sudden.""  Mr. Obama, who is nearing the final days of his first international trip as a presidential candidate, has navigated a political high-wire for days as he traveled through Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan and Jerusalem. Germany, France and Britain remain on his agenda this week as he works to prove himself on a worldwide stage in a trip that has been heavily promoted by his campaign.   ""I think the world is keenly interested in this election. I think they're hungry for a sense of where America's going,"" Mr. Obama said, standing in the aisle of his campaign plane. ""Certainly there's a curiosity factor involved.""  Mr. Obama met for about an hour with Chancellor Merkel at the Federal Chancellery before holding an afternoon session with Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Mr. Obama, who acknowledged on Thursday that he was lacking sleep from his weeklong trip, said he also hoped to take an afternoon break before delivering his evening speech.  Aides to the Obama campaign have suggested that the speech in Berlin was neither a campaign nor a political event. When a reporter asked the senator if he considered the address a campaign event, he said with a puzzled look: ""As opposed to?""  ""It's not a political rally,"" he added. ""Hopefully, it will be viewed as a substantive, articulation of the relationship I'd like to see between the United States and Europe. I'm hoping to communicate across the Atlantic the value of that relationship and how we need to build on it.""  While Mr. Obama may well be the first American presidential candidate to deliver a speech in Berlin, several presidents have made important addresses in the city, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Mr. Obama shrugged off any comparisions.  ""They were presidents, I am a citizen,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But obviously Berlin is representative of the extraordinary success of the post World War II effort to bring the continent together and to bring the West together. Then, later to bring the East and the West together. So I think it's a natural place to talk.""  Even as supporters lined the streets in Berlin on Thursday, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mr. Obama, he conceded that a key piece of his audience is in the United States.  ""There's no doubt,"" he said, ""that part of what I want to communicate on both sides of the Atlantic is the enormous potential of us restoring a sense of coming together.""

us,Credit Suisse Results Beat Estimates,"Credit Suisse posted a smaller-than-expected fall in second-quarter earnings on Thursday, sending its shares sharply higher in Zurich and giving some investors new hope that the turmoil in the financial sector was showing signs of easing.  The Swiss banks earnings easily beat analysts forecasts, despite falling 62 percent to 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.16 billion), because of smaller asset write-downs than expected. Its investment bank, private bank and asset management business all posted profits.   An analyst at WestLB, Georg Kanders, said the results ""could be the confirmation of the beginning of the end of the financial crisis.""   Credit Suisse said its wealth management unit attracted net funds of 15.4 billion francs in the quarter, more than twice the forecast amount.   ""They're taking a considerable number of clients away from UBS,"" Ralph Silva, research director at Tower Group, told Bloomberg News.  ""We anticipate that the current challenging market conditions will persist over the near to medium term, and we will continue to manage our business conservatively,"" the bank's chief executive officer, Brady Dougan, said in a statement.  The bank has emerged less damaged from the subprime-related turmoil than other big names, notably UBS.  Still, a 5.3 billion franc write-down in the first quarter dragged Credit Suisse to a 2.1 billion franc loss, its first quarterly loss in five years. Net write-downs were immaterial at 22 million francs in the second quarter, Credit Suisse said.  The bank has not had to turn to shareholders for cash, unlike UBS and other European rivals like Royal Bank of Scotland and Credit Agricole, who have had to repair their damaged balance sheets.

us,G.O.P. Looking Forward to 2012?,"Congressional reapportionment will await the 2010 census, and won't affect the Electoral College until the 2012 presidential race, but that hasn't stopped Michael Barone from doing a little reading of the tea leaves. Relying on figures from the political statistics guru Clark Bensen at the site Polidata, which show states that George Bush won 2004 gaining eight electoral votes and states won by John Kerry losing eight, Barone sees happy days ahead for the G.O.P.    Under the new electoral vote distribution, Bush's 286-to-252 electoral vote margin in 2004 becomes 294-to-244. Bush would have lost in 2004 if Ohio had not gone his way; under the projected post-2010 apportionment, Bush would have won 276-to-262 if Ohio had not gone his way. The demographic trends reflected in these projections would not prevent Barack Obama from being elected this year and re-elected in 2012, but they would make it marginally more difficult. Demography, modestly, favors the Republicans, and more than modestly over the long haul ...    James Joyner at Outside the Beltway, however, finds Barone's analysis a bit simplistic. (For those who, like the Opinionator, struggled through high-school Latin, a Google search tells us that ceteris paribus means ""all other things being equal."")    As to the first part of Barone's analysis, it presumes ceteris paribus. But ceteris haven't paribused at all. Arizona, Texas, Florida and Georgia (at least) are becoming decidedly more Hispanic and the Carolinas and Georgia are becoming more postindustrial and ""ideaopolis"" oriented. Further, Virginia, Colorado, and other states are becoming more purple for a variety of reasons.  My guess is that Texas, which is projected to gain 4 seats, and California, which is projected to lose 1, will still be reliably Republican and Democratic, respectively, at the presidential level in 2012. But the number of Electoral Votes isn't the only thing that changes over the course of a decade. I certainly wouldn't consider all the states in either list above ""safe"" for McCain or Obama.

us,Fuzzy Numbers at Bon Jovi Concert,"Jon Bon Jovi performing in Central Park's Great Lawn in July. (Photo: Jason DeCrow/Associated Press) Slide Show  In recent years, New York City has been going to great lengths to count the numbers of people who attend big events in the parks like rock concerts and Metropolitan Opera performances. One of those efforts literally ran out of gas, though, at the Bon Jovi concert on Central Park's Great Lawn on July 12.    Admission to the Lawn was by ticket (they were distributed free as part of a commercial promotion), and the city planned to scan the bar code on every ticket to get an exact attendance count.  But there was a problem, according to Doug Blonsky, the president of the Central Park Conservancy: a generator in the park's command center ran out of fuel. For about 90 minutes, a computer that was supposed to get the scanning data had no power. However, the city was using a second, low-tech counting tactic: parks workers hand counted every person who went through the entrances to the lawn, using clickers. At the end, the hand count showed 48,560 people, while the scanner count was 8,000 less, the Parks Department said.  In any case, the counts from the Jon Bon Jovi concert and a few other recent events show that crowd estimates for past concerts -- the 600,000 who supposedly saw Paul Simon, for instance, or the 300,000 who saw Elton John -- were vastly overstated. (New York isn't the only place where crowd counts have been routinely inflated.)  The number of people who actually attend these events has taken on a charge in recent years because the city would not give a permit to two groups that wanted to hold an antiwar rally in the park in 2004.  With Central Park restored after decades as a big dust bowl, the Parks Department has resisted certain kinds of mass gatherings that once were common. It has permitted opera and symphonic concerts, and some tightly controlled rock concerts.  The decision to exclude the 2004 peace rally was challenged in court, with the groups saying that the park had historically been the host of mass events, with hundreds of thousands of people. Ultimately, the city paid the groups a $50,000 settlement and $500,000 in legal fees. But city officials say that the historical argument shouldn't carry that much weight because the crowd estimates before 2000 had no basis in reality. The officials remain protective of the lawn -- at the expense of free speech on the only suitable open space in Manhattan, critics say.   Judging by the e-mail response this week to this column, quite a few readers agree.  Jim Dwyer writes the About New York column for The Times. ",2008-07-24T13:29:39+0000

But thieves who prefer to operate in the shadows have stumbled today into the top of Britain's headlines.   Someone swiped the bike of the British opposition leader, David Cameron, who happens to be a national advocate for parking that gas-guzzling automobile and pedaling instead. Mr. Cameron, the Conservative party chief, regularly commutes to work at the House of Commons by bicycle.   As the story filled with humble details goes, he stopped at a supermarket on his way home, to pick up some items for dinner, and left his mountain bike locked to a bollard, a short and stout barrier whose main purpose is to block vehicle traffic while letting pedestrians pass. Mr. Cameron would regret the decision minutes later.   (Photo: Britain's Conservative Party leader David Cameron. (Photo: Reuters))   According to a witness quoted by The Evening Standard, ""a couple of kids hanging around"" quickly saw their opportunity. In a swift motion, they demonstrated how Mr. Cameron's bike-locking skills fall far short of his political prowess. ""They just picked it up and ran off,"" the witness said, referring to the bike and the chain.  When Mr. Cameron emerged from the store, one witness told The Mirror, he was flabbergasted to find the bike gone. ""He just kept on saying ... 'But I locked it.' "" And the heartbreaking moments would not end there. In a public appeal to reporters, he was hopeful ...   ""If anyone has seen it I would very much like it back. To me it was absolutely priceless.""  ... but also realistic about ""losing an old friend"" ...  ""I'm not expecting to get it back any time soon.""  His spokesman said that he has resolved to ""take it on the chin,"" as anyone with stalwart British blood pumping through his veins would do. But Mr. Cameron may take solace in a similar story. Many years ago, a search for another stolen and absolutely priceless red-and-white B.M.X. bike ended happily, thanks to The Lede's dad, who, it should be noted, did not have the help of Scotland Yard on the case.

us,German Press Agog Over Obama,"If Senator John McCain's campaign aides are envious of all the press coverage from the American media corps traveling with his rival, Senator Barack Obama, on his overseas trip, they'd be clenching their teeth even more if they were reading the German press today.  The level of coverage of the Obama visit has been gushing, to say the least. The Die Zeit Web site is live blogging the visit every few minutes, and even has this dialogue between Senator Obama and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier:    DPA [the German news agency] reports that Steinmeier greeted Obama with the words: 'How's it going?' The daily Suddeutsche goes further, reporting that Obama then replied, 'Hello.'   Die Zeit remarks with some surprise that Americans seem to be paying less attention to the visit than Germans are.  It notes that a full 80 percent of respondents to an online poll by N-TV agreed that the media hubbub was ""too much.""   Yet most of them also acknowledged that they were watching it all.    There was a similar breathless nature to this item from a live blog at the Web site of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Frankfurt daily:    Foreign Ministry, Blue Hall. The second photo-op with Steinmeier lasted 15 seconds. It would have been even shorter had it not been for an American who approached Obama as he exited, to thrust his (the senator's) book under his nose and ask him to sign it. 'Did he say anything?' asked one photographer in the scrum.  When no one replied, he asked, 'Did he breathe?'   And the Web site of the Berliner Morgenpost noted that ahead of his much-awaited speech in the German capital, Obama -- who in Israel had said he was so tired he could fall asleep on his feet -- nonetheless spent time in the fitness center of the Hotel Ritz Carlton.

us,If Microsoft Opens the Xbox Is an App Store for Apple TV Next?,"The open season on openness has reached that most closed of societies: the video game console. Microsoft is now creating a method for almost anyone to write and sell games for its Xbox 360 machines.   The new Microsoft plan for game developers is called Xbox Live Community Games. Here's the deal: Spend $99 to become a premium member in the XNA Creators Club. Write a game. Submit it to a panel of other club members for approval. If it is deemed ""safe to play"" you can set a price at between $2.50 and $10. Microsoft will sell the game and keep 30 percent.   Sounds like Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch, doesn't it? And Microsoft addresses that head on its detailed list of frequently asked questions about the program. Apple, Microsoft points out, approves all applications for the iPhone, while it uses the much more scalable method of having peers review applications.    We're revolutionizing the way games are created and distributed because we're not the arbiters of content. The games on Xbox LIVE Community Games will be built by the community, for the community and managed by the community.    Until now, developers needed to negotiate a business arrangement with Microsoft to have their games distributed for the Xbox.   The first crop of games written this way will appear in the fall. Only then will we see how much people who are used to the heavily produced console games, and the professional casual games on Xbox Live, actually want to play games written by amateurs. But if you asked how many people want to watch grainy amateur videos instead of professional television, you might well have missed out on the YouTube phenomenon.   Opening up game consoles could actually be very important in revolutionizing all of home entertainment. Remember that Xbox 360, Tivo and Apple TV boxes are fundamentally similar devices optimized for different purposes. All of them take information from a hard drive and an Internet connection to display entertainment on a television screen. Yes, the Xbox has much better graphics processing and an optical drive. The Tivo decodes cable and broadcast signals.   But the platforms are converging. Xbox does a brisk business in downloaded movies and has a new deal with Netflix. Tivo downloads movies from Amazon and now links to YouTube.   So think about this: a version of Apple's app store for Apple TV. This could serve as a basic game platform for Apple--not so basic if the company beefs up the graphic chip in the device. Moreover, apps for Apple TV could offer the sort of info snacking that iPhone apps do: weather, yellow pages, photo sharing, viral videos and so on. I assume video, photos and entertainment apps would be most popular, but there is someone who will do anything. And that's the beauty of an open environment.   But even more than casual entertainment, the right approach for open applications for an Internet connected video device will revolutionize television. Imagine a CNN application that lets you assemble a newscast on topics that interest you. People have been chatting about ""interactive television"" for several decades. But suddenly we have the right platform: A real computer with a broadband Internet connection coming in and video going out.    What's missing is how people will control this device. A traditional remote, with the up-down-left-right-select buttons, just isn't going to cut it. An open environment with thousands of choices in my view requires a keyboard because search turns out to be the very best way for people to find what they want fast. I've often thought that the best remote control will have a Blackberry style keyboard on it. But I have a new bet: Apple could let you use your iPhone or iPod Touch to control this new more powerful version of Apple TV. They already have a rudimentary remote application for playing music.   If you've read this far, you may think I've gone off the deep end. But I think we have seen the power of open and flexible computing environments over closed and specialized systems. You can see the revolution brewing in mobile phones. And I simply can't imagine why you would choose a closed system for the TV in your living room if you have a choice of an open one if it say as easy as an iPhone to use.    Microsoft clearly is making part of this bet with its community games initiative. Since Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in its attempt to build a closed set top box environment for pay TV companies, I don't know how much it will push the revolution to video. For now, Microsoft's game community doesn't allow for free apps sponsored by advertising, a necessary part of this vision.   But Apple's relentless strategy to design a single operating system at the core of its computers, phones and set-top boxes makes me believe that it will be open season on Apple TV within a year or two.

Some thirty gigantic and ravenously hungry Kamchatka brown bears have already killed and eaten two men at a platinum mine in Russia's Far Eastern Kamchatka region and appear to be hunting for more. People in the region have been forced to cower in their homes waiting for hunters to dispose of the animals, which can stand 10 feet tall and weigh up to 1,500 pounds.   Local officials have considered exterminating the creatures, and a group of hunters has already been dispatched to the region where most of the bears have gathered. Hunters killed at least 300 bears last year and poachers shot about 600 more illegally, the Guardian reported.   ""These predators have to be destroyed,"" Viktor Leushkin, a village official, told Itar-Tass. ""Once they kill a human, they will do it again and again.""   The Kamchatka brown bears are massive, weighing up to 1,500 pounds, but they typically shy away from humans. Yet a sharp decline in salmon, their traditional food, due to poaching has forced them to seek out other food sources, as more and more unfortunate people have come to discover.   The wilds of Kamchatka, an ethereal region of active volcanoes and hot springs, is not the only place in Russia facing attacks by hungry bears. The Times Online reports that three people have died this year from bear attacks on near-by Sakhalin Island. Another woman was found mauled to death in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatski, the capital of the Kamchatka region.  On Dot Earth: Last month's blog post on bear troubles, ""Polar Bear Shot in Iceland.""

us,Cancer Doctor Warns About Cellphones,"The head of a prominent cancer research institute has warned his faculty and staff to limit cellphone use because of a possible cancer risk, The Associated Press reports.  Dr. Ronald B. Herberman, the director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, notes that while the evidence about a cellphone-cancer link remains unclear, people should take precautions, particularly for children.  ""Really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldn't wait for a definitive study to come out, but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later,"" Dr. Herberman told The Associated Press.  Earlier this year, three prominent brain surgeons raised similar concerns while speaking on ""The Larry King Show."" Their concerns were largely based on observational studies that showed only an association between cellphone use and cancer, not a causal relationship. The most important of these studies is called Interphone, a vast research effort in 13 countries, including Canada, Israel and several in Europe.  Some of the research suggests a link between cellphone use and three types of tumors: glioma; cancer of the parotid, a salivary gland near the ear; and acoustic neuroma, a tumor that essentially occurs where the ear meets the brain. All these tumors are rare, so even if cellphone use does increase risk, the risk is still very low.  On Wednesday, Dr. Herberman sent a memo to about 3,000 faculty and staff saying that children should use cellphones only for emergencies because their brains are still developing. He advised adults to keep cellphones away from the head and use the speakerphone or a wireless headset, he said.  ""Although the evidence is still controversial, I am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cellphone use,"" he wrote in his memo.

us,The Price to Pay for Obama Stadium Tickets,"Updated Want to score one of the tickets to Senator Barack Obama's speech next month accepting the Democratic nomination in Denver? You won't have to pay, but you may have to work for it, according to the Obama campaign.  In an interview with The Denver Post, the deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand indicated that the price of admission to the speech would be a pledge to volunteer and recruit new voters on behalf of Mr. Obama.  ""We're going to ask those 80,000 people in that stadium to march out of there and go with very specific instructions and goals to register millions of new voters,"" Mr. Hildebrand told the newspaper.  And by stadium, Mr. Hildebrand is, of course, referring to the campaign's choice of venue for the acceptance speech  Invesco Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos football team.   Earlier this month the Obama team announced that they had decided to hold the speech at the stadium because it would accommodate a much larger crowd than the Pepsi Center, where the Democratic National Convention will take place.   Nearly 60,000 members of the public could receive the ""community credentials"" that carry the price of activism between the convention and the November election, The Post reported.  And at last week's Netroots Nation conference, the gathering of bloggers from across the country, Mr. Hildebrand announced that the campaign would kick off a sizable nationwide voter registration drive just after the Democratic convention.  In an interview with The Times, Mr. Hildebrand spoke more about the public credentialing plan: ""If people are going to utilize a credential to see Barack's acceptance speech in person, we will provide strong encouragement that they give us their time and their muscle between now and the election.""  Most important, he said, is that ""the people who take credentials for this event actually show up.""  He also confirmed that a ""significant percentage"" of the tickets for the convention's final night would be reserved for residents of Denver, the host city, and Colorado at large. But the campaign's goal is to have Americans from all 50 states in the stadium as Mr. Obama accepts the nomination on Aug. 28.  Out-of-towners who want to attend will likely have to sign up through a local campaign or Democratic Party offices. Some tickets might also be available online. The D.N.C.C. expects to announce final details about the public credentialing process next week. ",2008-07-24T15:32:18+0000
us,The Road to Anbar,"(Photo: The bridge over the Euphrates river in Falluja, as it looks today. Four years earlier, the remains of four private contractors were hung there after being killed and mutilated by insurgents. (Photo: Ali al-Saadi/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images))   BAGHDAD -- This spring I needed to interview former detainees in American detention centers who had recently been released, so I went to Anbar Province, a vast western desert area of Iraq that lies between Baghdad and Jordan. It is best known for the turbulent town of Falluja, which became a headquarters for Al Qaeda in Iraq and where the Americans fought bloody battles in 2004. It then became something of a ghost town peopled almost exclusively by fighters. Eventually, the Marines completely controlled it and the violence migrated elsewhere. But many of those who had been detained there were locals, and eventually they returned to their homes.  We had to leave early and so I didn't have much choice of a translator. Anwar was the only person who came in early, and although she was a Shiite and usually I would not have taken her a hardline Sunni area, I asked her to go. She is 30-years old and the mother of a little girl. A fine translator, she is also a thoughtful observer. Her sense of loss -- on many levels--- is finely tuned, but she can also laugh.  At first, she was scared to come with me to a place where the Sunnis are known for all but eating Shiites. But as our journey unfolded she became lost, as did I, in memories of an earlier time in Iraq. For her, childhood and the early days of her marriage; for me, the first year or two that I was reporting here in 2003 and 2004.  As we drove through the Baghdad outskirts, we each began to remember the last time we had been in Anbar. For Anwar it was the fall of 2005 when she fled to Syria. For me it was September of 2004, when I made it back to Baghdad from Ramadi through Falluja, when the city was in the grip of Al Qaeda in Iraq gunmen.    Anwar's first memory was of early morning, 6 a.m. in the winter, and loading a suitcase into a mini-bus shared with other fleeing Shiites, with her infant daughter in her arms racing toward the border, praying that Sunnis would not stop the car and execute them. When she got to the border she was surprised to find that it was only 9 am; they had crossed Iraq's western desert like the wind. She called her mother and said, ""We are here, we can see Syria."" It was two years before she came back.  As we talked about these memories, we reached the western edge of Baghdad and were going by a neighborhood named Al Khadraa. Anwar pointed and said, 'Right there behind that house is Adnan's parent's house,"" Adnan is her husband.  ""They had to leave it because extremists took over the neighborhood. So they let a Sunni woman, a widow, live there for free with her children so that it would not become a nest for terrorists.  ""Look, can you see? It's that one right there, where that palm tree is lying in the road.""  Iraqis chop down palm trees and use the trunks as makeshift road barriers. I looked at the house and it looked perfectly ordinary. A low, yellow brick house with a scruffy garden, grass that already in April, before the true heat of the year, looked brown. As if reading my mind, Anwar said. ""It had a beatuiful garden with many kinds of palm trees inside. It is very neglected now. Just seeing it makes my heart beat so."" Her eyes were filled with tears.  At the time Anwar fled to Syria, masked fighters from Al Qaeda in Iraq still controlled many of the roads in the west, though not the main highway in Anbar (but sometimes that as well). Falluja and Ramadi were 'no go' zones for Western journalists unless they were embedded with the military.  My memory of Anbar dated from the fall of 2004, a couple of months before the American military offensive in Falluja. On that particular day, as it happened, there had been a suicide bomb attack on the marines on the highway between Ramadi and Falluja. I was at a marine base in Ramadi and needed to get back to Baghdad because we were short staffed in the LA Times office, where I was then working.  Instead of waiting until there was a helicopter to fly me back, I had two of our Iraqi drivers come out to get me. I dressed in a black abbaya and veil and black Iraqi shoes and climbed in the back of one of the cars. Ziad, the driver, who looked more Russian than Iraqi, told me that the marines had closed the highway and so we would have to take detours through Falluja.   I don't think I allowed myself to think about how dangerous that would be. Because the Al Qaeda guys controlled the checkpoints, they might see that there was a westerner in the car -- a prize; someone whose beheading they would want to video. We agreed I would lie down in the back of the car curled in a fetal position facing the seat, I would cover my head and most of my pale face with my black veil. Ziad would say I was pregnant and ill and he was taking me to my sister's in Ameriya, a Sunni area of Baghdad. I tried to imagine being pregnant and fearing that I was going to lose the pregnancy.  Soon we were bumping along the unpaved roads that the marines had routed traffic to. It was very hot and uncomfortable on the seat and I wanted to sit up. 'Safe?"" I called to Ziad. ""La"" (""No"" in Arabic) he said as we slowed down again. As I cast my eye upward for a second I saw leaning in the window a swarthy thin man with a Kalashnikov in one hand and a black and white checked scarf hiding his face. It was an insurgent checkpoint. He and Ziad spoke in Arabic for a few minutes before we proceeded. There were probably four checkpoints like this before we rejoined the main highway. At each one an armed man looked into the car and then waved us through.  I owed Ziad my life, literally. When we got back I could see how frightened he had been. If any one of them had asked to see our identification, we would have been kidnapped and eventually, perhaps, beheaded.  Four years later, the road is safe. By 10 a.m., we had passed the last Baghdad checkpointit used to take a mere 45 minutes to reach Falluja from Baghdad, but now it's a nearly two hour journey because of the Iraqi Army checkpoints. We were approaching the town of Abu Ghraib, known best for its notorious detention facility where American soldiers had humiliated and intimidated Iraqi detainees. I had never thought about the town as anything other than a scruffy bedroom community of Baghdad.   We passed one of those strange mirage like desert ponds that lie low and flat, whether from some aquifer close to the land's surface or a broken water pipe is hard to say. It is certainly not rainwater, especially this year, which has been parching dry even by Iraqi standards.  Anwar gazed out the window at the dry desert scrub, the patch of water and clumps of palm trees and then spoke as if in a dream. ""There are lovely lands near here. My uncle used to have a farm. He planted it himself,"" she said.  I was surprised since I did not think of the area as wet enough for farming. ""He had vegetables and pomegranates and all kinds of trees. It was on a small river and we went there in the summer. He had a small stable with horses, and cows and chickens.  ""When we visited, he put a table outdoors that he had gone outside Iraq to buy in Europe, and he bought big umbrellas to make it shady, and special chairs. That was in the time of Saddam Hussein when we were young.  ""And he had another special garden for grapes. You entered long tunnels and the grapes grew over them, red and green. It was so beautiful. That was 20 years ago now. He had to leave there because he lived in the middle of the Zobaie tribe and they did not like strangers,'' said Anwar, using the code word for Shiites.  We were quiet then and watched the desert slip by. ",2008-07-24T15:36:19+0000

us,Pessimism From Venture Capitalists,"It's a dreary time for Bay Area venture capitalists. Investments are slowing and exits are stalled. Venture capitalists don't expect the I.P.O. drought to ease until 2010, according to a new survey of dealmakers by audit, tax and advisory firm KPMG. Only 9 percent of those surveyed think I.P.O. activity will pick up next year and 12 percent predict it will never again reach historic levels.   A July 1 survey by the National Venture Capital Association found investors to be more optimistic, with 43 percent predicting that public offerings would pick up in the next 12 months. Only 5 percent thought it would take longer than two years. Still, they said that two-thirds of venture-backed companies were less likely to want to go public than they were three years ago. They blamed the drought on skittish investors, the credit crunch and the regulatory requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   Paul Kedrosky, an investor and senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, takes the more pessimistic view. He doesn't see the I.P.O. markets opening up for several years and predicts dire consequences for venture firms. ""Self-serving protestations to the contrary aside, there is no institutional venture market without regular and sizable IPO exits. With 10-year venture returns set to soon lag long term S&#38;P returns, this is an asset class in a serious state of brokenness,"" he says.   Only five venture-backed companies went public in the first half of 2008, while 86 went public in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association. The percentage of dollars going into first-time financings hit its lowest mark since 2004. That's in part because venture capitalists are being forced to invest new rounds of capital in late-stage companies that they expected to have gone public or been acquired by now. Firms have extended their exit timelines by a year or more, KPMG found.   ""I am convinced that the I.P.O. market will be largely unavailable or unattractive for at least the rest of 2008 and for the first half of 2009,"" says Jim Breyer of venture capital firm Accel, an early investor in Facebook, where Breyer is on the board. ""We are advising our portfolio companies to view their cash as particularly precious in these difficult times.""   When the market does turn around, investors say green technology will lead the way, with mobile and digital entertainment following. They predict that international investing will pick up and expect China, India, Brazil, Russia, Israel and Qatar to be attractive markets, the KPMG survey found. ",2008-07-24T15:51:24+0000

Bruno's travels on state aircraft last summer, according to a report released today by the State Commission on Public Integrity.  Two of the officials, Richard Baum, the former top aide to Gov. Eliot Spitzer, and William Howard, a former public safety adviser to the governor, have already reached settlements with the commission.  The other two officials, former communications director Darren Dopp and former state police superintendent Preston Felton, are contesting the charges. If the commission's findings are upheld, Mr. Dopp could be subject to a $10,000 fine and Mr. Felton to fines totaling $20,000.  The commission's report says:   Senior Spitzer administration officials did more than seek to generate a negative news story about the governor's political opponent. Rather, the Commission has determined that reasonable cause exists that the State Police were enlisted in an effort to gather and publicize sensitive information about Senate Bruno's travel. In doing so, Spitzer Administration officials caused the State Police to contravene longstanding State Police procedures governing the disclosure of such travel administration.   The findings bring to a head one of the most long-awaited investigations concerning the Spitzer administration, which has spawned numerous inquiries into its conduct, most of them outliving the administration itself.

us,The Fat Fight Goes On,"Many readers took issue with the good news on saturated fat, as I described Gary Taubes's take on a new Israeli study that compared an Atkins-like low-carb diet with other diets. Mr. Taubes, the author of ""Good Calories, Bad Calories,"" noted that the people eating the low-carb diet ate more saturated fat than the other dieters but ended up with an improved cholesterol profile. He called it perhaps the best evidence yet that saturated fat has been wrongly condemned by the American Heart Association and the federal government.   Some readers argued that there wasn't that much difference in saturated-fat consumption among the dieters. Saturated fat constituted a little less than 10 percent of the calories consumed by the people on the Mediterranean and A.H.A. low-fat diets; it constituted about 12.5 percent of the low-carb dieters' calories. Some critics said that's a difference of only 2.5 percentage points; others noted that it represents an increase of 25 percent. Both, of course, are right.   Here's Mr. Taubes's reply:    In an ideal world, it would be great to have significantly larger differences in saturated fat content. It would also be great to have studies that looked at heart disease endpoints and, ideally, overall mortality. That's what I argued for in the epilogue of ""Good Calories, Bad Calories,"" while acknowledging that studies of health outcomes (rather than just change in cholesterol numbers and weight) would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more. It's unlikely they'll ever be done. And if they are done, they would take years to plan and the better part of a decade to accumulate enough hard endpoints, as they're known in the lingo  heart attacks, deaths, new cases of cancer, etc.  to generate statistically significant results. I still think they're worth it, but the folks at the National Institutes of Health do not, or at least not yet.   The point I was making is that all the relevant diet trials done in the last decade  randomized controlled trials comparing Atkins-like low-carb diets to AHA low-fat, calorie-restricted diets  of which there are now more than half a dozen, have observed the same result., In each one, LDL on the two diets was a virtual wash and cholesterol profiles (total/HDL) showed greater improvement on the Atkins diet. When the trial looked at blood pressure, that improved significantly on the higher fat, lower carb diet. In this Israeli study, they looked at markers of inflammation  same story.  What we have to keep in mind here is that nutrition is a science (or at least should be) and science is about generating hypotheses, making predictions from our hypotheses, and then seeing if they hold true. The relevant hypothesis here  i.e., what we've believed for the past 30-odd years  is that saturated fat causes heart disease by elevating either total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol, specifically. So our prediction is that the diet with the higher saturated fat content will have a relatively deleterious effect on cholesterol. We do the test; we repeat it a half dozen times in different populations. Each time it fails to confirm our prediction. So maybe the hypothesis is wrong. That seems like a reasonable conclusion. No one is proving anything here  as some of your respondents like to decry  we're just looking at the evidence and trying to decide which hypotheses it supports and which it tends to refute.  The knee-jerk response  as exemplified by quite a few respondents  is to assume that sometime in the not-too-distant past, maybe the 1960s or 1970s, before this low-fat dogma set in, such trials, or far better trials, were done and found the opposite  that the higher the saturated fat in the diet, the lower the cholesterol and the better the cholesterol profile. Or the higher the saturated fat, the greater the mortality. But that's simply not the case, as I point out in my book. In fact, I've been criticized (by Gina Kolata, among others) for going on and on in the book about all the different studies. But I did so precisely because I didn't want to be accused of cherry picking the data. (I was anyway, but that's just the nature of this business.) When Ancel Keys, for instance, reported in the 1950s reported that saturated fats raised total cholesterol, which they did in his studies, he based it on comparisons of butter fat to polyunsaturated oils in studies that lasted only two to nine weeks. (He also reported, curiously enough, that the saturated fats had no significant effect on LDL.)  These latest trials just happen to be the best data we have on the long-term effects of saturated fat in the diet, and the best data we have says that more saturated fat is better than less. It may be true that if we lowered saturated fat further  say to 7 % of all calories as the American Heart Association is now recommending  or total fat down to 10 percent, as Dean Ornish argues, or raised saturated fat to 20 percent of calories, as Keys did, that we'd see a different result, but that's just another hypothesis. The trials haven't been done to test it. It's also hard to imagine why a small decrease in saturated fat would be deleterious, but a larger decrease would be beneficial.  It's also true that I don't think that LDL is a particularly meaningful predictor of heart disease risk, and I think total cholesterol is meaningless (based on the evidence that I recount in the book). But the point is that the AHA and the National Cholesterol Education Program and the authorities at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute do think LDL is meaningful, and that's the basis by which they have always recommended low-saturated-fat diets. They also think that total cholesterol/HDL is the single best predictor of heart disease risk, so by their assessment, more saturated fat is better than less. I think the best predictors of risk regarding cholesterol profiles are HDL and the size and density of the LDL particles themselves, and maybe measurements of a protein known as ApoB (the protein component of the LDL particle itself) -- and the existing diet trials in those cases also suggest that saturated fats are at worst harmless and perhaps even beneficial.  Last point, the funding. It's true that the study was financed by the Atkins Foundation, but to assume that the researchers went out and falsified their findings or twisted their observations to satisfy the source of funding is naive. Regrettably, the only institutions that will finance clinical trials, for the most part, are those that stand to gain from the results. That's why the pharmaceutical industry finances drug trials. It would be nice if the government financed all these trials, but they don't. So it's up to the Atkins Foundation and any other organizations that might hold similar beliefs. In this case, the Atkins-funded diet trial observed the exact same results as similar NIH-funded diet trials.  Worth noting here is that the NIH has also spent $5 million recently for a large (300+ subjects, two-year-long) Atkins vs. AHA low-fat diet trial. This is a larger and longer version of a pilot trial that observed results similar to the Israeli trial. To my knowledge, it's the largest diet/weight trial the NIH has ever funded. The principal investigator was Gary Foster of Temple University, currently the president of the Obesity Society, which is to obesity these days what the American Heart Association is to heart disease. In February of 2007, Dr. Foster told me the researchers had ""completed the final 2 year assessments on most but not all"" of their subjects. This week he told me that a paper on the results is ""in the peer review process"" and that ""journal policies prevent me from saying more than that."" It would be nice to see those results, and we can only hope they'll be published soon.   Any Lab reader care to venture a prediction on the results of the NIH study? (The best prophet will be duly celebrated here when the results comes out.) Or do you have any other thoughts on this issue? ",2008-07-24T16:18:50+0000

us,Apple's MobileMess,"Two weeks ago, Apple launched MobileMe, the successor to its.Mac service, which costs $100 a year. Among other benefits, it can keep multiple Macs, PCs and iPhones in sync. E-mail, calendars and address books are wirelessly kept up to date. Very cool idea.  When I started testing it on July 10, there were a lot of glitches, especially with the Web-based address book, calendar and e-mail programs. Apple told me that it was having some technical problems, but that they were rapidly being solved. And sure enough, by the 14th, several days after the launch, I was really pounding on it, and it worked as advertised.  Well, actually, not quite ""as advertised."" Apple was saying the service offered ""push"" e-mail, calendar and contacts, meaning that changes were propagated instantly among devices. In fact, as I noted in my review, Macs and PCs don't check for updates any more frequently than every 15 minutes. Otherwise, though, the system works very well  for me  and it's extremely useful.  On July 16, Apple took the very unusual step of sending an apology to all MobileMe members, saying that the launch ""was a lot rockier than we had hoped."" Fortunately, the letter went on, ""we have worked through those problems and the Web apps are now up and running.""  It also said that Apple would stop using the word ""push"" in its advertising until Macs and PCs did their syncing nearly instantly. It concluded with an apology, and a free one-month extension to every member's subscription.  Unfortunately, MobileMe's problems were nowhere near over.  After my review appeared, a strange note showed up on the MobileMe support Web site: ""1% of MobileMe members cannot access MobileMe Mail. We apologize for this service interruption and are working hard to resolve the problem.""  Now, even if 1 percent is accurate, Apple has 2 million .Mac/MobileMe customers. So that's at least 20,000 people.   And just about every one of them e-mailed me.  For most of them, the e-mail features of MobileMe just don't work. The online Mail program at Me.com shows up empty; mail you try to send from your e-mail program never goes out; and messages sent to you get bounced.  For a few, it's a lot worse. ""This morning, I woke up and turned on my computer,"" wrote one reader. ""Happily, it seemed that the MobileMe e-mail service was back up. However, a few seconds later, when my computer synced with .Mac/MobileMe, ALL of my e-mail -- every single e-mail I've ever sent, received, and filed on .Mac -- disappeared. Every e-mail file on my hard drive (in the Mail library) was gone. I immediately went to Me.com to make sure that all my e-mail was still saved to Apple's server. It wasn't. All of the mail was gone.""  Apple escalated her case and dedicated top technicians to it, for which she was grateful. In the end, however, they recovered only 43 messages. The rest are gone forever.  ""I can't even begin to describe how unnerving, enraging, unbelievable and frustrating it is to have thousands of e-mails that I rely on disappear -- from a service that I'm paying for,"" she wrote me.  As days went by with no change, the disastrous launch began taking on a life of its own. Small-business owners lost money because they couldn't get e-mail from their customers. The Apple support Web site filled up with messages from apoplectic customers. People started calling it ""ImmobileMe"" and ""MobileMess.""  MobileMe tech support, my correspondents tell me, is nearly impossible to reach; the recording says that the support team is ""unavailable due to the overwhelming interest in MobileMe."" (Somehow I doubt that ""overwhelming interest"" is the problem.) When you do reach them, they're apologetic but can do nothing to help.  O.K., look: Even big companies screw up. Intel's done it. Microsoft's done it. Google's done it.   Maybe it wasn't such a hot idea for Apple to launch four enormously complex initiatives  the iPhone 3G, the App Store, the iPhone 2.0 software update and MobileMe  all on the same day.   Still, things can go wrong. We get that.  And it's a little mind-boggling that today, nearly two weeks after MobileMe's official opening, Apple still hasn't solved the problem. That's got to be a record in the short history of cloud computing.   But the real problem is how Apple is responding. For a company that's so brilliant at marketing, it seems to have absolutely no clue about crisis management.  One of my correspondents put it like this: ""I love Apple. My first computer ever was a 128K Macintosh. But the lack of explanation and communication on the MobileMe problem is outrageous. Why not update the status message? Why not give us some indication of what's going on?""   I called Apple. Would the P.R. team be willing to say what the problem is? What is being done to solve it? When might it be fixed? What kind of resources or time is being spent on a resolution?  No. Apple declined to comment on any of that.  A P.R. manager did, however, offer me this official statement: ""The .Mac to MobileMe transition was a lot rockier than we had hoped, and we are still having some growing pains. Some users have been having problems with their e-mail in particular, and we are trying to restore the service as soon as possible. We're very thankful for our loyal customers' patience as we work out the kinks.""   Shortly thereafter, that stale, static status message on the MobileMe site was expanded to include this: ""We understand this is a serious issue and apologize for this service interruption. We are working hard to restore your service.""  That's about as far as Apple will go in expressing an understanding of the emotional toll the outage is causing those 20,000 people.   It's amazing that Apple doesn't recognize this situation. This is an airplane that's stuck on the runway for hours with no food or working bathroom. And the pilot doesn't come on the P.A. system to tell the customers what the problem is, what's being done to fix it, how much longer they might be stuck, and how he empathizes with their plight. Instead, he comes on once every three hours to repeat the same thing: ""We apologize for the inconvenience.""  MobileMess, indeed. ",2008-07-24T16:28:16+0000

(Credit: Scrabulous.com)) Looking to cut down its main competition and most high-profile copycat in the growing market for social gaming, Hasbro has sued the two Indian brothers behind the popular Web game Scrabulous, which has more than half a million regular users on the social network Facebook.  Hasbro, the Rhode Island company that owns the trademark to the 60-year-old board game, Scrabble, on which Scrabulous is closely based, has also asked Facebook to remove the game under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, saying that it infringes the company's intellectual property. Facebook has not yet responded to or commented on the request.  ""Hasbro has an obligation to act appropriately against infringement of our intellectual properties,"" said Barry Nagler, Hasbro's general counsel, in a statement. ""We view the Scrabulous application as clear and blatant infringement of our Scrabble intellectual property, and we are pursuing this legal action in accordance with the interests of our shareholders, and the integrity of the Scrabble brand.""  ""Hasbro has always had the same two priorities,"" said Mark Blecher, general manager for Hasbro Digital Media, in an interview this morning. ""One is to offer a great playing authentic game for fans and the second is to protect our intellectual property. This was theft of I.P., plain and simple.""  The suit was filed in the Southern District of New York today, naming Scrabulous creators, Rajat Agarwalla and Jayant Agarwalla, and their company as the defendants.  The Hasbro licensee Electronic Arts started its own version of Scrabble for Facebook this month. It has a little over 8000 active users. Mr. Blecher said that EA had a ""a brief conversation"" with the Scrabulous creators about working together but that ultimately the company decided it wanted to control the game itself and develop it across various technology platforms.

(Renderings: Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) Enlarge this image. )   The on-again, off-again plans to build an office tower over the Port Authority Bus Terminal took at least a conceptual step forward on Thursday afternoon with the unveiling of three possible designs by three leading architectural firms.  Easily the most striking of the three is a constructivist assemblage by the London firm Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners, which is also designing Tower 3 at the World Trade Center site. It takes the form of four discrete boxes stacked atop one another and bound together by open diagonal trusswork that echoes the bold X-shaped steel braces girdling the main terminal below.  In complete contrast, for its suavity and lucidity, is a proposal by the Manhattan firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Architects. The central element of this plan is a sheer, glass-clad tower whose surface has an almost icy gleam. In this plan, the X braces would recede in importance behind a screen.  Somewhere between these two is the proposal by Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects of New Haven, whose overall form is monolithic but accentuated with a curtain wall on the north and south sides in a kind of monumental basketweave pattern.  The 40-story, 1.3-million-square-foot office tower is to be developed by a joint venture of Vornado Realty Trust and the Lawrence Ruben Company, which is leasing the air rights over the terminal for 99 years.

us,License Plates and the First Amendment,"(Photo: In April, Florida shelved plans for a Christian-themed specialty license plate. Now, South Carolina is considering a similar message and design. (James Moore, Faith in Teaching, via Associated Press))   In May, the South Carolina Legislature passed a bill that approved a Christian license plate design featuring the image of a cross over a stained-glass window, along with the slogan ""I Believe.""  According to The State newspaper in South Carolina, there would be no extra charge for the license plate. And if Gov. Mark Sanford signs the bill into law, South Carolina would become the first state to offer a religious-themed plate.   But before that happens it might have to survive court challenges from the American Jewish Congress and the American Civil Liberties Union.  ''The whole issue here is that people are trying to get the state to endorse their religion, and that's wrong,'' Dr. T. Jeremey Gunn, director of the A.C.L.U. Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, told The Times in June. ''It's almost as if there's insufficient support, and they have to go to the state to get it.''  In a letter to Governor Sanford, Marc Stern, general counsel to the American Jewish Congress, argued that a state oversteps its bounds when it ""creates special Christian plates by special legislation, with no assurances that other faiths could obtain similar legislative approval for plates of their faiths.""   Mr. Stern conceded in his letter that ""private parties are free to display whatever religious or anti-religious symbols or slogans they wish on their vehicles, and perhaps even purchase ordinary vanity plates communicating religious messages.""  But even vanity plates, though protected under the First Amendment, are regulated by the states. For example, four-letter obscenities (or using clever syntax to insinuate obscenities) are not allowed. In Virginia, there are 6,000 prohibited words, according to this March 24, 2006 edition of NPR's On the Media. The show's host, Bob Garfield, said that ""the list continues to grow, as state employees actually conjugate vulgarities to anticipate subsequent distasteful permutations.""  But some decisions are not so clear-cut:   &#x2022; MPEACHW in South Dakota  &#x2022; GETOSAMA in New York  &#x2022; H8MICH in Ohio  &#x2022; JN36NT in Vermont  All of the above were initially revoked by their respective states, though MPEACHW was eventually allowed. The top two are relatively obvious messages, though the reason why GETOSAMA was revoked is up for debate. H8MICH was banned because it was seen as an attack on University of Michigan sports teams. JN36NT was banned because it referred to a religious passage, John 3:6 New Testament; Vermont does not allow religious messages on vanity plates.  It's a wonder states put up with all of this trouble to continue the service. Actually, not really. Vanity and speciaty plates generate millions of dollars in revenue for the states every year. So the debate goes on.  Governor Sanford has not announced whether he will sign the ""I Believe"" license plate bill into law. In April, a similar ""I Believe"" plate proposal was rejected by Florida lawmakers because of the debate it would provoke.  Related:  OUTATIME, OUTATME, OUTATYM ",2008-07-24T17:38:54+0000

us,Love in Unexpected Places,"(Photo: Jane Gross with nurse Eileen Dunnion, who cared for Ms. Gross's mother at the Hebrew Home for the Aged. At right, a needlepoint by Ms. Gross's mother, Estelle Gross. (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times))   Once upon a time, I thought the most unforgivable thing I could do as a daughter was to put my mother in a nursing home. I didn't promise her I wouldn't, but only because it never came up.   I believed the horrifying stereotypes, which are all too often true. And I assumed that any assisted living community, however poorly managed or ill-equipped, was a kinder alternative and surely one that would leave me less guilt-ridden.   So how to explain that I spent Wednesday, the fifth anniversary of my mother's death, at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale, N.Y., where she lived from September 12, 2001, to July 23, 2003? Why not the cemetery? Or the house where I grew up? Why return to the Resnick Pavilion, room 606, year after year and so often on her birthday, as well?   The explanation is simple, if surprising: My happiest times with my mother were spent here. Despite the unavoidable institutional odors, the unpredictable rantings of demented residents, the ""feeders"" spooning mush into the mouths of once capable men and women, the row upon row of wheelchairs in the TV lounge, in this nursing home my mother and I had an opportunity to know and love each other in a way we never had before.   (Photo: Estelle Gross's former room at the Hebrew Home for the Aged. (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times))   Partly this is because I didn't bear the 24/7 burden of caring for her at home. She first lived in an assisted living facility, but as she grew frailer, that arrangement no longer worked. My responsibilities became unbearable, and far too often, for dubious reasons, she was rushed to the emergency room with me following close behind. It was exhausting and scary.  My role when she lived in this nursing home -- arguably the finest in the country -- was still no picnic. Visits were depressing, even after the smells, the sounds and the sadness became familiar rather than jarring. Vigilance was required, especially on weekends and holidays when staff was thin and unfamiliar. Advocacy was essential, and worked best when my brother and I took turns playing the good cop/bad cop game.   But the nurses and social workers in this setting came to know all three of us intimately -- our strengths and weaknesses, our histories together and apart, our conflicts and our secrets. My mother was their primary responsibility. But to care for her well they had to care for us, too. Thus they were essential to the repair work we accomplished as a family.   On my visit this week, Hannah Curry, a social worker, remembered how I took my coffee and made sure I saw that my mother's needlepoints still were hanging in her office and at the nurses' station. Ms. Curry's mother and aunt are both residents of the Hebrew Home now, and we talked of her new juggling act as professional, daughter and niece.  Eileen Dunnion, the head nurse, brought me up to date on her son's achievements, an upcoming vacation to Ireland and the deaths of several residents I had come to know. She caught up on my career and my brother's, even remembering the names of our dogs, and asked how we were getting along. ""He's my new best friend,"" I told her.   She was as pleased at the answer as my mother would have been. ",2008-07-24T18:20:31+0000

us,Does Fructose Make You Fatter?,"High-fructose corn syrup is a sweetener used in many processed foods ranging from sodas to baked goods. While the ingredient is cheaper and sweeter than regular sugar, new research suggests that it can also make you fatter.  In a small study, Texas researchers showed that the body converts fructose to body fat with ""surprising speed,'' said Elizabeth Parks, associate professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. The study, which appears in The Journal of Nutrition, shows how glucose and fructose, which are forms of sugar, are metabolized differently.  In humans, triglycerides, which are a type of fat in the blood, are mostly formed in the liver. Dr. Parks said the liver acts like ""a traffic cop"" who coordinates how the body uses dietary sugars. When the liver encounters glucose, it decides whether the body needs to store it, burn it for energy or turn it into triglycerides.  But when fructose enters the body, it bypasses the process and ends up being quickly converted to body fat.   ""It's basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence,"" Dr. Parks said. ""It's a less-controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis. The bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body.""  For the study, six people were given three different drinks. In one test, the breakfast drink was 100 percent glucose. In the second test, they drank half glucose and half fructose; and in the third, they drank 25 percent glucose and 75 percent fructose. The drinks were given at random, and neither the study subjects nor the evaluators were aware who was drinking what. The subjects ate a regular lunch about four hours later.  The researchers found that lipogenesis, the process by which sugars are turned into body fat, increased significantly when the study subjects drank the drinks with fructose. When fructose was given at breakfast, the body was more likely to store the fats eaten at lunch.  Dr. Parks noted that the study likely underestimates the fat-building effect of fructose because the study subjects were lean and healthy. In overweight people, the effect may be amplified.  Although fruit contains fructose, it also contains many beneficial nutrients, so dieters shouldn't eliminate fruit from their diets. But limiting processed foods containing high-fructose corn syrup as well as curbing calories is a good idea, Dr. Parks said.  ""There are lots of people out there who want to demonize fructose as the cause of the obesity epidemic,"" she said. ""I think it may be a contributor, but it's not the only problem. Americans are eating too many calories for their activity level. We're overeating fat, we're overeating protein and we're overeating all sugars."" ",2008-07-24T18:40:06+0000

The quote comes from a fine piece about the organization by blogger/Nation writer Christopher Hayes, who makes a convincing case that, ""General BetrayUs"" ads notwithstanding, MoveOn has been remarkably successful in packaging progressive politics for the next millennium.     In many ways MoveOn's relationship to its members looks a lot like a business's relationship to its customers. If a product isn't selling, they take it off the shelves. For activists rooted in an earlier generation of social movements, which tended to prize long, disputatious meetings and the unwieldy process of forming bottom-up consensus, this approach is at best alien, at worst insidious. Customers, after all, aren't part of the creation of the product: they're not running the meetings where new packaging is designed; their input is limited to the final result and expressed through the transaction of purchase. And the role of customer imposes no obligations. You are free to buy or not buy, or in MoveOn's case, sign the petition or not sign the petition. Oscar Wilde once complained that the trouble with socialism was that it took ""too many evenings."" MoveOn holds out the promise of progressive change without the evenings.    ""What distinguishes MoveOn from a just a great e-mail list?"" asks Jim Manzi at the Corner, who answers his own question with all due respect for his enemies.     Interactivity. Hayes's article reminded me of nothing more than a profile of a successful Internet start-up. Leading consumer web businesses have, as a general rule, figured out that the new medium allows interactivity, and hence community-building, and hence barriers to entry. Eventually, though they usually don't say this out loud, this also allows the capture of new types of data about consumer behavior that permit far better message development and targeting.  Important new technologies tend to create new organizational forms built around them. These new organizational forms tend to appear first in the industries that create the new technologies, and then diffuse into the broader economy. Conservative activists should study this organization closely.    ""Grand New Party"" author (and former Times Op-Ed Page staffer) Reihan Salaam is likewise impressed:    I was most impressed by how MoveOn's leadership is attuned to the overromanticization of deliberative democracy.   The organizing model that requires long meetings and vigorous debate can lead to organizations being driven by, in MoveOn spokeswoman Ilyse Hogue's words, ""the loudest person in the room,"" something that cuts against MoveOn's non-shouter ethos.  Having experienced this ""democratic"" dynamic firsthand, I really appreciate Hogue's canny realism. But I do have some other points, which you'll find below.   Chris is convinced that MoveOn represents today's silent majority, or rather a slice of today's silent majority. I was surprised that he didn't reference Matt Bai characterization of MoveOn as built on the angry energy of besieged liberals surrounded by conservative suburbanites. I imagine this doesn't tell the entire story, but it struck me as a plausible characterization of many MoveOn members, and I think it fits Chris's MoveOn-as-Netflix framework.    Making changing the political course of the nation as easy as renting ""Sex and the City"" -- I'm not sure that's what the founders had in mind, but give Pariser credit for understanding the service economy.   (Note: For a very different take on the advocacy group's effectiveness, take a look at Big Tent Democrat's latest post at TalkLeft. Also, Hayes asked me to include a link to the article at the Nation's Web site; done.) ",2008-07-24T19:35:57+0000

us,Giulianis Son Discusses Duke Lawsuit,"(Photo: Andrew Giuliani, the son of the former mayor and presidential candidate, has filed a lawsuit against Duke University. The suit contends that he was unfairly removed from the golf team. (Photo: Rob Bennett for The New York Times))  His father made it big in politics, but Andrew Giuliani's dreams veer toward sports, he explained as he smacked golf balls on Randalls Island on Thursday. That's one reason he said he had little choice but to sue Duke University where he is a student, and its head golf coach for pushing him off the varsity golf team this spring.  Mr. Giuliani, who is 22, is the older of two children of Rudolph W. Giuliani and his former wife, Donna Hanover.  On Wednesday, the younger Giuliani filed a lawsuit [pdf] in federal court in Durham, N.C., accusing the university of bad faith by ""aggressively"" recruiting him as a high school student to play for Duke, then dashing his dreams by taking steps during his junior year in college to dislodge him from the team.   In the lawsuit, he acknowledges that he may have misbehaved in February by flipping his putter a few feet, throwing and breaking a club, gunning his engine out of a parking lot and tossing an apple at a teammate's face in a skirmish.  Rather than ""quibble"" about the details, the student said he had apologized for his own conduct, and said it pales next to the ""bizarre"" treatment he received from the school once Coach Orrin Daniel Vincent III took over the men's golf program last summer.  Taking it all in on Thursday, as the student practiced his swing before reporters and photographers at the driving range on Randalls Island, was his mother. ""It's not something you're going to be happy about,'' said Ms. Hanover, the TV personality and actress. Her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani became final in 2002, and in 2003 she married Edwin A. Oster, a high school boyfriend. (Mr. Giuliani also remarried, to Judith Nathan that same year.)  Ms. Hanover added that under no condition would Andrew be changing schools. ""Oh, he's going to finish at Duke,'' she said.  Duke, which had endured much unfavorable publicity when it suspended members of its men's lacrosse team for perceived misconduct and ultimately had to apologize, issued a brief statement that read: ""Duke's coaches and student athletes are held to the highest standards, which include a strong commitment to fairness for all participants in our sports programs. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.''  A revised and updated version of this article was published in Friday's final print edition.  ",2008-07-24T19:59:55+0000

us,Americas Nearly Perfect Postal Workers,"(Photo: The great American letter carrier, as portrayed by the media arm of the U.S. Postal Service. (Photo: U.S. Postal Service))   The American economy is ailing, the dollar remains weak and only one-fifth of the population is optimistic about the country's direction. However, there's one bright spot that may be all too easy to take for granted.  The United States Postal Service, the inventor of the Forever Stamp, today announced that it delivered a record-breaking performance between April and June, including near-perfect scores in several categories:    -- Overnight service was 97 percent on-time, up from 96 percent the same period last year. -- Two-day service was 95 percent on-time, up from 93 percent the same period last year. -- Three-day service was 94 percent on-time, up from 91 percent the same period last year.  In addition, five postal districts were 98 percent on-time for overnight deliveries. All figures were obtained by independent auditors, the postal service said.  A $40,587.00 Swiss watch is only slightly more dependable than that. And Rolex isn't even operating under a presumption of disgruntlement from its clients.  Meanwhile, a United Nations-led conference kicked off this week in Geneva with the goal of modernizing the way letters and packages pass from country to country. More than 2,000 representatives from 190 countries are attending.   Atop the list of priorities is, of course, improving speed. As of now, ""national postal operators are currently delivering 57 percent of international letters in less than five business days, lagging behind the target of 68 per cent,"" a statement from the United Nations Universal Postal Union said.  Still, there seems to be plenty of chutzpah in Geneva. As the conference kicked off on Tuesday, Director-General Edouard Dayan declared that the future of snail mail was bright and exciting:  ""Far from being obsolete, postal services are still alive and well,"" he said, adding that e-mail and the Internet had not rung the death knell for them.  ""On the contrary, all means of communication complement each other, and the postal sector in this era of the Internet and online commerce has never played a more important role in today's commercial trade.""

(Photo: Aude Guerrucci/Getty Images)) President Bush also gave a speech on America's role in the world on Thursday, and while the setting and the style could hardly be different, there were some striking parallels between his and Senator Barack Obama's.  Both men talked about hope. Both spoke of freedom as the core of American foreign policy. They sought to revive the spirit of NATO, the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan for a new era and a new war against extremism. It is a conflict that involves not only military might, but the instruments of soft power: aid, trade, help fighting AIDS.  Both championed the victims of political oppression in places like Myanmar, Iran, Zimbabwe and Darfur. Neither offered any new proposal.   ""If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope,"" one of them said. And the other said, ""In order to protect America, we must defeat the ideology of hatred by spreading the hope of freedom.""  Dare to say that most who did not watch both could tell who said what.  That is not to say that Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama share anything more than the vaguest sense of American exceptionalism  that the United States has strived ""at great cost and great sacrifice"" to create ""a more hopeful world"" (Mr. Obama) or that it has ""acted to defend and advance the cause of liberty"" (Mr. Bush).  Mr. Obama, speaking before tens of thousands in Berlin and millions more, made their differences clear enough, though he did so subtly, without directly confronting Mr. Bush or his Republican rival, Senator John McCain.  Mr. Bush gave his a couple hours earlier before 400 invited guests of the United States Agency for International Development, including administration officials and dissidents from Cuba, Belarus, Iran and North Korea, and he made a nonpartisan appeal to ""future presidents and future Congresses."" (Far from the heat of the campaign, it was not broadcast live.)  Substantively, however, the two speeches suggested that, all campaigning aside, some fundamental aspects of American foreign policy are likely to remain more or less unchanged. Those include opposition to Iran's nuclear weapons, support for an Israeli-Palestinian peace, a strong NATO role in helping rebuild Afghanistan.  Even on Iraq, where he has differed most with the administration, Mr. Obama called on the world to help Iraqis achieve sovereignty.  ""Despite past differences, this is the moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close,"" he said.  Mr. Bush mentioned Iraq twice, both times with Afghanistan, saying the two countries had emerged ""from tyranny to establish representative governments."" ",2008-07-24T21:52:21+0000

""Obama reframed the debate--and reclaimed the word--with his spectacular speech in Berlin today, when he spoke of ""the dream of freedom"" as something both Americans and Europeans shared and could be proud of.""  ""What will the reaction be at home?"" asks former Hillary Clinton partisan Taylor Marsh.   ""Like it or not, the Obama team has raised the bar with this speech at this setting, especially coming after a week that candidates dream about. For some checking in it could be their first impression; for others another look at a man trying to make history by grabbing a bit of the past and bringing it into the future as comparison. We'll see how it plays and if the media writes a real review or decides to get even for Obama's... er... audacity.""  ""The speech also endeavored to reconcile patriotism with self-criticism of America, which some Republicans are already trying to locate in his anti-war candidacy and indeed in this very trip abroad,"" writes Greg Sargent at TPM.   "" 'I know my country has not perfected itself.' The line, again, has a hint of a plea; he's asking Europe to forgive America the sins of the Bush years, while insisting that there's nothing incompatible whatsoever between patriotic love of America and caring what the rest of the world thinks of us.""  Even Jim Geraghty at National Review praises Senator Obama for his willingness to ask the Germans for more help against the Taliban: ""If Barack Obama can convince the Germans to contribute more to the mission in Afghanistan, God bless him, I mean that. But today he probably had a sense of how difficult it will be to get more resources out of Germany. Chancellor Merkel, while a gracious host, emphasized that she has 'no plans to go beyond pledges made last month for the NATO-led ISAF mission.' Additionally, a poll in February showed 85 percent opposed to sending German troops to the south of Afghanistan. Germans love Obama. But will they make concessions to him?""   Dissenters? Of course. ""The presumptive Democratic nominee's much hyped speech in Berlin today sounded grand and important, but contained nothing but platitudes and leftist, and multicultural, rah-rah,"" comments Kevin Holtsberry, a diarist at the conservative consortium RedState.  ""What it really came down to, after a long history lesson on the Berlin Airlift, was Obama the messiah giving the world a giant pep talk ... am sure speech will play well in Europe, whose devotion to idealistic Utopian schemes is well known, and among the liberal media, who faint every time Obama rises to speak. But I fail to see how it wins him any votes in the battleground state of the Midwest. And perhaps that is the silver lining."" ",2008-07-24T22:16:23+0000

us,When an Astronaut Believes in Aliens,"(Photo: Souvenirs on display at the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, Nev., the heart of Alien Country. (Photo: Isaac Brekken for The New York Times))   U.F.O. sightings are commonplace. Belief in aliens is high. Proof, of course, is hard to come by. In May, Jeff Peckman earned national attention for simply claiming to have a video showing an alien. The screening, though, was disappointing.  This week, another believer stepped forward to claim another round of headlines. But he wasn't shopping any proof, just a sterling background on the subject. Here's a few headlines from Google News:  -- Apollo 14 Moonwalker Claims Aliens Exist -- Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Claims UFO Cover Up -- Ex-NASA scientist says aliens exist -- Moon-walker claims alien contact cover-up   Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, appeared on a British radio show to say that he was ""privileged enough to be in on the fact that we've been visited on this planet and the U.F.O. phenomena is real.""   A close watcher of Mr. Mitchell wouldn't have heard anything new. As Robert Pearlman, the editor of CollectSpace, wrote on a message board:  Based on the nine minute call, it (a) doesn't seem to be anything tremendously different from prior comments and writings by Dr. Mitchell, and (b) he isn't actually claiming first-hand knowledge but rather repeating what he was told by others. It is no secret that Dr. Mitchell's Noetic Science Institute attracts those that believe in extraterrestrials and that he has attended numerous conferences where they have been on the agenda for discussion, thus what he says here is of little surprise (and some might argue, consequence).  Indeed, Mr. Mitchell's similar remarks in the past are available on YouTube, here, here and here.  While Mr. Mitchell, 77, is certainly entitled to his own views on the issue, the rest of us may need to wait for something more convincing. In the end, it would seem that the latest flare-up in alien news may be explained away in exactly the same way that a Reuters headline panned a new movie based on a television show that stirred the same part of our imaginations: ""Little to believe in with new 'X-Files' movie.""

us,The Other Home Equity Crisis,"In the early 1990s, she was called the ""New Traditionalist.""   In the early 2000s, she led the charge of the ""Opt-Out Revolution."" Educated and affluent, happily employed full-time with the care of her kids, she was said to be the standard-bearer for a generation that had discovered, after decades of blindly Seeking It All, that the road to true happiness lay in throwing in the towel and heading home.  It has happened like clockwork. In the past two economic downturns, as job losses have forced women out of the workplace, a sort of angel has appeared to guide their way and re-label their unfortunate circumstances as virtuous ""choice.""   Economists, sociologists and other academics who rigorously track workplace trends and work-life issues have been saying for years that this self-realized creature with her new, post-feminist home and hearth priorities, is a chimera.   There has been no meaningful large-scale generational trend toward stay-at-home motherhood, they say. While women's workforce participation did start to decline in 2000, interrupting decades of continual progress, this wasn't because women chose joyfully to go home. Women left the workforce when the cost of child care ate up their entire after-tax salaries, or when family-unfriendly workplaces pushed them out. Or when, like women without children or men with and without children, they were laid off in a bad economy.  But these naysaying voices have been largely shouting in the wind. No one has really wanted to hear that the much-vaunted new ""choices"" weren't really choices at all. No one's been scouring obscure academic journals for the real skinny on women's progress. No one's been too eager to embrace grim facts over more-glorious fictions.  But now the facts have gotten so very grim that no one can believably gussy them up anymore.  This week, Congress issued a report, titled ""Equality in Job Loss: Women are Increasingly Vulnerable to Layoffs During Recessions,"" that may -- if read in its entirety -- finally, officially and definitively sound a death knell for the story of the Opt-Out Revolution. The report, commissioned by Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, states categorically that mothers are not leaving the workforce to stay home with their kids. They're being forced out.  Women -- all women, mothers or not -- were hit ""especially hard"" hard by the recession of 2001 and the recovery-that-never-really-was, the report states. ""Unlike in the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, during the 2001 recession, the percent of jobs lost by women often exceeded that of men in the industries hardest hit by the downturn. The lackluster recovery of the 2000s made it difficult for women to regain their jobs -- women's employment rates never returned to their pre-recession peak.""   While prior recessions tended to spare women's jobs relative to men's, that trend has been reversed in the current downturn, thanks in part to women's progress in entering formerly male industries and occupations, and in part to the fact that job sectors like service and retail, which still employ disproportionate numbers of women, have suffered disproportionate losses. And this -- not a calling to motherhood -- accounts for the fall, starting in 2000, of women's labor force participation rates.   ""Women may be more susceptible to the impact of the business cycle than they were when they were more highly concentrated in a smaller number of non-cyclical occupations, like teaching and nursing,"" the report states. ""There is no evidence, however, that mothers are increasingly 'opting out' of employment, in favor of full-time motherhood. For this story to be true, the employment rate of non-mothers would have had to diverge sharply from that of mothers, which has not been the case.""  In fact, Heather Boushey, a senior economist at the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which released the report, proved in earlier research that there was no evidence at all for the belief that having children was causing women to drop out of work. On the contrary: the likelihood that a woman with children at home would leave the labor force decreased dramatically from 1984 to 2000, and continued to fall significantly right up to 2004. This downward trend held for women of all age groups and educational levels -- except for women in their thirties with advanced degrees, for whom the numbers remained stable over time. ""The data stand in opposition to the media frenzy on this topic,"" Boushey wrote for the Center for Economic and Policy Research in 2005. ""The main reasons for declining labor force participation rates among women over the last four years appears to be the weakness of the labor market.""   Men, of course, were hit hard by the recession and weak recovery, too; in fact, as Louis Uchitelle of the Times reported earlier this week, the workforce participation rates of men aged 25 through 54 have dropped from 96 percent in 1953 to 86.4 percent today.   But when men in their prime working years drop out of the workforce we don't say they've gone home to be with their kids.  We say they're unemployed.  The distinction is truly meaningful beyond the neat way it encapsulates our inability to separate ideology from fact when it comes to thinking about mothers and their much-vaunted ""choices."" Unemployed people, after all, are entitled to benefits. As a society, we tend to think it's incumbent upon us to get them working again -- for their own good, individually, for the good of their families, and for our collective welfare. Politicians promise to retrain them. Devise policies to retain them. The unemployed still fall under the ever-retracting umbrella of people we consider, to some extent, to be worthy of our care.  Mothers, with their glorious array of post-feminist lifestyle options, have long been seen as something else. They're individuals, making choices, responsible for the fallout of those choices even if, in point of fact, those choices were made for them by a weak economy, the unaffordability of child care or an inflexible workplace. They don't need ""government handouts"" like quality child care, flextime, sick days, family leave and top-notch afterschool programs, because they've made their proud choices and, by golly (unless they're whiners), they're going to go it alone.   I'm so glad that, at long last, this fiction has been officially acknowledged.  The new ""Equality in Job Loss"" report calls for specific policies to address the rising tide of female unemployment in the current economic downturn, including continued fiscal aid to the states to stave off job losses in still female-heavy state and local governments and measures to ensure that all workers -- including women, who frequently don't qualify for unemployment benefits because they work intermittently or part-time -- can access unemployment compensation. And, of course, family-friendly policies to keep women in the workforce in the first place.  ""In many recessions, it's been the wife's salary that has buffered the family. In this new reality, women are not going to be there to buffer their families from the economic downturn,"" Congresswoman Maloney told me in an interview. ""As we move forward, we're going to have to deal with this reality. And we have to think about this in terms of policy.""  Dealing with reality would be a major shift for our country, the implications of which could be huge not just for working mothers but for their children. And it's about time.

Here at The New York Times, we still have all of our foreign bureaus -- partly because our strategy is to compete for readers who seek international news and analysis -- but most newspapers and TV networks have been pulling back. Only four American newspapers now have foreign desks.

On the other hand, readers who want global news can find it now on the Web, more easily than ever. And there have been some interesting efforts at citizen journalism or blogging from hot spots around the world. One new venture is Demotix, which offers aspiring journalists a chance to upload their articles and photos for others to see -- and some possibility that news outlets will publish them. I don't know whether to be horrified, since it represents a further erosion of the newspaper business model, or to applaud another avenue to get international news coverage. The latter, I guess.

us,Clicking for Dollars,"The presidential candidates have tried all manner of ways to pry money out of donors this year through the Internet. Now, the Republican National Committee has come up with a technique that can generate cash for the party when a supporter searches the Web for, say, ""Barack Obama.""  Viewed as a win-win for both the committee and e-commerce sites, a new browser toolbar allows users to send two or three cents each time they conduct a Yahoo-based Web search through the toolbar. The service also lets the R.N.C. take a percentage of sales when toolbar users make purchases from about 300 vendors around the Web.  FreeCause, a Massachusetts-based company that created a version of the toolbar for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the breast cancer group, helped develop the application for the party. It also includes an R.S.S. feed and a related Facebook widget.  The microdonations to the committee are technically payments from the advertisers to users for conducting the search, which users agree to send directly to the party through a licensing agreement upon installation. That way, the party can track how much each donor is generating to make sure the amount does not surpass the Federal Election Commission's limit of $28,500  or about 1.4 million searches.

In its first statement since Mr. Savages remarks on July 16 the company said that it was satisfied that he did not mean any disrespect to autistic children or their families but was instead reiterating his longstanding concerns on public health issues. The company added that it was not appropriate to censor the opinions of its hosts on legitimate issues. In his comments Mr. Savage had said, in part: Ill tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out. So that some ""positive action might result from the matter, the company said, it would soon begin broadcasting public service announcements on legitimate autism issues.",2008-07-25T04:00:00+0000

us,"Rethinking Diets, Weight Loss and Health","Few topics generate more heated discussion than diet and weight loss, and for the past week, readers have posted hundreds of comments reacting to the latest diet research.  The latest study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, compared three diets. Some participants cut fat, others counted carbohydrates in a version of the Atkins diet, while others adopted Mediterranean-style eating habits. Some people declared the research a vindication for Atkins, others criticized my view of the study as more evidence that diets don't really work.   For some needed perspective, I turned to Gina Kolata, a New York Times reporter and author of the wonderful book, ""Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss -- and the Myths and Realities of Dieting."" Not only is Gina well versed in the science of weight loss, but she has an unusually compassionate take on the efforts of the dieters in this recent study and all people who struggle with their weight.  ""Every study that has ever been done, and this one included, shows that it's absolutely unbelievably difficult,'' she said. ""When people beat themselves up and say, 'I should be thin, it's my own fault,' maybe it's not your own fault. How much harder can somebody try than people in this study and look what happened. They didn't lose much weight.''  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. ""Rethinking Thin"" shows how difficult it can be for people to lose weight and keep it off. So what advice does Gina have for people who are overweight?  ""Don't always blame yourself, and don't beat up on yourself,'' she said. ""It's obviously really, really hard. Don't say, 'I'm a weak person and it's my own fault.' ""   Instead, Gina says some people who have tried unsuccessfully to lose weight may decide to say to themselves, ""I can be attractive. I can buy clothes. I can be fit. I can be healthy. I can have a good life, and I may not be skinny, but so what.""  Gina offers a powerful and compassionate message to people who are overweight and those who judge them.

us,Clear Channel Shareholders Approve Buyout Deal,"Clear Channel Communications shareholders on Thursday approved a $17.9 billion takeover by private equity funds Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital, ending a 20-month effort to take the radio and billboard operator private.  Clear Channel said that about 97 percent of the shares voted were cast in favor of the deal. The parties plan to consummate the merger on Wednesday, July 30.   The approval caps high-level negotiations and legal battles in two states, after six banks, which agreed in 2006 to fund the deal, attempted to back out against the headwind of the slumping stock market and dwindling capital markets.  In March, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain filed complaints in New York and Texas against the six Wall Street banks -- Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank and Wachovia -- to enforce their agreement to fund the buyout.  In May, the bank syndicate, private equity buyers and Clear Channel struck a deal to lower the deal's price and settle litigation between the parties.  The deal approved by shareholders, provided them with $36 a share, down from a $39.20 previously offered.  Central to the dispute was the hit the banks would take in funding the deal, given the deteriorated lending conditions.  Regulators have approved the transaction, and the lenders have placed funding in escrow.  Clear Channel Chief Executive Mark Mays told Reuters after the shareholder meeting that the deal will be good for the estimated 120 million people who listen to Clear Channel radio stations daily.  ""From a listener perspective, I don't think they will see anything radical or different. This is really a capital structure change rather than a programming change,"" he told news service.  Clear Channel owns some of the highest profile radio personalities in the country, including Rush Limbaugh, who was just signed to a new contract.  To complete the deal, Clear Channel sold its television division and several hundred of its radio stations, but Mays said he doesn't plan on any additional sales under the new ownership.  ""The international assets, specifically, are not for sale. All those rumors are untrue. We went through a process, we divested of our television and some radio stations, and now we have what we feel is the core assets that we want to operate the company going forward,"" Mr. Mays told Reuters.  He said he believes traditional media companies are ""truly undervalued.""  ""The media stocks clearly are still out of favor in the equity markets. When will that be corrected? As soon as the media stocks are able to change the incorrect perception and realize that today's traditional media, radio, the newspaper, or television, still reaches a mass audience and still gives great results to our advertising customers,"" Mr. May told the news service.  Clear Channel Communications will continue to be headquartered in San Antonio, where it was founded in 1972, Mr. Mays said.

us,New History of Woolworth Building,"(Photo: The Woolworth Building, known for its height when it opened in 1913, is being extensively renovated. (Photo: Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times))  Updated, 12:38 p.m. &#124; On the evening of April 24, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson pressed a tiny button inside the White House, lighting up the Woolworth Building in Manhattan. It was ""the tallest structure in the world, with the one exception of the Eiffel Tower in Paris,"" The New York Times reported, and it was a marvel of architecture and engineering.   Of course, the Woolworth Building has been surpassed in height -- by the Chrysler Building in 1930 and by the Empire State Building in 1931 -- and it has at times seemed to recede into the fabric of Lower Manhattan. The building's owners at one point considered converting the building into luxury apartments, but now the structure is being refurbished as top-end offices.   (Photo: ""The Skyscraper and the City: The Woolworth Building and the Making of Modern New York."") ""The Skyscraper and the City: The Woolworth Building and the Making of Modern New York,"" a book scheduled to be released next week by the University of Chicago Press, offers a new examination of the building and its significance in New York's history.   The 400-page book is the culmination of more than 15 years of research by Gail Fenske, a professor of architecture at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., who began the project as a doctoral dissertation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The book provides a new perspective on some of the most notable aspects of the Woolworth Building, like its eclectic design -- Beaux-Arts with Gothic ornamentation, over steel-frame engineering. The building has been seen as ""a throwback, a historicist building, not truly a modern building,"" Professor Fenske said in an interview, adding that she instead sees the building as ""in a sense emblematic of modernity,"" capturing both ""the excitement of the new -- the breaking of technological barriers -- and also, on the other hand, a discomfort with it.""  Designed by Cass Gilbert, the building, at 233 Broadway, between Park Place and Barclay Street, was commissioned by the retail magnate Frank W. Woolworth and constructed between 1910 and 1913. Woolworth famously financed the building without loans or help from developers. ""He financed it on his own,"" Professor Fenske said. ""It was unnerving to speculators, because he could do whatever he wanted.""   The book contains numerous illustrations, including one showing a 1929 advertisement for the building, calling it a ""Cathedral of Commerce"" -- a name that has stuck -- and lauding its height (792 feet), number of floors (60), weight (206 million pounds), floor area (15 acres), exterior windows (3,000), tons of steel (24,000), bricks (17 million) and tons of terra cotta (7,500).   In the interview, Professor Fenske said she initially disliked the moniker ""Cathedral of Commerce,"" finding it glib and simplistic. But as she studied the context in which the tower rose, she said, she began to see the name as appropriate. Its Gothic gestures suggested comfort, ""moralizing evocations"" of the old world from which many of Woolworth's customers had come. (Although Woolworth, the 5- and 10-cent emporium, was in some ways the Wal-Mart of its era, it also differed from today's big-box retailers. For instance, Woolworth's carried finely crafted products imported from Europe that would be particularly familiar -- and appealing -- to immigrant customers.) By turning to Beaux-Arts design, Professor Fenske writes, Gilbert and Woolworth ""resisted the forces of sensationalism and spectacle"" associated with advertising and mass culture.   The book places the Woolworth Building in the context of its time and place: the booming commercial culture of early 20th century New York; the often unsettling experience of modernization; advances in technology and communications; and a new phenomenon of ""urban spectatorship"" that made skyscrapers sources of public wonder and admiration.   Many innovations set the Woolworth Building apart. It contained a shopping arcade, health club, barber shop, restaurant, social club and even an observatory. Its use of technology -- including an innovative water supply system, a electrical generating plan, high-speed electric elevators providing both local and express service and what Professor Fenske calls ""the first prominent use of architectural floodlighting in the world"" -- also set it apart. So did the construction process, run by the builder Louis Horowitz of the Thompson-Starrett Company, who managed to avoid labor conflict, rationalize the building process and set a record for speed -- paving the way for the famously rapid completion of the Empire State Building nearly 20 years later.  The building has survived the Woolworth Corporation itself. The company announced in 1997 that it would close its remaining discount stores. The company was renamed the Venator Group, began focusing on athletic wear, and since 2001 has done business under the Foot Locker name. Although there are no longer Woolworth's stores in the United States, the Woolworths Group, a former subsidiary of the American company, continues to operate hundreds of retail stores in Britain.   Summarizing the legacy of the Woolworth Building, Professor Fenske writes:  The question of whether the Woolworth Building is, indeed, a great work of architecture may still be open to debate. Yet Woolworth and Gilbert's project represented in the eyes of contemporaries more than a vulgar contraption for producing a profit, and more than a dubious expression of corporate power, egregious advertising, or an aggressive assault on New York's new signature skyline.  As the building approaches its centennial, she argues, New Yorkers should recognize not only its ""aesthetic distinction"" but also how ""it reflected and refracted the many dreams and obsessions of the urban society that produced it.""

us,Condoleezza Rices Yen for Shopping,"(Photo: Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, from left, on Friday in Perth, in Prague last week and with Singapore's Foreign Minister George Yeo on Wednesday. (Photo: From left, pool photograph by Lee Griffith; Adam Berry/Bloomberg News; pool photograph by Roslan Rahman))   President Bush's renowned call for Americans to go shopping after 9/11 did not necessarily apply to his own extremely busy administration.  No one understood that better than Condoleezza Rice, whose tireless habits included long days and nights at the White House followed by weekends often spent at Camp David with the president. There was not much time for shopping, a crucial step towards looks that ""boldly eschewed the typical fare chosen by powerful American women on the world stage,"" as Robin Givhan of The Washington Post once wrote of Ms. Rice.  So when she let down her guard today at an Australian all-girls school to say that she's ""looking forward to getting back to shopping,"" suffice it to say that this wasn't some attempt at leveling with the common folk. She really meant it.   The secretary of state recalled shopping trips after church as a child and the mall that is about five minutes from her apartment near Stanford University, where she was expected to return when the curtain falls on the Bush administration. If she's talking about the Stanford Mall, there's more than 140 ""world class stores"" waiting for her.  She continued, ""It's a great pastime, shopping. I love it, even if I don't buy anything. I just love going to the stores to look.""   As she looked forward to leaving public life, she batted away yet another question about her White House ambitions, saying she's ""really not someone who would like to be in life as an elected official.""   But it was her joy for shopping that reduced her chances in 2005, when a scandal emerged in three words during a national outrage: ""Shopping During Katrina."" After a much-maligned trip to Ferragamo, a high-end shoe store on 5th Avenue in New York, she looked back in an interview with Marcus Mabry, a New York Times editor then working for Newsweek:  ""Look, I'd be the first to say I learned something from that. I thought of myself as secretary of state; my responsibility is foreign policy. I didn't think about my role as a visible African American national figure. I just didn't think about it.""   It was a rare moment when serious thinking and shopping were widely expected to go hand-in-hand. Come Jan. 20, she won't have to worry about that anymore.         ",2008-07-25T14:51:16+0000

Submit your queries on fashion, travel, design and entertaining to The Moment.   Question: It seems that all of my friends -- and random cousins -- are getting married between now and December. I don't want to wear the same dress over and over again, but I can't really afford to buy a new gown for each one. Please help.  Answered by: Karla M. Martinez, Ts womens market director.   I hear you. This year I was invited to nearly a dozen weddings -- each one calling for different ""attire."" I started the circuit with a black tie wedding in Cartagena, Colombia, made stops in Texas, Mexico and the south of France, and will end up in San Salvador in November. I have had to find the perfect dress for each occasion -- not to mention each climate -- without spending a fortune. In other words, I've done my research. My search started while I was back home in El Paso. The closest Neiman Marcus is 6 hours away by car and the fanciest designer label at the fanciest local department store is St. John, so I had my work cut out for me. A quick survey of Dillard's, however, led me to a number of dresses by designers like BCBG that were totally cute -- for less than $200.  When I returned to New York City, Melissa Ventosa Martin (T's women's fashion associate) and I broadened the search to find dresses for the following kinds of weddings: black tie, city, garden, beach and traditional (or ""country club""). The simpler options -- like the classic black cocktail dress -- can easily be ""reinvented"" by adding a strong piece of jewelry, say a bracelet or a pair of earrings. But no matter what dress you go with, always remember: never upstage the bride. This year I have seen more guests dressed in white than ever before -- always to the dismay of the woman walking down the aisle. If you want to wear white to a wedding, make sure you're the one who's getting married.   Garden:    Tracey Reese draped strapless dress in lime rose, $425.

us,V.C. Advice to Entrepreneurs: It's Not All About the iPhone,"Though almost every discussion at the MobileBeat conference in Sunnyvale, Calif., on Thursday centered around the iPhone, venture capitalists told mobile entrepreneurs to broaden their focus and build applications for all phones. Still, all anyone wanted to talk about was the Apple App Store, from which users have downloaded 30 million applications for the iPhone this month.   Startups should ""intelligently hedge their bets across multiple platforms,"" advised Richard Wong of Accel Partners. His firm has invested in mobile games and application site GetJar, ""the store for the other 3 billion phones that aren't iPhones,"" as Mr. Wong put it.   Rick Segal of Blackberry Partners Fund and JLA Ventures reminded developers that the iPhone only accounts for a tiny share of the worldwide market. In India, for example, Nokia has 70 percent market share. ""You must think multi-platform,"" he said.   Some investors insisted that multiple mobile platforms -- whether Apple's, Google's, Research in Motion's or others -- will thrive. Matt Murphy, head of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &#38; Byers' $100 million iFund, said most entrepreneurs who pitch him have iPhone applications, but that the platform war ""is not a winner-take-all game.""   David Sokolic of Battery Ventures disagrees. He predicts a shakeout akin to the PC market and Microsoft's Windows, with a clear leader emerging.  So what's a mobile start-up to do? One solution: introduce new features and applications on the iPhone, then push them out to other types of phones if customers like them. That's what location-based mobile service Loopt does, said its chief executive, Sam Altman.   Mr. Murphy likes that approach. It takes so little money to roll out an application on the iPhone that ""it changes the game for entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to see if you have something,"" he said.   Another piece of advice: don't create a mobile version of a Web site that already exists, said Mr. Segal. Instead, figure out a need that is unique to mobile users, like getting directions when you're lost.   Is all the venture-capital hype for mobile applications misplaced? Since 1970, there have only been about 150 acquisitions of venture-backed mobile companies and only 30 of those were over $100 million.   ""Mobile hasn't been proven to drive great returns in venture, but that's changing,"" said Mr. Murphy. According to Nielsen Mobile, of the 255 million mobile subscribers in the United States, 95 million pay for access to mobile internet, up from 74 million last year. Forty million use it to go online regularly. (One reason developers might be right to focus on the iPhone: only 4 percent of mobile Internet users have an iPhone, but they use it to go online at five times the average rate.) A few of the most popular new uses for mobile phones: games, roadside assistance and -- big surprise -- porn.   Said Jed Stremel, director of mobile for Facebook: ""We're beginning the golden age of mobile."" ",2008-07-25T17:29:45+0000

us,Bronx School Must Wait for New Home,"(Photo: The Bronx Borough Courthouse, a landmark that has stood vacant for more than 30 years, where a charter school was supposed to open. (Photos: David Gonzalez/The New York Times)) Lady Justice sits atop the Bronx Borough Courthouse like a stone dowager, awaiting some gentleman caller who will try to persuade her to part with her majestic, though decrepit, mansion. With her shield and sword at the ready, she was never a pushover.  In March, the owner announced that the Beaux Arts building on Third Avenue would come back to life in September as the Bronx Academy of Promise Charter School. But as summer inches ever closer to the start of the school year, the landmark courthouse remains empty and silent as officials from Imagine Schools, the nonprofit company that will run the academy, go back and forth with the landlord to negotiate a 25-year lease.   In just a few months, plans have changed, with the school's proposed home going from grand to bland. It will now open in a temporary location a mile and a half away on River Avenue, inside a low-slung windowless brick building. There would not be much of a view even with windows: the school sits in the shadow of the elevated tracks, next to a parking lot and across the street from a warren of beat up garages.   Officials of Imagine Schools, a Virginia company that runs dozens of charter schools nationwide, said they had been overly optimistic that the courthouse could have been ready for this school year. Instead, they are hoping to occupy the courthouse in 2009.  ""There just is no physical way,"" said Samuel Howard, a regional executive vice president. ""It is going to take every bit of a year for the landlord to do what we require of the structure and for all that needs to be there. There's no way it could have been done by this September.""  (Photo: A close-up of the bricked-up side entrance to the Bronx Borough Courthouse on Third Avenue.) Henry Weinstein, the owner, bought the courthouse from the city in 1999. He has said in the past that he intended to spend up to $30 million to renovate the building, whose interior had been picked clean by scavengers over the decades. At various times, plans had been floated to rent or sell the white elephant.  Andrew M. Chertoff, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, said in an e-mail message that the two parties have been negotiating lease terms for the last several months. He also said that once the lease deal is completed, construction will begin and the building will be ready for occupancy by September 2009, if not sooner.   The hulking building appears little changed since Mr. Weinstein bought it: a chain-link fence hugs the building, where some cracked walls are covered with graffiti like ""I Love You"" and ""Pistola."" Most of the windows are sealed tight with cinder blocks. Lady Justice -- with no blindfold to block her view -- looks out on a small plaza where weeds poke through cracks in the sidewalk. Several signs advertise ""Building Available.""  Community groups familiar with the building remain skeptical of the owner's intentions, said Yolanda Gonzalez, the executive director of We Stay/Nos Quedamos. Her group, a coalition of residents who successfully challenged officials in the 1990s to make them partners in rebuilding their blighted community, tried to buy the building in the 1990s to make it a symbolic centerpiece for their neighborhood's radically changed fortunes.   ""We still want it,"" Ms. Gonzalez said. ""The owner has done nothing except sit on it.""  While school officials await a lease, they have rented the temporary space on River Avenue, which used to be an early childhood education center run by the Volunteers of America. Somewhere along the way to the new location, the school parted ways with Urban Youth Alliance, a faith-based group that had been the school's community partner.  Officials at the Urban Youth Alliance would not elaborate on the split, nor would officials at Imagine Schools. ""I'm not at liberty to get into that decision,"" Mr. Howard said. ""There's nothing I can say about that."" He suggested contacting the Rev. Michael Carrion, president of the school's board. Mr. Carrion did not reply to an e-mail message.  Still, the community remains enthusiastic despite the setbacks and switches. The school already has 180 students registered for kindergarten through second grade.   ""We filled up the kindergarten in a week,"" said Angie Chiaravalloti, a regional director for Imagine. ""And we have a waiting list for 50 more for K alone."" She said that while the building looked plain on the outside, the classrooms were bright and welcoming.  ""There are no windows, but it is air conditioned,"" she said. ""There is a big area in the back we plan on cleaning up. There is a very large cafeteria where you can have a playroom. From the outside it does not look like much. But you go inside and it's amazing.""  A few days ago, two maintenance men lounged in chairs at the school's entrance, taking a break. One of them wore a Scarface T-shirt showing Tony Montana and his little friend about to get busy.  ""We're just painting and doing things,"" said Clinton Young. ""Just brightening it up.""  The facade could use it. The windowless stretch that is the school's public face had already been tagged with graffiti. Atop its roof, where swirls of razor wire graced the sides, hung a banner with the only clue of what lay inside.  ""Bronx Academy of Promise Charter School,"" it read. ""Leading Communities of Achievement and Hope.""

(Photo: Carlos Alvarez/Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images))   President Hugo Chvez of Venezuela did not succeed today in hugging King Juan Carlos of Spain as he planned, but he was warmly received as they mended fences after a spat that became a YouTube sensation last year.   President Chavez arrived an hour late, but the king remained in high spirits, according to reports. They exchanged grins, handshakes and embraced just a few inches shy of a full-fledged hug, right. (Experts could disagree).   At his palace in Majorca, a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea, the king professed, ""I'm happy to see you."" And Mr. Chavez replied with a joke, ""Why don't we go to the beach?""  Reporters watched carefully for further signs of rapprochement as Mr. Chavez continued, as he is known to do. But it would be two words that went unsaid that mattered most. No one told him to ""shut up!"" ",2008-07-25T18:43:15+0000

us,Paper Chase,"""Conservative provocateurs have been hunting for it,"" warns MSNBC's Domenic Montanaro.  ""Investigative journalists have been on the prowl, too. Even a former professor has been searching through old boxes for his copy of it. But today Barack Obama made it official: He doesn't have and can't release any copies of the thesis-length paper he wrote 25 years ago while a senior at Columbia University.""  Indeed, here's Jaime Sneider with dark murmurs at The Blog:   ""It's only natural to wonder what the budding socialist turned presidential candidate thought of nuclear proliferation in the early 1980s. The Obama campaign, proving every bit as secretive as the Office of the Vice President, has been less than forthcoming with details.""  Injecting a note of common sense is the Atlantic's Matt Yglesias.     When I was in college, I wrote a senior thesis. It was even, in a sense, on a politically relevant topic having to do with John Rawls' Political Liberalism. You might think that if you really wanted to understand what I thought about certain political issues you'd need to dig up that paper to gain some insights. But realistically, insofar as I can recall what the thesis said (I don't have a copy, but I believe it's in the university archives) it says stuff I don't believe anymore. If you really want to gain additional insights into what Matt Yglesias thinks about the issues, you should probably read my frequently updated blog.   Similarly, if you want to know what Barack Obama thinks about arms control you should listen to his speeches about arms control, look at his record in the United States Senate, and perhaps look at the stated views of some of his close associates on these matters. Just like the secret key to understanding John McCain's foreign policy views is to read the various major foreign policy speeches his given over his past ten years' worth of presidential campaigning and, again, look at the record and stated views of his associates. Journalists pride themselves on their sleuthing abilities -- trying to find new information and bring it into the public record -- but when you're talking about public officials the odds are that the most important information about their character and their policies is going to be the stuff that's already a matter of public record. An old college paper is just an old college paper.    In general, that's hard to dispute, although one can perhaps understand the lingering interest in this senior thesis  (and also why this one sits collecting dust in the same library).

us,Swimmer Feels Betrayed by the System,"(Photo: Tara Kirk was a 2004 Olympian in the 100 breaststroke and a silver medalist at last year's World Championships in the event. (Tony Avelar/Associated Press))   [Updated, 7:52 p.m.]  As the swimmer Jessica Hardy prepares for an arbitration hearing on a positive drug test with her berth on the 2008 Olympic team riding on the ruling, one of the women Hardy defeated at the United States Olympic trials sits in Ireland wondering if there is any justice.  Tara Kirk finished third in the 100-meter breaststroke, missing a berth to Beijing by 0.01 of a second. Hardy, the American-record holder in the event, was the winner. She also qualified in the 50 freestyle and the 400 freestyle and 400 medley relays, but one of her three post-race drug tests from the trials revealed the presence of the banned anabolic agent Clenbuterol.  Hardy, 21, was informed of the failed drug test Monday, which was also the deadline for national governing bodies to submit their rosters for the Beijing Games. Kirk, in an exchange of e-mail messages, said, ""I have confirmed that U.S.A. swimming knew about the positive drug test before the deadline to submit the names."" She declined to say who she spoke with.  If what Kirk was told is true, it raises the question of why U.S. Swimming did not submit the names of Kirk and Lara Jackson, who finished third in the 50 freestyle at trials, as alternates on its roster, to be summoned only if Hardy loses her appeal.   Hardy remains on the team, pending the results of her appeal next week to an American Arbitration Association panel.  ""I feel certain that someone along the way failed me and Lara,"" Kirk wrote.  Reached Friday, Mark Schubert, the U.S. national team director, said he could not answer questions or comment. ""The hearing process for the people involved must run its fair course,"" he responded by email.   Kirk said she phoned Schubert Thursday after her fianc read about Harding's failed drug test on the Internet.   ""He called back and said that they were following entry procedure,"" Kirk wrote, adding, ""I asked him to make an appeal to change the final roster and after a long and emotional plea, he agreed.""   Reached by telephone Friday, Darryl Seibel, a United States Olympic Committee spokesman, said Friday, ""I'm not aware of any procedure or provision by which an athlete can be added to the official roster in place of another athlete if that athlete is suspended because of a doping violation.""   Seibel said any questions pertaining to the composition of the U.S. swimming roster needed to be directed to Schubert. The U.S. team was traveling Friday from northern California, where it has been training for the past two-and-a-half weeks, to Singapore for another pre-Games camp. The swimming competition begins Aug. 9.   In California, the U.S. Olympic swim team was training at Stanford, where Kirk has practiced for the past eight years.   The 25-year-old Kirk, a 2004 Olympian in the 100 breaststroke and a silver medalist at last year's World Championships in the event, was devastated when she did not qualify for Beijing. It was going to be less a sporting event than a pilgrimage for Kirk, who had a grandfather who was born in China and a grandmother who was educated there.   The thought of staying at her home near the Stanford campus, and possibly bumping into members of the U.S. Olympic team that was headed to China without her, was more than Kirk could bear, she said. When friends with a cottage in Ireland, on Achill Island, offered it to Kirk and her fianc, she accepted, and has spent the past couple weeks hiking and healing.  ""I needed a place to get away to,"" Kirk wrote. She added, ""I couldn't deal with running into all those people who had had their dreams come true when mine lay so broken.""  Kirk swam one second slower than her personal best in the 100 breaststroke final at the trials, and so she blamed herself for not having made the team. In light of Hardy's failed drug test, ""the situation seems more gray,"" Kirk wrote.   As it is, Kirk's coach, Lea Maurer, has been told it is too late for any names to be added to the U.S. Olympic roster. If Hardy loses her appeal, Rebecca Soni, who made the team in the 200 breaststroke, will swim the 100 even though she finished one spot behind Kirk. And Kara Lynn Joyce, an alternate on the 400 freestyle relay, will compete in the 50.   ""That is much harder to take,"" Kirk wrote. She added, ""Now it seems that human judgment may have played a role in keeping me off the team. I feel betrayed by people who were supposed to do what was right.""   ",2008-07-25T19:08:04+0000

(Photo: Uli Seit for The New York Times)) Updated, 10:01 p.m. &#124; Seventeen people were reported injured -- two of them critically -- and scores of residents were evacuated after an explosion rocked an apartment building this afternoon in Flushing, Queens, the authorities reported.   The explosion occurred at 4:24 p.m. in a second-floor apartment in a six- or seven-story, 90-unit building at 147-25 Sanford Avenue. The second floor was engulfed in flames, while smoke billowed out of other floors. [Read an updated version of this article prepared for later editions.]  ""The explosion sounded as if a truck had fallen from the sky,"" said Jose Lazo, 49, who lives on Barclay Avenue, behind the building.   The Daily News reported earlier this month that residents had been without hot water and gas for nearly a month, following a small kitchen fire in one unit of the building. In protest, some residents had begun withholding rent payments to the building's owner, the Alwall Construction Corporation, The Daily News reported.   The Daily News quoted an Alwall official, Jeff Pace, attributing the blame for the delay in restoring gas to Consolidated Edison, saying that labor problems at the utility had held up the testing of a new gas line. But a spokesman for the utility said it was not responsible for any of the delays.   In the meantime, the Buildings Department had cited the landlord for failing to provide gas and hot water.  According to the Fire Department, the gas in the building had been turned off while maintenance work was done. After the gas was turned back on, an occupant in Apartment 2P turned on the stove, triggering the explosion. The fire rose to Apartment 3P, and blew up part of the floor, said Chief Robert Kubler. Five apartments on the second floor, and at least on the third floor, were damaged.   In the aftermath of the explosion, the Fire Department removed debris, covered in wet ash, from the building.   Late Friday evening, Fire Department officials said there was a partial collapse of interior walls, but no structural damage. Several apartments would remain shut for the night, they said.  ""We are very fortunate that more people weren't injured,"" said another fire chief, Robert Browne.   Fire officials said the building did not have fire-proofing, which would have protected the interior walls from damage. However, the explosion mostly affected the steel floor and wood beams, so fire-proofing would not have helped too much.   Councilman John C. Liu, who represents the neighborhood, said that the American Red Cross had set up a temporary overnight shelter directly across the street from the building, at Junior High School 189.   The building has been the site of an ongoing feud between residents -- who had lacked gas and hot water for several weeks -- and the landlord. Mr. Liu said in a statement:   After suffering for weeks with no hot water or gas, my constituents now find themselves having to live through an even worse nightmare where their relatives are sent to the hospital and homes literally blown apart. There is no more room for excusefull accountability must be established in this case. What a horrific way for my constituents to end the week.  Assemblywoman Ellen Young, a Queens Democrat who represents Flushing and is an ally of Mr. Liu, said in a statement:   This is a terrible example of bureaucratic neglect turned tragic. I am very concerned that the people affected by this blast not only had to live for weeks without hot water or gas, but that the inspection and testing of the gas lines were not done timely or properly. I would remind all contractors to hire only licensed technicians when performing such tests to ensure the public's safety.   Al Baker and Christine Hauser contributed reporting.

us,Whats So Funny About Nebraska?,"(Photo: Dick Cavett and Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show"" in an undated photo. (Courtesy of NBC))  Among my growing list of topics promised but not delivered was a report on a comedy festival I attended recently in Norfolk, Neb. (I got an award there, but let that pass.) At the risk of sounding curmudgeonly, attending anything that threatened a forced viewing of a lot of new and largely unknown standup comics would be low on my list of musts; down there between dedicating a statue of Spiro Agnew and a street sale of macram.  But this one, the Great American Comedy Festival, had good promise. Among the reasons for saying yes was that Robert Klein would be there and that these particular aspirants to the jesting trade had been expertly selected. Eddie Brill  himself a comic pro and hunter for talent for Dave Letterman's show  had combed the comic woods, scanning top comedy clubs around the United States for the best available and most promising talent. And he delivered it. Brill confesses that there is something a little silly in treating comedy as a contest, but it can be fun and nobody gets hurt.   (Parenthetically to the point of irrelevance, one of Bill Clinton's lesser legacies to us all has been to make it just about impossible for anyone in public life and in the media to say anything without prefacing it with the now reflexive phrase, ""Let me say this..."" Who's stopping you?!, I scream at the screen.)  Anyway, let me say this: John William Carson, born Oct. 23, 1925, in Corning, Iowa, continued his growing up in Norfolk, Neb., a town now famous for Johnny Carson. He died on another 23rd -- in January of 2005.  For years I wrote for Johnny, and as I moved on he remained a valued friend. I've never known why I have to convince skeptics of this fact.   When Carson was eight, the family moved to the diminutive metropolis of Norfolk. Smooth and gregarious on camera, Johnny was uneasy with most people. He wasn't with me and our enduring friendship had a lot to do with that.   He was suspicious of journalists and columnists, and their failure to get him to ""open up"" resulted in some bad press and the frequent label ""cold."" That military brace, ramrod-straight posture of his was lampooned by those who go by the silly, pretentious term ""impressionists."" (You know: Rich Little, Will Jordan, David Frye, Monet, Renoir...)  While still writing for John C. in days of yore, I survived saying about him on one of those well-produced Smith & Hemion ""Kraft Music Hall"" shows a joke that began, ""It's often said about Johnny that he has a ramrod up his...spine."" During the laugh, I glanced to the side to see if the eminent victim of the roast  and my former boss -- was at least smiling. He was.  It's hard to ""roast"" someone you really like, but our friendship survived the evening. People, including some on his staff, continued to treat me as a hallucinator with: ""You've actually been to Johnny's house? For dinner?"" It never stopped.  *****  ""Don't for God's sake ever repeat this to anyone or tell him I told you,"" said the gnomish little bald man in the Cinerama-wide plate-glass specs, ""at least while he and I are both alive."" The speaker, who was driving, was the legendary agent Irving ""Swifty"" Lazar. We were heading up whatever ""drive"" in Bel Air led to Swifty's house, a place that was really a mini-Louvre of priceless paintings, with Picasso one of the smaller names. In Swifty's case, there was major money in book-agenting such huge-selling volumes as Richard M. Nixon's memoirs -- humorously categorized under ""non-fiction.""  Swifty, driving in disconcerting Mr. Magoo style, delivered a thunderbolt.   ""Johnny is very fond of you, you know,"" he began. And after another ""top secret"" cautioning, he went on, ""I think you ought to know this. Johnny said to me once, 'Cavett's the only one who could beat me. If Dick hadn't been on a network with a short station line-up, he might have.'""  As comics say about such moments, ""When they brought me to...and then brought me two more....""  That Johnny had said this was so unexpected and so startling to me  and you don't need a degree in psychiatry to understand this  that I promptly forgot it. (Yes, it came back in due course and it still has voltage for me.)  By the way, none of this should be construed as an attempt to obscure Johnny's later, genuine enthusiasm for Dave Letterman's talents.  ""We wish you were on once a week,"" a member of the Carson staff said to me once. ""Johnny's a different man when you come on. He's even happy in the afternoon when he comes to work. And when you're out there with him, he actually leans back in his chair."" This touched me, and does now, remembering it.  *****  I was among the judges of the eight finalists in the comedy competition that night in Norfolk. It's the home, quite naturally, of a splendid Johnny Carson Museum, featuring an intriguing collection of photographs, some showing the pre-and post-pubescent lad with his beloved magic apparatus and that then-still-anonymous face that was to become, often painfully for its owner, instantly recognizable everywhere.  Each day of the festival -- it was the first held -- the local papers were splashed with publicity and articles about the hugely successful event. One newspaper had a big color picture of Johnny on the air, at his desk, looking amused by his guest (me) in the swivel chair beside him. I'd never seen the picture before. We both look young and happy and are clearly enjoying each other's company.   The place, a handsome and good-sized theater, was packed for the gala final night's show. There was a good, smart, sell-out audience of sharp local people and, onstage, excellent work by the young aspirants. At the end of the show, to my ear, both Bob Klein and I killed 'em. (The audience, not the aspirants.)  Klein and I reminisced over a western breakfast about what it was like ""being on"" with Johnny and how much pleasing him and making him laugh meant to a growing comic and his career. And, of course, to quite a few would-be pursuers of the comedy dream, a single smashing appearance with Johnny made a career.   Klein and I recalled how each time you found yourself standing anxiously behind that famous curtain with the vertical colored stripes, nerves would jangle almost audibly. At least a portion of your life flashed before your eyes.  Next, your pulse quickened a bit as you  alone and hidden -- heard the familiar voice say your name and, pushing that curtain aside, and taking one step into the bright lights -- you were in front of America. And Johnny.  I felt sort of sorry for those sharp young comics in Norfolk that they would never have the thrill (do we still say ""the rush""?) of meeting Johnny  the career-maker of the day  and making him laugh on the air.  Of all the appearances I did with him -- doubtless they are among that ton of Carson shows NBC so thoughtfully erased  I most remember one in California. He would always have me on the show whenever the latest incarnation of ""The Dick Cavett Show"" ... um ... completed its current tenure. Often on the following Monday and always with a version of the same joke in the monologue: ""Our good friend Dick Cavett is here tonight. Dick's had another show shot out from under him. [Laugh.] I'm always afraid that if the next one doesn't take, it's going to be Armed Forces Radio for Dick."" [Laugh with capital ""L.""]  On such a night I made Johnny laugh, but hard. I had been the first guest out  a huge honor  and so by the end, when it was time for goodnights, and having ""moved down"" with each new guest, I was the farthest down the couch, cheek to cheek with Ed McMahon.  With about a minute remaining, Johnny began asking each guest what was coming up for him. And each had a big movie, big Broadway show, big something to plug. I didn't. I hoped the clock would run out before my fellow Nebraskan got to me.  Every comic can report a few ""gift from the gods"" moments. Here came one. ""What are you doing, Richard?"" he asked with a kindly smile, and I sensed he knew I probably had nothing to brag about.  Then, a miracle bred of panic: I heard myself say, ""I'm working on an idea for a sitcom, Johnny. It's a humorous version of 'Gilligan's Island.'"" The reaction would have broken a laugh meter.  Several columnists quoted the line, but  since an ear for nuance is not mandatory for such employment  invariably misquoted it as ""a comedy version,"" thus karate-chopping away the line's finesse, if I may so say.  But the important thing was Johnny's reaction. He did that thing where he exploded with laughter that sent him sideways stage left off his chair. I felt like a stock market must feel going through the roof, or the space shuttle blasting off.  For a (comparative) youngster, still making his way in our cutthroat business, a lottery win would have paled by comparison. Oh, how I'd love to have a tape of that moment to wear out in repeated viewings.  *****  Well, our hour is about up. Maybe next time we might explore why, despite all this, anybody in his right mind would want to be a comedian. ",2008-07-25T23:17:34+0000

""I think it's a pretty good timetable,"" Mr. McCain said Friday in an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room,'' before adding that it should be based ""on the conditions on the ground.''   For months Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has railed against setting timetables for withdrawing from Iraq, and has criticized Mr. Obama, his Democratic rival, for suggesting one. But in recent days the debate has shifted as Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, moved closer to Mr. Obama's position.   In the interview on CNN Mr. McCain first seemed to downplay any possibility that Mr. Maliki would actually ask for the United States to withdraw its troops in the next 16 months to two years. ""He won't,'' he said, explaining that he knows Mr. Maliki well.   Then, asked why he thinks Mr. Maliki had called 16 months a pretty good timetable, Mr. McCain gave his enigmatic answer.   ""He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground,'' Mr. McCain said. ""I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should -- or horizons for withdrawal. But they have to be based on conditions on the ground. This success is very fragile. It's incredibly impressive, but very fragile. So we know, those of us who have been involved in it for many years, know that if we reverse this, by setting a date for withdrawal, all of the hard-won victory can be reversed.''  Democrats exulted, sending around the statement to reporters to suggest he was coming around to Mr. Obama's way of thinking. The McCain campaign did not explain the timetable remark, but said that Mr. McCain's position remained that he wants the troops to withdraw based on conditions on the ground.

us,The House That Her Grandpa Built,"COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- She has a familiar face. A Ruthian mug, with a miniature version of that famous wide-set nose.   Linda Ruth Tosetti, Babe Ruth's 53-year-old granddaughter, who also possesses her grandfather's legendary garrulousness, was in Cooperstown on Friday strolling through the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown with her husband, Andy.   But more than 200 miles from the Bronx, she had Yankee Stadium on her mind. She was wondering why, in the final year of the old ballpark -- the House that Her Grandfather Famously Built -- the Yankees have not announced any plans to honor him.  ""I'd just like them to do something,"" she said. ""Look at what the Mets did naming the rotunda of their new stadium for Jackie Robinson,"" she said. ""What have the Yankees done? It's like they're forgetting their history."" She wonders why Babe Ruth Plaza, outside the old stadium, looks so shabby.  She said she has written to Hank Steinbrenner, Brian Cashman and Jason Zillo, the team's lead spokesman, but has heard nothing from them. She toured the stadium in February, believing it to be her last visit before it is razed. ""I got all teared up,"" she said.  Zillo said that last month, Ruth's only surviving daughter, Julie Ruth Stevens, and her family, were at the stadium to present the Babe Ruth Award to Alex Rodriguez. As for anything formal to honor Ruth before the end of this season, Zillo said he wasn't sure what the team's plans are.  Tosetti said that a new documentary about Ruth is being produced and will focus on his charity toward children and to poor people in St. Petersburg, Fla. Along the way, she said, she has learned from autopsy records examined by two surgeons and a dentist that her grandfather did not die of throat cancer but from nasopharyngeal cancer, which starts in the back of the nose, and is most common among Asians. The raspiness heard in his voice in his final years, she said, probably stemmed from damage to his larynx caused by a tumor behind the left side of his face.  She joked that she is learning so much new information about her grandfather through the documentary -- and the campaign to have Ruth's No. 3 symbolically retired throughout M.L.B. -- that before she takes her last breath, ""Someone will say, ""Linda, did you know your grandfather . ?""

MillerPutnam Valley, N.Y., July 13, 2008  Ive been thinking a lot about your column. What I cant accept  in your column and in Times policy generally  is the failure to distinguish between using unfit language and reporting on it.You write as if it would be the same thing for you or a columnist to offer an opinion in unfit language as for a Times writer to report in the third person what a public figure has said that includes accurately quoted unfit language.Surely this is a fundamental journalistic distinction. If there is an argument for ignoring that distinction in this sort of case, the argument needs to be made.The classroom-breakfast table issue is not an argument, if it even is an issue  dont you think most parents and teachers also distinguish between using bad language and speaking seriously about someone elses use of it?Bill Kellers statement about being reluctant to lead the charge to a coarser public discourse is a silly overstatement. The policy has the effect common to most fig leaves, visual and rhetorical, inspiring people to peek underneath, in these cases at other sources of information.Toni H. OlivieroBrooklyn, July 24, 2008The writer is dean of liberal arts and sciences, Pratt Institute.  Putting aside the action that the Rev. Jesse Jackson described, why is the word in question dirty and other words describing the identical part of the anatomy, testicles or gonads, not dirty? Why is this particular word dirty when used in one context, but not others?After all, the group of letters considered dirty, when used as Mr. Jackson used them, are beyond reproach when used to name those small shelled fruit or seeds we gobble down with our beers, or that mad, eccentric character who hangs out at the street corner, or that small, usually square or hexagonal flat piece of metal or word, with a hole through it for screwing onto a bolt.What is there exactly that makes this word, a grouping of four perfectly neutral letters, dirty?Ronald RubinTopanga, Calif., July 14, 2008  You do a fine job of fence-sitting on the issue of reporting offensive speech.I propose two simple rules:Keep it clean (the present well-intentioned Times policy).Dont bowdlerize.If you cant say what they said, dont even say they said it. If its too important to ignore, its too important to censor.When the language is the story, you must report the language.Wittgenstein said it best: What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.Kim de RielHavertown, Pa., July 14, 2008  The decision of The Times not to directly quote the Rev. Jesse Jacksons offensive words raises the question: Why not use the technical term castration to indicate what he really said about Senator Barack Obama, as you say The Washington Post did?By removing that specific information from Mr. Jacksons statement, The Times missed the sad irony that one form of physical assault inflicted by lynch mobs on African-American men was castration. Viewed in its full context, the statement demonstrates how badly out of touch Mr. Jackson is with many in the black community (including me, an African-American who participated in the civil rights movement and who worked in his 1988 presidential primary campaign).John Brown ChildsSanta Cruz, Calif., July 14, 2008The writer is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  How about letting your grammar slip, and your spelling, to accord with common usage? Would the critical public similarly expect The Times to slide with the times? I think not.It is only where matters of a onetime prudish sensitivity are concerned, and it is only to justify their own such indulgence.But I just want to say that Im with you on where you arrive with it. I dont see The Times as lagging behind current taste, but as upholding the long-standing standard of propriety.Irv ThomasSeattle, July 13, 2008  I hope you will soon write a column about oral and written language. Except for a brief nod to literature and the Internet, all the examples you provide are from oral language (talk, rappers, rock bands, stage, screen, television), and then you extend those examples to written discourse. But oral language is not the same as written language. I have no idea if the medium is the message, but the medium certainly affects the message and audience.Its not a matter of being so prissy were out of touch or standards. Its a matter of accuracy and clarity, while appreciating and understanding the power and relationship between oral and written language and our humanity.Allen BergerSavannah, Ga., July 13, 2008The writer is emeritus professor of reading and writing at Miami University.  One of the reasons given for why The Times doesnt use dirty words whereas The New Yorker does is because The New Yorker is not delivered to middle- and high-school classrooms as 40,000 daily copies of The Times are.Perhaps if The Times did use dirty words, it would be delivering more than 40,000 daily copies. At least the 30,000 unread or barely skimmed copies would be scanned with more interest.Perhaps Id even start believing whats written in it again.Alex DeringPrinceton, N.J., July 14, 2008  I enjoyed your column about the editorial squeamishness regarding reporting the Rev. Jesse Jacksons wish to separate Barack Obama from his testicles.A coven of prudish (old maid) librarians indeed.Do Times (and other) editors really believe that children of an age to read The Times, at this point nearly a decade into a new and increasingly ill-spoken century, arent aware of most of the four-letter Anglo-Saxon adjectives bandied about so freely?To me, its just another example of editorial self-righteousness. In a 43-year career at The Baltimore Sun, they provided me with an abundance of giggles as the editors struggled with euphemspeak  how to report something without actually reporting it. (And they dont want quotes cleaned up! Yuk, yuk!)Robert A. ErlandsonTowson, Md., July 15, 2008  The papers writers and editors do not have to, and likely should not, write such vulgarities  except when such words are pertinent to the story. And in this case, the editors Paul Winfield and Chuck Strum seem to have lost their news sense. The man said it!What was newsworthy was the context and the entire quotation: the Rev. Jesse Jackson using Barack Obamas first name, leaning in sotto voce so that it appeared that Dr. Reed V. Tuckson had to struggle to hear him. Dr. Tucksons attempt to be polite and respectful while awkwardly, it seems to me, hiding shock behind outward stoicism. Mr. Jacksons making the talking down to black people comment, pausing, pulling away, leaning in again and making the nuts comment. And Mr. Jacksons settling back, pausing again, then making the violent gesture.By the end of it all Jackson seemed to be talking to himself rather than to Dr. Tuckson.I say all this having interviewed both gentlemen more than once when I was at United Press International and The Washington Post more than 20 years ago, and in Dr. Tucksons case, having shared a long, nonworking conversation during an airplane flight.The full quotation put in context would demonstrate all and more of what Mr. Winfield and Mr. Strum saw as being most newsworthy: the generational divide in political black leadership, the bitterness and palpable anger, the class-elitism issue, the simultaneous rejection and embrace of homogeneity. It is all there, and more. It is not all there when you leave out the nuts line. The Times editors neglected to consider the intelligence of their readers and the ability of those readers to process all of the pertinent information.So, Im with my former somewhat-of-a-colleague David Remnick at The New Yorker. The Times, The Washington Post and the few crumbs that are left of my hometown Baltimore Sun need to loosen the reins.Doug StevensonBaltimore, July 17, 2008  I was appalled that The Times thinks it is ever all right not to give an exact quote of what someone said. The paper cannot possibly have editorial standards that deem something important enough to print and not relate the words.What would the possible importance be of a quote that cannot be given? We use words to communicate. Adults use blue words to communicate among themselves.Maybe if The Times always used exact language we would avoid more bubbles and recessions, and enough people might understand in advance of disaster and change behavior. Its possible.Stephen J. BoyleJersey City, July 14, 2008  When a public figure uses a dirty word, and its central to the story, The Times has a duty to publish the quote. Otherwise, The Times is just not reporting the news. Citizens have a right to know what these public figures actually said because its germane to our judgment of their character.Should The Times include audio or video clips of these incidents? No, leave that to the tabloids.Should The Times worry about these words showing up in their school circulation? Todays middle and high school kids know and use vulgar and dirty language all the time.I used to teach high school. If The Times had added a line, Caution: coarse language, or something like that to clue me in, I would have used the article to open a discussion with my class about the quote, and about when language like that is appropriate and when its not.Herbert N. Swearengen IIIBlytheville, Ariz., July 13, 2008  When a public figure uses profanity or other demeaning language, the failure to quote him precisely is to falsify the portrait of the speaker.The essence of reporting is to provide the reader with a complete picture of the event. That includes the character of the participants. That means telling the reader what the speaker really is, not want he wants the public to see him to be.In other words, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has a very low, crass opinion of Barack Obama. Mr. Jackson needs to be seen that way, not another.Elihu I. RoseLake Success, N.Y., July 13, 2008  This Times policy serves only its own image, not the larger public civility it claims to be protecting. When a story prints, Cheney to senator: **** off (or however the obscenity is disguised), few readers will not supply the missing word.A basic principle of linguistics: if you have a word in mind and display some symbols to your audience so that the audience realizes what you meant to write, then you have communicated the word to them. Not actually printing the missing letters is a trick to give the illusion of civility, while allowing the unprintable language to be communicated just as clearly as if it were spelled out.This fussy preservation of the appearance of civility amounts to hypocrisy.Charles J. SmithBuffalo, July 13, 2008  So why not draw the line between quoting those who use the bad words and Times writers using them in their own writing?I have been so infuriated by the news media (especially radio and TV) talking to our own soldiers, the heroes people like to point to, and then bleeping what they say.Soldiers have always had foul mouths, and what theyre talking about is inherently offensive. People use offensive language, and they often use it for a very good reason. Let them.David BeanArlington, Mass., July 13, 2008 Please allow me to point out that cut off his nuts is not the same as castrate. Almost all Times editors and readers should know this well. It is an informal expression used almost exclusively in spoken English that is taken to be extreme hyperbole by both speaker and listener.The Rev. Jesse Jackson has no desire to castrate Barack Obama; even to joke about it is absurd. It is an emphatic expression used to express the depth of the speakers anger or outrage.It is also metaphorical, suggesting something like, Id really like to do something strong enough to get Barack Obama to pay attention and listen to what some of us are trying to tell him.By mistakenly treating Mr. Jacksons compressed, metaphorical expression as if it were literal, the Times did a disservice to readers and to Mr. Jackson by making the story confusing and shredding the coherence of what Mr. Jackson was trying to say.Wouldnt it be possible for The Times to simply use asterisks for offensive words? That would preserve the context of the remarks and not assign added meaning to them.As for potty, I find it more offensive than nuts, because it treats readers as if they were children.Chris DrakeHatoyama-machi, Japan, July 13, 2008 Re Weighing the Risk (July 6, 2008): A question you didnt raise is, Why does The New York Times publish the name of a nontorturing C.I.A. interrogator and not publish the names of those whove actually tortured people? Was it because it was easier to get Deuce Martinezs name?It seems to me that the real issue is that The Times, once again, is taking the easy route on digging deeper.Christopher CookPrague, July 6, 2008  In May, you defended The Timess practice of withholding the names of reporters reporting from Zimbabwe and Myanmar. Risk, you know. But now you defend The Timess disclosing of the name of the interrogator of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. The peoples right to know, you know.But the real basis for decisions whether to disclose is clear: Will it harm the Bush war effort (if it will, yes; if it wont no)?You say that the Times has sometimes agreed, sometimes refused to withhold information when asked to do so by the C.I.A. Why dont you give readers some depth and disclose how many times it has agreed and refused since Iraq was invaded?Steven K. CochranDallas, July 7, 2008",2008-07-26T05:51:45+0000

us,"McCain, Obama Trade Barbs Across the Seas","(Photo: Senator Barack Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown walk on the Horse Guards Parade in London. (Pool photo by Peter MacDiarmid)) LONDON  Senators John McCain and Barack Obama engaged in a trans-Atlantic bickering match of sorts on Saturday, with Mr. McCain devoting the opening minutes of his weekly radio address to criticize Mr. Obama's weeklong trip through the Middle East and Europe.  ""This week, the presidential contest was a long-distance affair, with my opponent touring various continents and arriving yesterday in Paris,"" Mr. McCain said. ""With all the breathless coverage from abroad, and with Senator Obama now addressing his speeches to the people of the world, I'm starting to feel a little left out. Maybe you are too.""  Mr. Obama, who spoke to reporters after finishing a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, dismissed the criticism. He noted that Mr. McCain also had traveled to the Middle East and Europe  and beyond  since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee.  ""It is hard for me to understand Senator McCain's argument,"" Mr. Obama said, standing in front of No. 10 Downing Street. ""He was telling me I was supposed to take this trip. He suggested it and thought it was a good idea.""  London was the final destination on Mr. Obama's foreign tour that began in Iraq and Afghanistan last weekend. He held a final round of meetings here on Saturday, sharing breakfast with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, holding an hourlong talk with opposition leader David Cameron and going for an outdoor stroll with Mr. Brown.  ""We've been through two world wars together. We speak a common language. We share a belief in rule of law and due process,"" Mr. Obama said, explaining the relationship between the two countries. ""We just like the people. There is a deep and abiding affection for the British people in America and a fascination with all things British that's not going to go away any time soon.""  With that, Mr. Obama's foreign trip is nearly complete. By nightfall, he is scheduled to take off for Chicago. ",2008-07-26T14:05:39+0000

us,Track Athletes in the Final Stretch,"With the Olympics two weeks away, track and field athletes are getting their last tune-ups in before the Beijing Games.  For those in New York City early Sunday morning, the NYC Half-Marathon will include Olympians Dathan Ritzenheim of the United States, Hendrik Ramaala of South Africa, Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, and Madai Perez of Mexico. The race begins at 7 a.m. and a map of the course for spectators is available here. The event is particularly important for Ritzenhein, who qualified for the Olympic marathon but was sidelined this spring because of a a stress fracture in his left foot. He returned to competition earlier this month.  At the London Grand Prix, one of the last pre-Olympic meets, Asafa Powell continued his strong week, although his publicized duel in the 100 meters with Tyson Gay never materialized. On Tuesday, Powell beat the world record holder Usain Bolt in Stockholm. Friday in London, Powell won again. But Gay had pulled out of the race to nurse his ailing hamstring. Powell is scheduled to compete next week in Monaco as well.     Bolt did not compete in the 100 at Crystal Palace, but dominated the 200 on Saturday, winning in 19.76 ahead of the American Wallace Spearmon's 20.27. Bolt still has not decided whether he will run in both the 100 and the 200 in Beijing. ""I'd definitely like to double,"" he said. ""I think I could do well in both."" That's a bit of an understatement.  In addition to a rare loss by Bernard Lagat in the 1,500, Allyson Felix had a surprising fourth-place finish in the 200 meters on Friday night. Sherone Simpson won the race, saying afterward, ""To get a win so close to the Olympics is very good psychologically."" Felix pulled out of the 100 on Saturday.   MEN'S BASKETBALL The United States men's basketball team won its first pre-Olympic exhibition, 120-65, over Canada on Friday night in Las Vegas. Dwyane Wade, in his first game action in four months, scored 20 points playing in place of the injured LeBron James. Carmelo Anthony and Michael Redd also had 20 points against the Canadians, who did not qualify for the Olympics. The Americans shot 65 percent from the field, with Redd doing what he was put on the team to do, making 6 of 8 3-point attempts.  The point guard play was interesting to follow. Jason Kidd started the game, played 16 minutes and didn't attempt a shot. He had five rebounds but no assists. Deron Williams and Chris Paul would seem to be in competition for the No. 2 point guard spot, but Coach Mike Krzyzewski put them into the game together in the first quarter. Williams finished with 14 points and 5 assists, while Paul had 11 points and 8 assists.   ""When these two guys are in together, either one of them can bring the ball up and either one of them can pressure the ball,"" Krzyzewski explained. ""They seem to like to play with one another. The intelligence of your team is at the highest level when you have two guys like them on the court at the same time. I was telling them that needs to be a strength of our team when the two of them are in together -- we can pickup a little bit better and try to wear some people down.""  Krzyzewski was particularly impressed with the team's defense, which forced 24 turnovers."" I like the effort we have on the defensive end of the court and after the first 10 minutes, that's the first game we played, we just seemed like we were in synch, we were passing the ball more, and playing much better defense the last three quarters,"" he said.  Chris Sheridan of ESPN.com charted each defensive possession and was impressed with Team USA's pressure, but still sees holes in the pick-and-roll defense. In Sporting News Today, Mike DeCourcy writes that despite the 55-point win, the game still showed in the importance of James.  Video of the postgame news conference is available at nba.com.  Team USA now heads to China, where it will play four more exhibition games before the Olympic tournament. ",2008-07-26T18:05:57+0000

But Susan Neimans previous book on ethics, Evil in Modern Thought, was widely and favorably reviewed, and the present work is a worthy successor. Neimans particular skill lies in expressing sensitivity, intelligence and moral seriousness without any hint of oversimplification, dogmatism or misplaced piety. She clearly and unflinchingly sees life as it is, but also sees how it might be, and could be, if we recaptured some of the hopes and ideals that currently escape us. ",2008-07-27T04:00:00+0000

us,Inside the List,"POPULAR NOTIONS: Larry McMurtry, whose new memoir, Books, is reviewed in this issue by James Campbell, had his first novel, Horseman, Pass By, published in 1961. It quickly jumped to the screen as Hud, the Paul Newman movie. McMurtrys next two novels were also turned into films  Leaving Cheyenne (1963) became Lovin Molly and The Last Picture Show (1966) became, well, The Last Picture Show. For all of McMurtrys critical and filmic success, including the publication of Terms of Endearment in 1975, he didnt place a book on the Times best-seller list until 1985, when the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Lonesome Dove had a 24-week run in hardcover and inspired a much-admired mini-series. Since then, his novels have appeared here frequently. Reviewing McMurtrys first novel in the Book Review in 1961, the journalist Wayne Gard spotted his talent. Some popular notions of life on a Texas cattle ranch are exploded in this short, realistic novel, Gard wrote. The cow hands ride horses less often than pickup trucks or Cadillacs. And in the evening, instead of sitting around a campfire strumming guitars and singing Git along, little dogie, they are more likely to have a game at the pool hall, drink beer and try their charms on any girls they can find. ... Larry McMurtry has not only a sharp ear for dialogue but a gift of expression that easily could blossom in more important works.",2008-07-27T04:00:00+0000

The best source? Vats in the back at Chinese restaurants. Weve found a lot of really great grease, says Addie Gorlin, a sophomore majoring in geography and history. The mission is to proselytize about alternative fuel, exchange ideas with local leaders and show off their mobile museum of sustainable living. The 12 students stop at zoo parking lots, pull up at block parties and hang out at state parks (this weekend, theyre in Rainier, Wash.). The clunker of a bus, retrofitted by students, has five 200-watt solar panels, thanks to sponsors, that power the essentials: television, stereo, refrigerator and laptops for daily blogging. The first Big Green Bus tour was organized in 2005 by a pack of Dartmouth ultimate Frisbee players, borrowing the symbolism from Middlebury, whose Project Bio Bus had circumnavigated the year before. Andrew Zabel, a senior majoring in government, is one of this years Big Green Bus organizers. Sixty students applied for the trip. We dont choose based on being an expert, Mr. Zabel says. Its a vehicle for creating an environmentalist  a theater major, a history major, wherever you go in life, to do it through that green lens. ",2008-07-27T04:00:00+0000

A development of pink-stucco villas was encroaching on some old farms. It was a Friday morning in early May, two days before the Turkish Grand Prix. At the security checkpoint, my driver, Suleyman, slapped my press credentials against the windshield, and the armed guards hurriedly waved us past, and we rolled down to the entrance. Istanbul Park opened three years ago. To everyone other than the Formula One teams and the attendant pack of journalists, it is an incongruous aspect of the tracks festive design that the 25,000-seat grandstand is rarely full. But the teams dont much care about full grandstands, not when as many as 80 million people watch the race on television. All Formula One needs is a country willing to spend about $150 million to build a state-of-the-art track. Besides, it is a well-known fact in the paddock, the enclave where the teams set up their deluxe motor homes for the five days of a race, that Istanbul Park has been a wash for the Turkish government. Last year, it leased the facility to Bernie Ecclestone, the London businessman whose firm owns the commercial rights to Formula One, including television rights, and disburses the revenues to the teams according to a system he created three decades ago. You could point to the grand prix venues that have popped up in the past few years  in Shanghai, Bahrain, Singapore  and conclude that a glamorous European sport fits the ambitions of these countries, along with towering new skyscrapers and designer hotels. But this gets it only partly right. Formula One needs these new markets so it can make more money, and a country, whatever else it may be, is a market. ",2008-07-27T04:00:00+0000

us,German Athletes Have T-Shirt Choice,"Germany and its athletes have been among the more outspoken Olympic participants when it comes to human rights in China.   Chancellor Angela Merkel has taken a hard line on China, saying that she will not attend the opening ceremony. (The former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder is going, reflecting two different approaches to China.) A group of German athletes designed and promoted wristbands that say Sports for Human Rights, with proceeds going to Amnesty International. Yvonne Bnisch, who won a gold medal in judo in 2004, has said she will boycott the opening ceremony to protest human rights violations in Tibet. German businesses even got into the act. The chief executive of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, speaking at a shareholders' meeting in April, urged China to ""open up their society."" Volkswagen was the first foreign automaker to enter the Chinese market and is a sponsor of the Beijing Games.  So perhaps it should come as no surprise that at a send-off for the German Olympic team Saturday, the German Olympic Sports Confederation was presented with T-shirts with slogans like ""Fair Games,"" ""Sport for Human Rights,"" ""Celebrate Humanity,"" ""Free Tibet"" and ""Free China."" According to Agence France-Presse, the T-shirts were given by a group of former German athletes, including Dieter Baumann, who won the 5,000 meters at the Barcelona Games in 1992, and the sprinter Ines Geipel. The shirts will be available to wear at the German House in Beijing, which has been set up by the federation for its athletes, their guests and news conferences.   ""We do not want to tell athletes how to behave, but perhaps some of them will wear them in the German House, which has ex-territorial status, to show how they feel,"" Geipel said.   Germany was among the countries that asked the I.O.C. for clarification on the Olympic Charter's rules on political displays. In an memo released this spring, the International Olympic Committee prohibited athletes competing in the Beijing Games from making political statements in Olympic areas. In particular, the memo stated:   Rule 51.3 of the Olympic Charter provides that ""no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas"". For the purpose of these guidelines, these areas are defined as every area for which an official Olympic accreditation is required. Compliance with this Rule implies avoiding the display of any sign, banner, poster, piece of equipment or clothing which could be perceived as any kind of demonstration or propaganda.  In rejecting calls for an Olympic boycott in March, the German Olympic Sport Confederation released a statement that described the human rights situation in China as unsatisfactory. That statement also said: ""Sport is not a suitable tool to be used to apply political pressure. Sport is not in a position to solve the problems that neither the United Nations nor individual nations were able to resolve despite decades of effort. ... We believe sport is there to promote dialogue and international understanding. Sport builds bridges, not walls.""   ",2008-07-27T14:47:18+0000

us,Lab Ready for Sex Tests for Female Athletes,"Beijing Olympics organizers have set up a gender determination lab to test female athletes suspected to be males, China's state media reported Sunday.  Experts at the lab, located at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, will evaluate cases based on their external appearance and take blood samples to test hormones, genes and chromosomes, said Prof. Tian Qinjie of the college hospital, according to the Xinhua news agency.  Gender verification tests emerged in the 1960s when Communist countries in Eastern Europe were thought to be using male athletes in women's competitions. The tests were used at the Olympics for the first time at the 1968 Mexico City Games.  The concept has drawn criticism over the years, largely because certain chromosomal abnormalities may cause a woman to fail a test, even though it gives her no competitive advantage. Also, if a female athlete fails a test she must have a physiological examination, which many consider invasive and a privacy violation.   The ethical implications of the test and the notion of reducing female athletes to their sex chromosomes led to the International Olympic Committee's decision in 1999 to stop requiring chromosome tests for every female Olympian; now the organizing body has the authority to arrange for gender verification if it is called into question.   At the 1996 Atlanta Games, eight athletes failed the tests but were all cleared by subsequent examinations. Santhi Soundarajan, a middle-distance runner from India, was stripped of an Asian Games silver medal in 2006 after failing a gender verification test.   What do you think? Is the possibility of male athletes posing as women in the Olympics great enough to warrant such testing? Or are these tests inappropriate? ",2008-07-27T18:43:50+0000

(Credit: Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times)) I can't keep track of what young people are being called these days after a string of ""Generation [ ]"" labels. But my vote would be Generation E, for energy and the environment, if initiatives at a host of schools around the United States are any indication. I've heard more than a few sociologists and historians opine that we're essentially going to have to grow past our fossil fuel norms and into a new relationship with energy in which environmental considerations are integrated seamlessly into how people make choices related to energy. Maybe this is starting to happen among those who will inherit the consequences of energy decisions being made (or not made) today?  The latest Education Life section of The Times provides a great tour of energy-related actions in academia, from the sustainability curriculum at the newest campus in the State University of New York system, Stony Brook Southhampton, to seven examples of environmental initiatives at schools around the country.  There's plenty going on in secondary schools such as the Common Ground magnet high school in New Haven, and, as I wrote a few days ago, around Kansas City, where ever fewer school buses and cars are idling as they wait to pick up kids.   I still think it would be great if there were a way to harness existing school sports networks -- like football districts -- to create inter-school energy competitions aimed at cutting heating and electricity bills, and related pollution. There's a ""Blueprint for a Green School"" online.   What are your kids, schools, or communities up to on this front? ",2008-07-27T20:39:40+0000

us,Travel Narrows,"Most of us are good at a few things and bad at a longer list of other things. I am a bad traveler and I wonder if others share my infirmity.   In the past couple of months I have taken two trips, one to New Zealand and another to England and Ireland. Both were the result of invitations to give a talk or participate in a conference, but in each case there was ample time left over to do the things that travelers do.   I tried, but I just couldn't get the hang of it.  The manifestations of my incapacity were physical, although its root causes were not. In the course of a week's touring of Ireland, all my usual little ills returned -- mouth sores, intestinal difficulties (a euphemism), clogged nasal passages, and what one might call ""strategic fatigue."" Strategic fatigue sets in whenever I enter a museum (when I saw that the display case containing the Book of Kells was surrounded by other tourists I didn't have the strength to push myself forward) or when I approach an ancient site (at Clonmacnoise, the location of an ancient abbey, I retreated immediately to the coffee shop and never saw the ruin) or when the possibility of getting out of the car to enjoy a scenic view presented itself (I protested that it would take too much time, or that we needed gas, or something equally feeble).   The one time I tried to be a good sport and a good tourist was at Carrowmore Megalithic Cemetery in Sligo, which, as far as I could tell, consisted of clumps of small rocks placed at inconvenient distances from one another. These rocks were, I was told, tombs and significant stone circles. It was lost on me, but I dutifully trudged around a large circle taking pictures. The reward for my efforts was the discovery later in the day that, sometime during our exercise in archaeological reverence, a backpack containing my wife's clothing and jewelry had been stolen from our rental car. That'll teach me!  It was the fact that my wife was with me on this trip that alerted me to the extent of my problem. She was supposed to have accompanied me to New Zealand, but couldn't make it at the last moment. I attributed my inability fully to respond to the considerable glories of New Zealand to her absence. Had she been here, I told myself, I could have fed off her enthusiasm and taken pleasure from her pleasure. But in Ireland both her enthusiasm and her sense of pleasure were abundantly visible and still I couldn't do much more than go through the motions. It's not that I didn't recognize the beauty of the landscape or the majesty of the monuments. I couldn't rise to the level of appreciation they deserved.  Why not? What's wrong with me? There are two answers to these questions. First, I just don't care about seeing sights. In London, I ended up at Milton's burial place by accident. I was there for a concert. Churches, famous squares, wide rivers, forests, cobbled streets, scenic vistas, castles, grand gardens . . . I go Spiro Agnew one better: when I've seen one, I've seen one too many.  But behind the lack of interest in sightseeing is something deeper and more unsettling. When I ask people what they like about traveling, they usually answer, I enjoy encountering different cultures and seeing how other people live. I am perfectly happy with the fact of other cultures, and I certainly hope that those who inhabit them live well; but that's as far as it goes.   By definition, a culture other than yours is one that displays unfamiliar practices, enforces local protocols and insists on its own decorums. Some of them even have different languages and are unhappy if you don't speak them. To me that all spells discomfort, and I don't see why I should endure the indignities of airplane travel only to be made uncomfortable once I get where I'm going. As for seeing how other people live, that's their business, not mine.  For a while, I tried to attach my feelings about travel to some honorable moral or intellectual tradition. I recalled some poems by Ben Jonson in which he praises Sir John Roe for the Roman virtue of being always the same no matter how extensively he traveled (""his often change of clime, though not of mind."") But I had to acknowledge that the springs of my own sensibilities had more to do with parochialism and sloth than with some noble capaciousness of mind. In the end, I just have to admit that I was born without the travel gene, which probably means that I was also born without the curiosity gene, and that I'll just have to live with it.   Or, rather, my wife will.  Stanley Fish responds to readers' comments.  ",2008-07-27T21:38:44+0000

The show, about a boy who, after his parents divorce, must move from New York City to Indiana and try to get in with the cool kids, features a book by the childrens author and songwriter Dan Elish (Born Too Short, Confessions of an Eighth-Grade Basket Case) and Robert Horn (Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance). The musical 13 was first presented at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles almost two years ago. More recently, after significant rewrites, it played at the Norma Terris Theater in Chester, Conn.

us,The Cadillac of Walkers,"(Photo: Stephanie Mead, 87, resident at the Atria senior home in Connecticut, with a state-of-the-art walker. (James Estrin/The New York Times))   More than a dozen years ago, my late mother was considered a fashionista among the limited mobility set because her walker was customized with tennis balls on its back legs. The fuzzy yellow balls, scored with a utility knife for a snug fit, were intended to work rather like shock absorbers, smoothing her ride and eliminating the annoying tap-tap-tap of the walker's legs hitting the floor. She carried her possessions in a wicker basket secured to the handlebars with shoe laces.   (Photo: The walking cane, tricked out and individualized. (James Estrin/The New York Times))   Today, such a walker would mark my mother as a nerd, a penny-pincher or, worse yet, someone whose neglectful children had failed to provide her with the next new thing. Spend some time at an assisted living community these days and it's clear that the Cadillac of walkers -- will our generation call them the BMWs of walkers? -- is no longer a jury-rigged contraption of found objects, but rather a ""rollator,"" a ""rolling walker"" or a ""walker with a seat.""  There are many brands -- I claim no expertise and welcome reviews from those who do. But all have more or less the same features. Most important is a seat that folds down, permitting longer excursions with time-outs whenever mom or dad needs a rest. Some of the seats even have hidden storage compartments, like old-fashioned piano benches. (What's inside? Eyeglasses. Romance novels. Oranges. Lottery tickets. Keys. Large-print ""Reader's Digests."")   The handlebar is padded for arthritic hands, and there are hand brakes to lock the wheels in place when sitting down. While walkers have rotating wheels only on the front legs, these newfangled beauties, in metallic blue or English racing green, have four wheels that pivot, making it possible to walk on rough sidewalks or grass -- an off-road experience. Accessories include cup holders, food trays and an array of storage pouches.   (Photo: Residents of Atria Senior Home in Stratford, Conn., with the latest in mobility devices. (James Estrin/The New York Times))   Prices are reasonable: as little as $85 for a Costco Web site special, or as much as $275 for a model that will support a 400-pounder.

us,Congress Confronts Final Week of Work,"WASHINGTON  It's the last week before the long summer recess, but Congress is hardly all sunshine and smiles as it tries to wrap up some major business before the August break.   In both the House and the Senate, lawmakers are engaged in an increasingly bitter fight over how to address the high price of gasoline  a recognition that some very unhappy constituents are waiting for them back home in a major election year.  ""A member just has to go home to know what is the No. 1 economic issue in a country where people are concerned right now about what to do about the economy,"" said Representative Roy Blunt, of Missouri, the No. 2 Republican.  Chances of a deal on energy policy, however, are slim.  And even as lawmakers seem ready to clash until the last boarding call for the last flight home, the focus has already shifted in many ways to the presidential race  a point underscored by Senator Barack Obama's planned visit with House Democrats on Tuesday.  Still, with fall politics driving the debate, House Democrats will push forward this week with a bill intended to curb speculation in the oil-futures market. Republicans continue to press their demands for lifting a ban an off-shore oil drilling and for vastly increasing domestic energy production.  And the Democrats continue to push back, saying oil companies should drill on existing leases of federal land and that the focus should be on alternatives to fossil fuels.   ""Our position is that we ought to drill, we ought to drill where we've given leases that exist,"" the majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said. ""We really do believe that we ought to drill, we ought to drill now and we ought to drill where there is not controversy and where we do have leases.""  In the Senate, the fight over energy policy raged through the weekend. Democrats hoping to muscle their way past the stalemate sought to take up a bill that would nearly double federal spending on home energy subsidies this year, with an increase of $2.5 billion in assistance. Republicans blocked that effort, insisting on keeping a bill on oil speculation on the floor so that they could continue a broader debate about energy policy.  The energy fight will pause briefly in the Senate for a procedural vote on a bill that the Democrats constructed in an effort to break the vice-grip that Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, has placed on many pieces of legislation, using the rights of a single senator to hold up any bill by placing a ""hold"" on it.  Mr. Coburn has come to be known as the Senate's Dr. No. And the bill the Democrats pulled together, including several pieces of legislation authored by Mr. Coburn's fellow Republicans, is being called the Tomnibus. It is unlikely that Democrats will succeed in changing Mr. Coburn's tactics.  But the Democrats' maneuver did succeed in getting front-page attention for Mr. Coburn today in both The New York Times and The Washington Post, though whether Mr. Coburn was embarrassed, as the Democrats hoped, also seemed unlikely given his defiant remarks.  Of course, amid all the political squabbling and rhetorical re-hash, there is actually a government to run.  The House this week is also planning to debate a bill to finance military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs  the first appropriations bill to make it to the House floor this year. And the House leadership is also hoping to act on at least one of several major pieces of legislation awaiting completion including a bill to overhaul the Consumer Products Safety Commission and another bill reauthorizing the financing and operations of Amtrak, the subsidized rail road company.  But with just days to go before the recess, and the party conventions fast-approaching, running the government will not get in the way of larger political objectives for November. House Democrats this week also expect to take up a bill to aid women who win discrimination lawsuits against their employers, substantially increasing the amount of damages that can be sought and taking other steps to reduce pay disparity.  The bill, called the Fair Pay Act, is a corollary to a measure that was blocked in the Senate in April seeking to overturn the Supreme Court ruling against Lilly Ledbetter, an Alabama woman who sued the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company but lost when the court found she did not file her complaint in time. Ms. Ledbetter had been paid as much as 40 percent less than male counterparts doing the same job, according to her supporters.  To be sure, pay parity for women is a matter of deeply held principle for Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers. But the politics of the issue are also unmistakable.  In April, when Republicans blocked the Ledbetter measure, Democratic leaders did not convene the Senate until 5 p.m. so both of the party's presidential candidates, Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton could return to Washington. Both spoke in favor of the legislation, countering arguments by several Republicans that the bill would simply encourage costly litigation.  And with women voters likely to play a crucial role in the outcome in November, Democrats have made clear that pay equity will be a major topic in both the presidential race and congressional campaigns around the country.

But beyond waving at the notion that American voters are uncomfortable with the idea of ""a young, inexperienced African American as their president,"" Novak doesn't provide an answer. He writes:     In locking up the nomination this year, when he had been counted out after the disintegration of his campaign structure, McCain showed more fortitude than skill. He was blessed by a weak field of Republican competitors, who eliminated each other and left McCain as the last man standing.  But Obama is no Huckabee, Giuliani or Romney. He is the most spectacular campaigner of his generation, with appeal well beyond Democratic ranks. That he lingers below the 50 percent mark is a mystery among politicians of both parties. It is particularly troubling to Democrats who recall past Democratic candidates taking a huge lead over the summer before being overtaken or nearly overtaken by a surging Republican opponent.  In 1976, Jimmy Carter took a 33-point summer lead over President Gerald Ford and won in a photo finish. In 1988, Michael Dukakis led George H.W. Bush by 17 points after being nominated in Atlanta before he lost the election. Al Gore and John Kerry were ahead of George W. Bush in the summer.  Clearly, Obama has not yet closed the deal with the people to accept a young, inexperienced African American as their president. Obama had virtually clinched the nomination when white working men in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia poured out to vote and carried their states comfortably for Hillary Clinton. It was not because of unalterable affection for her.  ",2008-07-28T13:31:47+0000

us,Iranian Leader Hints at Cooperation,"  The nuclear disagreements between Iran and the West have been communicated in many ways -- military exercises, diplomat-packed negotiating rooms, lengthy government reports and short, bellicose statements from their leaders. So why not a prime-time interview on American television?  In a talk with Brian Williams of the NBC ""Nightly News"" at his compound in Iran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran acknowledged recent American moves meant to thaw relations with his country, and hinted that Iran could be persuaded to change its course as a result. Here are his words to an American audience:   ""Today, we see new behavior shown by the United States [...] My question is: is such behavior rooted in a new approach? In other words, mutual respect, cooperation and justice. Or is this approach a continuation in the confrontation with Iranian people but in a new guise?  ""[...] If the approach changes, we will be facing a new situation, and the response from the Iranian people will be a positive one.""   The interview took place at a moment best described as ""fluid"" -- the word of an energy market analyst reacting to Iran's weekend announcement of many more uranium-enrichment centrifuges. Iran has maintained that its program is peaceful, and NBC reported today that he Mr. Ahmedinejad flatly stated more than once that ""we are not working to manufacture a bomb."" He also said that ""nuclear weapons are so 20th-century,"" according to Mr. Williams.  Still, as Iran continues to enrich uranium while Western powers urge it to stop, the United States has sent signals of a less confrontational stance with steps like sending an envoy to international nuclear talks with Iran and by considering whether to open a diplomatic post in Tehran. Meanwhile, at the moment there are no American aircraft carriers in the Gulf.  Whether something ""positive"" can now happen at a pace that is acceptable to Washington remains to be seen. After the talks in Geneva earlier this month with the American envoy in attendance, the Iranian foreign minister lauded the ""positive step,"" the positive atmosphere and the ""new positive approach."" But in substance, the meeting ended where it began, at a deadlock.   Iran's stance in Geneva, as characterized by a document it distributed at the talks, remained the same. The New York Times obtained a copy [pdf] and described it this way:  The six powers were hoping that Iran would accept a compromise formula to pave the way to formal negotiations. For six weeks, Iran would not add ""any new nuclear activity,"" refraining from the new installation of centrifuges that enrich uranium, and the United States and other powers would not seek new United Nations sanctions.  But both in their paper, and throughout the talks, the Iranians did not discuss the formula, called a ""freeze for freeze."" As a result, they left the impression that they wanted to lure the parties into an open-ended, cost-free, high-level negotiating process.  ""The paper calls for a huge exercise in talking,"" said one senior European official. ""If you were to try to implement it, it would take a minimum of several years.""   Last week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that she had tired of all the stalling and that Iran ought to get serious. Whether she thinks Mr. Ahmadinejad's latest remarks were a shift will be key.  ",2008-07-28T14:24:44+0000

us,Apple Weighs in on the MobileMe Mess,"Last Thursday, in my weekly e-column, I blasted Apple for the way it's been handling the disastrous opening of its MobileMe service. Two weeks after launch, at least 20,000 customers still had no way to send or receive e-mail.   The worst part, though, was Apple's smug silence on the issue. What was causing the problem? How come a fix was taking so long? What was being done to solve it? When would it be fixed? What kind of resources were being spent on a resolution? Did Apple understand the disruption this problem was causing those thousands of people and small businesses?  Apple wouldn't say.   There was a terse note on the MobileMe support site: ""1% of MobileMe members cannot access MobileMe Mail. We apologize for this service interruption and are working hard to resolve the problem."" But otherwise, there was no communication whatsoever, no acknowledgment of people's growing desperation, even two weeks after MobileMe's launch.  And then, on Saturdaywell, knock me down with a feather. Apple performed a complete 180-degree reversal. The most opaque, uncommunicative tech company on the planet suddenly became transparent and informative.   At Steve Jobs's direction, the company has launched a new blog that's exclusively dedicated to the MobileMe mess.  In the first posting alone, Apple identifies the specific cause of the MobileMe problem (blockage from a bad mail server); what's being done to solve it (24/7 coordinated efforts); current status (e-mail service restored, but e-mail older than Friday is still missing, and one-tenth of messages sent between July 16 and 18 may be forever lost); the severity of the original problem (70 bugs fixed); and estimated time of completion (end of the week).   More amazingly, the blog acknowledges, for the first time, the emotional toll of the experience. ""It's been a rocky road, and we know the pain some people have been suffering.""  I'll bet good money that Apple has never before used the words ""pain"" and ""suffering"" to describe one of its products.  What made Apple change its stance? Was it the thousands of people on its support boards, clamoring for accountability? Did my column have anything to do with it? Or was it just Steve Jobs coming back from vacation?   I can't remember any tech company ever willing to bare its ugly internal problems quite so publicly, and with so frank an admission of the distress it was causing. [UPDATE: I overstated that. Readers have pointed out similar notes from other companies, like this one, that do document internal problems, although without the acknowledgment of customer suffering.] These days, my e-mail is filled with notes from customers, expressing relief and a huge stress reduction.  It would have been a lot better if MobileMe had worked great from Day One. It would have been better if Apple had been this candid from the beginning.  But at least Apple has finally provided what thousands of people have been aching for: honesty, transparency, and, above all, a sympathetic ear. ",2008-07-28T15:14:22+0000

us,Yahoo and the Icahn Effect,"What's in store for Yahoo's shareholders now that the Web company has reached a truce with Carl Icahn?   That is anyone's guess, but a look at companies in similar situations shows that the stock gains that the outspoken investor often brings with him -- call it the ""Icahn effect"" -- can be quite volatile, at least in the short term.  Yahoo's stock got a boost in May after Mr. Icahn said he was going to shake things up at the Internet company and try to sell it to Microsoft. But he recently abandoned his proxy fight, agreeing to get three board seats instead.   At DealBook's request, FactSet SharkWatch analyzed the stock performance of public companies that Mr. Icahn has targeted with activist campaigns since 2000.   In some cases, Mr. Icahn's target ended up getting sold or going private. That often delivered big premiums to shareholders.  But when the company stayed public and independent -- which could be Yahoo's fate -- here's what FactSet found.  In the first month after Mr. Icahn started his campaign, the stock prices of the companies he targeted from 2000 to 2008 popped an average of 8 percent. That included 32 companies and 35 campaigns: Mr. Icahn launched three campaigns against Visix and two against ImClone Systems.  The average increase jumped to 17 percent after six months, while the number of companies dropped to 21. (Eleven of the companies ceased to be public, such as Register.com and Morton's Restaurants.)  A year after Mr. Icahn started agitating, the average gain declined for companies that weren't sold, broken up or taken private. Of the 16 public companies that remained, the one-year increase averaged 8 percent, FactSet said.  In 2007, Mr. Icahn claimed to have created more than $50 billion of shareholder value in the previous two years through his rabble rousing. Fortune crunched the numbers and said they seemed to jibe with his claims.  Investors in Kerr-McGee, the oil and gas producer, more than doubled their money from the time Mr. Icahn got involved to when the company was sold to Anadarko.  These days, Yahoo's shareholders might be happy just to get that 8 percent mentioned above.  After the first month of Mr. Icahn's campaign, Yahoo's stock was down 7 percent. More recently, after Yahoo posted mixed second-quarter earnings last week, it was down 19 percent. ",2008-07-28T16:49:52+0000

The Hulu Player Widget lets people search for and watch Hulu videos from any Internet page.    Hulu has been struggling to convince other major programmers to contribute material to the service. Its major selling points are the growing traffic on Hulu.com, a clean and uniform video watching experience and now, broad reach across the Web.

""By the way, I, as I do every three months, I visited my dermatologist this morning,'' Mr. McCain said outside an oil pump here, where he was talking about energy. ""She said that I was doing fine, took a small little nick from my cheek, as she does regularly, and that will be biopsied just to make sure that everything is fine.''   Mr. McCain, who wore a band-aid over the spot earlier, had taken it off, revealing a small dark area on his upper right cheek.

us,Man Sought in Daughters Kidnapping,"(Photo: Clark Rockefeller and his daughter, Reigh, 7. (Photo: Boston Police Department)) Updated, 7:44 p.m. &#124; The New York City police are searching the city's streets and area harbors for a man, Clark Rockefeller, who is believed to have snatched his 7-year-old daughter, Reigh Rockefeller, from a Boston street and brought her to New York.  According to the Boston Police Department, a private social worker called the police shortly after noon on Sunday to report that Mr. Rockefeller had kidnapped the child after arriving for a supervised custodial visit. Mr. Rockefeller and his wife, Sandra L. Boss, divorced last year.   The Boston police described Mr. Rockefeller as a man in his 50s with blond hair, standing 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing about 170 pounds. The social worker told the officers that Mr. Rockefeller grabbed his daughter, put her into a black sport-utility vehicle and sped away. Reigh was described as being 4 feet tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and wearing a pink and white sun dress and red shoes. The Boston police issued, then canceled, an Amber Alert after determining that Mr. Rockefeller was heading with the girl to New York.  Law enforcement authorities in New York said they believed that Mr. Rockefeller arrived in Manhattan on Sunday night with his daughter, with the intent of ferrying her to Bermuda by boat. Harbor patrols were searching marinas in an effort to find the father and daughter, the authorities said.  The Boston police have a warrant out for Mr. Rockefeller's arrest on charges of custodial kidnapping, assault and battery, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.  Public records show that Clark Rockefeller and Reigh's mother, Sandra L. Boss, 41, lived together most recently in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston in a home valued at $2.3 million.  The Boston Globe reported that Ms. Boss is a partner, based in London, for McKinsey & Company, the management consulting company, and that she is also interim chairwoman of the board of trustees of The Mount, Edith Wharton's home and estate in Lenox, Mass., in the Berkshires.   Ms. Boss graduated from Stanford in 1989, with a degree in American studies, and holds an M.B.A. from Harvard. According to a biography on McKinsey's Web site, she led a McKinsey study, commissioned by Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, on New York's competitiveness with London as a global financial center. Before joining McKinsey, she worked for Merrill Lynch in debt markets and for Trammell Crow Ventures.  Ms. Boss filed for divorce on Jan. 17, 2007, in Suffolk County Probate and Family Court, and on Nov. 30, 2007, she successfully petitioned Probate and Family Court to legally change her daughter's name from Reigh Storrow Rockefeller to Reigh Storrow Mills Boss, according to public records and The Boston Herald. The child's father signed off on the name change as J. Clark Rockefeller. The divorce is final, but the records from the court proceedings were sealed at the couple's request.   In telephone interviews on Monday, Amy Fitch and Michele Hiltzik, senior archivists at the Rockefeller Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., which maintains the records of the Rockefeller family associated with Standard Oil, philanthropy and politics, said there was no indication that Clark Rockefeller was a descendant of William Avery Rockefeller, the father of John D. Rockefeller Sr. and William Rockefeller.   (John D. Rockefeller Sr., the oil tycoon, and his son John D. Jr., the philanthropist, made the Rockefeller name famous. The five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr. -- John D. III, Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop and David -- continued to extend the family's name. Nelson A. Rockefeller was governor of New York and vice president of the United States under President Gerald R. Ford. Winthrop was governor of Arkansas. David, the only one of the five brothers still living, was head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, and has been a major fixture in New York life for decades.)  In 2004, The Valley News, in Lebanon, N.H., reported that Mr. Rockefeller refused to confirm whether or not he was related, directly or otherwise, to the famed Rockefeller family. ""Maybe I am, maybe I'm not; it's not something that I would either confirm or deny,"" Clark Rockefeller responded, according to the paper. ""I just don't want anything to do with the whole question.""  The newspaper was trying to determine Clark Rockefeller's lineage after he reportedly wrote a $110,000 check to the town of Cornish, N.H., in exchange for a deed to a historic church.

us,Did Obama Overstay?,"Dan Schnur was the national communications director for John McCain's presidential campaign in 2000. (Full biography.)  At many levels, Barack Obama's overseas tour could have been categorized as a political victory before it even began. The Iraqi prime minister had just announced support for a timeline similar to Mr. Obama's plan for early American troop withdrawal, the Bush Administration had sent a representative to multination talks with Iran, and a growing military and political consensus had emerged as to the need for a greater military presence in Afghanistan.   (Photo: Barack Obama played basketball with American troops in Kuwait, on July 20, before flying to Afghanistan. (Army Sgt. Brooks Fletcher/US Army, via Associated Press)) In other words, the three most important pillars of Mr. Obama's international platform had been endorsed from a variety of unexpected sources. That's a pretty good way to start a trip designed to deal with questions about a candidate's understanding of foreign policy and national security.  But as every junior political operative knows, it's all about the photos, which means that the real value of Mr. Obama's trip was the visual reinforcement of too-good-to-be-true images he accumulated along the way. Many American voters read about his policy and political achievements in print. But a much larger audience saw footage of the Democratic nominee meeting with Hamid Karzai, president of Afghanistan, and Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki; taking a helicopter ride with Gen. David Petraeus; and sinking a three-point shot on a basketball court on a United States military installation in Kuwait.   Before Mr. Obama's plane left American airspace 10 days ago, polls showed that voters strongly preferred John McCain when it comes to foreign policy and national security matters. By the time Mr. Obama returned home this past weekend, that steady stream of photos with military and political leaders probably raised voters' comfort level with him on this front.   Iraq and Afghanistan are the two foreign policy matters of greatest and most immediate concern to American voters, so it was of critical importance that Mr. Obama visit those two countries. Despite some verbal gymnastics on questions related to his opposition to the United States troop surge, this part of the trip was a home run. But the weeklong journey was actually three separate trips, each with a different impact on the American electorate. The trip's second segment, which took Mr. Obama to Jordan and Israel, was essentially a draw. His visit to Israel was an exercise in diplomatic survival at best: no setbacks but no real gains either. And the scenic backdrop of his news conference in Jordan was probably offset by the reporting of his ride to the airport in King Abdullah's Mercedes 600 Series sports car.   The third part of the expedition  Germany, France and England  was the least helpful to him. Indeed, as the week wore on, the beneficial news coverage that Mr. Obama received on earlier stops began to fade. Just as the United States news media had reacted to Hillary Clinton's complaints and ""Saturday Night Live""'s parodies last spring by toughening up on Mr. Obama during the final weeks of the primary campaign, another mini-backlash developed as this trip reached its final destinations. By this past weekend, news stories used words like ""defend"" and ""rebut"" to characterize Mr. Obama's own statements about the trip. The candidate himself began to acknowledge that many voters might not see the benefits in his being out of the country for such an extended period.   The controversy over the campaign's decision to cancel a visit with wounded American troops in Germany didn't help matters, especially given the photograph that emerged of the candidate heading into the hotel gym at the Berlin Ritz-Carlton. But the bigger problem is that it wasn't as clear what the final stops were designed to accomplish. Voters understood that Mr. Obama went to Afghanistan and Iraq to show them that he was prepared to be their commander in chief. But his visits to London and Paris didn't seem quite so urgent. Proving his foreign policy knowledge in the world's hot spots was necessary: playing diplomat in Western Europe looked premature.  For most of the week, Mr. Obama deftly walked a fine line between statesman and show-off, between interloper and leader. On balance, he took great strides toward addressing voter concerns about his national security capabilities. Score the week a win for the Democrats, but like many tourists who traveled overseas this summer, Mr. Obama may have stayed too long. ",2008-07-28T18:34:32+0000

us,Photo Exhibition Brings Distant Frescoes to Moscow,"Ferapontovo Monastery, in the Vologda region 300 miles north of Moscow, is way off the beaten track for most tourists. But for those curious about the luminous 15th-century frescoes in the monasterys Cathedral of the Nativity of the Virgin, there is an exhibition of remarkable photographs on display in Moscows Shchusev State Museum of Architecture through the end of August.Profoundly theological in their content and execution, the frescoes depicting biblical prophets, saints, New Testament parables, Jesus and the Last Judgment, were painted by Dionisy the Wise,widely regarded as one of the greatest Russian iconographers. The frescoes, along with the monastery itself, are on Unescos World Heritage list, and are especially notable for their terracotta and blue hues that seem more Mediterranean in style than northern Russian.Which makes it all the more amazing thatthe 300 or so images in The Light of Dionisys Frescoes exhibition at the Shchusev Museum are photographs,the work of Yuri Kholdin, a photographer who spent over 10 years studying and capturing the frescoes, using analog cameras and shooting at specific times of day, with as little artificial light as possible. The result is a collection of images that are so detailed and true to the originals that they look like the real thing. The fact that they are hung in the museums Aptekarsky Prikaz wing, which looks and feels like a monastic chamber, only enhances the effect. Several times, I wanted to reach out and touch them, to feel the texture I could so clearly see.Kholdin died a year ago at age 52, in an accident while photographing the skyscrapers of Moscow City, the Russian capitals new business district. His widow, Yekaterina Danilova, an art historian with theological training who wrote the texts that accompany the images, has continued his work promoting the frescoes. Kholdins love of the art form was reflected in his creation of a foundation called Frescoes of Russia.In an interview about his work, which was distributed at the exhibition, Danilova discusses Kholdins time studying Renaissance art in Italy and his interest in Kazimir Malevichs Suprematism, which was influenced by icons. Its possible to see the influence of both in Kholdins approach to photographing the frescoes. One American visitor at the exhibitions July 22 opening compared the photographs of the frescoes to the work of the Italian Renaissance painter Giotto. The close-ups of fresco details  an angels face, a pitcher on a table  are reminiscent of Suprematist compositions.For more information on Kholdins work see his Web site, www.dionisy.ru, for now in Russian only.",2008-07-28T19:00:54+0000

Ms. al-Kaseem was wounded during fighting between the Mahdi Army militia and American and Iraqi forces. (Photo: Moises Saman for The New York Times))   Video This blog post is part of a series examining the people and places in Sadr City, the poor Baghdad neighborhood that is the center of the support for the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.  BAGHDAD -- In the first years of the war, reporters would rush to the scene of car bombings. Now the American and Iraqi military block access to bombing sites until the damage can be cleaned up and the victims evacuated. One result of this policy is that the immediate aftermath of attacks in Iraq are no longer seen on television or in newspapers. To be sure, violence is down in Baghdad and many other cities in Iraq, but it has not disappeared.  Today, when many reporters and photographers hear a large explosion in the city they head to the nearest hospital to document the dead and wounded as they are brought to morgue or emergency room. In Sadr City, that means traveling to one of four hospitals. The video and photos in this post, gathered from numerous visits to the area's oldest hospital, depict graphically conditions inside a health care facility in the hours after an attack.    (Photo: An Iraqi man, wounded during clashes between the Mahdi Army and American and Iraqi forces in April, in a hallway at the Imam Ali Hospital. (Photo: Moises Saman for The New York Times))   The largest health center in Sadr City is Imam Ali hospital, located deep in the northern part of the poor neighborhood. Built in the 1970's, it was originally called General Saddam Hospital, but has since been renamed for the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. A smaller hospital in Sadr City for women is named after Muhammad's daughter, Fatima. Imam Ali was revered by Shiites, and his assassination in 661 led to the Sunni-Shiia split that still divides Muslims.   The 300-bed hospital employs 45 doctors, but at least 2 million people live in the densely packed neighborhood. Doctors said they had received 300 dead and 1,400 wounded earlier this year before a ceasefire was declared. The pact between the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and the Iraqi government has slowed violence in Sadr City, but it has not stopped it all together.  Doctor Yaarrub Anlwan, 40, a specialist in general surgery, said that although the situation is better now than it was under Saddam Hussein, he feels pessimistic about the future. ""For 30 years this population was poor. And they don't have any education. They are neglected in many civilian life conditions,"" Dr. Anlwan said. ""We need more time for the construction of the person, before the construction of the buildings.""  Most hospitals in Iraq operate under the Ministry of Health. Teaching hospitals report to the Ministry of Higher Education and are usually better equipped, Dr. Anlwan said. Imam Ali Hospital reports to the Ministry of Health. The Health Ministry has also been accused in the past of funding Shiite militias and using their facilities to kidnap and kill Iraqi civilians. ",2008-07-28T19:15:20+0000

us,Should Gas Prices Nix Vacation Plans?,"Spiraling gas prices were causing me to anguish over my family's planned summer vacation trip to Utah. Bite the bullet and go anyway? Or should we cancel?   I finally decided to turn off the gas-price hysteria on the local TV news and turn on my own brain. I got out my calculator.  The vehicle we were going to drive averages around 20 miles a gallon. Naturally, we would have preferred a more fuel-efficient ride, but for hauling eight people our options were limited. We could have traded it in for a more fuel-efficient model, but that would have cost thousands just in sales tax, registration and license fees -- not to mention the beating I would have taken on the trade. Paying thousands to save hundreds seemed like voodoo math. Turns out I wasn't even talking about hundreds.  The drive was 800 miles, round-trip from Los Angeles. The last time we did it, about a year ago, regular unleaded cost about $3.09 a gallon. Now, gas prices in my area are around $4.39 a gallon. That's a significant increase, no doubt about it. But how much would it really add to my gas bill for the trip?  The answer was surprising: about 50 bucks. It will cost me about $175 for gas this year, compared with $124 last year.  Would it have been worth scuttling the vacation over that amount? C'mon. That's less than the cost of a lunch for our group.  O.K., nobody is making light of out-of-control gas prices here. But $50 more wasn't going to make or break our trip. Why be in panic mode?  We decided to see if we could cut costs in other areas to offset even that increased amount. We found it was pretty easy. First, we looked for a cheaper hotel. That was simple. A lot of hoteliers are hurting these days, and bargains abound, especially for those traveling on off-peak days. But weekend travelers can find bargains, too. For instance, using Web sites like Travelocity and Kayak we found a four-star hotel in Las Vegas for just $58 a night (there were others, as well) mid-week. My son was able to book that rate for the weekend as well. We spent a lot more than that on hotels last year. For the whole trip, we wound up spending about $100 less than we did last year.   The real pain, for me, was when gas doubled from $1 to $2 a gallon -- then went up another dollar to $3 last year. From a mathematical standpoint, the percentage of the increases is getting smaller, if that's any consolation.  I sure don't want to dissuade anyone from parking their gas guzzler if they have the option of driving a more economical vehicle or taking public transportation. These things make sense and are responsible actions. But before canceling an important family get-together, much-deserved vacation or even a weekend getaway, do the math. The numbers may surprise you. ",2008-07-28T20:24:14+0000

us,Police Investigate Officer in Video,"Updated, 6:03 p.m. &#124; The New York City Police Department said on Monday afternoon that it had placed a police officer on modified assignment after a widely circulated YouTube video showed the officer appearing to violently shove a participant in the Critical Mass bike ride, causing the cyclist to fall off his bike.   The video, made on Friday evening and widely circulated after it was cited on Gothamist, shows the officer rushing toward the cyclist, wearing a white T-shirt and a backpack, as he pedaled down Broadway between 46th and 47th Streets:     (For background on how the video reached YouTube, see this update.)  The Police Department has not identified the officer or provided any further details about the episode on the tape, but Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, the top police spokesman, said in a statement on Monday, ""The officer has been placed on modified assignment pending further investigation of the incident.""   Modified assignment is not a form of discipline, but is used when the Police Department is investigating possible misconduct.   Many Critical Mass bike participants have been arrested in the past, resulting in protracted litigation and court decisions, but recently, relations between the New York riders -- part of a worldwide network of urban cyclists -- and the police had shown signs of improvement.   The rides began roughly a decade ago, in San Francisco, and in early years they sometimes resulted in free-for-alls.   The New York rides -- organized by Time's Up, an environmental advocacy organization, and held on the last Friday of each month -- gained momentum in 2004, when scores of riders were arrested in August 2004, as part of the protests at the Republican National Convention. Nine more cyclists were arrested the following month, and this time, the cyclists also complained that police officers had sawed through locks and seized their bikes.  Things came to a boil in October 2004, when the city went to court to try to require Critical Mass to obtain a permit to conduct its monthly rides, arguing that the intense concentration of cyclists disrupted traffic. A federal judge denied the city's request on technical grounds, and also barred the city from seizing bikes of people who were not charged with breaking the law.   Still, some cyclists continued to get arrested, and the bicycle became an unlikely symbol of defiance of authority. Cyclist-police relations were worsened with revelations, in 2005, that the Police Department had conducted secret surveillance of numerous protest groups, including Critical Mass, around the time of the convention.  In February 2006, a state judge again rejected the city's efforts to restrict the rides, but urged both sides to talk to each other, writing, ""The social compact and the realities of living in a crowded place demand patience, mutual respect and self-restraint.""  The city did not give up. In June 2006, the Police Department proposed rules that would require parade permits for bicyclists traveling in groups of 20 or more -- and for any bicyclists or walkers taking to the streets in groups of two or more. The city backed down slightly, amid a storm of protest. In January 2007, the city finally adopted rules requiring parade permits for bicyclists and others who take to the streets in groups of 50 or more for processions, races and protests. Meanwhile, there have been signs in recent years that the ride's popularity has declined.  ",2008-07-28T21:07:10+0000

us,The Caped Decider?,"The politics of Batman: Mystery writer Andrew Klavan has taken a decent amount of ribbing online for his suggestion, on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal, that President Bush and Bruce Wayne's alter ego (you know, the $314 Million Man) have a lot in common. Klavan wrote on Friday:     There seems to me no question that the Batman film ""The Dark Knight,"" currently breaking every box office record in history, is at some level a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by George W. Bush in this time of terror and war. Like W, Batman is vilified and despised for confronting terrorists in the only terms they understand. Like W, Batman sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past.  And like W, Batman understands that there is no moral equivalence between a free society -- in which people sometimes make the wrong choices -- and a criminal sect bent on destruction. The former must be cherished even in its moments of folly; the latter must be hounded to the gates of Hell.  ""The Dark Knight,"" then, is a conservative movie about the war on terror.     Klavan was mocked by bloggers like Isaac Chotiner of The New Republic, but other bloggers are seriously discussing his thesis.  ""Insofar as it's possible to view an action movie that had the biggest three-day-opening in cinematic history as a comment on the current national-security debate, 'The Dark Knight' weighs in strongly on the side of the Bush administration,"" writes Spencer Ackerman of The Washington Independent. ""Confronting the Joker, a nihilistic enemy whose motives are both unexplained and beside the point, the Batman faces his biggest dilemma yet: whether to abuse his power in order to save Gotham City. Again and again in the movie, the Batman's moral hand-wringing results in the deaths of innocents. Only by becoming like the monster he must vanquish can Batman secure a victory that even he understands is Pyrrhic.""   But Steven Taylor, a political scientist at Troy University, thinks ""The Dark Knight"" works better as a critique of President Bush's approach to the war on terrorism -- rather than a celebration of it. He writes at Outside the Beltway:    Klavan's view that one can actually look at Batman as even a useful allegory about the war on terror illustrates perhaps the key problem with what has been the underlying logic in much of the Bush administration's approach to counter-terrorism, i.e., that it is that it is all very simply: just punish the bad guys. There are two basic assumptions inherent in the overall approach: 1) whatever the good guy does in pursing the bad guy is ultimately good and is justified because the good guy only wants good, and 2) the good guy only using his powers against the bad buys. It assumes above all else that it is easy to identify the bad guys, as in movies (or the comics) where they wear costumes and they are quite obvious in their malefaction.    Matthew Yglesias sides with Taylor's perspective. ""I think Cheney would look at the movie and say 'see -- this is what we're doing,'"" Yglesias writes on his blog for The Atlantic. ""I look at the movie and say 'see -- if you were fighting a comic book bad guy and you were a comic book hero then your policies would make sense.' ""    ",2008-07-28T21:17:11+0000

us,Comedy Central Accepts Political Ad,"For the first time, Comedy Central's ""Daily Show"" with Jon Stewart and ""The Colbert Report"" will be broadcasting a political advertisement, one promoting Senator Barack Obama.  Tony Fox, a spokesman for Comedy Central, said he did not know why the cable channel had not accepted political advocacy advertising before, but said of the decision to do so now: ""Political advertising in an election year is good business.""  He also said that this particular spot, produced by members of MoveOn.org Political Action, the liberal action group, was humorous and would be a good fit with Comedy Central's young, politically sophisticated audience. It is entitled ""It Could Happen to You"" and features Rider Strong, the former star of ""Boy Meets World,"" and Amber Benson of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  MoveOn will spend $150,000 to run it for one week on Comedy Central and MTV, which had not accepted political advertising for more than a decade but reversed that policy a month ago. Both MTV and Comedy Central are owned by Viacom Networks, which has generally weathered the current advertising downturn better than some of its competitors.   Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Pali Research in New York, said the move showed the growing importance of MTV on the media landscape.  ""Advertising is weak across the media landscape, but MTV is continuing to be resourceful in capitalizing on a political campaign,"" he said, adding that the company is ""making a sharp decision to take the dollars while they were available.""  MoveOn said its commercial was ""in part"" a response to an anti-Obama commercial that ran last week on MTV by Let Freedom Ring, a conservative advocacy group. It said it also wants to try to increase turnout among young voters.  ""It Could Happen to You"" was selected by members of MoveOn.org in a contest for 30-second pro-Obama videos and was voted the funniest. The title refers to the possibility that voters could catch Mr. Obama's message of hope, making fun of ""hope"" as if it were a contagious disease.  The spot is to run both nationally and on local cable in Washington, D.C., where political journalists are likely to see it and promote it for free. ",2008-07-28T22:01:45+0000

us,Grow Your Own,"""Edible landscape"" seems to be going head to head with ""staycation"" as the most popular catch phrase of Summer 2008. Lawns may not be disappearing before our very eyes, but citizens are definitely swapping out blades of grass for bushels of beans in increasing numbers.  Take me for instance, a bona fide city dweller: As a follow up to my  column in March on the reclamation of urban and suburban land for agricultural use, I've spent the last several weeks putting theory into practice, literally getting my hands dirty (and whatever other clich I can unearth) in the interest of urban agriculture.   (Photo: My backyard, before and after. (Allison Arieff))   Two months ago, I learned about My Farm, run by mortgage-broker-turned-farmer Trevor Paque. My Farm is essentially an urban take on community-sponsored agriculture (CSAs). With CSAs, individuals essentially invest in rural farms to help support their operations and are given a weekly box of fresh produce in return. With My Farm (and similar operations found in cities including New York and Portland, Ore.), you can grow food in your own backyard with the assistance of urban farmers like Paque. In one day, he created our 120-square-foot backyard farm  landscaping with found materials from the yard, installing a drip-irrigation system and planting heirloom seeds. Now he comes once a week to harvest a box of organic and ridiculously local produce for us  plus an additional box, which he sells to another family in our neighborhood.   This costs us about $100 a month, and has allowed us to replace our water-dependent grass patch with an edible landscape. After just three months in business, Paque has a waiting list of over 200 people and is scrambling to keep up with demand.   Urban agriculture has been around since at least the 18th century, but it's an idea whose time has truly come  now  in the United States. The reasons range from the fact that our hands are always found glued to computer keys and not even occasionally in the dirt, to the scary existence of industrially grown tomatoes that may (or may not) cause salmonella, to the fact that a drive to the market can now cost more than the food you purchase there.   Though some may see this as a ""lazy locavore"" trend  wherein couch potato clients, glass of biodynamic Syrah in hand, observe the hard labor of city farmers while lounging with their laptops  the urban agriculture movement seems to me to be slowly transcending its elitist associations. It is truly growing into something that is wholly about collaboration, community and connection to food, to neighbors, to land.  That's certainly been my experience both in my yard, as neighbors and friends come by to help harvest (and to eat), and in my city. Earlier this month, my family spent a Saturday at San Francisco's Civic Center Plaza, helping to plant a 10,000-square-foot Victory Garden sponsored by Slow Food Nation, a nonprofit organization that will be celebrating American food through art, music, lectures, tastings, school programs and the like over Labor Day Weekend. More than 250 volunteers and nearly a dozen Bay Area gardening organizations dedicated their time to plant the first edible garden in front of San Francisco's City Hall since 1943. Designed by John Bela of the arts collective REBAR and curated by the artist/gardener/activist Amy Francheschini of Victory Gardens 2008+, this public installation aims to demonstrate the potential of a truly local agriculture practice while producing high-quality food for those in need.   (Photo: Slow Food Nation's victory garden in front of San Francisco City Hall. (Courtesy of Scott Chernis/Scott Chernis Photography))   This day was social networking of the best sort. Participants got some dirt under their fingernails, ran into old friends, ate an organic lunch and left weary but happy. It was as much about community creation as food cultivation. I hope to see this sort of urban (and suburban) intervention replicated across the country. (It will be a shame if the city of San Francisco can't find a way to either keep the garden here or find a suitable space to relocate it.)  This isn't just a California thing, nor does it require vast amounts of open space. At PS1 in Long Island City, N.Y., the architecture firm WORK AC eschewed that art institution's traditionalUrban Beach concept for an Urban Farm.  Planters at PS1, part of WORK AC's Urban Farm""/>Planters are part of WORK AC's Urban Farm project. (Elizabeth Felicella)""This came out a desire to combine urbanism with ecology,"" explains Work Architecture Company principal Dan Wood, who with his partner, Amale Andraos, and their architecture students at Princeton have concluded that the urban farm is really the holy grail of making things sustainable. WORK AC's take is particularly urban, featuring things like a mobile phone charging station, speakers that emit farm-animal sounds and ""Gaia"" soil made from recycled Styrofoam and pectin gel. Food harvested from the project is used at PS1's caf, thus reducing food miles to a whopping 300 feet.   When I spoke with Wood and Andraos recently, it was evident that this project is the result of an intricate network of people and places. They spoke excitedly of the great advice they'd received, for example, from Michael Grady Robertson of the 50-acre Queens County Farm Museum (which I bet you didn't know existed) in New York and from their solar panel installer, who'd honed his craft in Alaska. Andraos stressed that they really wanted this typically rural thing to offer to city dwellers all the things that attract them about city living: social interaction, play, excitement, fun.  If all of this has helped plant a seed of inspiration, why not enter Readymade's Second Annual Garden Challenge. The DIY bible Readymade, which inspires its readership toward the execution (or at least vicarious realization) of creative ideas on small budgets, invites readers to submit ideas for transforming their own outdoor spaces in innovative ways. (E-mail ideas to shana@readymademag.com by Aug. 1.) I've no doubt they'll be hearing from hordes of less-than-lazy locavores.   ",2008-07-28T22:33:30+0000

Creates Facebook Parody Site for Obama,"Here's an entry you would not expect to see on Barack Obama's official profile on the social networking site Facebook: ""Barack Obama is now friends with Antonin 'Tony' Rezko.""  But that's the first item on Mr. Obama's ""FriendFeed"" on BarackBook.com, a Facebook parody site created by the Republican National Committee that it says will go live on Tuesday. According to the R.N.C, the site is intended to showcase some of Mr. Obama's ""notable associations.""   And highlighting Mr. Obama's relationship with Mr. Rezko, the Chicago real estate developer who was recently convicted in federal court of corruption and money laundering, is just the beginning. Mr. Rezko was an early political backer of Mr. Obama and donated large sums to his campaigns. (Mr. Obama has since severed ties with Mr. Rezko and given much of the money he raised to charity.)  An early glance at the R.N.C. mockup shows Mr. Rezko with his own profile page that lists links to Mr. Obama and other ""friends"" of the Illinois senator. Other ""BarackBook"" friends include, Eric Holder, a Washington lawyer and member of Mr. Obama's vice presidential selection team, and William Ayers, one of the founders of the radical group Weather Underground.  Each profile is set to include videos, news articles and sections like ""Facts About Me and Barack,"" ""My Donations and Bundling for Barack"" and ""What Barack Says About Me."" The R.N.C. says it plans to continue updating BarackBook between now and the election. (Notably, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright, Mr. Obama's controversial former pastor, does not yet have a profile.)  Users of Facebook  the real one  may be able to install an application on their personal page with links to BarackBook.  Alex Conant, a spokesman for the R.N.C. called the planned site ""an interactive way to learn more about Obama's poor judgment.""  But in using a faux social networking site to highlight what it considers to be some of Mr. Obama's more controversial acquaintances -- past and present -- the R.N.C. is also opening itself up to the inevitable comparisons between the Obama campaign's online efforts and those of his rival, Senator John McCain.  While there is no single metric for success on the Internet, there are some leading indicators. For example, Mr. Obama has about 1.2 million Facebook friends, while Mr. McCain has fewer than 200,000. But the Republicans are making an effort to catch up in the e-campaign. Last week the R.N.C. launched a new Internet browser toolbar to collect ""micro-donations"" from supporters.  And as the Republicans are trying to point out with their twist on Facebook, having lots of friends can have its downsides. ",2008-07-29T00:40:03+0000

(Photo: Sherri LaRose-Chiglo/St. Paul Pioneer Press, via Associated Press) )   (Photo: The entire span of the Interstate 35-W bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed last Aug. 1, a disaster later traced to a design flaw. (Photo: Photo: Allen Brisson-Smith for The New York Times))   An eerie thing happened a few days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Minnesota bridge collapse on Aug. 1. Instead of the calendar announcing that it was time to look back on the disaster last summer that left 13 people dead, a 1,200-pound chunk of concrete did the honors:  [A] 6-foot-by-9-foot section fell Saturday from the Maryland Avenue bridge onto two vehicles, choking traffic on Interstate 35E for more than eight hours as crews inspected the overpass that shuttles nearly 140,000 motorists per day through downtown St. Paul.  Luckily, no one was hurt, and the overpass itself was quickly declared ""structurally safe,"" The Associated Press reported.   Besides that crumbling concrete in Minnesota, though, there was another bracing moment in the run-up to the anniversary.  On Monday, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials unleashed all the shock and awe it could muster in an effort to foster a ""national commitment to increasing bridge investment"" aimed at preventing another collapse, whether because of deterioration and deferred maintenance or because of obsolete or flawed design, as was found to be the case with the I-35W bridge.   (Photo: Ed Rendell, the governor of Pennsylvania, leading a news conference beneath a once-dangerous bridge on Monday. (Photo: American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials))   To make its point, a news conference headlined by Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania was held -- where else? -- under a bridge, one in north Philadelphia that was closed for two days in March so that a widening crack could be mended. (It, too, is structurally sound, they say.)  ""The current generation of baby boomer bridges are showing their age, and they're going to require significant investment,"" Pete Rahn, the association's president and director of the Missouri Department of Transportation, said at the news conference. ""We must act now.""  Governor Rendell added his own take on the urgent message: ""We simply can't wait. We need solutions, not rhetoric.""  A report released by the association raised further alarms in its fine print: One out of every four bridges now in use in the United States is classified as ""structurally deficient,"" as the I-35W bridge was before it failed. That's about 152,000 bridges, a number that will only rise, according to the report:  Within the next 15 years almost half of the nation's bridges will exceed 50 years of age, exceeding the life span for which they were designed. Even now, one in five are over 50.  Fixing every bridge flagged with structural issues would cost about $140 billion, the report said -- or nearly double the $80 billion that Governor Rendell said is spent annually on all kinds of transportation infrastructure around the country.  Would the huge expense be worth it? To answer that requires a definition of the term ""structurally deficient,"" which Matthew Wald, who covers transportation issues for The New York Times, provided last year:  It means, engineers say, that the bridge can no longer carry the load it was intended to support. In many cases this means nothing, because bridges are generally designed for higher loads than the traffic imposes. In some cases, transportation officials put up signs warning away heavy trucks, or even close lanes to limit the number of vehicles.  But bridge collapses are extremely rare, and when one occurs, it is usually because a barge or truck has hit its supports.  Another part of the answer, of course, depends on what else the country may need the money for. And next year's budget priorities will be decided at a time of record federal deficits nearing a half-trillion dollars, the White House predicted on Monday. ""The bleak outlook for the budget will crimp the ability of the next president to carry out ambitious spending plans,"" The New York Times reported.  There was more bad bridge-repair news on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The Transportation Department's Highway Trust Fund is straining as Americans cut back on driving because of the slowing economy and rising gasoline prices, the paper reported. Taxes on motor fuel provide the money earmarked for the fund, a setup that had worked well for decades.   Now, the Transportation Department is trying to build support for a cash infusion, a goal already on the radar of Congress. Last week, a bill that would inject $8 billion of general tax money into the fund cleared the House despite sharp objections from the White House, which cited the mounting budget deficit among other problems. From Congressional Quarterly:  ""This bill is both a gimmick and a dangerous precedent that shifts costs from users to taxpayers at large,"" the White House said. ""Moreover, the measure would unnecessarily increase the deficit and would place any hope of future, responsible constraints on highway spending in jeopardy.""   A Republican supporter of the bill, John Mica of Florida, was just as sharp in characterizing the situation he was trying to address. ""The highway trust fund is basically busted,"" Mr. Mica told The Associated Press. ""This is a national crisis.""  The bill passed by a ""veto-proof"" margin -- 387 to 37 -- in the House, but has yet to reach a vote in the Senate. If the bill becomes law despite the president's opposition, the United States will be taking a step in the right direction for the bridge-repair advocates. But their $140 billion goal will still be many steps away on this particular anniversary.  An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to Ed Rendell in a caption as the ""former"" governor of Pennsylvania; he remains in office.  ",2008-07-29T12:54:49+0000

But who cares for the single and/or childless people? -- Posted by Cathy.    I've never married, have no children and, apart from my mother, do not have a close family. I have a ""caretaker'' personality, helping elderly neighbors, new parent neighbors, pet owner neighbors (and homeless pets), but there is no one to take care of me.... I am downright terrified. -- Posted by EMC.  Many of us who are unmarried and without children are wondering who is going to care for us when the time comes. -- Posted by Kathleen.  As a single childless woman, I share the fear of my readers, above, and no amount of financial preparation for a prolonged old age calms me. For sure, my long-term care insurance policy will buy me a home health aide and pay to retrofit my house if I'm able to remain here, or contribute to care in another setting. I have the luxury of savings and a mortgage that will be paid off by the time I'm 70. If I need a geriatric case manager, I'll probably be able to afford one. I count my blessings.   But, having witnessed the ""new old age'' from a front-row seat, I'm haunted by the knowledge that there is no one who will care about me in the deepest and most loving sense of the word at the end of my life. No one who will advocate for me, not simply for adequate care but for the small and arguably inessential things that can make life worth living even in compromised health.   My friend Esther has my health care proxy and will use it wisely, I know. But with a large family of her own, she cannot be my daily mainstay, as I was my mother's (and she was hers). My friend Jill's grown daughters have vowed, in their words, to ""feed me creamed spinach'' when the time comes. My reply: ""You'll only be able to do that, my darling girls, if your own parents don't need you at the same time.""   Another friend, Ann, shares my fantasy of setting up joint housekeeping, assuming she outlives her husband. Our thinking goes something like this: If one of us can see and the other hear, if one of us is mobile and the other cognitively intact, we'll muddle through as long as we can and then pool our insurance premiums to hire home care. We'd prefer to use the benefit for a masseuse and a manicurist but know it would be a hard sell to persuade MetLife that those were the kinds of ""activities of daily living"" our policies cover.  I've written before about pairs or small groups of unrelated women who are already doing this, some even constructing houses designed for their old age. But these arrangements, however cozy and comforting, exist outside the law, since friendship remains, and likely will always remain, an unsanctioned relationship with none of the legal rights granted to parents, children, spouses and, in some locations, domestic partners. Friends helping friends through illness or old age is a luxury of those who can afford to do it with no help from the government or their employers.   The handful of benefits available to family caregivers are not available to friends who have taken on the identical role. The most obvious example of this is the Family Medical Leave Act, which excludes friends (and also siblings!), even if they are around-the-clock caretakers, as I was for a beloved colleague during a 10-month siege of brain cancer. An A.C.L.U. attorney, at the time, was chomping at the bit to file a class-action lawsuit to try and establish that right, with me as the lead plaintiff. But -- and here comes another ""count your blessings'' moment -- my employer voluntarily cut me all the slack I needed and I was not about to reward generosity with litigation.   All of this came to mind last month when I stumbled upon an essay in The Boston Globe by Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow. She examines the ""second class'' status of friendship in ""the American hierarchy of relationships'' and describes a nascent movement to grant it legal status. The subject seems ripe for conversation at a time when more and more of us are approaching old age outside of nuclear families.     ",2008-07-29T13:03:18+0000

The detractors of ""The Dark Knight""  like New York magazine's David Edelstein  have pointed to the film's ""spectacularly incoherent"" action sequences. In Slate, Dennis Lim uses a video slide show (warning: it includes a few very violent scenes from action films) to demonstrate how the Hollywood fight scene has evolved into something that is ""fixated on chaos at the expense of clarity and precision."" Lim writes:    [T]he assaultive style that emerged in the '90s (and never went away) was associated with the decade's series of ultrachaotic blow-'em-ups, many of which emerged from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, home to such jock auteurs as Tony Scott and Michael Bay. Yet '90s action cinema is a wasteland when it comes to fight scenes. Most of these frat-metal spectaculars, obsessed with scale and volume, were too busy detonating asteroids and dropping fireballs on major metropolitan areas to bother with anything quite as puny as one-on-one combat.   The ""slice-and-dice method"" used by Christopher Nolan, the director of ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" ""robs his fights of authenticity,"" Lim writes. He later adds, ""Like the chopped-up dances in 'Chicago' and 'Moulin Rouge,' chopped-up battles obscure matters of technique and talent. (Given the importance of choreography, craft, and even chemistry, there are obvious affinities between fight scenes and dance numbers, not to mention sex scenes.)""   Lim then shows a ""show-stopping corridor fight in Korean director Park Chanwook's 'Oldboy'"" for comparison. He concludes: ""to watch this after trying to figure out what's happening between Batman and the Joker is something like going back to Astaire and Rogers after watching Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere in 'Chicago.'""

us,MetroCard Machine Problems Persist,"(Photo:  (Photo: Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times)) Subway riders seeking to use credit or debit cards at the roughly 1,600 vending machines that sell MetroCards in New York City's subway stations encountered a second day of frustration on Tuesday morning, as most of the machines refused the transactions and would only accept cash. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has deployed teams of technicians to examine the problem, said that by 9:45 a.m., most of the vending machines appeared to working again.   ""There may be some stations that haven't been rebooted, but we are processing credit/debit transactions,"" Paul J. Fleuranges, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, the arm of the M.T.A. that runs the subways and buses, wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions about the breakdowns.   The on-again, off-again pattern of breakdowns -- which were particularly acute from about 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. on Monday, then again from about 5:20 p.m. into the evening, and yet again during this morning's rush -- highlighted ordinary New Yorkers' dependence on credit and debit cards for ordinary transactions -- and, arguably, the perils involved in the transition to a largely cashless economy. There are two types of MetroCard vending machines, both of which accept credit and debit cards. The larger model accepts cash and dispenses up to $6 in change, while the smaller model does neither.  In the subway station at West 96th Street and Broadway, a handwritten sign posted onto the machines stated: ""No debit or credit cards. Use cash.""  Customers had formed lines outside the machines; several of them rummaged through wallets and pocketbooks, searching for cash. Similar problems were observed at the Pacific Street station in Brooklyn and the Times Square subway hub in Manhattan.  The MetroCard was introduced in 1994 and became the only practical way to pay transit fares by 2003, when the token was phased out. (New York City Transit buses still accept coins.) Now, only a fraction of riders pays the base fare (currently $2); most riders buy regular cards valued at $7 or more (which carry a 15 percent bonus) or unlimited-ride cards valid for seven days ($25), 14 days ($47) or 30 days ($81).  Problems with the machines are not uncommon. In early 2004, M.T.A. statistics showed that workers were called to fix the vending machines about 800 times a day -- although some of those calls were for the same machines.   Meanwhile, the M.T.A. has continued to experiment with other forms of cashless fare payment that go even beyond the MetroCard. In 2006, New York City Transit began a pilot project at several East Side subway stations that allow riders with a MasterCard PayPass to tap or wave the tag at the subway turnstile, avoiding the use of the MetroCard altogether. That experiment has been deemed a success and has been extended into this year.   City Room invites readers who experienced problems using their credit and debit cards trying to buy MetroCards this week to share their experiences using the comment box below.  We are also interested in thoughts on the notion of a cashless society: Does the convenience of not having to carry around cash outweigh the risks associated with relying on technology?

us,Censorship Reports From Olympic Press Center,"Western journalists working at the Main Press Centre in Beijing say they could not access the website for Amnesty International on Tuesday, a claim that officials with the International Olympic Committee say they are investigating, according to Reuters.  The website's unavailability came a day after Amnesty International issued a harsh report criticizing China for failing to live up to promises that it would improve its human rights record ahead of the Olympics. Kevan Gosper, chairman of the I.O.C.'s Press Commission, also said he would look into reports of slow Internet access at the Centre, which by the time the Games begin on August 8 is expected to welcome 20,000 accredited journalists.  Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director, said he began hearing about the problem after he directed reporters working at the Main Press Centre to his website to view the recently released report. ""It is really disappointing,"" he said in a telephone interview. The Chinese government's ""one big, begrudging promise was that foreign media would have free access on all issues, everywhere.""  Zarifi said that in addition to the Amnesty International site, he also received reports that other sites were also unavailable, including those belonging to the German news station Deutsche Welle and BBC's Chinese websites.  China loosened the regulations governing foreign media earlier this year and has promised the I.O.C. that journalists covering the Games would have the same freedom to report as at previous Olympics.    ""All of these things are a concern and we'll investigate them but our preoccupation is that the media are able to report on the Games as they did in previous Games,"" Gosper told Reuters.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told Reuters that while some sites -- such as those related to Falun Gong, which the Chinese government considers a cult -- are indeed being blocked, he suggested that the problem with other sites could have originated with their hosts. ""There are some problems with a lot of websites themselves that makes it not easy to view them in China,"" Liu said.  Zarifi said there had been no other complaints about his site's availability outside of China.        ",2008-07-29T16:23:05+0000

us,Sen. Stevens Indicted in Corruption Inquiry,"Updated A federal grand jury has indicted longtime Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, on charges of failing to disclose receiving gifts of services and construction work as part of a wide-ranging corruption inquiry involving public officials and corporations in his home state. The indictment accuses Mr. Stevens of failing to report on his financial disclosure forms receiving gifts of more than $250,000 -- in labor and construction materials -- from Veco Corp.  Matthew Friedrich, assistant attorney general, said that at the same time that construction and architectural work was being done by Veco Corp. executives and employees on Mr. Stevens' home in Girdwood, the corporation was seeking assistance on business-related matters. Among the services performed at the senator's Girdwood home, called the ""chalet"" by the family, was the lifting of the building onto stilts with an entirely new first floor built, as well as such amenities as a Viking grill.  Despite the fact that Veco executives had longstanding ties with Mr. Stevens and lobbied him on federal matters, Mr. Friedrich cautioned that the indictment did not allege any quid pro quo. Mr. Stevens, however, did not reimburse the corporation for any of the work done at his home, he added.   Senator Stevens issued a statement in which he proclaimed his innocence, and said:   ""I have proudly served this nation and Alaska for over 50 years. My public service began when I served in World War II. It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me. I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. Senator.  In accordance with Senate Republican Conference rules, I have temporarily relinquished my vice-chairmanship and ranking positions until I am absolved of these charges.  The impact of these charges on my family disturbs me greatly. I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that.""    Just a year ago, federal agents raided Mr. Stevens' home following questions about renovations at the home. A few months before that, an Alaska businessman, Bill J. Allen, admitted to bribery, and in court papers acknowledged making $243,000 in possibly illegal payments to a state lawmaker identified only as ""Senator B."" That abbreviation referred to Senator Ted Stevens's son, Ben Stevens.   The sprawling federal investigation that began more than four years ago has ensnared several local and state officials, as well as federal officials. The Anchorage Daily News has a breakdown of those who have been charged and/or convicted.   The 84-year-old senator has been running for re-election this year while he was under investigative scrutiny, a matter that had not gone unmentioned by Democrats. His opponent, Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich, has been campaigning hard against the longest-sitting Republican member of the Senate, and Democrats have been touting this race as among its most competitive this year.   Mr. Stevens was first appointed to the Senate in 1968, and has served nearly six full terms. He also had been a United States attorney in the 1950s.  Federal officials said they did not know whether Mr. Stevens would surrender to authorities here or in Alaska for an arraignment. Here's a link to the full indictment.

us,"At Bar Exam, No Macs Allowed","(Photo: Students taking the bar exam in 2002. (Photo: Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times))  The rumor mill about bar exam horrors chugged steadily in June and July as thousands of recent law school graduates prepared for the grueling New York State Bar Examination.   Today and Wednesday, test takers will sit for hours, proving their grasp of the intricacies of the law -- from criminal codes to contracts. Some hope they won't have to sit next to lip smackers or overzealous scribblers, others hope that their health will hold up.  Many will be praying that their computers will not have a meltdown.   ""There's no guarantee when it comes to technology,"" said John McAlary, the executive director of the New York State Board of Law Examiners. ""There's always a risk that something can go wrong.""   The New York board has allowed candidates to complete the essay parts of the bar exam on their laptops since February 2003. Last summer was the first time anyone who wanted to use a laptop could; before that, laptop spaces were allocated on a lottery system.  For all the stories of students having anxiety attacks in the exam room, there seems to be a competing number about their computers crashing and the specialized exam software going awry. To account for technology's fallibilities, the exam board issued a policy for students who opted to use their laptops. (Multiple choice questions are still done on pencil and paper.) The policy, not exactly intended to soothe, includes a list of system requirements, warnings, and disclaimers, like this one:  Technical difficulties may include hardware or software malfunctions, data saving or retrieval problems, operator errors, upload or download problems, or the loss of electrical power at the examination facility. In the event any technical difficulties occur during the bar examination, you must handwrite your essay answers in the answer books provided and no additional time may be allowed. If you choose to continue to use your computer to write your essay answers after experiencing technical difficulties, or when you have been instructed not to do so, you do so at your own risk.  For Mac users with bad handwriting, there is no keyboarding option. The exam software is designed to run on Windows systems, and the New York board included this clause in its laptop policy, warning in capital letters: ""We do not support Apple products in any form including Intel-based laptops running Boot Camp  no exceptions.""  Last summer, panic spread through various testing sites when the exam software  which locks down all programs and files except the exam  malfunctioned. Hundreds of laptop users who navigated back to a previously completed essay found a blank screen. In the months following the exam, Mr. McAlary said, the board salvaged all but 47 essays. Some of those candidates passed or failed regardless of their score on the lost essay, leaving only 15 that were given an estimated score. Nine of them passed the bar, six didn't.  The board switched to a different software vendor for the February exam, but some candidates remain wary. This summer, only half of the 12,000 test takers opted to use their laptops.  ""We have people ask, should I do it or shouldn't I do it?"" said Erica Fine, Eastern Regional Director of BAR/BRI, the bar exam preparation course. Technical problems are one concern, but lack of practice with pen and paper is another. ""Some people haven't handwritten in three years.""  At most law schools, course exams are routinely administered on laptops. Most students are familiar with exam software and accustomed to taking all their notes and outlining on laptops.  ""I was kind of scared to do the handwriting,"" said Katie Brandes, a recent graduate of Columbia Law School.  Still, even some laptop addicts will rely on their chicken scratch rather than risk a computer crash.  ""A lot of people are choosing to hand-write because their laptops are so old,"" Ms. Brandes said, referring to classmates who bought their computers at the start of law school three years ago. ""They're worried that they won't handle the software.""  For Mac users and others who might want to borrow a PC for the exam, the board offers this warning:   There are risks associated with renting or borrowing a computer for use on the bar examination. If you no longer have access to the computer after the conclusion of the examination, you may not be able to retrieve files which could assist in the recovery of missing portions of your essay answers.  Drew Kovacs, a Mac user, is not bothered. Mr. Kovacs, who graduated from the New York University School of Law, borrowed a PC from a friend who said he could keep it for the whole summer. Even if the board did offer software for Mac users, he said he still wouldn't have used it.  ""Even though I have a Mac and I like my Mac, I wouldn't have done it because it hasn't been tested on a Mac,"" he said. ""I think the software needs to develop to the point of being completely reliable.""  The New York exam is not the only one causing technical anxieties. Other states have had problems, too, and are also trying to deal with imperfections in the technology, said Erica Moeser, president of the National Conference of Bar Examiners.  The next step for the New York board is to work on approving exam software for Mac users, said Mr. McAlary. He said the board will wait for the February exam to explore the options. ""We have enough on our plate right now,"" Mr. McAlary said.     ",2008-07-29T17:31:42+0000

us,DealBook: Merrills Fire Sale May Burn Others,"Will Merrill Lynch's latest mark-downs spell trouble for other investment banks? That was one big question on Wall Street after Monday's surprise announcement that Merrill was selling a big pile of risky assets at a deep discount.   Michael Mayo, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank, is among those who think that Merrill's fire sale is a bad omen for banks holding complex, mortgage-linked securities. In a report published Tuesday, he examined Merrill's move and concluded that Citigroup may need to take an $8 billion write-down in the third quarter.   Much of what Merrill sold were called -- it's a mouthful -- United States super senior collateralized debt obligations of asset-backed securities. Known as U.S. ABS CDOs for short, these assets are often backed by large numbers of home loans.  Though they had a face value of about $30.6 billion, Merrill had been carrying these assets on its books at $11.1 billion as recently as the end of June, reflecting the serious problems in the mortgage markets.  That's a mark-down of about 64 percent. By comparison, Citigroup had marked down its ABS CDOs by 44 percent, which might have implied that Merrill was being overly pessimistic.  That could be part of the reason why Merrill's chief executive, John Thain, has repeatedly said that his firm remained well-capitalized. Merrill may have thought that it was being conservative in its accounting. And if the mortgage market got going again, those CDOs might have shot up in value.  But things turned out very differently. Under Monday's sale agreement, Merrill unloaded the securities for just $6.7 billion, or 22 cents on the dollar.   So it looks as if Merrill's bean-counters were far too optimistic -- which could be a wake-up call for other financial firms.  Banks are supposed to carry assets like these at fair value, defined as the ""price that would be received to sell an asset [...] in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants."" (That's how Merrill put it in a recent regulatory filing.)  However, CDOs are tough to sell in these troubled times. What's more, one CDO can be vastly different than another. So the price of one transaction doesn't offer a universal benchmark.  Banks often end up using internal estimates of what they believe these assets could get in a sale, drawing on external data such as housing prices and relevant market indices.  Will Wall Street take Merrill's recent deal into account?  Glenn Schorr, an analyst at UBS, thinks so. He wrote in a report Tuesday that ""we do think the CDO sale is large and diversified enough to be applicable to others with similar exposure.""   That doesn't look good for Citi and the rest of the banks holding CDOs -- which is nearly all of them. Apply Merrill's sale price to Citi's CDO exposure and that would equate to a $7 billion write-down, Mr. Mayo calculated. (He estimated an additional $1 billion in other write-downs, for a total of $8 billion.)  Mr. Schorr is a bit more cautious in applying the Merrill sale price to Citi, writing that Merrill's announcements do not necessarily imply a 40 percent write-down is in order. But he cautioned that ""directionally, we think investors should expect further incremental write-downs in coming quarters.""  Go to Article from Reuters>> ",2008-07-29T17:48:43+0000
us,Union Takes on Obama Rumors,"The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which endorsed Senator Barack Obama for president last month, announced on Tuesday that it would begin sending fliers to union members to dispel what it says are false rumors about him.  The labor federation said it would mail fliers to more than 600,000 union members in four battleground states  Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin  telling them that Mr. Obama is not a Muslim and often wears a flag pin on his lapel.  One flier, with the headline, ""Straight Answers to Real Questions,"" states: ""A lot of unfair, false rumors are being spread. Here are the answers to some of the honest questions you may have about Barack Obama.""  With regard to the widespread belief that Mr. Obama is Muslim, the flier states, ""He is a committed Christian. In 1985, he began working as a community organizer with a Christian church-based group."" Below a photo of Mr. Obama being sworn in, the flier states, ""Barack Obama took the oath of office on his personal family bible. It was Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, who was sworn in on the Koran.""  As for rumors that Senator Obama was not born in America, the flier points out that he was born in Honolulu.   The flier also addresses this question: ""Does he place his hand over his heart when he says the pledge?"" The flier answers, ""Yes, Barack Obama always places his hand over his heart during the pledge of allegiance.""  The flier gives footnotes to back each of its answers, with one pointing to a Washington Post piece explaining that a photo that showed Mr. Obama without a hand on his heart, while Senator Hillary Clinton and Gov. Bill Richardson had their right hand over their heart was taken while the national anthem was being played, and not while they were saying the pledge of allegiance.   The flier also poses the question: ""Does he wear a flag pin on his lapel?"" The answer it gives is, ""Yes, but not always. Like many presidential candidates, sometimes he wears a flag pin, sometimes he wears a breast cancer awareness pin, sometimes he wears his U.S. Senate membership pin and other times he wears no pin at all.""  On one side of the flier is a photo of two burly union members from Dayton, Ohio, Shaun Blanton and Tom Pietrzak, and next to them is the caption, ""Everyone knows it's time for a change, but people have questions about Barack Obama. There are some things we'd like to know.""  The A.F.L.-C.I.O., a federation of 56 unions representing 10 million workers, said the mailing would be targeted to ""union swing voters"" in battleground states. The federation said, ""The mailers are the leading edge of massive campaign in August to clearly define Sen. Obama among millions of union voters.""  The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is also sending out an issue-oriented flier to the more than 600,000 union members in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and one Wisconsin. In it, Bill Schultz, a retired teacher, saying, ""I'm voting for the candidate who will protect American jobs."" The flyer says: ""Barack Obama will fight to save American jobs. Obama opposed trade deals like Nafta that ship good paying jobs overseas.""  The flier also quotes Fran Benso, a member of the Communications Workers of America, saying, ""I'm voting for the candidate who will fix our health care system.""  The flier then says, ""Obama's health care plan will provide guaranteed eligibility, affordable premiums and quality care. He believes every American should have a health care plan as good as members of Congress.""  The campaign of Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has criticized Mr. Obama for attacking Nafta and for waffling about whether he supports free trade. The McCain campaign has also criticized Mr. Obama's health proposals, saying they would make big government even bigger and would cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars when its federal budget deficit is already soaring.   The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it would seek to mobilize union members and their families in 24 states overall, focusing on some 13 million people  union members, union retirees, and their family members.  In an additional effort, an A.F.L.C.I.O. affiliate, Working America, says it is reaching out to its nearly 2.5 million members, people who are not union members, but support organized labor on many issues. Working America says it has more than 160 canvassers knocking on doors each day in Ohio to discuss numerous issues, including trade policy and health care. Working America says it has 800,000 members just in Ohio.  ",2008-07-29T17:53:08+0000

us,"On Al Qaeda, Good News and Bad News","(Photo: The study counted Al Qaeda attacks from 1995 (1) to 2007 (26), excluding Iraq and Afghanistan. (Image: RAND))   In more than 200 pages, a RAND study released today takes issue with the Bush administration's ""war on terror,"" from its focus on military force to the very title of the effort.   As others have also argued, the authors of the report conclude that terrorists are criminals -- not ""holy warriors"" -- who should be fought mainly by police officers and intelligence agents under the the rubric of ""counterterrorism,"" rather than by soldiers.   Unlike some other critics of the administration, though, the RAND researchers didn't stop with a look at American strategy: they also examined al Qaeda's strategy, and saw serious shortcomings. Both sides, the report suggests, have benefited from the other's failings.   The authors reached their conclusions with the help of an immense database about terrorist groups and their activities from 1968 to 2006. Here is how the report frames one of its major questions:  How do terrorist groups end? All terrorist groups eventually end. But do they end because police or military forces defeat them? Do they end by achieving victory? Or do they end for other reasons?  [...] Terrorist groups usually end for two major reasons: They decide to adopt nonviolent tactics and join the political process, or local law-enforcement agencies arrest or kill key members of the group. Military force has rarely been the primary reason that terrorist groups end, and, since 1968, few groups have ended by achieving victory.  (Photo: A chart from the RAND study on ""How terrorist groups end."" (Image: RAND))   In making their case, the RAND authors assert that American efforts since the Sept. 11 attacks have been a mixed bag. They bottom-line it this way in layman's terms:   The good news about countering Al Qaeda is that its probability of success in actually overthrowing any governments is close to zero.  [...] The bad news is that U.S. efforts against Al Qaeda have not been successful.  (Photo: A photograph provided by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb shows Abdelmalek Droukdal, third from right, an explosives expert and leader of one of the most potent Qaeda affiliates. The photograph's authenticity was verified by The New York Times.)   As evidence, the study notes that the number of Al Qaeda attacks worldwide -- excluding Iraq and Afghanistan -- had increased after 9/11 and spiked last year to nearly double the previous high. Iraq and Afghanistan were excluded, and so were any strikes by groups without ""probable"" connections to Osama bin Laden's organization.  That left a tally of attacks that was dominated by a single country: Algeria, which was hit with 23 attacks by the group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group was the subject of an exhaustive article in The New York Times earlier this month that noted the F.B.I.'s new office in Algiers to deal with the growing threat.  Two of the remaining three incidents took place in the West Bank and injured no one, the report said, but Pakistan paid dearly for the third attack, which left the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto dead along with 24 others in December. Al Qaeda has not mounted a succesful attack on United States soil since September 2001. But RAND said that the increased activity in Northern Africa has provided the group with a crucial training ground.  Even as Al Qaeda lands blows elsewhere, the report said that the threat it poses would have been much stronger if it had built significant popular support for its cause, but it has failed to do so. ""Making a world of enemies is never a winning strategy,"" the authors noted dryly, referring to Qaeda opponents in various governments as well as public opinion.   The group's refusal to embrace health and social welfare initiatives, which have turned Hezbollah into a political force in Lebanon, also plays a role. Indeed, polio is resurgent in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where Al Qaeda is based.  Then again, there don't seem to be any examples of ""winning strategies"" for terrorist groups with as broad ambitions as Al Qaeda. As RAND found, ""No terrorist group that sought empire or social revolution ever achieved victory.""  By the same token, no long-researched report can keep up with the fast-moving events that it seeks to analyze. Just as RAND unveiled its prescription for shifting the American fight to intelligence units and working more closely with local forces, reports pf the death of a senior Qaeda trainer and weapons expert in Pakistan were circulating.   According to anonymous reports, a strike by a C.I.A. drone aircraft did him in, and a Pakistani intelligence official has said that his nation's ""active cooperation"" was a key ingredient in the attack.   Unfortunately, the Bush administration would not hit the trifecta, at least in terms of the report's recommendations.

Thus, today the Take Back the Tap water campaign, spearheaded by Food & Water Watch, a consumer rights organization, and Riverkeeper, a water protection organization, called on New York City restaurants to ban bottled water and follow the lead of some city government institutions.   Until now, it has been mostly city governments leading the tap water movement, with the United States Conference of Mayors passing a resolution recently urging that municipal governments phase out bottled water in city buildings.   Some restaurants are now embracing that policy. Among the New York restaurants that have signed a pledge with the campaign are: Gusto Grilled Organics, Gemma, Broadway East, the Birdbath bakery, Il Buco, Bobo, Pure Food & Wine,  Del Posto, Angelica Kitchen, the Diner and Marlow and Sons. The restaurants will be listed as ""water conscious"" in the online Eat Well Guide.  Drink Local, like Eat Local (like many other American food movements), got its start on the West Coast with California restaurants like Incanto in San Francisco, Poggio in Sausalito, and Alice Water's famed Chez Panisse in Berkeley first banning the bottle. Del Posto became one of the first high profile New York restaurants to join in.  Tap versus bottled in restaurants is just one skirmish in the epic face-off between the bottled water industry and environmentalists. Soaring transportation costs have been added to the debate that has centered around traditional environmental concerns about the impact of plastics manufacturing and carbon emissions in the $10 billion bottled water industry.  For the consumer, the campaign might put a stop to restaurants using bottled water as a stealth source of profits. New York, for the record, has some of the most highly regarded tap water in the world, placing well even in the local taste tests.   This could also mean an end to waiters asking awkward questions about still, sparkling or tap (tap is sometimes left off, and sometimes altogether denied). And maybe no more emptied bottles being replaced with new ones so that the unsuspecting diner finds a $60 bill for water at the end of the evening.  ",2008-07-29T19:25:17+0000

us,Paterson Warns of Economic Crisis,"Updated, 7:12 p.m. &#124; In a rare, brief televised address, Gov. David A. Paterson announced on Tuesday afternoon that he would call the Legislature into an emergency session on Aug. 19 to address what he called an economic and budget crisis confronting New York State as a result of plummeting revenues and rising costs.   The new governor avoided any mention of new taxes, instead arguing forcefully for austerity. He said he was calling on the Legislature to reduce the size of the state workforce; cut agency spending; reduce property taxes for homeowners; aid New Yorkers with the soaring costs of home energy; and even consider public-private partnerships that would take over state assets.   Mr. Paterson predicted that the budget shortfall for the next fiscal year, starting April 1, would be $6.4 billion -- much higher than the $5 billion projected when he took office unexpectedly in March, replacing Gov. Eliot Spitzer, who resigned.   ""When I travel across the state, I see communities suffering,"" Mr. Paterson said in his address, from the Red Room of the State Capitol in Albany. ""Everywhere I go, I meet people who are losing their jobs and their homes. I meet families who are forced to pay more for gasoline and for food while their paychecks stay the same. Next winter, some of these families will have to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children. The rising cost of health care means that they cannot afford to get sick.""   ""Revenues are dropping dramatically,"" the governor added. At the start of May, the state budget office projected a cumulative deficit of $21.5 billion over the next three years. Now, just two months later, that estimate has risen to $26.2 billion -- ""a staggering 22 percent increase in less than 90 days.""  Mr. Paterson offered another example of the rapid deterioration in the state's finances. In June 2007, he said, the 16 banks that pay the most on their business profits remitted $173 million to the state treasury. ""This June, just a month ago, they sent us $5 million -- a 97 percent decrease,"" he said.   Echoing testimony he offered on Monday to the State Financial Control Board, which was created in 1975 to oversee the finances of New York City during its fiscal crisis, Mr. Paterson sounded a note of alarm. ""Our economic woes are so severe that I wanted to talk to you personally this evening about where we stand,"" he said. ""The fact is we confront harsh times. Let me be honest, this situation will get worse before it gets better but the time to act is now.""   Mr. Paterson, who was the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate before being elected lieutenant governor in 2006, alluded to the longtime dysfunction in state government. ""For too long we have done less with more -- and paid more for less,"" he said.   The governor, who is legally blind, usually speaks from memory after careful preparation, and does not use prepared notes. In his address, he seemed to say that the emergency session of the Legislature would occur on Aug. 29, which is the start of the Labor Day weekend. His aides later said the actual date is Aug. 19.   He vowed, ""We will cut spending. Government will learn to do more with less."" He called for help from business and labor leaders and New York's representatives in Washington to support him.  He added, ""It is time for New York and other governments to cut up our credit cards. The era of 'buy now and pay later, and later' is over. The faster we address this crisis, the faster and stronger we will emerge from it.""   In a written response e-mailed to reporters moments after the governor's address, the new State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, offered a fairly conciliatory reaction to Mr. Paterson's remarks. Mr. Skelos said in his statement:   The Governor's speech on the dire state of the economy confirms what most New Yorkers already know: middle-class taxpayers are feeling a crunch from high property taxes, high gas prices, and rising energy and health care costs, and they need some relief.  Mr. Skelos urged Mr. Paterson and the Democratic-controlled State Assembly to cap the annual growth in state spending at 4 percent or less. (Mr. Paterson has agreed to a cap on property taxes, but has faced resistance from the Assembly.)   The Republican have held onto their razor-thin majority in the State Senate in part by holding onto support from unions, and Mr. Skelos said the state should ""minimize any disruption"" that would be caused by trimming the workforce. ""In the past, the State rightly offered early retirement and other cost-cutting incentives to reduce the workforce through attrition, rather than through painful cuts,"" Mr. Skelos said.   Mr. Skelos also said he had decided to call on members of the Senate to return to Albany on Aug. 8 to meet in a special session to act on the property tax cap and on education spending proposals.   Speaker Sheldon Silver of the State Assembly released a statement on Tuesday evening that acknowledged the economic distress but also made clear that the Assembly would not simply go ahead with a blanket program of cutbacks:   In every period of economic decline, the call for cuts and caps gives rise to the same, important questions. What programs will be cut? Whose services will be diminished or eliminated?   Mr. Silver replied, ""Our answer is that middle class families and our working poor must not be forced to bear the brunt of such cuts."" He specifically said that the Assembly would fight for universally available prekindergarten; public school financing; reductions in class size; aid for nursing homes and home-care services for the elderly; and affordable housing.   Mr. Silver concluded:   There are tough choices to be made; choices that must reflect our priorities as a state. If it is our intention to ask working families to shoulder the burden of these cuts, we must ensure that our most affluent citizens share that burden. At the same time, we expect Washington to acknowledge New York's economic hardship and to provide this state with the assistance we deserve and need.  Regarding the Governor's call for a property tax cap, let me reiterate that we can support such a cap so long as this state honors its commitment to our children's education. To provide immediate relief to our property taxpayers, we are recommending a fully financed property-tax ""circuit breaker.""   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who like Mr. Paterson has warned that New York City faces a tough fiscal situation, said in a statement:   Governor Paterson tonight laid out the extraordinary budget challenges faced by New York State, and all New Yorkers should appreciate that he is moving now  rather than waiting until next year or until after the next election  to tackle the serious problems we face. As we've seen in New York City, government budget cuts never come easy but can be done. The Governor demonstrated that he is ready to stand up to the interest groups that will no doubt protest before the Statehouse, just as they took to the steps of City Hall earlier this year. Tonight's speech was an urgent call to action, and the Governor has my support in developing solutions that work for the people of the City and the State.    ",2008-07-29T21:22:35+0000

us,Democrats to Spend $20 Million to Woo Latino Voters,"The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee plan to spend $20 million on a grassroots organizing and advertising effort aimed at shoring up the support of Hispanics, one of the country's fastest growing demographic groups.  The campaign said it would pour resources into every state, running paid advertisements and conducting voter mobilization activities, online and on the ground. More of the money will flow to battleground states and those with large Hispanic populations, like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico, according to Frank Sanchez, the chairman of the Obama campaign's National Hispanic Leadership Council.  The Obama campaign has said that Hispanics could tip the balance in a number of key swing states, and they're betting their investment will pay off in November.   The D.N.C. and the Obama campaign will jointly finance the effort. They noted that the $20 million sum was more than double what the Bush and Kerry campaigns spent altogether on Hispanic outreach during the 2004 election, according to a Johns Hopkins University study.  Both campaigns have been actively courting Hispanics this year, though Mr. Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, appears to be doing better than his Republican rival, Senator John McCain, among the group. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted earlier this month showed Mr. Obama leading Mr. McCain among Hispanics 62 to 23 percent.  On a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Linda Chavez-Thompson, the vice-chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, asserted that Hispanics do not trust Mr. McCain because, as she put it, ""he walked away"" from a comprehensive reform proposal he had co-sponsored. She called it ""a betrayal of the voters of this country.""  Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, fired back on behalf of the McCain campaign, saying that Mr. McCain ""doesn't need an introduction to the Hispanic community.""  ""John McCain has been working for more than two decades for the values, principles and issues Latinos care about. Hispanics will elect the next President of the United States based on who has the best record, experience and is better prepared to move this country forward,"" Mr. Diaz-Balart said in a statement.

us,Swarm,"For the last few weeks, one of my two hives has been itching to swarm. Swarming is a natural phenomenon of a beehive. Whether from cramped quarters, poor nectar flow, or a species' inherent tendency to propagate, a hive will prod a queen to get into flying shape so that all the bees that are able to fly (and that are home at the time) can migrate to new quarters.   The swarming instinct has an inverse relationship to the nectar flow: in other words, when the nectar and pollen are flowing in the spring and fall, a hive is generally content (and busy). During the dog days of summer, however, when it's wiltingly hot (or there are torrential downpours as we have had in the East), and a food source is limited, a hive will swarm.  A good beekeeper tries to stay a step or two ahead of the hive to prevent swarms. As this column has already established, I have no claim to the status ""good."" Thus my first inclination was to treat the symptom (versus the underlying cause). My homespun remedy to deal with the agitated swirling mass of bees at the front of the hive was to put a burning stick of incense at the front door. I use white sage, which is the same scent as the garden sage I use in my smoker when I open up the hive for serious inspection. The curling wisps of smoke rise up through the swirling bees, and they calm down within minutes. I assume they send a message to the bees in the hive that there is a fire nearby and that this in not a good time to swarm.  Given the low nectar flow and the fact that I had recently added supers with empty comb to the hive, I couldn't imagine that the hive was honey-bound (meaning the bees had filled all available comb with honey and had nowhere else to work). When I opened up the hive on the first sunny day between deluges, I quickly realized my mistake. It wasn't that the comb was all filled -- there was plenty of space for honey. Rather, it was that the queen in my ""good child"" hive was doing exactly what she was supposed to do: crank out workers.   Every frame of every box was crawling with bees. They were packed in like sardines. I quickly added a super without any drawn comb in it, hoping that would not only provide room for growth, but also keep the bees busy producing wax.   To atone for my bad beekeeping behavior, I took a handful of wax caps still wet with honey from last season's harvest and left it on the front stoop of the hive. It was gone within 20 minutes. Sorry, girls!  (Photo: A disorderly swirl of bees begins to mass in front of this hive. The stick of incense is visible on top of the glass Mason jar.)   (Photo: A hive should generally look like this, with an orderly flight pattern in and out. This is the same hive as in the previous photo after a few minutes' dose of incense.)   (Photo: There is still plenty of space for the bees to fill in the honeycomb.)   (Photo: Crowding in the hive is apparent from the number of bees packed on top of these frames. But a beekeeper needs to pull the frame out to make sure it is really loaded with bees.)   (Photo: To make up for my negligence, I placed a handful of honeyed wax from last year's harvest on the front porch of the hive. This mass of bees worked it down to nothing in about 20 minutes.)   (Photo: I scraped off some propolis from one of the frames and formed it into a ball. (Propolis is a resinous material the bees make to seal their hives.) Two hours later, I was still trying to scrub off the residue from my fingers.) ",2008-07-29T22:01:24+0000

us,"Big East Media Day: Its Unanimous, Syracuse Is No Good","NEWPORT, R.I.  The 24 members of the news media who voted in the leagues preseason media poll agreed on one thing  Syracuse will be the worst team in the Big East in 2008. All 24 of them voted the Orange last, the latest in a flurry of signs that Syracuse football has bottomed out.Under the fourth-year coach Greg Robinson, the Orange is mired in the worst stretch in team history. Things are so bleak in Central New York that the Vegas over-under for victories for the Orange this is season is 2.5, and Syracuse has already been installed as a double-digit underdog in its opening game at Northwestern.Unless a miraculous turnaround comes, this will be Robinsons last year on the Hill. Its the most obvious looming story line for the Orange as it gets ready for the season. (And as evidence by this blog post, some Syracuse fans appear tired of Robinsons rhetoric by now.)Syracuse guard Ryan Durand acknowledged that Robinson was on the hot seat.He said: Obviously we know about it. Everyone on the team knows about it. But its not a dark cloud, its not a motivation. Our motivator is to win games, for us. Coach Robinson is one of us. But I want to win for the tackle and center next to me. I just want to win. Thats the name of the game.He added: Its never been addressed on the team. Its one of those things that doesnt need to be said. Everyone knows whats going on and what our mission is. Its one of those things we dont need to talk about. Its really silly to talk about it.Durand was more than happy to talk about the new offensive coordinator Mitch Bronwing, a coup of a hire by Robinson considering the slim chances of the Orange retaining him next season. Browning sat out last season after working for Glen Mason at Minnesota, and his resume includes tailbacks Laurence Maroney and Marion Barber III. His main focus will be to overhaul one of the countrys consistently bad units  during Robinsons tenure. The Orange gave up 54 sacks last season and 45 the previous year. Browning is regarded as an great molder of offensive linemen, and hes had all of the Orange linemen slim down, including having the tackles lose as many as 30 pounds.Durand, who has had four offensive coordinators in five years, called him a breath of fresh air.But breathing life into the corpse that is the Syracuse football program may be too much of a task for Browning.

us,Obama Warmly Received by Democratic House Caucus,"(Photo: Senator Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Cannon House Office Building on Tuesday. (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters))   WASHINGTON  The questions for Senator Barack Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, were the sort of stuff he gets asked all the time: How would he deal with Iran; how would he handle the record-high $482 billion budget deficit that he would inherit if he is elected; how about infrastructure and transportation?  But the questioners this time were House Democrats, the raucous caucus of lawmakers who hope to be Mr. Obama's governing partners should he win the White House.  Just back from his trip to the Middle East and Europe, Mr. Obama made a swing by the south side of the Capitol late Tuesday afternoon for a policy discussion. It is part of a stepped-up effort by the Obama campaign to reach out to Congress, where the Democrats are all but certain to retain control and perhaps extend their majorities.  The caucus room of the Cannon House Office Building was so crowded that some members of Congress did not have seats.  The question about Iran came from Representative Howard Berman of California, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Obama said the United States had to lay down clear markers and insist they not be crossed.   The question about public works projects came from Representative James L. Oberstar, the chairman of the Infrastructure and Transportation Committee. Mr. Obama said he could think of no better way to put Americans back to work.  A Democratic leadership aide in the room said Mr. Obama's over-arching message was that he was looking forward to working to working with the Democratic Congress. ""This was 'Hey, we need to work together, and you guys have tons of experience,' "" the aide said.  As usual, it was a mix of Mr. Obama strutting his political stuff but showing deference to his audience. When Representative Jim Matheson of Utah asked about the budget deficit, Mr. Obama shared his thoughts, but noted that Representative John M. Spratt Jr., the chairman of the Budget Committee, was the real expert in the room.  Unlike his last visit, which was a hand-shaking, back-slapping, hug-fest in the House chamber, the discussion on Wednesday was relatively low key. Mr. Obama got a standing ovation and warm introductions from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Rahm Emanuel, the conference chairman.  Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, asked if Mr. Obama might really ask Robert M. Gates to stay on as defense secretary. Nobody asked about Mr. Obama's deliberations on a running mate, though presumably there were some willing volunteers in the crowd.  He left, as he arrived, to a standing ovation.

us,Reid Dares Republicans to Stay Over Break,"WASHINGTON -- The indictment of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska on Tuesday lifted Democrats' hopes of winning a Senate seat in Alaska -- a feat they have not accomplished in the Last Frontier since 1974.  But the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, said he was actually feeling good about Senate races across the country. And he said that if Republicans wanted to stay in Washington through August to debate energy policy instead of going home to campaign, well, that was just fine by him.  With a bitter fight raging over how to address high gasoline prices, some Republicans have intimated that the Senate should not leave for the August recess at the end of this week unless it can pass some sort of energy legislation. In fact, the Democrats have not officially ""recessed"" for more than a year because they do not want to give President Bush the chance to make appointments to vacant jobs that require Senate confirmation.   And Mr. Reid said he would be happy to have Republicans join the lone Democrat coming in to open the Senate during the break. ""We don't need the Republicans' permission to adjourn,"" he said, scoffing at the question at a news conference on Tuesday. ""We're going to be in pro form session. This is because of President Bush not being fair on nominations. So we're going to be here anyway.""  But then, feeling feisty about the Democrats' election prospects, he basically dared Republicans to stick around Washington. ""We do not have a single Democratic incumbent -- has any trouble at all. We're in great shape,"" Mr. Reid said. ""There are 11 Republicans that we have races that they should be worried about, and they are worried about them.""   ""So if they want to stay here and work during the August recess, it's fine with us,"" he continued. ""I'm not sure it's fine with the Republican senators who have these challengers with them. But we're here. I have no problem. If they -- if they think that it's going to hurt us in any way, I'm not concerned at all, because it won't hurt us one bit.""  Republicans are certainly concerned about November -- they are at a numerical disadvantage having to defend 23 seats compared to just 12 for Democrats -- but they are hardly as concerned as Mr. Reid suggested.   Still, with the indictment of Mr. Stevens dominating news coverage, Republicans generally avoided public comment on Tuesday. So it remains to be seen if they will take up the dare. Stay tuned.

Now an artist is using that interrogation technique  which makes people feel as if they were drowning  to raise awareness of the issue of torture. The artist, Steve Powers, opened The Waterboarding Thrill Ride on Saturday in the Coney Island arcade in Brooklyn. An animatronic diorama that depicts a prisoner being waterboarded, it is being presented by Creative Time, the public art organization, as part of an initiative called Democracy in America: The National Campaign. The piece, which occupies a former photo booth redesigned as a jail cell on West 12th Street in Coney Island, will be on view to the public throughout the summer. Viewers can see the scene through cell bars after paying $1 outside. Humor has long been a strategy for speaking the unspeakable, Anne Pasternak, the president and artistic director of Creative Time, said in a statement, and it is vital that we as a nation begin a dialogue about the implications of waterboarding. In mid-August Mr. Powers and several lawyers will be waterboarded by a trained professional in a secret location in Coney Island as a private performance.

The judge, Thelma Simpson, is allowing the teenagers involved to testify through closed-circuit television; she also granted the prosecution a request that the proceedings, which are expected to last the rest of the week, be closed to the public.

Indicative of his classy nature, Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese refrained from talking about this being his final season in the job during his remarks at the leagues media day Tuesday.But one of the main questions here was who would replace Tranghese, one of the most respected leaders in college sports. The early consensus is that there is no consensus, unlike the Pac-10, which appears to be leaning toward hiring the former Stanford athletic director Ted Leland.The best list I could scrape together includes the senior associate commissioner John Marinatto, the associate commissioner Nick Carparelli, the associate commissioner Dan Gavitt, Louisville Athletic Director Tom Jurich and Connecticut Athletic Director Jeff Hathaway. Dont be surprised if a dark horse emerges, though. Marinatto would be considered the favorite, but theres a lot of golf left to play.The co-chairmen in charge of the search are the Pittsburgh president, Mark A. Nordenberg, and the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia. Nordenberg checked in by phone to talk about the process. Here are a few highlights.He called it a critical hire because of all the hard work Tranghese had done to position the Big East among the B.C.S. conferences after the defections to the A.C.C. Nordenberg played down the notion of whether the candidate would be a football or basketball guy; the league has eight football-playing members and 16 in basketball.In terms of the general functioning of the conference today, I dont really sense that tension as a constant part of life, Nordenberg said. Clearly both sports are very important to us. It would be hard to imagine that we would recommend someone not committed to both and a capable leader in terms of pushing both sports forward.Football is generally given priority in college sports because it generates more television and ticket revenue.Nordenberg didnt give a whole lot of hints as to what type of candidate the Big East would be looking for. Tranghese said in his teleconference to announce his impending retirement that hed prefer his replacement to be someone familiar with the Big East. Nordenberg said that he understood that thinking but that the league would be open to outside candidates as well.Nordenberg said the league would begin a deliberate search once the school year begins and said that Tranghese had shown flexibility in moving forward.Mike has been totally himself, Nordenberg said, indicating that his own personal plans can be adjusted to the needs of the conference. That is, if we find someone early, hell leave early. If it takes long, and that means extending his time, he can adjust to that as well. Were not locked into any time frame.Stay tuned to what will surely be one of the most intriguing hires in college sports this year. ",2008-07-30T06:25:00+0000

us,Randy Pausch's Last Words,"(Photo: A crowd filled an auditorium at the University of Virginia in November to hear Randy Pausch, a former professor there. (Kaylin Bowers/Daily Progress, via Associated Press))   Carnegie Mellon Professor Randy Pausch is best known for the words of wisdom and wit he delivered during a now famous ""Last Lecture"" and subsequent best-selling book.  And so it probably comes as no surprise that the final words uttered by Dr. Pausch before his death last Friday from pancreatic cancer reflected the same humor and good nature that made him an Internet celebrity.  Last night, ABC aired a tribute to Dr. Pausch, replaying a Diane Sawyer special about his life and experiences that first aired in the spring. The segment also included new interviews with his close friend Steve Seabolt, who was with Randy during his final moments and noted that his ""trademark wit and intellect were intact.''  Mr. Seabolt only shared a few moments with viewers, noting that even near death, Dr. Pausch's sense of humor remained. He said Dr. Pausch talked about how glad he was that he was home and his family and friend were close, and laughed, saying, ""I just feel so bad about the dying part.""  Mr. Seabolt also relayed a conversation he had with Dr. Pausch's 6-year-old son, Dylan. They were talking about cancer and he told the boy that ""some problems can't be solved, or they can't be solved yet.''  Dylan responded, ""My daddy has taught me that every problem can be solved, and that I should believe that every problem can be solved, and that I'm strong enough and smart enough that I should never let a problem get in my way.""  At the end, as Dr. Pausch's body was clearly failing, Mr. Seabolt said he told his friend, ""It's important for you to feel like you can let go. It's okay.""  Dr. Pausch's reply: ""I'll get back to you on that.''  And those, according to Mr. Seabolt, were the final words of Randy Pausch. ",2008-07-30T13:39:52+0000

Karlan &#124; 6:20 p.m.:  John Eastman's second post, along with a number of the readers' comments, prompts me to make the following points.  The first is about titles. John is 100 percent right both about the fact that ""professor"" is often used as a courtesy title to refer to law school teachers whatever their formal rank. (Students usually call every teacher either ""Mr.""  or ""Ms.""  X or ""Professor X."" I've never heard a single one call a teacher ""Lecturer X."") He's also 100 percent right that it would be very, very rare for anyone to have been appointed in recent times to a regular tenured position at a school like Chicago without any scholarship at all.  That being said, titles like ""senior lecturer"" differ from school to school. They're sometimes used for long-term appointments for people of great professional distinction who come to the academy, later in their careers. And some schools even have positions accompanied by the title ""professor"" that do not require prior publication experience. For example, here at Stanford, we have the Warren Christopher Professorship of the Practice of International Law and Diplomacy. It's been held by two very distinguished people  Allan Weiner, who has decided to stay on at Stanford as a Senior Lecturer, actually, and who is now writing very interesting and important scholarship  and by William Taft IV, who has served, among other posts, as general counsel and deputy secretary in the Department of Defense, U.S. Ambassador to NATO, and the U.S. Department of State's legal adviser, the highest legal position in the department. But neither Allan nor Will was given the Christopher Professorship because of traditional scholarly publication.  *****  Jodi Kantor &#124; 3:48 p.m.: Several readers have asked questions about Mr. Obama's status at the school. Let me clarify: he started teaching as a lecturer, meaning as a member of the adjunct faculty. But in 1996, he was promoted to senior lecturer, which in Chicago's parlance, made him a professor.  When the law school tried to hire Mr. Obama after his failed 2000 congressional race, it was for a tenured job, according to Daniel Fischel, the dean at the time. In our interview, I asked him if he meant ""tenure-track,"" and he said no. ""He would be hired as a tenured professor,"" he explained. The faculty would vote, but Mr. Obama already had their support, he added.  Accordingly, a reader asks: ""I'd like to know how unusual it is for an elite law school like Chicago to offer a tenured position to a professor who has not produced any academic writing.""  Now over to John Eastman, for an answer:  One of the comments challenges Ms. Kantor's use of the term, ""professor,"" to describe Barack Obama's position at the University of Chicago Law School. Chicago uses the formal title of ""lecturer"" for adjunct professors, and it was in that capacity that Senator Obama was first affiliated with the law school. He was at the time affiliated with a law firm, and there is nothing unusual in law schools, even elite law schools such as Chicago, tapping into local law firms for adjunct faculty. Nor is there anything unusual in students referring to adjuncts and ""lecturers"" as ""professor.""  What is unusual is the University of Chicago's ""promotion"" of Senator Obama to the position of ""senior lecturer."" As the law sSchool correctly points out on its Web site, that title is used for such long-established legal scholars as Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, both of whom continued to teach after their appointment to the United States Court of Appeals. Both were (and remain) extremely prolific scholars as well as teachers, and the ""senior lecturer"" title was acknowledge of that status and their judicial ""day job."" Barack Obama never achieved such a scholarly statureindeed, it does not appear that he engaged in legal scholarship at all. And to my knowledge, the title of ""senior lecturer"" has never been applied to someone who was basically an adjunct professor.  Even more unusual is Chicago's claim that Barack Obama was offered a fully tenured position. The University of Chicago is one of the most elite law schools in the country, and it would be extremely rare for the law school to offer a tenure-track position to someone without any legal scholarship, much less one with tenure. The course materials and examination questions prepared by then-Professor Obama demonstrate a deep and nuanced command of the law, but for that to have resulted in an offer to the tenured or even tenure-track faculty, the normal course (indeed, nearly the only course) is for that command of legal subjects to have first manifested itself into published articles.   Perhaps then-Professor Obama's observation of the way other legal scholars such as Robert Bork and Lani Gunier had had their work distorted for partisan political purposes counseled him against publication of his scholarly views. Too bad for us, and for the legal academy more generally. The chilling effect on true and important scholarship that has resulted from the last few decades of obnoxious confirmation fights is quite evident in Senator Obama's prior silence.  *****  Jodi Kantor &#124; 3:37 p.m.:  We've been talking today about Mr. Obama's voice as a professor, and now, thanks to WBEZ in Chicago, we can actually hear that voice.   In a follow-up to our article, the Chicago public radio station has posted audio of a 2001 appearance in which Mr. Obama discussed Dred Scott and Plessy v. Ferguson, landmark cases that upheld, respectively, slavery and segregation.  *****  Pamela S. Karlan, a law professor at Stanford, an expert on voting issues and a former clerk to Justice Harry A. Blackmun, concludes that ""it's hard to tell whether Professor Obama is simply playing it close to his vest  that is, he has strong views but thinks the classroom isn't an appropriate place for revealing them  or whether his views fall within the mainstream of the constitutional law professoriate, which tends to be moderately liberal on individual rights issues.""  Examining the Course Materials   Pamela S. Karlan &#124; 1:30 p.m.:  Three preliminary reactions to this really interesting story.  1. In thinking about what inferences we might draw about a President Obama from a Professor Obama, we're handicapped a little by a distinctive aspect of the University of Chicago Law School's constitutional law curriculum. Unlike most other first-tier American law schools, Chicago separates into two separate courses what are often referred to as the ""structural"" and ""individual rights"" provisions of the Constitution. (This is probably more a function of the fact that Chicago uses three shorter terms each academic year, rather than the more conventional two longer ones, so each course covers a bit less territory.)  So the course that Professor Obama taught did not examine many of the issues that have come to the forefront of constitutional debate during the last eight years  such as the president's inherent powers under Article II of the Constitution to disregard limitations placed on his authority by Congress or other aspects of what's referred to as ""separation of powers"" (the checks and balances among the three branches of government).  The only slight hint we get about the war on terror, for example, comes from one question about handing out limited supplies of an anti-biological weapon drug, and there we're focusing on individual rights, not the government's powers.  2. Looking at the exams for the Constitutional Law class, one of the most striking features to a law professor is how conventional they are. If you put Professor Obama's exam questions in a pile with the questions asked by me or my colleagues  or if you asked one of us to prepare model answers to his exam questions  you would not be able to guess which ones he prepared and which ones were prepared by full-time legal academics.  There are at least three inferences I draw from this. First, Senator Obama has a first-rate mind for legal doctrine and could have been a first-rate academic had his interests gone in that direction. He would have been most unlikely  even beyond the fact that his values differ  to have bought into the legal work underlying many of the current Administration's policies, such as the incomplete ""torture memos.""   Second, Senator Obama has a sensitivity to role. By this I mean that he doesn't appear to have used his classroom as a platform for pushing his own pet theories of constitutional law. He seems to have taught ""down the middle"" in a way that gave the students the tools to be fine constitutional lawyers but didn't require them to agree with his position. By contrast, I've seen other constitutional law professors' exams and model answers where a student who disagrees with the professor's idiosyncratic approach or policy preferences would have found it hard to do well.  Third, and perhaps related, precisely because the examinations and the model answers are so conventional, it's hard to tell whether Professor Obama is simply playing it close to his vest  that is, he has strong views but thinks the classroom isn't an appropriate place for revealing them  or whether his views fall within the mainstream of the constitutional law professoriate, which tends to be moderately liberal on individual rights issues.  3. The syllabus for Professor Obama's Racism and the Law class is an interesting one. The materials are not particularly surprising, but seem relatively well thought-out. But their focus, as well as the focus of the exam questions, tends to be almost entirely on blacks and whites, with only one session devoted to the distinctive issues surrounding Native Americans  and that session being primarily historical  and relatively little attention devoted to questions that arise with respect to Latinos.  That's not surprising as a matter of law school syllabi  the black-white paradigm remains dominant. And the syllabus is fifteen years old. But it's interesting that Senator Obama, despite having spent many years in Hawaii, where a number of very interesting questions about multiracial groups and indigenous people have been playing out, hewed so closely to the black-white line. I would imagine if he were teaching such a course today, he might have ranged further afield.  Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, writes that Mr. Obama's exam questions seem to be designed to ""ferret out the student's understanding, but also the cracks and fissures in the Supreme Court's current approach to the Constitution.""  Randy Barnett &#124; 12:15 p.m.: While the course materials themselves do not tell us very much about Senator Obama, the candidate, what they do tell us about Obama, the teacher, is generally favorable. I was particularly intrigued by his 1994 syllabus on ""Racism and the Law."" The materials assigned were balanced, including several readings by Frederick Douglass, who many modern race theorists have come to disparage as insufficiently radical (as Obama would know), along with an exchange between Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy on the one hand and Charles Cooper (who is now on Senator McCain's advisory committee) and Texas law professor Lino Graglia on the other. All three essays appeared in the conservative/libertarian Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy as part of a 1991 symposium on ""The Future of Civil Rights Law"" and were initially presented at the Federalist Society's 1990 National Student Symposium held at Stanford. The articles were published during Obama's third year as a law student so it is not surprising that he would be aware of them. And they would have been fresh at the time they were assigned.  I was struck by Obama's list of possible discussion topics for his seminar. They comprehensively and concisely identified most of the issues of ""race and the law"" that were then being widely discussed. What particularly impressed me was how even handed were his presentations of the competing sides the students might take. These summaries were remarkably free of the sort of cant and polemics that all too often afflicts academic discussions of race. Were this not a seminar on ""racism and the law"" I doubt one could tell which side of each issue the teacher was on. And indeed, even knowing it was written by Senator Obama, one cannot be sure which side of each issue he really took. Whatever position he held, however, Obama could clearly see and dispassionately articulate the other side.  The exam question and answer keys manifest a keen comprehension of then-prevailing Supreme Court Due Process and Equal Protection Clause doctrine. There is no doubt that his students were taught ""the law"" (such as it was), not merely the teacher's viewpoints. His exam questions were nicely designed to ferret out the student's understanding, but also the cracks and fissures in the Supreme Court's current approach to the Constitution. What they did not show, however, were any insights on how he thought Supreme Court doctrine could be improved.  Indeed, if one is looking to these material to learn more about Senator Obama's own views of either ""racism and the law"" or the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, one will be disappointed. He either was skillful at concealing his own take on these issues both in these materials and in the classroom (as reported by his former students) or he held no deep commitments on what one would think were matters of central concern to him. While this latter possibility would make him a flexible politician, it is bound to disappoint his most vehement supporters and detractors alike. In the end, while they confirm that the former president of the Harvard Law Review is a smart guy, and an exceptionally fair-minded teacher, they tell us little about his core beliefs on the very sensitive issues covered by these courses. Nor perhaps should we have expected them to.  *****  The next post is from Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of constitutional law at Yale and a former clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer, who compliments the quality of Mr. Obama's exam questions.   Akhil Reed Amar &#124; 11:51 a.m.: Barack Obama's exam questions and answers engaged me on several levels.  First, As a constitutional law professor, I came away impressed  dazzled, really  by the analytic intelligence and sophistication of these questions and answers. A really good exam  an exam that tests and stretches the student, while simultaneously providing the professor with a handy and fair index to rank the class  is its own special art form. Composing such an exam is like crafting a sonnet or a crossword puzzle. We don't have Obama's answer key every year; but the questions themselves are in many instances beautifully constructed to enable students to explore the seams and plumb the depths of the Supreme Court's case law. I am tempted to use variations of several of these questions myself in some future exam. (I won't say which, lest I tip my students off.) When I read Jodi Kantor's piece, I was very interested to hear that the University of Chicago Law School was willing to offer Obama tenure. In these materials I see why.   Second, as a student of history, I couldn't help thinking of Lincoln. Not just because we have a skinny guy from Illinois who is largely self-made and who can write a great speech  I knew that already. Lincoln was a brilliant lawyer, who did his own thinking and writing and cut to the essence of hard legal issues with amazing incisiveness. Lincoln understood the Constitution and its deepest structures as well as or better than any of the Justices on the Supreme Court of his day. These materials helped me see Obama in a similar light.  Which brings me to the last level  the moral level. Like Lincoln, Jefferson and Madison were also brilliant. But Jefferson and Madison lived and died as slaveholders and did much less than they could have done to put slavery on a path of ultimate extinction. Nixon had a keen legal mind, but a large moral blind spot. Lincoln had a rare combination of moral depth and legal brilliance. Make no mistake, he was a politician who understood how to tack and trim. But he was a politician with a strong moral compass and a deep understanding of the rule of law. Similarly, there is a great deal of moral seriousness in Obama's legal materials. They are not just about technical and technocratic legal questions. Some of the great mysteries and tragedies of human life and American society  involving marriage, divorce, childbearing, cloning, the right to die with dignity, infertility, sexual orientation, and yes, of course, race  are probed in these materials in ways that encourage students to think not just about law, but about justice, and truth, and morality.  *****  First up, John C. Eastman, Dean and Donald P. Kennedy Chair in Law at Chapman University and a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas:  John C. Eastman &#124; 11:11 a.m.:  Although Senator Obama's teaching position at the University of Chicago Law School overlapped my own time there as a student, I did not have occasion to take one of his classesI tended to register for the classes of the full-time tenured faculty rather than those taught by adjuncts such as Mr. Obamabut I am not surprised to see the intellectual diversity for which Chicago is famous reflected in then-Professor Obama's course syllabi and examinations. The syllabus from the 1994 ""Current Issues in Racism and the Law"" course is particularly instructive. While at many law schools, such courses are frequently taught by critical race theorists who focus largely on one side of a complex legal and policy debate, then-Professor Obama's course included, quite appropriately in my view, readings from across the ideological spectrum, from Derrick Bell and Malcolm X to Chuck Cooper and Lino Graglia.   I was particularly pleased to see a reading from the classic work by Vattel, one of the leading international law theorists in all of human history, The Law of Nations. What is more, it is evident from the sampling of proposed topics for group presentations contained in the syllabus that this spectrum of authors was included for more than mere exposure. Rather, it appears that then-Professor Obama was leading his students in an honest assessment of competing views regarding some of the most difficult legal and policy issues our nation has ever faceda refreshing change from what passes for debate about contested questions in our political classes these days. My one criticism of the course is his recommendation that students read Derrick Bell's summary of some landmark (if notorious) Supreme Court decisions. Cases such as Dred Scott v. Sanford, The Slaughterhouse Cases, and Plessy v. Ferguson, and in particular the strong dissenting opinions in those cases, cry out for careful study of the original materials, not a secondary summary.  Only occasionally do then-Professor Obama's decidedly personal views come across. He refers to Justice Scalia's approach to assessing fundamental rights as ""cramped,"" for example. But on the whole, this is a body of course materials that is as would be expected of Chicago Law Professors.  ****  Original Post &#124; July 29:  An excerpt from the syllabus for Barack Obama's 1994 Current Issues in Racism and the Law seminar. In the course of reporting  an article on the 12 years that Barack Obama spent teaching law at the University of Chicago, we unearthed some of Mr. Obama's old class materials: the syllabus and assignments for his ""Racism and the Law"" seminar, as well as a set of his constitutional law exams and a partial set of memos he wrote about the answers.  The documents let us hear his voice as a professor, asking students to wrestle with hot-button topics like cloning and reparations. He tells students what he wants and interrogates them on what they have learned. In his little asides about gym visits and his wife, Michelle, we hear hints of his professorial style.  But the documents also offer clues about his thinking. They show us whose writings he wanted students to explore, from Malcolm X to Robert Bork. He framed complex legal, moral and political issues for his students, and in the case of post-exam memos, answered a few problems for them. Those memos also contain a few references to still-sitting Supreme Court justices.  We're posting the documents here, and inviting you to offer your insights. Since the exam questions in particular involve hard-to-parse issues of constitutional law, we have asked four legal experts, of diverse ideological backgrounds, to lead our inquiry. John Eastman, Randy Barnett, Pamela S. Karlan and Akhil Reed Amar have already looked through the documents, at our request, and on Wednesday we will post their assessments here.  Some of the questions we've asked them to consider: Based on what you see here, how does Mr. Obama's teaching measure up? What do the courses he taught, and the way he taught them, tell us about his interests, beliefs and priorities, including his approach to the Constitution?   We will be integrating reader questions and comments into the discussion, so please post yours below. Everyone is welcome: readers, constitutional law professors, former students and colleagues of Mr. Obama's. (As for the documents, if you're not a lawyer, you will probably find the ""Racism and the Law"" syllabus a more satisfying read than the constitutional law exams.)    2003 Final Exam   2002 Final Exam   2001 Final Exam   2000 Final Exam  1999 Final Exam  1998 Exam  1997 Final Exam &#124; Answer Memo  1996 Final Exam &#124; Answer Memo   Reporting was contributed by Adrian Florido.

us,Kevin Martin's Open Network Manifesto,"UPDATE &#124; 4:12  Kevin Martin's spokesman called with some clarifications. See below.  Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Photo: Isaac Brekken/Associated Press Open was the word of the day for Kevin J. Martin, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, when he stopped by our offices Tuesday to meet with a group of reporters and editors. He was pleased that that he had been able to get two other commissioners to back his plan to sanction Comcast for interfering with some customers' use of file-sharing software. (The final vote will be on Friday.)   And he was eager to suggest that this move reflects a standard of openness that should apply to cable, telephone and wireless networks.    ""That precedent is going to be increasingly applied,"" he said. ""We are setting a very high bar on what network operators can do in terms of putting limits on consumers.""   That is hardly an absolutist defense of what some call network neutrality. Mr. Martin, a Republican appointed by President Bush, wants to portray his views as moderate. Mr. Martin's view is that people should generally be able to use any device and any software, and connect to any legal content they want to. But some limits, he said, are acceptable.   For example, he said it would be acceptable for a network to give priority to Internet telephone calls over e-mail, because short delays affect the quality of voice conversations much more than e-mail.   ""You have to have a very good reason for what you're trying to do,"" he said. ""Your solution has to be narrowly tailored.""   Mr. Martin contrasted this view with an earlier approach to openness that forced phone and occasionally cable companies to sell access to their networks to rivals at discounted wholesale rates. This, he suggested, kept the network owners from investing in infrastructure that they would then have to share with their competitors. Mr. Martin's scheme allows telecom companies to charge what they want, so long as they don't interfere unnecessarily with how customers use their networks.   ""The network operators can recoup their investment in the network and can charge for access to network services, but consumers have complete control over the devices and content that don't have anything to do with investment in the underlying network,"" he said.   I asked about reports that AT&#38;T now bans all use of peer-to-peer networking software on its wireless data network. It also bans some video services, like the Slingbox feature that lets you watch your home television signal on your cellphone.    Mr. Martin declined to answer. His view is that the commission should not publish explicit regulations. Rather, it should address complaints that are made, as it did with the Comcast case.   ""The commission is very careful in that we look at the particular facts that are in front of us. We are not judging the next case,"" he said. ""Hard and fast rules can actually be over- and under-inclusive, and they can also have adverse impact.""    Mr. Martin was asked whether the commission's approach will push more Internet providers to start to impose caps on how much bandwidth consumers can use.   He said he wanted to reserve judgment on that trend. He seemed comfortable with Internet providers offering services with limits, so long as they are clearly stated.   Mr. Martin, who by convention will offer his resignation to the new president, suggested that the telecommunications industry was moving toward his view of openness, and he takes some credit for this. The commission, after heavy lobbying from Silicon Valley, included a requirement for open access on some of the wireless spectrum it auctioned off earlier this year. Verizon, which won that part of the auction, has agreed to open its entire network to devices it does not sell.   At the same time, Mr. Martin said he was frustrated at faced the lack of response has not been able to gain support, in Congress and among fellow commissioners, for one of his major policy views: That pay TV companies should be forced to allow people to chose what programming they buy, rather than offering only large bundles of channels.   But he suggested that this goal may be achieved anyway if his view of open networks continues to be enforced. Set-top boxes used with cable TV, he said, should be seen the same way as cellphones. Consumers need to be able to use any set-top box to access any sort of content.    This is important, he said, because of the rise of video programming on the Internet.    ""Consumers can't take content from the Internet and easily watch it on their televisions,"" he said. He blamed cable companies from preventing set-top box makers, like TiVo, from being able to offer devices that can combine Internet video with cable offerings like on-demand movies.   ""The cable operators won't license a device that integrates Internet video content with their content,"" he said. ""I'm saying that's wrong, and I am trying to get the other commissioners to address it.""   One reason Mr. Martin hasn't gotten much agreement on his views is that some say the current model helps pay for a greater range of content that consumers can choose from.   Mr. Martin acknowledged this, but said people were being forced to pay for options they don't want. And he suggested that if there was free competition between cable programming and Internet video in open set-top boxes, cable companies would have to offer more choices about programs and prices.    ""Eventually people will not pay less for cable and watch YouTube instead,"" he said.   UPDATE  Robert Kenny, a spokesman for Mr. Martin, called with a few clarifications. As to what happens in the next administration, he said that while the convention is for the chairman to offer a resignation to a new president, Mr. Martin has not said what his intentions are. His term runs until 2011.  He pointed out that Mr. Martin did not use the word ""frustrated"" to describe his reaction to the lack of agreement with his views about cable pricing on the commission and in Congress. And he raised a question about the last quote for Mr. Martin. I checked my notes, and there was an error. Mr. Martin said that consumers will ""pay less"" for cable service, rather than ""not pay"" for cable.     ",2008-07-30T16:20:44+0000

us,The Lede: Hacker Closer to Facing Trial,"A ruling from the body that serves as Britain's highest court put Gary McKinnon one step closer today to an American courtroom, where he faces charges of committing ""the biggest hack of military computers ever detected.""  The House of Lords rejected Mr. McKinnon's appeal against an extradition order to the United States, where he is accused of having invaded computer networks run by the Pentagon, by NASA and by dozens of other parts of the United States government in 2001 and 2002. Along the way, prosecutors say, he crippled crucial instruments of national security just after the Sept. 11 hijackings, when the government was trying to head off any further terror attacks.  But Mr. McKinnon is not accused of acting as a spy or saboteur for some foreign country or terrorist group, although it certainly seemed prudent to rule such possibilities out in reports of the indictment in 2002. What he was really after, prosecutors said, was uncovering the truth about aliens and other government secrets.   In past interviews, Mr. McKinnon himself has detailed those hacking missions, carried out from his London apartment. But he has denied causing anywhere near as much damage as the charges suggest.   ""My thing was being quiet, and not being seen, and getting the information out,"" he told CNet in 2005. He also said that the networks he invaded were hardly secure; rather, they were all but open to him and to the many other hackers he says he encountered on the networks while he was poking around. ""I didn't even have to crack passwords,"" he said.  Mr. McKinnon's lawyers hope that the European Court of Human Rights will intervene before his extradition, but it seems more likely that the next panel to hear his case will be an American jury. Various estimates of the maximum prison sentence he could receive in the case if convicted range from 5 years to 60.  Indeed, one of the arguments that Mr. McKinnon's lawyers made against extradition was the probability that he would face a punishment far out of proportion to the alleged crimes. The lawyers have suggested that he could even be charged as a cyber-terrorist and be sent to the military detention center at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba.  When today's news went up on a website about the case, freegary.org.uk, some commenters expressed support for Mr. McKinnon while others expressed satisfaction that justice was being served. For many, it came down to this: Mr. McKinnon did the crime, and now deserves the time.   In his hours that Mr. McKinnon was lurking inside the digital curtains of the government networks, his most exciting discovery, he told The Guardian in 2005, was a list entitled ""Non-Terrestrial Officers."" He also claimed to have seen evidence of an antigravity device. He acknowledges that he cannot produce hard evidence that either document actually exists.  But his most gripping tale was told to Wired in 2006. As he was searching NASA's network for a trove of satellite photos that capture images of U.F.O.'s, he said, he finally hit pay dirt:   My dial-up 56K connection was very slow trying to download one of these picture files [...] It was a silvery, cigar-shaped object with geodesic spheres on either side. There were no visible seams or riveting [...] The object didn't look manmade or anything like what we have created [...] At my crowning moment, someone at NASA discovered what I was doing and I was disconnected.   Once again, then, he had come up empty-handed in his quest for the kind of information that, among other things, one would think might be useful now in reaching some secret deal with the government to stay out of prison. ""I had very little evidence,"" he acknowledged to The Guardian. ""It's not a very good bargaining chip at all, really, is it?"" ",2008-07-30T16:33:04+0000

us,Windows Down to Save Fuel?,"In his July 29 Science Times article ""10 Things to Scratch From Your Worry List,"" John Tierney urged readers not to waste the summer consumed by guilt about their cars' supposed ""planet-destroying A/C,"" because an Edmunds.com report had concluded that ""the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air-conditioner.""  Mr. Tierney is on solid ground: Edmunds, a site that offers car-buying guidance, and Consumer Reports did not see much of a fuel-economy impact of either running the air or rolling down the windows in separate 2005 tests.   But like many controversies of this type, the windows-vs.-air-conditioning question refuses to die. There are many opinions, some with scientific pedigrees.   Having an environmental perspective may affect your thinking here. The online Grist magazine clearly doesn't like auto air-conditioning very much, and Umbra Fisk, a columnist, concludes that ""rolling down windows wins the efficiency contest hands down."" And that's because ""The physical weight of the air-conditioner adds to the drag of the car, and running it takes power from the engine; both reduce your gas mileage  So all in all it would be best to not even have A/C in your car.""  She'd get an argument from the Society of Automotive Engineers, which in a 2004 test was not particularly friendly to the A/C-off crowd, concluding that rolling down the windows can have ""a significant real impact on fuel consumption."" The size of the effect depends to some extent on temperature, vehicle speed, wind velocity and direction and is relatively larger for lower-drag vehicles like sedans than for S.U.V.'s, the group said.   But the Energy Department, in its online fuel economy tips, advises motorists to ""turn off the air-conditioner and roll your windows down"" at slow speeds, when there will be less aerodynamic drag.  That's the basic message from Slate, too. ""The rule of thumb is to keep the windows down while on city streets, then resort to air-conditioning when you hit the highway,"" said a July 2008 ""Green Lantern"" column. ""Every car has a speed at which rolled-down windows cause so much drag as to decrease fuel economy more than a switched-on A/C. As you might expect, however, that milestone speed varies widely from car to car  and in some cases, it may be well north of posted speed limits.""  In fact, driving with the windows down at highway speeds will cost you 9 cents a gallon, or more than $70 a year in a 15-gallon car that is filled up once a week, warns Dailyfueleconomytip.com.   And so, like the Kennedy assassination, the windows-vs.-A/C question defies any attempt to lay it to rest. Mr. Tierney also said we shouldn't worry about ""carcinogenic cellphones,"" because, as he points out, there's no definitive scientific link. But that didn't stop the director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute from issuing a warning about that very subject just last week.  Jim Motavalli will be posting regularly about fuel economy, green cars and alternative fuels. He is the author of ""Forward Drive: The Race to Build 'Clean' Cars for the Future,"" among other books. He is also the executive editor of New Mass Media newspapers, a contributor to E/The Environmental Magazine and a radio host on WPKN-FM in Connecticut.  Recent posts:  Hummer for Sale ...

us,Royals Have Something to Cheer About,"There is a buzz coming from Kansas City that even a -74 run differential and a record of 50-59 can't seem to suppress. On a team with question marks across the diamond, they have a true star in the making and now the clock is ticking to see if they can build a team around him in time to put him to good use.  Joakim Soria, the team's 24-year-old closer, has pitched only 117 innings at the major league level yet has 1 2/3 shutout innings in an All-Star game and has earned the controversial nickname ""The Mexicutioner."" Some have questioned how appropriate the nickname is, but Soria, a native of Monclova, Mexico is a fan of it and so are Royals fans who have been snapping up Mexicutioner t-shirts.  (Photo: Joakim Soria has 29 saves and a 1.47 E.R.A. for the Royals. (Orlin Wagner/Associated Press))   To get the scoop on the closer who allows 0.69 baserunners per inning and sports a 1.47 earned-run average, I felt it would be best to reach out to the three writers who most closely follow the Royals to get their take on Soria, his nickname and his future.  Each writer was sent the same five questions and here are their replies:  1. On a scale of 1-10, how frustrating is it to have an exciting closer on a team that doesn't win very often?  Joe Posnanski Columnist for The Kansas City Star Well, the other guys may disagree with me ... but I find it to be the opposite of frustrating. For years, the Royals were lousy and they had terrible closers, and the way I observed things that seemed much more frustrating. In those days, the Royals could lose about 25 different ways. With a great closer, the possibilities have dwindled by one or two. In Kansas City, you are thankful for small things.    Rob Neyer Columnist for ESPN.com and Royals fan Frustration Number: 2. When it comes to the Royals, I learned a long time ago to take my small pleasures wherever I might find them. I still recall single, impressive-but-meaningless Mike MacDougal strikeouts from five years ago.  Rany Jazayerli Author of the Royals blog RanyontheRoyals.com, Royals fan and dermatologist I'd say about a 3. It's frustrating to see any great player wasted on a bad team, but I'd much rather have a bad team redeemed by a great closer than a great team undermined by a bad closer (see also Indians, Cleveland.) You have to understand, from 1996 to 2005 the Royals had the worst record in one-run games over a ten-year stretch in major league history. Soria is the first closer we've had in a dozen years who doesn't give me ulcers in the ninth inning. It's frustrating that he's on pace to throw about 70 innings, which is a criminal waste of resources. But the fact that I could go to bed before last night's west coast game was over and sleep easy - that's a nice feeling. I almost forgot what that felt like.  2. What are your thoughts on the Mexicutioner nickname and the t-shirts that celebrate it (especially considering its genesis on Rany's blog)?  Posnanski I like the name, though I must say that it has a cottage industry in town to take credit for it. That part's annoying, especially because it does seem that Rany came up with it. In any case, the name is fun.  Neyer I'm thrilled for Rany's blog, but I'm not wild about the nickname's undertones (even though Soria supposedly doesn't mind at all).  Jazayerli I think I'm more in shock than anything else, that a nickname that started on my blog has become the industry standard inside of two months. All credit for that has to go to Bob Dutton, who inserted the nickname into his game recaps at every opportunity until the name caught on. The only concern I'd have with the Mexicutioner is if Soria was offended by the name, but he's evidently not. The t-shirts are overtly commercial, but the design is pretty cool.  3. If given the choice of Dan Quisenberry, Joakim Soria or Roberto Hernandez, who would you have close?  Posnanski Tough call. As a reporter, I must say that Roberto Hernandez was one of the most stand-up guys I have ever been around. No matter what happened during the game -- and it was often bad -- he was always there at his locker with a beer at his feet, and he took the blame.  As a baseball fan, I love watching Joakim Soria pitch. Love it. He seems impossible to rattle, he throws every pitch for strikes, he has that amazing curveball. He's the most fun closer the Royals have ever had, with the possible exception of Al Hrabosky.  But from the heart, it's Quiz. He is, in my mind, the most underrated closer in baseball history. He probably should have won two Cy Young awards. His Hall of Fame case is every bit as good, and in some ways better, than Bruce Sutter's. And yet Sutter is in the Hall and Quiz didn't get enough votes to even stay on the ballot.  Neyer That's easy. Quiz, because he could give you two or three innings rather than just one. But you left out Jeff Montgomery, who's the second-greatest reliever in franchise history.  Jazayerli Quisenberry, for the innings, as well as the panache of having a closer who throws 83 with a tailwind. Although if I can force the opposing team to use Roberto Hernandez as their closer, it's a tough call.  4. In his blog a while back, Buster Olney said Soria has a demeanor similar to Mariano Rivera. With his new nickname, is a fist-pumping lesson something he would benefit from?  Posnanski The amazing thing is that from the first day he pitched in Kansas City, Soria has resembled Rivera. They have similar body types, their set up is almost identical, and so on. I don't think Soria needs a fist pump. I do wish that when he came in the Royals would play Van Morrison's ""Gloria"" and have people spell ""S-O-R-I-A"" as he walks to the mound. But nobody listens to me.  Neyer The nickname's plenty.  Jazayerli What makes the Mexicutioner nickname work is that it fits Soria's personality - he's lethally efficient, but he's not emotional about it. It's nothing personal; it's just business. If he started acting like Jonathan Papelbon on the mound, I'd check him for drugs.  5. How likely is it that the Royals will build a contending team in time to benefit from Soria's success?  Posnanski It's the million dollar question. The Royals seem to me to finally be showing some signs of life, especially with their pitching. But they aren't close right now.  Neyer The Royals have Soria locked up through 2014! Assuming they exercise all the options (which of course they won't do if he's not healthy and pitching effectively). A lot could happen between now and then. I suspect they'll contend, if marginally, at some point between now and 2014. But I'm disheartened by the Royals' almost complete lack of good hitters in their farm system.  Jazayerli The Royals have options on his contract through 2014. There's always a chance he'll get hurt between now and then, but at some point in the next six seasons the Royals have to get their act in gear. Don't they? (Rob, don't answer that.)

us,Dodging Witches and Wild Boar in Germany,"(Photo: A pine forest in the Harz Mountains.)  Deep in the forests of Germany's Harz Mountains, twilight is a time of magic. The light turns gray and ambient, and the colors  the green of moss, the brassy gold of pine needles, the violet of the wild blueberry bushes  pop out against the tall, brown, branchless trunks of pine trees. There's a stillness. The daytime hikers have returned to their villages, and the nocturnal animals have not yet woken. This is when you can almost believe the legends about Harz  that witches fly to the 3,747-foot-tall peak of Brocken, the tallest mountain in northern Germany, and that a strange creature called the Brocken Spectre patrols the misty trails.  But when you are lost in the Harz, having hiked  as I had  12 miles through thick pine forests and up 1,000-foot peaks, twilight can be disorienting, terrifying. The old, overgrown logging trail I was following didn't correspond to any on my topographical map, and though I could see the slanted red roofs and half-timbered facades of a distant village through a break in the trees, I had no guarantee this path would ever lead there.   Also, I was hearing things. A long, unearthly moan from the valley. The heavy crunch of a large mammal struggling through forest. And then, in the tricky light of evening, I saw the black haunches of what looked like a hefty wild boar bounding into the woods. Witches I could handle; wild animals, not so much. I had plenty of water, a flashlight, warm clothes, a knife, a hunk of bread, some cheese and four bars on my cellphone, and yet I was scared. I had never felt more alone.  Video Which was, after all, exactly why I'd come to the Harz, a national park almost smack in the middle of Germany that straddles the old East-West divide. After 10 weeks of interacting with strangers, making new friends, navigating Old Towns, inspecting fine restaurants and evaluating European civilization at the dawn of the third millennium, I'd had enough of, well, civilization itself.   The Harz Mountains offered the perfect escape: 860 square miles of hills, forests, lakes and rivers, with folksy villages nestled in the valleys where I could find soft, inexpensive beds every night at the ubiquitous pensions. By day, I'd embrace nature on foot; by night, I hoped, I'd find fellowship with other wanderers.  Better still, I'd be following in the bootsteps of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Heinrich Heine, who visited in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and wrote about the area  Goethe by sending his Faust to a celebration of witches atop the Brocken, Heine with a travelogue called ""The Harz Journey.""  From Gdansk, I took a series of four Polish and German trains (85.85 euros, or about $136, at $1.58 to the euro) to Quedlinburg, a medieval German city I planned to use as my base. As in most 1,200-year-old cities, Quedlinburg has both an Old Town and a New Town  only here the latter dates not from the modern era but from the early 12th century. No surprise that this compact tangle of cobblestones, half-timbered houses and sunlit market squares  which survived World War II unscathed  is a Unesco World Heritage Site.  But I only stayed in Quedlinburg long enough for a 17.70-euro schnitzel dinner at the tree-shaded Restaurant Benedikt (Marktkirchhof 18, 49-3946-526652) and a night at the suburban Pension Weingart (Friedrich-Jahn-Strasse 27, 49-3946-8617, www.pension-weingart.de; single, 35 euros).   In the morning, I left most of my belongings  at the Theophano Hotel (Markt 13/14, 49-3946-96300, www.hoteltheophano.de), pricey at 69 euros a night but the only affordable hotel with Internet access, then filled my backpack with supplies  maps and water-purification tablets, 17 euros from Bergwerk (Plkenstrasse 51, 49-3946-915085, www.bergwerk-quedlinburg.de); bread, cheese, sausage and beer, about 7 euros from local shops  and caught the 2-euro, 20-minute train to Thale.  Thale sits at the edge of the Harz, where the Bode River spills out from a steep, green-swathed gorge that's sometimes referred to as the Grand Canyon of Germany. That nickname makes it sound challenging  but it's not. Moms in pumps, dads with expensive cameras, bored-looking teenagers and even some truly elderly people were marching up the wide gravel-dirt-and-rock path that ran alongside the river. At times, it grew steep, and with 30 pounds on my back I was certainly sweating. But compared with my camping expedition to the Beartooth-Absaroka Wilderness in Montana last summer, this seven-and-a-half-mile stretch of picture-perfect forest, backed by the roar of the river, was, as they say, a walk in the park.  This stage ended at Treseburg, where I got my first, and possibly best, taste of a Harz village. This was a small place, just a few clusters of dark-wood houses hugging a couple of roads near the river. A church, a bridge, some kids wading in the water. A museum devoted to weathervanes. A mural on the side of a house showed Treseburg as it was in the 11th century, a walled town high on a hill. Another house was a vacation rental for two to four people, at 12.50 euros a person. I drank a 2.30-euro beer at a cafe and marched on.  After Treseburg, things got hairier. A sign warned of moose. The trail became steep, and was intercut with roads made for logging trucks. There was no one else around. The afternoon sun bore down, and I stopped frequently to glug my purified water.   (Photo: Wild raspberries abound on trails through the Harz. )  Once, I stopped and looked to my right. There, along the bank of a small creek, were raspberry bushes. I removed my hat and started filling it with the ripe, red fruit, and only when I was stuffing myself with my discovery did I wonder: How did I know to stop there? Pure chance? A subconscious sense of smell? Was I getting close to nature already, or was this some witch's trick?   [Note added Aug. 8, 2008: I later learned from reader comments that wild berries in central Europe can harbor the fuchsbandwurm, a potentially deadly parasite. Those raspberries and blueberries may be tempting, but should be avoidedor harvested and turned into safe, delicious jam.]  (Photo: A moose warning sign outside Altenbrak.)  The sky was starting to darken when I arrived in Altenbrak, three miles farther on. I needed a place to sleep and eat, and luckily, there were pensions everywhere, tidy houses bearing the sign ""zimmer frei"" room available. Unluckily, despite the claims of the signs, the zimmers that evening were mostly nicht frei  not free  and it wasn't until I reached the Pension & Restaurant Zum Harzer Jodlermeister (Sankt Ritter 26A, 49-39-45-65680, www.zum-harzer-jodlermeister.de) that I found a room that was both available and affordable (after I bargained them down to 35 euros from 45).   My zimmer was small and clean, with a soft single bed, a minibar, a slanted roof and a spacious bathroom where I showered off the day's sweat. On the patio cafe, I drank a big pilsner, ate a massive platter of schnitzel and pasta with a mushroom cream sauce, and finished with apple strudel and vanilla ice cream  20.60 euros in all, but I needed the calories. By 10 p.m., I was dead asleep.  (Photo: An antique dollhouse.)  The next three days unspooled pretty much the same way. A big breakfast (bread rolls with butter and jam or cold cuts, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, apples), a look around town (the antique dollhouse collection at Altenbrak's Heimatmuseum, the waterfall outside Knigshtte) and then off I'd tramp into the wilderness.   The farther I got from Thale, the wilder the land became. Often, I'd follow a trail for miles along a stream, stepping carefully over fallen logs and around mud puddles, and then, in an instant, find myself in a Narnia-like wood, carpeted with roots and electric-green moss, the only sounds the birds and a roaring wind. Then I'd take a few more steps and learn that the wind came from cars racing along a small highway.  Often, though, I was alone for what felt like hours, wandering down paths that even the loggers had long abandoned. At these times, I didn't care if I'd made wrong turns, or if the signs pointing me to Elend or Trageburg had utterly vanished. This was nature, oblivious to my presence but providing me with such enjoyment: the bees and butterflies in the wildflowers, the frigid water from the streams, the raspberries and, in the higher altitudes, the blueberries.  But there was a fine line between solitude and loneliness, and more than once I wanted nothing more than to be back in Brooklyn, cooking dinner for my pregnant wife, Jean. But it was also when I was most isolated that I was most happy to run into people. Near the shore of the Rappbodetalsperre lake, searching in vain for a picturesque spot to eat lunch, I found an old man on a motorcycle, clearing a field in which he and his friends planned to hunt wild boars for sport. Later, after I'd passed a fruitless two hours looking for a bridge across the lake, I happened upon a couple from Bremen  she in Fila polo shirt, he in wraparound sunglasses  who couldn't remember where they'd parked their convertible.  ""I know where it is,"" the man clarified. ""I just don't know how to get back there.""  With every step, I also discovered something about myself: I can walk  and walk and walk and walk. At the end of a 20-mile day, my feet would be sore, and my shoulders would ache from the weight of my pack. But after a night in the super-soft beds of Knigshutte's Pension Knigshof (Friedensstrasse 22, 49-3945-452146; www.am-felsen.de; single, 35 euros), I'd be ready for another near-marathon. Four days and 50 miles later, only the little toe on my right foot was blistered.  If there was a challenge in my westward trek, it was finding food. I had expected to buy locally produced bread, cheeses and meats in every village, but often there were no bakers or butchers. (What do locals do for groceries? They drive.) Still, I found ways to fill my belly at noon. Three miles from Altenbrak, I stumbled on Stemberghaus, a museum devoted to charcoal (www.harzkoehlerei.de), once one of the Harz Mountains' main industries; the snack bar sold local beer (schwarz, of course) and bratwurst. I ate well.  (Photo: A rich blend of split yellow peas and bacon. )  And west of Elend  whose name means misery  I found Kukki's Erbsensuppe (www.kukki.de), a roadside stand where a man was ladling a thick stew of split yellow peas and bacon out of a mobile field kitchen (2.50 euros a bowl, with discounts for more than three bowls). This was perfect Harz food  rich, hearty, just what you need to climb a mountain, but it was also a reminder of Germany's recent past: Kukki, the boss, had opened shop 19 years ago, soon after the border  less than a mile to the west  had ceased to be.  In fact, it was quite easy to forget that this entire area was once a high-security zone, with troops patrolling the land-mine-ridden hills. Today, there's just a small monument marking the old point where east met west, along with a trail that follows what used to be the border. As I marched along it  uphill for two miles  I was glad I'd loaded up on erbsensuppe.  My ascent of the Brocken, however, was anticlimactic. The path was well-marked, though I could have just as easily followed the hundreds of tourists making the four-mile climb. Within two hours  with blueberry breaks  I reached the Brocken's plateau, where witches supposedly fly every April 30. I bought bratwurst and French fries from a kiosk, and knocked back a celebratory shot of Schierker-Feuerstein, a peppery, 70-proof tonic made in the nearby village of Schierke.   I admired the view  the plains stretching out north, the suddenly tiny hills I'd trekked through to the south  and then it was time to descend, not on foot but by the train that many of the Brocken's visitors had ridden up and would ride back down.  (Photo: The steam train.)  It was an old steam engine, built in the 1950s and lovingly maintained, and it dripped water and puffed smoke as trains of yore are supposed to. It swirled down around the Brocken, and coasted through the woods that I'd crossed with so many thousands of heavy steps. The smell of coal and steam, the hoot of the whistle and the inimitable chugga-chugga, the breeze from the wide-open windows  they made the 16-euro journey fun. Still, as 90 minutes rolled past without my sweating, I couldn't help thinking I should've walked.  Next stop: Amsterdam. ",2008-07-30T16:57:40+0000

us,Obama Claims 'Wild Bill' Heritage in a Challenge to McCain,"(Photo: Wild Bill Hickok (Photo courtesy Adams Museum)) SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Barack Obama, genealogical gunslinger?  The Democratic candidate today invoked a distant  possibly apocryphal  cousin, Wild Bill Hickok, and suggested that he and John McCain forget the dreary debate-about-where-they-will-debate and just strap on six-shooters and meet at 60 paces.  (Note to the literal minded: The candidate was joking. We think.)  ""If Senator McCain wants a debate about taxes in this campaign, I'm ready,"" he told an audience here. ""Wild Bill Hickok had his first duel in the town square here. And the family legend is that he is a distant cousin of mine.""  Sensing a hike of the collective eyebrow in the audience, he quickly added: ""I'm serious, I'm serious. This is part of the family legend. I don't know if it's true, but I'm going to research it.""   Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Obama found out that he is a distant cousin to Mr. Cheney, a source of more than a few punchlines for the two of them. But Wild Bill Hickok was a new one.  Wild Bill lived in an era when a homicidally inclined fellow with an itchy trigger finger could become quickly famous. As it happens, Wild Bill fought his first quick-draw duel here in Springfield, shooting Davis Tutt outside a saloon, apparently over a gambling debt or a woman or both.  ""I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes,"" Mr. Obama said, smiling broadly. ""Quick draw.""  History, alas, also offers a caution or three for the aspiring duelist. The citizenry of Springfield was not enamored with Mr. Hickok plugging a citizen in plain daylight. Soon after, he lost a close election for marshal.  Eleven years later, the curtain dropped more definitively on his political career, as a gunslinger shot Wild Bill dead while playing poker at Saloon #10 in Deadwood. ",2008-07-30T17:03:24+0000

Nixon never did take up Lewis Rudin's offer to join the real estate mogul's celebrity roster in his high-rise at 215 East 68th Street, or at any of what Mr. Rudin called ""a dozen fine apartment buildings on the East Side and a dozen on the West Side"" that his company owned and managed in New York in the 1970s.  But Lester J. Tanner and his wife at the time, Marcella Tanner, did live there. And thereby hangs a tale, one that has escaped telling until now because, for one thing, the Tanners, who alone with the Nixons were privy to the story, never told it before.  It's a tale of how the disgraced former president, a Republican who was undone by his cover-up of the Watergate burglary and money-laundering scandal, found a refuge in Gotham. It's about how Mr. Nixon landed in the fancy town house once owned by the esteemed federal judge Billings Learned Hand, thanks to sympathetic Democrats -- sympathetic, that is, not to a widely despised political pariah but to a former chief executive of the United States shabbily treated by a city known for its hospitality to the downtrodden.   The story emerged after The New York Times published an article just last week, on July 21, about the Rudin Management Company's practice of offering precious rent-stabilized apartments or below-market deals in his buildings to well-connected friends, particularly public servants, past and present. David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, Howard Safir, a former police commissioner, and Thomas Von Essen, a former fire commissioner, are among the tenants in the 33-story luxury rental high-rise at 215 East 68th Street.  That prompted Mr. Tanner, 84, a trial lawyer with an eventful life of his own, to write with the following story.  Mr. Tanner related that in May 2006, on the occasion of a documentary film on the civic boosterism of Mr. Rudin, who died in 2001, Mr. Tanner reached out to Mr. Rudin's son, William, recalling how the elder Rudin had championed Mr. Nixon's efforts to become a New Yorker once again. (Before winning the White House in 1968, Mr. Nixon had lived in a 12-room apartment at 810 Fifth Avenue, where Nelson A. Rockefeller was a neighbor. Mr. Nixon sold the apartment for a reported $326,000.)  President Nixon announced his resignation on Aug. 8, 1974, and settled at Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, Calif. But within five years he was seeking to move back to New York, and on July 28, 1979, The Times broke the news that he had put down a deposit on a nine-room penthouse at 19 East 72nd Street, at Madison Avenue, that was selling for $750,000.  The seven-member co-op board informally approved the sale, only to backtrack days later after shareholders revolted, objecting that the Nixons would bring notoriety to the exclusive building, not to mention Secret Service disruptions. On Aug. 2, 1979, Mr. Nixon and his seller agreed to break their deal.  (Photo: Lewis Rudin, the real estate mogul, in 2000. (Photo: Bill Cunningham/The New York Times))  Enter Mr. Rudin. Furious at the picture it presented of ""the worst type of bigotry,"" as he put it, the developer told The Times, ""I'm ashamed as a New Yorker and I apologize to the Nixons."" He offered the former president his choice of an apartment in any of two dozen buildings the Rudins owned and managed ""and the Nixons are welcome in any of them if the space is available.""  But the Nixons weren't interested in renting; they wanted to buy.  Mr. Tanner had also read of the Nixons' ignominy and, like Mr. Rudin, was appalled. Like Mr. Rudin, too, he and his wife were lifelong Democrats. Mr. Tanner had even been a delegate for Senator Robert F. Kennedy before his assassination in 1968.  As a G.I. in World War II, Mr. Tanner had been taken prisoner by the Germans and was being held in the Ziegenhein stalag in January 1945, when the Nazi commandant demanded at gunpoint to know which of the American soldiers were Jews. As. Mr. Tanner recalled it, their brave officer, Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds, defied the camp commander, saying the Geneva Convention forbade the request, and Mr. Tanner and his fellow prisoners were spared, to be liberated shortly afterward.  In 1960, Mr. Tanner was instrumental in persuading the New York Stock Exchange to permit the listing of Mesabi Iron, its first noncorporation. Later, in 1992, Mr. Tanner represented an American Airlines executive, Barbara L. Sogg, in her gender-discrimination lawsuit against the airline.   At the time of Mr. Nixon's housing woes, the Tanners were living in a 5,000-square-foot, 12-room town house at 142 East 65th Street. The four-story, 20-foot-wide, 1871 building on a tree-lined block between Lexington and Third Avenues came with an impeccable pedigree. For about 60 years until his death in 1961, it had been the home of Judge Learned Hand, who was known for his wise jurisprudence, and who took epic walks from East 65th Street to the federal courthouse in Foley Square. Judge Learned Hand (Learned and Hand were family surnames) was also the jurist for whom Archibald Cox, the first Watergate special prosecutor, ordered fired by Mr. Nixon, had once served as a law clerk.  Mr. Tanner represented the Learned Hand estate in the sale of the house and got the opportunity to buy it himself from Edward Gudeman, an undersecretary of commerce in President John F. Kennedy's administration, for $320,000 in 1971.  Next door to the Tanners was David Rockefeller (in a double-wide town house of 40 feet), and over the garden wall on East 64th Street lived Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian and an assistant to Mr. Kennedy, the man who defeated Mr. Nixon in the 1960 presidential election.  As it happened, the Tanners were ready to downsize and had put the house on the market through Sotheby Parke Bernet International Realty Corporation, as the entity was known at the time. A glossy brochure titled ""An Elegant East Side Townhouse"" featured black and white photographs and promoted the property's six wood-burning fireplaces and proximity to Bloomingdale's, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Company. The asking price was $690,000. An Exxon oilman was ready to take it in a complex exchange of properties, structured to minimize taxes, that drove the selling price to $750,000, when Mr. Tanner read about Mr. Nixon's co-op debacle.  Agreeing with Mr. Rudin that their fellow New Yorkers had acted abominably, Mr. Tanner wrote the former president in California offering to sell him his house for the same $750,000. There was no board to nix the deal, Mr. Tanner stressed. And it would be done in confidence -- they were, after all, both lawyers and they could work it out between themselves.  But Mr. Nixon had not been idle. Moving quickly, he had already visited another co-op, on which he had put down a $92,000 deposit on a 12-room apartment at 817 Fifth Avenue, at 63rd Street, on sale for $925,000 -- marked down from the original $1 million asking price -- by Abe Hirschfeld, the quirky developer, parking-garage magnate, and, later, short-lived publisher of The New York Post. He had himself bought the apartment, covering the building's entire seventh floor, only two years earlier for $225,000.  Mr. Hirschfeld, who died in 2005, lost no time publicizing the deal, arranging for a reporter and photographer from New York Magazine to tour the apartment for the issue of Sept. 3, 1979. ""Everyone wants to see the place where Nixon will be living,"" said the obliging Mr. Hirschfeld. The picture spread even featured a floor plan. The Secret Service, which was still guarding the former president, was horrified.  When Mr. Nixon got his letter, Mr. Tanner recalled, he responded quickly, telephoning himself.  ""I'm coming in; I'm excited, I want to see the house,"" Mr. Tanner recalled Mr. Nixon saying.  But what about the Hirschfeld contract? Mr. Tanner asked.  Don't worry about that, he said Mr. Nixon replied. After all the publicity, the Secret Service would never permit him to live there.  But what about the $92,000 deposit? Mr. Tanner recalled persisting.  Mr. Nixon said he was ready to forfeit it, explaining, ""I don't want any litigation.""   ""He desperately wanted to come to New York,"" Mr. Tanner said. ""It was the place that had rehabilitated him after 1962."" That was the year Mr. Nixon lost the election for the California governorship to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and wrote his own, premature, political obituary, telling the press, ""You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.""  Sure enough, a few days later in August 1979, on the Tanners' doorstep at 142 East 65th Street, stood three generations of Nixons: the former president and his wife, Pat; their eldest daughter, Tricia, who was then living on Fifth Avenue and 70th Street with her husband, Edward F. Cox; and Tricia's and Edward's baby son, Christopher.  Marcella Tanner remembers it well. She said Mr. Nixon appeared in the doorway with Christopher on his shoulders. ""Not the way one thought of President Nixon,"" she said. Tricia was particularly enthralled, Mrs. Tanner remembered, repeating: ""I love the house. It wraps its arms around you.""  Pat Nixon, on the other hand, looked nervous, Mr. Tanner recalled, still bearing the scars of Watergate and incessantly chain-smoking.  Mr. Nixon was quickly at home, Mr. Tanner added, telling his hosts: ""A town house in Manhattan is like oceanfront property. It never loses its value.""  Mrs. Tanner ran to get her copy of Mr. Nixon's 1962 book, ""Six Crises,"" and asked him to autograph it. He obliged, and the Nixons left.  Mr. Tanner drew up a sales contract while Mr. Nixon broke his contract with Mr. Hirschfeld. Dated Sept. 4, 1979 [pdf], it listed the seller as Marcella Tanner and the buyer as ""Richard Nixon residing at La Casa Pacifica, San Clemente, California.""  (""My residences have always been in my wives' names,"" Mr. Tanner explained. ""I believe it makes for a happier marriage."")  Indeed, the Tanners were married for 39 years before their amicable divorce in 1988. He has since remarried.  Shortly before the closing, set for October in 1979, Mr. Tanner said he was awakened one midnight by a ringing phone and picked it up to hear Mr. Nixon's voice.  ""Pat can't sleep,"" he heard Mr. Nixon say. ""She's sure we'll be rejected.""  ""I told you not to worry,"" Mr. Tanner reassured him. ""I don't need anybody's approval.""  ""I told her that,"" Mr. Nixon persisted. ""She doesn't believe me.""  He asked Mr. Tanner to speak to Mrs. Nixon and explain it to her once more.  There was one more hitch before the closing, Mr. Tanner recalled. Mr. Nixon was having trouble selling Casa Pacifica and needed the funds to buy the Tanners' town house. Mr. Nixon asked if the closing could be delayed.  Absolutely not, Mr. Tanner said.  Amazing, he recalled thinking. After all the funny money that changed hands during Watergate, Mr. Nixon was strapped for cash. He ended up, Mr. Tanner recalled, getting a loan from the Key Biscayne Bank of his friend Charles (Bebe) Rebozo, who had been drawn into the Watergate entanglements.  The sale went through, with The Times on Oct. 5, 1979, once again breaking the story of another Nixon home purchase in New York.  The neighbors had mixed emotions. ""There goes the neighborhood,"" Mr. Schlesinger said, jokingly. Others, though, ripped out the flowers Mr. Tanner had planted, forcing him to hire guards to protect the house until the Nixons moved in.  The Tanners moved out, taking a room at the Harvard Club while they looked for an apartment, but they were having trouble finding one.  Now it was Mr. Tanner's turn to ask Mr. Nixon for a favor, and he called him in California. ""Lew Rudin said he would give you any apartment,"" Mr. Tanner reminded the former president. Mr. Nixon should say he was buying the Tanners' house and maybe Mr. Rudin would offer the Tanners an apartment.  The next day Mr. Tanner heard from a surprised Mr. Rudin. Ron Ziegler, the former White House press secretary, had called with the request. But Mr. Rudin was skeptical. ""I don't believe it,"" he told Mr. Tanner. Everyone knew the Nixons were buying the Hirschfeld apartment.  But Mr. Rudin was persuaded enough to invite Mr. Tanner to his office to examine floor plans. Mr. Tanner chose apartment 12L at 215 East 68th Street, one of the biggest in the building, a rent-stabilized three-bedroom, three-bath affair with a maid's room, large dining room, living room and foyer, at $1,800 a month.  Still, in the lease dated Jan. 1, 1980, the cautious Mr. Rudin inserted an unusual clause. It was only valid if the signing leaseholder actually sold his town house to Mr. Nixon.  William Rudin, Lew's son, said Wednesday that he recalled Mr. Tanner's 2006 letter detailing the elder Rudin's efforts to help Mr. Nixon find a home. ""Mr Tanner, I'm sure remembers everything that happened,"" William Rudin said. ""I'm sure it's a true story. That's who my father was. That's why he was Mister New York.""  Postscript: Although Mr. Nixon presented the picture of a happy life in the town house in a long interview given to Julie Baumgold for the June 9, 1980, issue of New York Magazine, the Nixons lived at 142 East 65th Street, for fewer than three years. In 1981, they bought a million-dollar modern house in Saddle River, N.J. And in 1982 they sold the town house to the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations for about $2.5 million, according to Mr. Tanner. The Nixons used the same Sotheby's sale brochure Mr. Tanner had prepared. Only this time the headline had been changed from ""Elegant"" town house to ""Historic."" Mr. Nixon died on April 23, 1994, at age 81.  As for the Tanners, after their divorce, Mr. Tanner bought a co-op apartment at 860 Fifth Avenue, where he later served as chairman of the board and still lives with his second wife. Mrs. Tanner stayed at 215 East 68th St., although when the rent reached $2,600 a month about 1991, she traded down to a two-bedroom unit now going for under $3,000 a month.  ""It was a favor to Nixon, not to us,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy."" ",2008-07-30T18:09:31+0000

Senator John McCain, whose recent suggestion that an increase in the Social Security payroll tax would not be off the table infuriated some fiscal conservatives, sought to reassure people here Wednesday that he opposes tax increases.   ""I want to look you in the eye: I will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase,'' he said here Wednesday at a town-hall-style meeting at the Wagner Company, a Caterpillar dealer. ""I will not do it.''   Mr. McCain has been attracting criticism from the right ever since he said that ""nothing's off the table"" when he was asked Sunday on ABC's ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos"" whether raising payroll taxes would be an option for Social Security.   Pat Toomey, the president of the Club for Growth, an influential anti-tax group, called the statement ""shocking"" and issued an open letter to Mr. McCain asking him to clarify his stance and to ""reaffirm your commitment to eschew all tax increases."" And an editorial in The Wall Street Journal  called Mr. McCain's statement a ""blunder,'' and added that: ""Such mistakes also help explain the continued lack of enthusiasm for Mr. McCain among many conservatives.''   Mr. McCain has resisted being drawn out in any detail on what he things should be done to shore up Social Security, except to call for convening a bipartisan group to fashion a solution. At his meeting Wednesday, he criticized his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, for supporting raising the payroll tax on high earners.   ""On Social Security, he wants to raise Social Security taxes,'' Mr. McCain said. ""I am opposed to raising taxes on Social Security. I want to fix the system without raising taxes. That's a debate that we should have openly in good faith. But we need to sit down together, my friends. You expect us Republicans and Democrats to sit down and fix social security so that future generations of Americans can have the same benefits that present-day retirees have.''   He did not elaborate how he might preserve the same benefits for future generations without raising payroll taxes.   Mr. McCain kept up his criticism of Mr. Obama. ""The bottom line is that Senator Obama's words, for their eloquence and passion, don't mean all that much,'' he said. ""And that's the problem with Washington. It's not just the Bush administration and it's not just the Democratic Congress. It's that everyone in Washington says whatever it takes to get elected, or score the political points of the day.''

us,Hispanics and Catholic New York,"(Photo: Father Flix Varela, a 19th-century social reformer in New York, was honored on a postage stamp in 1997. (Photo: United States Postal Service))   Many people, if asked when Hispanics began to reshape the Catholic Church in New York City, would probably put the date around 1950, when Puerto Rican migrants began arriving in Manhattan in large numbers. But in fact, Hispanics had exerted a powerful influence on religion and society in New York more than a century earlier, an important insight that emerged from a panel discussion on Tuesday night at the Museum of the City of New York.  The panel discussion -- part of an exhibition, ""Catholics in New York, 1808-1946,"" that is on view through Dec. 31 -- was billed as a talk on Latinos and the future of Catholic New York. The most informative parts of the 90-minute discussion focused on little-known aspects of social, religious and urban history. Rafael Pi Roman, the host of WNET's ""New York Voices,"" moderated the discussion.   Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo, an emeritus professor of Puerto Rican and Latino Studies at Brooklyn College and a distinguished scholar at the City University of New York, spoke first and gave a thorough recap of Hispanic Catholic life in New York through World War II.   He gave a quick overview of the life of Father Flix Varela, the Cuban-born priest who fled Spain in 1823 after the king, Ferdinand VII, waged a campaign of repression, and settled in New York, by way of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Here, Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, Father Varela founded the Church of the Transfiguration, on Mott Street in what is now Chinatown -- ""which as you recall is perilously close to what became Five Points,"" the notorious immigrant slum at the center of the film ""Gangs of New York."" Father Varela also got involved in the temperance movement.   In 1837, Father Varela became vicar general of the diocese of New York, but he was passed over for bishop in favor of John J. Hughes, who was elevated in 1842 and became the first archbishop of New York in 1850.   ""John Hughes was Irish through and through, knew his people, knew the system, knew how to use the resources of the church to get more resources for the church,"" Professor Stevens-Arroyo said.  Archbishop Hughes helped finance the construction of St. Patrick's Cathedral by buying up the land around it, knowing that it would become much more valuable after the grand Gothic edifice was completed. The archbishop also founded a savings bank for immigrants, offering 3 percent interest while investing the bank's assets at returns of 6 to 8 percent.  Yet despite Archbishop Hughes's accomplishments, ""the bond between the hierarchy and the faithful"" was not widely felt outside of the ranks of Irish Catholics.  Most Latino immigrants in New York in the 19th century were exiles or merchants, and the first Catholic parish for them was founded in 1859; through a series of mergers it is now known as St. Peter-St. Paul-Our Lady of Pilar.  Among the more prominent Hispanics in the New York region in the 19th century were the Civil War general George G. Meade, who was born in Spain and was the Union commander at Gettsyburg; Joseph II, the deposted Bonapartist king of Spain; the revolutionary Jos Mart; and the Puerto Rican nationalists Ramn Betances and Eugenio Mara de Hostos.  Some of the Hispanics of the time worked as cigar rollers. ""They would read, in a loud voice, from the best novels of the time,"" while doing their often-tedious jobs, Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, and in so doing were exposed to works of philosophy and nationalist liberation, disguised as novels.  It was a time, Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, when Italian, Slovak, Polish and Spanish-speaking immigrants had their own ""national parishes,"" separately run and governed from the ""territorial parishes"" operated by the Irish-dominated church establishment. The ""national parishes"" were responsible for recruitment of their own priests and nuns; some of them competed for financing with the mainstream church.   Discrimination within the church was rife. Cardinal John McCloskey, the fifth bishop and second archbishop of New York, ""told Polish people they didn't need a parish but a pig shanty,"" Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, while Archbishop Michael A. Corrigan, the McCloskey successor, told Mother Cabrini -- later the first American to be canonized -- that ""the best thing she could do for Italians was to tell them to stay in their own land.""   By the early 20th century, Catholic outreach to Hispanics had begun to improve a bit. Cardinal John M. Farley took part in a synod in Puerto Rico in 1917 and Catholic settlement houses for Hispanic immigrants began to emerge, including Casita Maria, in Harlem, which later moved to the Bronx.  Political power also began to shift in the neighborhood. As Professor Stevens-Arroyo noted, Vito A. Marcantonio, the liberal Congressman for the area who famously championed the rights of minorities and was known for his involvement in the American Labor Party, gave public support to Pedro Albizu Campos, the Puerto Rican nationalist who was jailed at one point for sedition.   (Photo: Cardinal Francis J. Spellman in 1964. (Photo: Edward Hausner/The New York Times)) A turning point, Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, was Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's decision, in 1939, to remove the diocesan priests from St. Cecilia's, a largely Puerto Rican parish in East Harlem that had been originally founded for German immigrants, and to replace them with a Redemptorist pastor.   Cardinal Spellman's decision, Professor Stevens-Arroyo said, had two reasons behind it. He had seen the work of the Redemptorists, a missionary order, during a cruise to Puerto Rico, and believed that they could effectively preach to the Puerto Rican population. In addition, Cardinal Spellman believed that the evangelization of Puerto Rican Catholics would help prevent the spread of Communism.   Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete, a distinguished Puerto Rican theologian, scientist and writer, spoke next. He spoke of the ""special relationship"" between New York City and Puerto Rico, and quipped, ""I have aways felt New York City to be part of Puerto Rico.""  He added, ""It is here where our flag was designed, where 'Lamento Borincano' was first heard, where the terrible nostalgia of growing old without being able to return to San Juan was expressed.""  Monsigor Albacete said that Spanish-speaking Catholics could reshape the faith in the same way that the confrontation of Roman Christianity and European invaders shaped the faith in the dark ages. ""The future of the church on Earth is shaped by the encounter between human freedom, human history, and the attractive power of God's love and mercy,"" he said.  Sister Veronica Mendez, a longtime Puerto Rican activist in East Harlem and a member of the Sisters of Our Lady of Christian Doctrine, spoke next, offering three ""snapshots"" of her childhood. Her family left Puerto Rico for New York in 1944. She recalled being baptized at age 6 -- a very different tradition from Irish Catholics, who believed in baptism immediately after birth, lest the child die without being cleansed of original sin. For Puerto Ricans, the celebration involved in baptism was important.   Sister Veronica also recalled being uncertain about which Mass at St. Cecilia's to attend as a child: the English or the Spanish. ""For a long time in New York, the Spanish church was the basement church,"" she said. ""That was the way we celebrated Mass.""  She recalled: ""A third snapshot: I'm sitting in my Catholic school class and sister is teaching and she's teaching us the importance of the name of Jesus and how out of reverence, we bow our heads every time we hear the name of Jesus."" The teacher then said, ""'And did you know there are some people who have such little respect for the name of Jesus that they give it to their children?'""  As the audience laughed, Sister Veronica recalled, ""I remember wishing the floor would open up and swallow me.""  She pointed out that Jesus is a common name among Hispanics, and is not seen at all as inconsistent with the Catholic faith.   David Gonzalez, a metropolitan reporter and former foreign correspondent for The New York Times, traced the movement of Hispanic Catholics across the Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s -- often keeping just ahead of the fires that ravaged the borough. Mr. Gonzalez, who graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School before attending Yale and Columbia, recalled the deteriorating conditions that made the Bronx a notorious symbol of urban demise, but he also traced the involvement of Latino Catholics in the revival of the borough -- and of New York itself.  For example, there was Astin Jacobo, the unofficial mayor of Crotona, who died in 2002. Mr. Jacobo was the custodian of Mr. Gonzalez's grammar school but so much more. In 1983, Mr. Jacobo confronted Mayor Edward I. Koch, demanding improvements in basic city services like sanitation.   Barbara Gonzalez, the chairwoman of the Centro Altagracia de Fe y Justicia, a Catholic advocacy and social justice organization based in Washington Heights and Inwood, offered a strong testimonial of her faith.  ""I'm excited, I'm encouraged, by the fervent passion that our young people are demonstrating,"" she said.   Along with New York history, one theme of the panel discussion was the impact of evangelical and Pentecostal Christianity on the Catholic Church in the United States. A study by the Pew Hispanic Center last year found that about one-third of all Catholics in the United States are now Latinos; that more than half of Hispanic Catholics identify themselves as charismatics; and that many of those who are joining evangelical churches are Catholic converts.

us,A Salmonella 'Smoking Gun',"The government's investigation into the Salmonella outbreak that began as a mystery focused on tomatoes has turned up the ""smoking gun,"" or at least one of them. From The Associated Press:  The salmonella strain linked to a nationwide outbreak has been found in irrigation water and a serrano pepper at a Mexican farm, federal health officials said Wednesday.   While serrano peppers have stood in the shadow of jalapeos for weeks as far as the inquiry goes, the Food and Drug Administration decided to issue a warning on both types of peppers on July 9, when officials seemed to shift their attention away from tomatoes.   Last week, the agency announced that it had traced the Salmonella strain to jalapeos grown in Mexico, though not at the same farm as the tainted irrigation water. There's no word on a third possible culprit: cilantro, an ingredient often found in salsas and other Mexican condiments that the 1,307 people in 43 states who were sickened seemed to have in common.   Even today, tomatoes have not been completely ruled out as a cause of outbreak, which looks to be of complicated origin. A health official quoted by Bloomberg News put today's serrano discovery in context:  ""We have a smoking gun, it appears,"" said Lonnie J. King, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, during the hearing. ""It also appears likely that more than one food vehicle has been involved in this outbreak.""  The latest break in the case emerged during a Congressional hearing concerning missteps in the investigation, ""The Recent Salmonella Outbreak: Lessons Learned and Consequences."" One of the lessons, though, was for lawmakers, not health officials: It's harder to shoot -- or at least criticize -- the messenger when they are carrying the best news so far in the inquiry.

The Team Obama bus caravan was wandering around rural Missouri Wednesday and pulled into the Bell Restaurant (a diner, as defined by this New Yorker but who am I to argue with a Show Me Stater), which advertises itself as offering B.B.Q., Steak and Seafood.  The candidate, who is sparing in consumption of almost everything, and has taken grief in the press for not letting his waist expand as the campaign season progresses, wanders in and immediately and loudly announces:  ""Well, I've had lunch, but I'm thinking maybe there is some pie.""  (He and his daughters had a back-and-forth in their Access Hollywood interview about the only sweet he likes: pie.)  At the diner, he then drops that hankering for pie, and sets to the business of chatting up waitresses, signing napkins and shaking hands with the 11 paying customers. These are mostly retired men in caps nursing their fifth or sixth cups of coffee. They are not a verbose lot.  ""How you guys doin'?"" the candidate asks a table of four.  ""Pretty good,"" one answers.  ""What sort of work you do?"" the candidate asks.  ""Retired,"" says one. ""Not much,"" says another.  O.K.   The candidate moves toward the kitchen, trailed by a beaming waitress or two. The food question hangs there. ""Well, I should order something,"" he says, adding a caveat: ""Now, I've had lunch.""  He settles on fried chicken; in his telling, he's become a junk-food dog. ""The healthy people, we'll give them the breasts,"" he tells the waitress. ""I'll eat the wings.""   Word now is out that a presidential candidate is in. People crowd by, cell phones held aloft. Darrel Martin, the stocky white-haired owner with a tight pompadour, pushes on through.  ""I came up here doing 80 on the interstate, yes I did,"" he announces, looking with just a touch of disgust at four large cops standing next to him. ""I knew every trooper with a radar gun would be here.""  This is the Republican red belt of Missouri, but celebrity tends to trump all. Even the Republicans smile and worry about ""going goofy"" with the candidate.  As the candidate headed for the door, a bag of fried chicken under his arm, waitress Mary Anderson picks up the phone.

While resistance to supporting a black candidate has dropped in every other age group since February, and overall stands at just 8 percent, it remains basically unchanged among the youngest voters,"" Larison writes. He adds:     While older generations report slightly increased unwillingness among friends, family and co-workers (which is the pollster's way of trying to get around respondents who self-censor), approximately one-fifth (22%) of 18-29 year olds state their own unwillingness to vote for a black presidential candidate. When asked about the willingness of friends, family and co-workers, the figure for ""no"" rises to 31%, which is the largest percentage in any age group.       ",2008-07-30T20:58:18+0000

Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Richardson, who was also a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out of the race in January, will attend both fund-raisers.

us,Google Gurus Plan to Cut Energy Use,"[UPDATE 7/31: See additional context on Google's own energy thirst below.] David M. Herszenhorn, who covers Congress, sent me a note from Washington today on an interesting hearing held to explore the role of efficiency in cutting Americans' expensive energy appetite.   Here's David's report:   WASHINGTON - Dan Reicher, Google's guru of all things related to energy and the environment, came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday with some ideas on how to keep Earth from overheating and poor families from freezing this winter in the face of sky-high prices for heating oil.   A central proposal, laid out in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, was a national program aimed at cutting heat and electricity bills in 10 million low-income homes over a decade. The existing federal ""weatherization"" program saw its Energy Department budget eliminated recently. The hearing was called ""Efficiency: The Hidden Secret to Solving Our Energy Crisis.""   Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the joint committee, said he planned to include the weatherization proposal in a bill later this year. ""I am very interested in the low-income home weatherization program,"" he said. ""And I'm going to put in some legislation to move it up.""   Over in the main part of the Capitol, lawmakers have been locked in a bitter stalemate over energy policy, with Republicans pushing for increased oil exploration, including expanded offshore drilling. Democrats, meanwhile, insist that drilling should be limited to existing leases on federal lands. Both sides say efforts to produce energy from renewable sources should be vastly increased, but they disagree on how to do so.  Mr. Reicher offered an array of ideas to a mostly receptive panel of lawmakers. In addition to weatherizing 10 million homes for low-income Americans, which he said would cost about $2 billion annually, he also said Congress should establish a mechanism called the Energy Efficiency Resource Standard that would set efficiency resource targets for electricity and gas suppliers over a given period of time.  He also called for a national ""renewable portfolio standard"" to increase the amount of electricity produced by sources other than fossil fuels. Some two dozen states have a hodgepodge of such requirements now for their utilities. This issue has divided Congress deeply in recent years. Other proposals included a greater focus on boosting fuel efficiency, the improvement of electric cars and increased tax incentives for the construction of energy-efficient buildings.  Perhaps Mr. Reicher's most intriguing comment, though, was his observation on the role that information technology will play in helping solve the nation's energy problems. ""The increasing interplay between energy hardware and information software -- and the corresponding rise of the Internet and the connectivity it brings -- adds to the potential to make and to use energy more productively,"" Mr. Reicher said. ""From smart meters and smart appliances to smart homes and a smart grid, we are poised to significantly advance our ability to monitor and manage energy.""  Presumably Google foresees a role in helping consumers or companies do this. It's already aggressively pursuing investments in what it calls ""Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal."" Mr. Reicher directs climate and energy initiatives at Google.org, the company's philanthropic arm, which has been capitalized with more than $1 billion in Google stock to address the issues of climate change, global poverty and global health.  UPDATE, 7/31: Google, of course, is large and fast growing user of energy. The company has been building large data centers -- warehouse sized buildings with rows upon rows of computers that can deliver search results, YouTube videos, email and a growing array of digital goodies -- around the United States and the world. Google does not disclose its own energy use or carbon ""footprint."" (Yahoo does disclose its carbon dioxide emissions.)  Collectively, data centers accounted for 1.5 percent of all electricity used in the United States in 2006. Even though Google is believed to have one of the largest collections of data centers of any company, its energy use likely accounts for a small fraction of that total.  In his testimony, Mr. Reicher addressed the company's electricity appetite: ""At Google we have been working to lower the cost and increase the deployment of renewable energy, and to accelerate the deployment of plug-in vehicles. We have also been working to increase our use of clean power and energy efficiency at Google data centers and offices in the U.S. and other countries. Together with other technology companies and organizations, Google launched the Climate Savers Computing Initiative last year to reduce the power consumption of computers and servers.""

us,"Ludacris Raps About Obama, Upsetting Many","(Photo: Ludacris (Photo: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters))   Ludacris has a crush on Obama, and all would be well today if he had created a song as inviting as some other musically-inclined supporters.   Instead, in the song, ""Politics,"" he did what he does best when matched with a booming bassline -- rapping without regard for anyone who might be offended. (You can listen to it here).  Offended, as it turns out, is precisely how many people should feel, according to a wide range of commentators -- including Senator Obama's spokesman.   ""This song is not only outrageously offensive to Senator Clinton, Reverend Jackson, Senator McCain, and President Bush,"" a spokesman, Bill Burton, said in a statement. ""It is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear.""  At a time in the presidential campaign when both sides stand accused of going too negative, Ludacris -- who once bragged in a song that he was ""from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows"" -- most certainly did.   Senator Clinton was called ""irrelevant"" and also a nasty name common in hip-hop lyrics but not in the remarks of presidential candidates. Senator McCain was the recipient of something that could be a schoolyard joke or an especially repulsive malediction, depending on the audience: ""McCain don't belong in any chair unless he's paralyzed.""   President Bush was also declared irrelevant, as well as ""the worst of all 43 presidents"" and ""mentally handicapped."" Reverend Jackson got off relatively easy as a ""slick"" politician.   Of course, this is precisely the kind of performance that won Ludacris fans around the world, three Grammy awards and Hollywood appeal. It also earned him a place on Senator Obama's iPod, a detail reported in June that Ludacris bragged about in the song:  With a slot in the president's iPod, Obama shouted him Said I handle my biz and I'm one of his favorite rappers  He was referring to a Rolling Stone interview in which Mr. Obama mentioned Ludacris, Jay-Z and Russell Simmons as ""great talents and great businessmen."" He also said that ""it would be nice if I could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying that they were getting bad images of themselves.""   Both points were reiterated today by Mr. Burton, ""While Ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics."" But the campaign was apparently referring to the misogyny and materialism, and not Ludacris' bold prediction that would suit it just fine: ""The first black president is destined and it's meant to be.""

us,Bad V.P. Picks,"Dan Schnur was the national communications director for John McCain's presidential campaign in 2000. (Full biography.)  Correction Appended  As the short lists of potential running mates for John McCain and Barack Obama grow shorter, an intriguing but somewhat unexpected question has emerged: Who would be the worse selection? Mitt Romney or Tim Kaine?   Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia seem to have emerged as among the most likely vice presidential choices for their party's nominees. But both men exacerbate the greatest weaknesses of Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama, respectively, rather than addressing them.   Conventional wisdom correctly suggests that Mr. McCain could benefit from a running mate who adds credibility on economic issues and excites the Republicans' conservative base. Mr. Romney's accomplishments in the private sector would be valuable in a discussion of jobs creation and economic growth, but he was attacked relentlessly in his campaign for Senate against Ted Kennedy for the layoffs and downsizing that occurred in companies he had acquired. At a time when voters are worried about their own job security, those same criticisms could pack greater punch this year.  Mr. Romney's ability to motivate the G.O.P. base is even more of an open question. While Mr. McCain is still trying to shore up his support among conservatives, there's no evidence that Mr. Romney, who lost those voters to John McCain and Mike Huckabee in the primaries, would help close the sale. Already, several religious conservative leaders have come forward warning that naming Mitt Romney would be counterproductive. Indeed, Mr. McCain can still rally these voters on his own by talking about national security, tax cuts and energy policy, or by scaring them about Barack Obama. But it's hard to see how Mr. Romney makes that rally any easier.  The attraction of Tim Kaine as Mr. Obama's running mate is demographic. Mr. Kaine is Catholic, speaks fluent Spanish and has successfully reached the working-class voters who eluded Mr. Obama in the primaries. But his resume is even thinner than Mr. Obama's. Indeed, Mr. Kaine's previous experience as a lieutenant governor and a mayor of Richmond does nothing to bolster Mr. Obama's credentials on national security or foreign policy. Mr. Obama may have helped himself in this area during his recent tour of the Middle East and Europe, but there are a number of Democratic Senators -- most notably Joe Biden of Delaware and Jack Reed of Rhode Island -- who can give him much more help in this area.   Both Mr. Romney's and Mr. Kaine's backers make the case for their selections by pointing to their ability to help in key swing states. Mr. McCain has targeted Michigan, where Mr. Romney's father was governor, and the Obama campaign is pouring resources into Virginia. But unless you count Al Gore in 1992 (which you shouldn't because Bill Clinton would have carried Tennessee no matter what), neither party's running mate has helped their ticket in a critically contested state since Lyndon Johnson helped John F. Kennedy carry Texas. And it's a good rule of politics to assume that when something doesn't happen for 48 years, it's not much of a rule.  Pundits and political backseat drivers point out that a vice presidential nominee rarely makes much difference to the voters one way or another. Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Kaine could end up having an impact -- just not the type that their would-be bosses want. Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama have correctly identified what they need in their running mates. Now all they have to do is find someone who actually fits the bill.  A previous version of this article misstated the dates when Tim Kaine served as mayor of Richmond. Mr. Kaine was mayor from 1998 to 2000, not ""three years ago."" ",2008-07-30T23:46:26+0000

Senator John McCain waded once more Wednesday evening into the fraught question of whether he would consider raising payroll taxes to shore up Social Security.   Mr. McCain told donors at a fund-raiser here that ""in any negotiation that I might have, when I go in my position will be that I am opposed to raising taxes.''   It was far less absolute than his insistence earlier in the day at a stop in Colorado that: ""I want to look you in the eye: I will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase.''    At the fund-raiser, Mr. McCain said: ""I am opposed to raising taxes -- I am opposed to raising taxes. Senator Obama wants to raise your taxes. He wants to raise your taxes. And in any negotiation that I might have, when I go in my position will be that I am opposed to raising taxes. But we have to work together to save Social Security. This young man standing right in front of me  Social Security benefits won't be there for him when he retires. Is this right for us to lay on to the next generation of Americans the burden that we've imposed on them? No.''   Mr. McCain also criticized his rival, Senator Barack Obama, on Iraq, and noted that he had ""no military experience whatsoever.''   ""What puzzled me was when Senator Obama announced his policy concerning Iraq before he left, having not having been there in more than 900 days,'' he said. ""And he got a briefing from General Petraeus and General Petraeus told him that his policy of setting a date for withdrawal is dangerous for America and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on television, our highest ranking military officer, said it would be a dangerous course. Now for somebody who's had no military experience whatsoever, I would strongly recommend that Senator Obama at least listen, at least listen to our military leaders and devise a policy before you leave.''

us,Melena Ryziks Tour Diary: Almost Famous?,"The rock star life it wasnt. From the moment I began working on this story, following 23-year-old Sean Carlson as he planned his first-ever tour from his home  actually, his fathers home  in L.A., it was clear that I would not be experiencing the perks that people usually imagine when they think of bands on the road. Instead of a plush custom-made Pimp My Ride-worthy vehicle, the tour would be criss-crossing the country on a vintage Blue Bird school bus, complete with narrow brown vinyl seats, pinchy windows and no air-conditioning. (The one concession to modernity: air cards, for Internet access.)And instead of one band and a roadie or two, there would be three or four groups, plus the crew of four, a couple of photographers, some members of a Philly art collective, a merch girl, an anarchist bookstore guy and a video blogger  sometimes more than two dozen people  all traveling side by side. To conserve money and promote eco-consciousness, Sean and his crew of merry punkers had the bus converted to run on bio-diesel  which meant that late each night they went on a messy scouting trip to score grease. (Their D.I.Y. ethos, and their lack of cash, prevented them from buying it.)I followed the tour from its first day, when it stopped in Brooklyn to pick up several of the bands  the headliners, Matt & Kim, and their friends Team Robespierre  then drove to the first shows in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. I caught up with it again for a couple of gigs in Texas, and for the final two nights back in New York City. To answer everyones first question: no, the veggie oil-fueled bus didnt smell like French fries. Especially at the end, it smelled likes boys and sweat and whiskey. Ok, so it was a little bit rock star.",2008-07-31T04:00:00+0000

Some of these critics will be included in the town hall special, NBC said on Tuesday, along with experts in adolescent psychology and teenage pregnancy. The teenage couples and the actual parents of the children will also be in attendance. The meeting will be broadcast on Aug. 6, with Hoda Kotb, the Today show co-host, and Dr. Drew Pinsky, the television personality whos also a professor of psychiatry, as hosts.

us,Icahn Scores Big With ImClone Bid,"He may not have made a mint on Yahoo, but Carl Icahn, the billionaire financier with a knack for shaking things up, looks set to hit the jackpot on ImClone Systems.  Bristol-Myers Squibb on Thursday offered to buy ImClone for $60 per share, which is nearly double what Mr. Icahn paid for his stake in the drug maker about two years ago, according to data from regulatory filings. Mr. Icahn became ImClone's chairman in October 2006 after an intense proxy battle, which included the kind of acerbic letters to shareholders that he sent in its more recent feud with Yahoo's board.   If the ImClone sale goes through at the offered price, it would represent a hefty payback for Mr. Icahn's troubles.  ImClone makes the cancer drug Erbitux. The drug has had an up-and-down history: It was initially rejected by the Food and Drug Administration -- stock trades around that time led to the prosecution of Martha Stewart -- but has since turned into a steady performer.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2006, Mr. Icahn indicated that the total purchase price for the nearly 11.7 million shares owned by him or his funds was $390.5 million. That suggests he paid an average of about $33.46 each for the ImClone shares.   Confusingly, Mr. Icahn told The New York Times in October 2006 that most of the ImClone shares he owned at the time were acquired when the stock was selling below $20. At least two filings with the S.E.C. list transactions in which his funds paid per-share prices in the high $20 to low $30 range for ImClone stock.  In any case, Mr. Icahn clearly paid far below what Bristol-Myers offered for ImClone on Thursday. At $60 per share, Mr. Icahn's stake is worth about $700 million, nearly 80 percent above his total purchase price as reported to the S.E.C.  And he may do even better than that: ImClone's shares jumped to $64 apiece in early trading Thursday, as investors seemed to be hoping for a higher bid.

us,"Dot Earth: Bangladesh, Sediment and Sea Level","(Photo: Sediment from rivers is adding land area to Bangladesh. Can this counter rising seas? (The New York Times)) Scientists in Bangladesh have been reappraising forecasts of eventual inundation of sprawling, crowded delta regions as seas rise in a warming world. According to several reports, a fresh satellite analysis shows that new lands formed by sediment carried from the crumbling Himalayas are adding to Bangladesh's land area -- at least for now.   As wire stories circulated overnight, I sent out some queries to sea-level experts and will report back on how this battle between new sediment and rising seas will play out.   Sea level is not uniform globally. Juneau, Alaska, is rising, for instance. The land there is rebounding, freed of the weight of ice-age glaciers. When I visited Juneau last year, biologists told me that a fight is brewing over whether protected coastal wetlands should no longer be protected once they are dry. (Coastal property owners say the new land is theirs.)  The fate of Bangladesh's lowlands will be determined by a mix of changes in the height of the Indian Ocean, subsidence of deltas as aquifers are drained and newly deposited sediments compress, and the addition of all that Himalayan soil.  In checking out the news from Bangladesh, I noticed that the Dutch have been advising Bangladeshis to do as the Dutch do -- use engineering to work with the flow of sediment and accelerate the accretion of new lands. A recent article in The New Nation -- ""Can Bangladesh Trap Silt?"" -- is worth a look. All of this serves as a useful reminder that humans are not some static element in the climate puzzle, but a dynamic, responsive and innovative one -- at least once a human community gets a strong signal that action is needed.   When I wrote with James Kanter last year about the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on impacts from global warming, I made sure we noted how the consequences for humans change significantly when adaptation is taken into account (boldface added):    Without such adaptations, it said, a rise of 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century could lead to the inundation of coasts and islands inhabited by hundreds of millions of people. But if steady investments are made in seawalls and other coastal protections, vulnerability could be sharply reduced.  Bangladesh has already proved to be one of the world's most resilient countries in the face of flood threats, as Secretary General Ban Ki-moon pointed out here. It sounds as if the country is getting geared up to find ways to exploit the eroding Himalayas as a way to counter the erosion of its coasts.  Adaptation can buy time and cut losses in the short run. But in the end, many experts note that unabated greenhouse-gas emissions essentially mean there will be no new normal climate or coastline to adapt to -- in Bangladesh or anywhere else.

us,City Room: Photos of Brooklyns Waterfront,"The Domino sugar refinery has been on the East River for more than a century. Part of the plant is now a landmark, but the windows in this view will be demolished. (Photo: Nathan Kensinger) Slide ShowNathan Kensinger generally does not ask for permission when he photographs the decaying remnants of Brooklyn's industrial waterfront. Since 2003, he has wandered into shuttered factories, padlocked basements and forbidding warehouses. He often goes along with other photographers who have an adventurous bent. He hasn't been arrested, yet, but he doesn't want to tempt fate, either.   Mr. Kensinger's photographs are now on view in a small exhibition, ""Twilight on the Waterfront: Brooklyn's Vanishing Industrial Heritage,"" that opened on June 17 and runs through Aug. 30 at the central branch of the Brooklyn Public Library.   His subjects range from the Domino sugar refinery in Williamsburg, part of which was declared a landmark in 2007; the ruins of the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse, which were ravaged by arson in 2006; and the haunting remains of Dead Horse Bay, where a 17th-century Dutch mill once stood.   Mr. Kensinger, 29, grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco, within view of the Navy Yard, and now lives near the Gowanus Canal; water has long been a source of fascination. He studied documentary filmmaking at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., where he graduated in 2001, then worked on a still-unfinished documentary for two years, before moving to Brooklyn.  In recent years, Mr. Kensinger said in a phone interview, he has spent more time photographing, though he still focuses on documentary filmmaking and cinematography. He also works as a location scout for ""Law & Order: SVU,"" a job that came about, he said, because of his knowledge of the city's more arcane locations.   He usually takes nothing more than a single digital camera -- he uses a Nikon D80 -- with just one lens. He explained:    I really have to keep the equipment pretty light because most of these spaces are off-limits. To gain access to them, I can't really carry a lot of heavy equipment. I might be climbing a fence or climbing a wall, which makes it difficult to carry a lot of stuff with me. It's very difficult to gain access to those sites. A lot of them I gained access to as they were being demolished. They don't want people taking photographs -- not only for safety reasons, but also maybe because they don't want to encourage preservationists.   Some hazards were involved. ""I really don't like the guard dogs,"" Mr. Kensinger said. ""There's definitely a degree of danger to the whole enterprise, but I think the rewards of seeing these spaces that no one else is able to see is worth my while. There's certainly danger with buildings decaying, floors collapsing, stepping on nails. I stepped on a 10-inch nail one time. It was not so fun."" (Without revealing too many specifics, Mr. Kensinger said he carefully prepares before each shoot, scouting out security procedures and determining the best ways to get access.)  Mr. Kensinger is part of a movement of adventure urban explorer, who wander -- and document -- the city's forbidden places. As ""Children of Darkness,"" a 2007 article in The Times, explained, these explorers include artists like Miru Kim, who takes photographs of herself, naked, posed in abandoned tunnels and structures throughout the city and elsewhere.  Such photographs seem to have found an audience. Mr. Kensinger's work is featured in ""Click! A Crowd-Curated Exhibition"" at the Brooklyn Museum, and through his Web site, he has found like-minded photographers and explorers.

us,Quest for True Blu-ray Quality via Satellite,"High-definition, Blu-ray discs offer consumers what is now the ultimate in picture quality: its programming is recorded in the 1080p format, delivering 1,080 lines of information, progressively scanned. If you own a large-enough 1080p flat panel TV, you'll be able to see the difference between its picture and that of a high-definition image transmitted by your local TV station, cable or satellite.  Until now, 1080p programming could not be transmitted because the signal contains too much information to squeeze into the available bandwidth. Instead it's only been available on recorded media, like Blu-ray. So the programming you get with an antenna or cable is usually sent in the less-high-definition 1080i (for interlace) resolution.   Which is why Thursday's announcement by Dish Network that they will start showing 1080p content is potentially significant. In its news release, the company says that in addition to a host of 17 new national high-definition channels, it will also offer pay-per-view movies in 1080p. The first, available on Friday, is ""I Am Legend,"" the Will Smith sci-fi film.  While the satellite company may be the first to sell 1080p content, they're not the first to announce it. Those honors go to DirecTV; on Monday the company said it would introduce an additional 30 national high-definition channels by the middle of August, bringing its high definition total up to 130 (Dish says it will have 100 high-definition national channels by Friday). And DirecTV announced it will also offer 1080p pay per view programming later this year.   Both companies imply that their 1080p offerings will look as good as Blu-ray discs. DirecTV says its titles are in ""the same format used by Blu-Ray HD DVDs."" Dish is even more direct, (so to speak), calling its offerings ""Blu-ray disc quality.""  But are they Blu-ray quality? Resolution is not the only factor that determines picture quality. Another is bit rate, the number of bits per second that are being transmitted down the pipe to consumers.   All digital television is compressed, reducing the amount of space the signal needs, while trying not to cut picture quality. But when a transmission gets too compressed -- if a program provider needs extra space for more channels, for instance -- the result can be a picture that breaks up into little squares or gets the ""mosquito effect,"" a sense that a swarm of bugs is circling around an object in motion.  Bit rate is a subject that the cable and satellite providers never discuss, but anyone who watches the various services can see that some channels are considerably softer looking than others. Fast-moving action, as found in sports programming, requires more bits (less compression). Program providers may ""borrow"" bits from one channel and give them to another.  Pete Putman, a well-known television engineer and owner of ROAM Consulting, and his colleagues often check bit rates, and he's found that CBS, when viewed over the air, generally offers the highest, around 17 megabits a second for their high definition programming. The new digital converter boxes now being used by Dish and DirecTV use a more advanced compression scheme, and Putman believes that they are sending out high-definition programming at around 6 to 8 megabits a second.   Requirements may eventually change. As Consumer Electronics Daily, a trade paper, reported today, Fujitsu asserts that it has found a way to reduce the bit rate for the compression schemes now used by DirecTV and Dish. The company reportedly has filed more than a dozen patents on picture coding that one day may bring the high-definition compression rate down to 4 megabits a second.  But for now, Putman believes that for a 1080p picture to look like Blu-ray, program providers will have to increase their bit rate to 16 or 18 megabits a second. Do they have the capacity to do that? And if not, will the Blu-ray camp call foul?  ""We'll have to see what comparisons are made and what comes out of it,"" said Andy Parsons, head of the Blu-ray Disc Association.

The latest posts on his Icahn Report, which appeared Thursday morning, comprise of a critique of the financial press and an explanation of why he dropped his proxy fight with Yahoo. He also said that, after months of highly public feuding with Yahoo, he won't be making an appearance at its upcoming shareholder meeting.  His media commentary was inspired by an article published last week in The Wall Street Journal, which seemed to question his combative management style.  ""The article states that I often exert an 'outsized influence' as a board member, implying that this is somehow reckless and counter to the best interests of stockholders,"" Mr. Icahn wrote. ""Major shareholders, particularly those who serve on boards, should actively question decisions a company makes many business journalists don't seem to get this important point, and I have never understood why""   Elsewhere in the post, he said: ""Historians will marvel at why the press wont write more about the egregious abuses and mismanagement at corporate boards in America.""  Then Mr. Icahn focused on his recent settlement with Yahoo, in which he dropped his fight to gain control of the Internet giant's board and instead agreed to take three seats for him and his allies.   ""Last week, I realized it was impossible to gain enough support from the large institutions to win a majority of the Yahoo! directorships,"" Mr. Icahn wrote. ""Realizing I could not gain control, I saw no point in spending the final two weeks in a debilitating fight.""  Mr. Icahn went on to say that having a minority board presence is not ideal, but that he had worked out a deal with management ""that any meaningful transaction, including the strategy in dealing with that transaction, will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made.""   But those hoping to catch a glimpse of the corporate agitator at the upcoming Yahoo shareholder meeting will be disappointed: Mr. Icahn said he would not be attending.

us,Gates Plans Post-Gates Pentagon,"(Photo: (Photo: Jim Young/Reuters))   By announcing today that military combat tours would be shortened from 15 to 12 months, President Bush was implementing a major recommendation that his Pentagon chief made months earlier.   In a profile earlier this year in The New York Times Magazine, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is quoted telling a group of soldiers' wives at Fort Hood last November that he would seek to shorten the tours by the end of 2008, when President Bush's tenure in office (and presumably his own) would be drawing to a close. But he was thinking beyond that date as well, speaking of hopes that troops might spend as long as three years at Stateside bases between combat tours.  As it turned out, the thought was just one element of his long-term vision for the military. As The Washington Post reports today, Mr. Gates approved a new National Defense Strategy last month, a step called ""unusual"" for someone who probably has only six months left in office. (Would he stay on after January to serve in, for example, an Obama administration? ""Inconceivable,"" he says.)  Even so, Mr. Gates, who has had the ear of two presidents named Bush, is clearly trying to influence the next administration with his strategy paper. From the Post article:  In a foreword to the document Gates acknowledges that a new president will soon reassess threats and priorities. Gates wrote that he perceives this document as a ""a blueprint to success"" for a future administration.  Some have argued that a defense strategy produced in the last year of the first Bush administration by a Pentagon headed by Dick Cheney served as a blueprint for the current one, so Mr. Gates's hope may be based in at least some precedent.  The new strategy document, however, reportedly focuses mainly on battling terrorists and other ""irregular"" foes, rather than potential military threats from China, Russia or any other nation that could challenge the United States as the sole superpower, the Pentagon's chief worry in Mr. Cheney's day as Secretary of Defense. In another contrast to the earlier strategy, Mr. Gates is rather straightforward in the new document about downgrading the importance of the immense combat capabilities of his department, in favor of taking full advantage of the nation's so-called ""soft power"":   ""The use of force plays a role, yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development, as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies,"" the document said. ""For these reasons, arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves, but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves.""   The approach sounded similar -- at least in broad outlines -- to the one laid out in a RAND study of how to end terrorism, released earlier this week. And it will probably attract the same criticism -- that it is unwise to shift away from conventional warfare. Critics may comfort themselves with knowing that both documents may be dismissed just as lightly by whoever succeeds Mr. Gates, and his boss in the White House, in January.

us,"It's the Software, Not You","A couple of weeks ago, I spent a long weekend trip to New York City with my kids. We took a bunch of taxi rides over the three days, and discovered that the taxis are equipped with touchscreen credit-card payment systems.   As you complete the transaction, a final screen offers to save you time with shortcuts for adding a tip.  The thing is, the software for these systems come from two different companies. In some cabs, you're offered buttons that add 15%, 20% or 25% tip--perfectly understandable.  But in the other half of the taxis, the tip buttons say $2, $3 and $4. That's it, no matter how long or short the ride was.   Considering the huge range of fares, those options are almost never exactly what you want. A percentage makes infinitely more sense.  It reminded me suddenly of the touchscreen kiosks at Delta. Now, I actually like Delta quite a lot, and think they're doing a lot of things right lately. But the kiosks--oh, man.  You come up, you swipe your credit card. That alone ought to tell the kiosk who you are, and it should therefore know what flight you're checking in for.   But no, it plays dumb. It asks you to key in your destination. So you type in ""SAN"" for San Francisco. And it asks you: San Francisco, San Diego, or San Juan? Oh, I don't know--how about THE ONE YOU HAVE A RESERVATION ON!?   (Yes, yes, I know--you might have more than one reservation on Delta. But come on. Let's say you have flights today at 3 pm, tomorrow at 5 pm, and next Friday at 8 pm. As you swipe your credit card, today, at 1:30 pm, does it really think you're checking in for anything but the first one?)  But O.K. You tap San Francisco. And now--I kid you not--it wants to know what time of day the flight departs!   Are you kidding me? It doesn't know the airline's own flight time? Come on--it already knows what flight I'm on, so what's the point of this exercise? For God's sake, just check me in!  Whenever I encounter badly designed software like this, I stand there, slack-jawed, mind boggling, and wonder what on earth the designers were *thinking.* Not, obviously, about elegance, intelligence and simplicity.  Years ago, I read about a software designer at Palm named Rob Haitani. In designing the address-book program for the PalmPilot, he favored placing the ""Add"" button (to input a new person's contact information) at the bottom of the tiny 160-pixel-square screen, but relegating the ""Delete"" command to a pull-down menu.   His fellow designers argued that those commands are equivalent, and should therefore be displayed with equal prominence. Haitani, however, disagreed. You add people to your address book all the time. But you delete people only rarely--when the die, move away or break up with you. So Add should be prominent, and Delete should be hidden to save screen space.  That's intelligence.  Maybe it's a laziness thing, or a cost-saving thing. After all, it's less effort to make the end user jump through a bunch of hoops than to make your own software more intelligent.  All of these thoughts go through my mind every time I see the standard Windows software-installation wizard, seven screens long.  You don't really need seven screens of options to install a program, do you? Why can't it assume that you want the standard setup and get on with it?   Surely 90 percent of the time, people, YES, want the program in their Start menus; YES, want the typical installation; NO, don't want icons on the desktop; YES, agree to the legalese. And to accommodate the weirdos who wants something different, provide one single Installation Options button. And then get on with it. One screen, not seven.  Why do software designers want their work to appear more complex instead of less? I just don't get why they don't get it.  So the next time you're frustrated by software complexity, take heart; much of the time, it's not you. It's them. It's designers who have something on their mind other than software intelligence.

us,College Students Behaving Badly,"Many people associate property crime and other delinquent behaviors with low social status and a lack of education. But new research has identified a surprising risk factor for bad behavior -- college.  Men who attend college are more likely to commit property crimes during their college years than their non-college-attending peers, according to research to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Boston this weekend.  Sociologists at Bowling Green State University in Ohio examined data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which tracks education, crime levels, substance abuse and socializing among adolescents and young adults. Beginning with 9,246 students who were seventh through twelfth graders in the 1994-1995 academic year, the survey followed the students again in 1996 and 2001. The study defined ""college students"" or ""college-bound youth"" as those who were enrolled full-time in a four-year college for at least 12 months by the third wave of the survey. ""Non-college students"" were defined as those respondents who either did not attend college through the course of the study or were not enrolled full-time at a four-year university.  During adolescence, the prospect of attending college was positive. The researchers found that college-bound youth were less likely to be involved in criminal activity and substance use during adolescence than kids who weren't headed for college.  But college attendance appears to trigger some surprising changes. When male students enrolled in four-year universities, levels of drinking, property theft and unstructured socializing with friends increased and surpassed rates for their less-educated male peers.  The reason appears to be that kids who don't go to college simply have to grow up more quickly. College enrollment allows for a lifestyle that essentially extends the adolescent period, said Patrick M. Seffrin, the study's primary investigator and a graduate student and research assistant in the department of sociology and the Center for Family and Demographic Research at Bowling Green State University.  College delays entry into adult roles like marriage, parenting and full-time work. Instead, college students have lots of unstructured social time. Other studies have linked unstructured socializing or ""hanging out"" with higher levels of delinquency and risk taking.   ""College attendance is commonly associated with self-improvement and upward mobility,"" Mr. Seffrin said. ""Yet this research suggests that college may actually encourage, rather than deter, social deviance and risk-taking.''    ",2008-07-31T16:46:36+0000

""If Ted Stevens had retired in 2002, when he was 78 years old, it's doubtful he would have come under the scrutiny that produced this federal indictment,"" Carey writes. ""If Ted had been a private citizen in 2003, Bill Allen could have turned the Girdwood chalet into a mansion and nobody would have cared. But Ted Stevens wasn't about to retire. In an e-mail, he told me that a doctor he knew said there was no reason humans couldn't live and function well to age 120. Apparently that's what he was intended to do."" Carey continues:    As a much younger candidate for the Senate, Stevens repeatedly hammered incumbent Ernest Gruening as too old. His attacks in 1968 were blunt, personal and quite jarring -- especially as the ""aged"" Ernest Gruening was younger then than Stevens is now.  Stevens did not break the law because of his age. Rather, his lengthy service seems to have convinced him that his U.S. Senate seat was private property, his and his alone. He's among some senators of both parties who have the idea they are senator for life.  In fact, the Senate is becoming an old folks home. In 1928, Furnifold Simmons of North Carolina was the oldest senator, age 74. Today, 16 senators are 74 or older -- almost one-sixth of the entire body. If Mark Begich wins this Senate seat, he will, at age 46, become the third-youngest senator. ",2008-07-31T16:59:40+0000

us,M.T.A. Details MetroCard Problem,"Updated, 2:48 p.m. &#124; New York City Transit officials say a faulty encryption device was to blame for the widespread breakdowns in MetroCard vending machines on Monday and Tuesday. The problems left thousands of subway and bus riders unable to use credit and debit cards to purchase MetroCards during peak hours of the morning and evening rush on Monday, and again during the Tuesday morning rush.  Transit officials said on Thursday morning that an encryption device used to encode transmitted data for customer security was not working. The one functioning encryption device could not handle the load during peak hours, Paul J. Fleuranges, a spokesman for New York City Transit, the arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that runs the subways and buses, said in an e-mail message.  The system's 2,245 MetroCard vending machines are programmed to cancel credit and debit transactions after too much time has passed without bank authorization, Mr. Fleuranges said.  The problem was discovered following the Tuesday morning rush and another device was activated to distribute the workload, Mr. Fleuranges said.  Officials said they have asked the private contractor who provides the interface from the agency's data center to the banks to add a feature that will send out a warning signal when an encryption device goes down.  ""This will allow New York City Transit to take immediate action to prevent possible future outages,"" Mr. Fleuranges said.  Officials did not immediately identify the contractor, or say who operates the encryption devices: the contractor, the agency or the bank.  New York City Transit said in a statement on Thursday afternoon:   During three separate rush periods (Monday a.m. and p.m., and Tuesday a.m.), M.T.A. New York City Transit's MetroCard Vending Machines (MVMs) and MetroCard Express Machines (MEMs) had difficulty processing credit-and debit-card sales transactions, inconveniencing thousands of our customers. As customer usage increased, it took an increased period of time to receive authorizations for card usage from our bank. In such cases, the machines are programmed to cancel the transaction after too much time has elapsed without authorization.   After an investigation, it was discovered that one of the encryption devices was not operating. The devices are required by Credit Card Industry security protocols and are necessary to process transactions. The one functioning device could not handle the load during peak usage periods.   Normally the system is served by at least two encrypters (sometimes three). In this case, however, our monitoring system told us that two were active when in fact only one of them was working. This ""false positive"" was the main reason why it took so long to identify the cause.   Following Tuesday's a.m. rush period, when this issue was identified, another device was activated to distribute the workload and, as we expected, the change corrected the ""time out"" issues encountered over those three rush hours.   To eliminate a recurrence of this issue, we have requested that the contractor who provides the interface from the M.T.A. data center to the bank that authorizes credit-and-debit-card transactions investigate the addition of a triggering feature that will display a warning message when only one encryption device is active. This will allow NYC Transit to take immediate action to prevent possible future outages.   It should be noted that on Wednesday, with the problem corrected, we processed 211,000 credit/debit purchase requests at MVMs (about 20,000 above the normal figure) and successfully processed 99.98 percent of them. Only 35 attempted transactions didn't succeed, and only 14 of those ""timed out.""   The problems began occurring early Monday morning and became widespread from about 8:30 to 10:30, near the end of the morning rush, prompting the transit agency to issue a service alert warning riders of the problems.  The problems also caused confusion among transit workers and station agents, some of whom gave customers conflicting instructions on using the machines. The disruptions began again in the evening rush and again on Tuesday morning. Transit officials characterized the problem as ""unprecedented in magnitude.""   The Daily News reported that problems with the machines continued on Wednesday evening at Grand Central Terminal and at the 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue station. Mr. Fleuranges said those problems were resolved and were not related to the encryption issue.  The systemwide failure highlighted the increasing dependence New Yorkers have come to depend on debit and credit cards in their daily commute and the problems that can emerge with even small technical glitches. Credit and debit cards are used in about 30 percent of MetroCard transactions, accounting for about 62 percent of vending machine revenue, according to the agency. ",2008-07-31T17:16:14+0000

(Al Behrman/Associated Press))  Ken Griffey Jr. has approved a trade to the Chicago White Sox from the Cincinnati Reds. According to multiple media outlets, the Reds would receive pitcher Nick Masset and infielder Danny Richar in exchange for Griffey.   Griffey, who has never played in a World Series, may have a chance with the White Sox who lead the American League Central by one and a half games.  The deal is awaiting confirmation from the commissioner's office because more than $1 million is changing hands in order to split Griffey's remaining salary. Griffey is in the last year of a 9-year, $116.5 million deal. There is a $16.5 million option for 2009, with a $4 million buyout.   Since Griffey has 10 years of major league service, including five with the same team, he had the right to quash the deal.   The White Sox have Carlos Quentin in left field and Jermaine Dye in right so they would presumably return Griffey to center, a position he has not played regularly since 2006. Nick Swisher, the center fielder, and Paul Konerko could share time at first base. Jim Thome is the designated hitter.  Griffey, who has 608 career homers, is batting .245 with 15 homers and 53 runs batted in. ",2008-07-31T17:33:03+0000

us,McCain Camp Says Obama Is Playing the Race Card,"Updated &#124; 4:17 p.m.:  RACINE, Wis.  Senator John McCain's campaign accused Barack Obama of playing ""the race card'' on Thursday, citing his remarks that Republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out he ""doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.''  ""Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck,'' Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's campaign manager, said in a statement. ""It's divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.''  Mr. Davis was alluding to comments that Mr. Obama made Wednesday in Missouri when he reacted to the increasingly negative tone, and negative ads that have been coming his way from the McCain campaign in recent days.  ""So nobody really thinks that Bush or McCain have a real answer for the challenges we face, so what they're going to try to do is make you scared of me,'' Mr. Obama said Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., in remarks that he echoed throughout the day. ""You know, he's not patriotic enough. He's got a funny name. You know, he doesn't look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills, you know. He's risky. That's essentially the argument they're making.''   Mr. Obama has made similar statements about the lines of attack against him before, and was even more direct last month when he said: ""We know what kind of campaign they're going to run. They're going to try to make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?''  The McCain campaign's decision to make the charge now that Mr. Obama was playing the ""race card"" comes as it has adopted a far more aggressive, negative posture towards Mr. Obama in recent days, trying to tar him as arrogant, out of touch and unprepared for the presidency with a series of statements by Mr. McCain and a series of negative ads  some of which have been condemned as misleading.   Mr. McCain said Thursday that he agreed with Mr. Davis's statement. ""I agree with it, and I'm disappointed that Senator Obama would say the things he's saying,"" Mr. McCain said on his campaign bus here, according to The Associated Press.   Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said: ""This is a race about big challenges -- a slumping economy, a broken foreign policy, and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies. Barack Obama in no way believes that the McCain campaign is using race as an issue, but he does believe they're using the same old low-road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign, and those are the issues he'll continue to talk about.""   By making the accusation that Mr. Obama was playing the ""race card,'' Mr. McCain's campaign, of course, was itself explicitly injecting race into its campaign against the first black man ever to become a major party's presidential nominee.  And the McCain campaign was echoing one of the more sensitive and divisive arguments that arose in Mr. Obama's primary battle against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. Many black leaders, and voters, criticized Bill Clinton for equating Mr. Obama's victory in the South Carolina primary with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's victory in the 1988 primary, which they saw as an attempt to diminish Mr. Obama's success. Mr. Clinton later complained in a radio interview that Mr. Obama had ""played the race card on me.''  The new discussion of race comes as Mr. McCain is schedule to address the National Urban League on Friday in Orlando.   Related: McCain Says He Is Proud of 'Celebrity' Ad ",2008-07-31T17:35:53+0000

us,McCain Says He Is Proud of 'Celebrity' Ad,"Update &#124; 4 p.m.: RACINE, Wis.  Senator John McCain said here Thursday that he was ""proud"" of his campaign's commercial likening Senator Barack Obama to celebrities like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.   Mr. McCain  who has not taken questions from his traveling press in a week  made the remarks after a young woman at a town-hall-style meeting here asked him if he had ""flip-flopped"" from his earlier pledge to refrain from mudslinging. She asked specifically asked about the new Britney Spears commercial. ""I was like, Oh-Kayyyy,'' she said of the ad, stretching out the word, apparently to indicate skepticism.   ""Campaigns are tough, but I'm proud of the campaign we've run,'' said Mr. McCain, whose campaign has broadcast a series of negative ads about Mr. Obama.   ""All I can say is we're proud of that commercial,'' he said.    The Obama campaign announced today it was setting up a new Web site called McCain's Low Road Express to debunk ads and statements by the McCain campaign and e-mailed a video of Mr. Obama discussing the ad today during a campaign event in Cedar Rapids. ""Given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and healthcare and jobs and our foreign policy, you'd think that we'd be having a serious debate,"" Mr. Obama said during But so far, all we've been hearing about is Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. I mean I do -- I do have to ask my opponent, is that the best you can come up with? Is that really what this election's about? Is that what is worthy of the American people? Even the media has pointed out that senator John McCain who started off talking about running an honorable campaign has fallen back into the predictable political attacks the demonstrably false statements.""   Here is the full exchange from the McCain town-hall-style meeting:   ""First of all, Senator McCain, I just want to commend you on your service for our country'' the young woman said. ""But, earlier this year, in April, you had made comments about, like, the mudslinging, how it had been affecting other campaigns, and how you didn't want to do that. But recently, especially last week when Obama went to Europe, it seemed like there was a lot of campaign ads that you put out that were doing that. And the one yesterday, comparing him to Britney Spears and Paris HiltonLike, I was like, Ok-Kayyyy. So it seems like, to Americans like me and other people, like you may have flip-flopped on what you had said earlier. What is your response to that?""   Mr. McCain replied: ""Well, first of all, um, let me say that there are differences, and we are drawing those differences and I have said earlier, I admire his campaign. But what we are talking about here is substance, and not style. And what we're talking about is who has an agenda for the future of America. Campaigns are tough, but I'm proud of the campaign that we have run, I'm proud of the issues that we have, trying to address with the American people, and again, I would hope that Senator Obama would join me so that we could discuss this as he said he wanted to quote, ""duel"" over taxes, I believe it was yesterday. So all I can say is that we're proud of that commercial, we think Americans need to know that I believe that we should base this campaign on what we can do for Americans here at home, and how we can make America safe and prosperous and that's the theme of our campaign. I thank you."" ",2008-07-31T18:05:30+0000

(Photos: David Gonzalez/The New York Times) )  The inventory at Brooklyn's Moore Street Retail Market is about to be restocked with the one must-have item that was fast running out: time.   Great big chunks of it.  A year and a half after the city proposed closing the Depression-era public market on the eastern edge of Williamsburg to make way for rental housing, the market's scrappy vendors are on the verge of signing a five-year lease (with an option for five more if things go well).   ""I'm happier than a dog with two tails,"" said Virgilio Rodriguez, the head of the vendor's association. ""They wanted to throw us out. Now we have a place that will give us life. This is our past, our present and our future.""  (Photo: Virgilio Rodriguez (black shirt) and Manuel Rivera (white shirt), merchant leaders at the Moore Street Market in Brooklyn. )  Manuel Rivera, a silver-haired record seller known as Papo, has been in the thick of the fight with the city. He was happily dazed as he merrily mixed metaphors.  ""This is an accomplishment,"" he said. ""We were dealing with monsters, millionaires. And now the little fish ate the big fish.""  The vendors see this as nothing short of a miracle -- like the ones promised by the sprays, baths and candles sold at the market's botanica. After all, when they were first told of their impending eviction, the city bluntly offered them $20 a square foot to leave the stalls many of them had rented for decades. Then it tried to exile them to an out of the way corner of the neighborhood.  Instead, the vendors scrambled to rally friends and neighbors to preserve what they saw as their tropical town square. They gathered 25,000 signatures on a petition and appealed to local politicians like United States Representative Nydia M. Velzquez and State Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez. They are good allies to have: she is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Small Business and he is chairman of the Assembly's Housing Committee.   In one of those ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" situations, these two not-exactly-chummy politicos teamed up to confront the city's Economic Development Corporation, the agency that oversees the market. State Senator Martin Malav Dilan, in the meantime, said he would block any plans to build anything on the market's site.   All of them saw the market as much more than a place that offered fruits,vegetables and meat (and potions, records and haircuts, too). It was a living link to the area's immigrant past.  (Photo: Knick-knacks on sale at the Moore Street Market. While current vendors won a new lease, any new vendors there will be limited to selling food.)  ""This is the last standing infrastructure that is endemic to a community that went from being Jewish, to Italian and now Latino,"" Mr. Lopez said. ""We were not going to allow it to go and we would get everyone all over the city, our political friends to be there to save it.""  The city had wanted to do away with the market because it had been running up a large deficit. Officials close to the negotiations said the city had already bought two parcels next to the market, as part of a plan to build rental housing. These officials, however, said building new housing became moot once the local economy soured.  ""I imagine the economic times have played a role in whatever the city had planned for the property,"" said Gerald Esposito, the manager of Community Board 1. ""Maybe the money was not there. Maybe it's back to Plan B. And we were Plan B.""  Elected officials are trying to improve the market's chances for survival by providing financing to improve the market itself and how it is run. As part of the proposed agreement, the Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group, will assume responsibility for the lease and help current tenants hone their business skills. New tenants will be limited to selling food and agricultural products, and the market will have to become self-supporting in a few years, officials said.  Mr. Esposito is hoping to widen the sidewalks outside the market to turn it into more of a plaza that connects to the surrounding neighborhood. (The few remaining public markets look like sealed bunkers -- which in a way they were, since they were designed to have clean indoor stalls in contrast to the funky, open-air carts that once ruled the chaotic sidewalks outside.)  Officials for the city's E.D.C. did not say much about the pending resolution of this long-simmering conflict. Nor did they want anyone inquiring about it. After spending an hour taking pictures in the market, an employee and two security guards told me that no pictures were allowed -- even though the market is a taxpayer-supported public site and is trying to drum up more business to survive.  But Representative Velazquez and Assemblyman Lopez were already claiming victory. And the merchants were all too ready to join in. Mr. Rodriguez, who runs a restaurant and a beverage distribution business at the market, is ready to dip into his inventory and throw a bash to celebrate their good fortune.  Who knows if old political foes will dance under the skylights? Who cares if a sign at the door says no music? The sign also says no pets. But you know the night of that party, two-tailed dogs will have their day on Moore Street.   ",2008-07-31T18:46:16+0000

us,Obama Slams McCain's Energy Plan,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa -- Barack Obama took Exxon Mobil's report of a record $11.68 billion profit last quarter and his own speech on energy policy and fashioned a rhetorical mortar shell aimed at Senator John McCain.  Mr. McCain's corporate tax plan, he claimed, would yield $4 billion a year in savings for oil companies while his proposed federal gas tax holiday would pay for half a tank of gasoline over the course of an entire summer.  ""So under my opponent's plan, the oil companies get billions more and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on big oil that got us into this crisis,"" he told more than a thousand people in a college gym here. ""That's a risk that we just can't afford to take. Not this time.""  The Democratic candidate then turned to his own plan: A $150 billion investment over 10 years in alternative energies and fuels. (The funding of this plan is not entirely clear.) He counseled optimism, promising a transition to an economy based thousands of new businesses working on wind, solar and bio-fuels.   ""We can't have a policy that tinkers around the margins while going down an oil company's wish list  it's time to fundamentally transform our energy economy,"" he said. These steps are not far-off, pie-in-the-sky solutions.""  Energy policy is, in fact, a tricky political business for the candidates. This spring, Mr. Obama successfully turned Senator Hillary Clinton's advocacy of a federal gas tax holiday against her, portraying it as a step that would save voters precious few dollars and beggar the federal highway fund. Senator McCain also endorses this gas tax holiday.  When told that Mr. Obama said that the average American could save as much money by keeping their tires filled with air as drilling for new oil promises, Mr. McCain replied:  ""He suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas,"" Mr. McCain said. ""My friends, let's do that, but do you think that's enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil? I don't think so.""  But as oil prices top $4 a gallon, Mr. McCain's advocacy of off-shore oil drilling is a different matter. The Republican candidate acknowledges drilling will have little short-term value (The Bush Energy Department estimates that new off-shore drilling would not result in more production and lower prices for at least ten years). But he portrays this step as a long term strategic winner, and recent polls show that message beginning to resonate with voters.  Mr. Obama counters that oil companies already have 68 million acres of federal land and off-shore waters under lease for exploration, and that these are largely untouched. Oil companies are in fact exploring oil production on some percentage of these acres, obtaining permits and even drilling holes. But wide expanses are not yet productive.  The Democratic candidate has tackled the drilling question on two levels, as bad policy and as fundraising politics.  ""It won't lower prices today.

Rangel (Photo: Susan Walsh/Associated Press))  The House of Representatives decided on Thursday afternoon to table, by a vote of 254 to 138, a Republican resolution to censure Representative Charles B. Rangel, the powerful New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The resolution said Mr. Rangel ""dishonored himself and brought discredit to the House,"" citing a report in The New York Times on July 11 that Mr. Rangel occupied four rent-stabilized apartments in a Harlem building, including one that he used as a campaign office.   Mr. Rangel, who was elected to the House in 1970 and is the dean of the New York Congressional delegation, has defended his housing arrangements as legal and fair and, in a forceful address to his colleagues, said he had done nothing wrong, urging lawmakers to reject the censure motion. He said he would welcome a review by the House ethics committee into his housing arrangements and into questions about his use of Congressional stationery to promote a $30 million academic center at the City College of New York, his alma mater. The Washington Post reported on July 15 that Mr. Rangel had used the letterhead to ask foundations and corporations to support the center, which will house his papers.   ""I've never felt more secure that I've violated no law and no spirit of the law, but in order to make certain -- to make certain -- that there is no cloud over my conduct in New York, I ask the ethics committee to look into it,"" Mr. Rangel said.  Mr. Rangel has said The Times's article was unfair, a theme he emphasized in his remarks from the House floor.   ""With not one scintilla of any evidence other than a newspaper story, I think fairness would say for God's sake, don't make a politics out of personal reputation. Strike out 'discredit,' strike out 'censure' and put in there whatever the heck the ethics committee will recommend, I join with them, I ask you to consider that, and I yield back the balance of my time,"" he said at the close of his remarks.   The censure resolution, which was reported this morning on the Web site Politico, was put forward by the Republican minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio. It accused Mr. Rangel of violating federal law and House rules -- including the House gift ban. The resolution argued that the favorable housing agreement amounted to a gift that Mr. Rangel failed to report. It also argued that Mr. Rangel received an illegal campaign contribution in the form of office space. Sylvia Olnick, an owner of the Olnick Organization, Mr. Rangel's landlord, has given contributions to Mr. Rangel's campaign and to his political action committee.  In a statement, Mr. Boehner said the Democrats, who seized control of the House in 2006, have failed to live up to their promise to root out corruption. Mr. Boehner's motion, known as a privileged resolution, came two days after Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the longest-serving Republican, was indicted on federal charges of making false statements.   Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, moved to table the resolution. The Republicans requested a roll-call vote on the matter.  The full text of Mr. Rangel's statement on the floor of the House, as transcribed by The Times, follows:   Thank you Mr. Speaker, and I promise you this will not take anywhere near one hour. I was advised last night and assured this morning that the minority intended to bring up a resolution recommending that I be censured, or that my conduct, as reported in The New York Times, would be declared that I was a discredit to this House. There's no one in this House that's more thick-skinned than I am in terms of playing politics, but playing with someone's reputation, especially someone that has felt so honored to serve in this House -- I really think goes a step beyond that. In reading the allegations as to where my campaign headquarters was located or what the rent should have been, I've never felt more secure that I've violated no law and no spirit of the law, but in order to make certain  to make certain  that there is no cloud over my conduct in New York, I ask the ethics committee to look into it, to investigate to do whatever us necessary to bring this to the House and to bring it to my family and friends.   In addition to that the same newspaper reported that I was overly aggressive in trying to raise funds in order to encourage monies to go to a local college that encouraged minorities and others to get involved in public service, and even though there was no request for money, the mere fact that there was a cloud involved in the accusation by the newspaper, even though there have been more newspaper articles correcting it than anything else - referred that too to the ethics committee. And showing that I do want this to be sincerely investigated, I'm asking the minority to allow me to join in with them in this resolution to say this matter should be cleared up. But there's no need, even for mean-spirited people in the minority, to say that I'm a discredit to the United States Congress, based on a newspaper story. And worse than that, there's no reason why Republicans or Democrats should do this to each other, based on any newspaper story.  And so I don't know the parliamentary inquiry and as most of you suspected, most of my friends say, 'Rangel, the less you say, the better. Get out of the headlines and do all of these things.' And this is what I normally recommend to newer members: 'Just leave it alone, it'll go away.' But my reputation won't, and I could not really appreciate, if this body was to recommend that, I'm dishonored - that I represent, I represent, bring dishonor to this wonderful House and this wonderful country or that I be censured. And so I make an appeal to the minority, let me join in with you with the request, let me say if there's any doubts about anything, I would feel better if it went to the ethics committee, I have requested that it go in with the ethics committee, let us join in but with not one scintilla of any evidence other than a newspaper story, I think fairness would say for God's sake, don't make a politics out of personal reputation. Strike out 'discredit,' strike out censure and put in there whatever the heck the ethics committee will recommend, I join with them, I ask you to consider that, and I yield back the balance of my time.

us,Fired Crisis Director Resurfaces,"(Photo: The entire span of the Interstate 35-W bridge over the Mississippi River collapsed last Aug. 1, a disaster later traced to a design flaw. (Photo: Photo: Allen Brisson-Smith for The New York Times))   Correction Appended  Update, Friday, 12:03 p.m. As a commenter just posted, Sonia Pitt has been fired again.  One of the themes developing in the days leading up to the first anniversary of the Minnesota bridge collapse posits that the tragedy's lessons had not yet sunk in. Bridges still crumble, leaders still clamor for more funds to fix them and, as we learned today, the government is still struggling to rebuild the public's trust.  The Star Tribune reports that an official fired for failing the state in the aftermath of the incident that killed 13 people has somehow ended up at Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration.   In May, Sonia Pitt began work at T.S.A. headquarters in Arlington, Va., as a ""transportation security specialist,"" a job that pays $89,920 a year, the agency confirmed.   Her unceremonious exit from state government, where she served as the Minnesota Department of Transportation's director of homeland security and emergency management, was sped by a chain of events described on The Lede in May by Patrick J. Lyons:  Far from rushing home to take charge personally when the bridge fell, Ms. Pitt stayed out of town for another 10 days, on a mixed business-and-personal visit to Washington and to Cambridge, Mass., before returning to Minneapolis and the mess.  After investigations turned up a number of embarrassing things about how she had been operating (using her state cell phone for personal calls on the road, for instance, and claiming thousands of dollars in dubious travel expenses, and skipping a six-week training and certification course in, um, emergency management), she was dismissed from the post on Nov. 9. A month later, three officials above her in the hierarchy were disciplined for failing to supervise her, and Lt. Gov. Carol Molnau, who also served as transportation commissioner at the time (not anymore), allowed as how nearly a week went by after the bridge collapse before she even noticed that Ms. Pitt was not around.   The post was about an arbitrator's decision to uphold her firing, which Ms. Pitt challenged. She was hired by the T.S.A. just 10 days later, the Tribune observed.  Perhaps sensing the potential for outrage over the hire, the T.S.A. moved quickly after the news broke to announce that it had begun an investigation on why Ms. Pitt was hired.  Correction: The first reference to Transportation Security Agency erroneously called it the Transportation ""Safety"" Agency. We apologize for the error. ",2008-07-31T20:28:42+0000

us,Camp Co-Dependence,"I'm sure we all read, with equal parts disgust and delectation, The Times' story last week on affluent parents who just can't let go when their children abandon them for sleep-away camp.   In case you missed it, the article presented fathers and mothers so used to instant service that they call camp directors at all hours of the day and night to sound the alarm if they suspect Junior isn't using sunscreen. It showcased ""high-end"" sleep-away camps that employ full-time ""parent liaisons"" just to handle such phone calls and e-mail traffic, ""almost like a hotel concierge listening to a client's needs,"" as a camp consultant put it.   One parent liaison explained that all her careful hand-holding can, when successful, make camp a learning experience for parents, too. The hope, she said, is that by the end, ""They've learned how to separate a little bit better.""   The most enlightening part of the article for me was the most prominently featured camp's reported cost: $10,000. Reading the price, I finally understood why, whenever I make mention of the fact that my elder daughter attends sleep-away camp, a few responders always comment upon how wealthy I must be.   For the record: my daughter's sleep-away camp costs $550 a week.   Which, I now realize, is a good thing for reasons far beyond the family budget.  The $10,000-camp universe appears to be rife with what mental health professionals are now calling ""affluenza,"" a social pathology that, they say, is rampant at a time when getting and spending -- a lot -- have become our nation's most cherished activities, and when purchasing power has become, to an unprecedented extent, almost the sole source of many people's status and identity.   In our society, you don't have to be wealthy to suffer from affluenza. Its symptoms -- ""debt, overwork, waste, and harm to the environment, leading to psychological disorders, alienation, and distress,"" in adults; ""lack of motivation  apathy, laziness, or failure to commit to and achieve goals  overindulgence and attitudes of entitlement"" in children, according to the New York University Child Study Center (pdf), are pervasive -- and no one is immune.  For affluenza is not just a constellation of symptoms. It is an ethic, a play-the-system, lie-and-cheat-your-way-to-what-you-want, don't-let-the-peons-stand-in-your-way ethic of amorality. You rock, kid, parents teach. And you -- alone -- rule.  This ethic drives behavior -- like the behavior of the wealthy parents profiled in The Times who, flouting camp bans on cellphone use, sent their kids off with two phones, so that, if one was confiscated, there'd still be a spare for secret calls home. And it also permeates social attitudes and policy.  Yet if affluenza, in greater or lesser form, has infected wide swaths of the population at large, one group -- the children of the rich -- appears to be particularly susceptible to its ravages.   Many studies have shown positive trends among American teenagers in recent decades regarding problems like teen suicide, pregnancy, substance use and violence. Yet upper middle class kids appear to be floundering, outpacing their peers in rates of cigarette smoking, depression, alcohol and drug abuse, anxiety, rule-breaking, and psychosomatic disorders like headaches and stomach problems, writes Madeline Levine, a clinical psychologist in California's wealthy Marin County, in her 2006 book, ""The Price of Privilege: How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids.""  Sociologist Annette Lareau, who studied the childrearing habits of middle-, upper-middle- and working-class families in depth for her 2003 book, ""Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life,"" has found that working class children, who have fewer scheduled activities, more unstructured time and less fussing-over generally by adults, are more spontaneous and creative in their play than are middle- and upper-middle-class kids, enjoy their leisure activities more, and show greater autonomy and self-reliance.   ""Indulged children are often less able to cope with stress,"" writes Harvard psychologist Dan Kindlon in his book, ""Too Much of a Good Thing: Raising Children of Character in an Indulgent Age,"" ""because their parents have created an atmosphere where their whims are indulged, where they were always assured  that they're entitled and that life should be a bed of roses.""  In the case of the rich children at the sorts of fancy camps featured in the paper last weekend, it's easy to point fingers at signs of incipient pathology. All that parental micromanaging is sure to suppress problem-solving, one could say. Unconstrained parental meddling is bound to kill off kids' resilience.  ""If your child doesn't get the bunk they want or you're worried that he didn't get the right camp counselor, if you convey that kind of response  'Oh my God, that's awful, let me call them, it's so unfair'  that's the worst possible response a parent could have,"" Catherine Steiner-Adair, a clinical psychologist who consults with camps, told The Times' Tina Kelley.   I wonder what that psychologist would make of a camp I heard tell of this summer, which permits campers to regularly make phone calls home and scripts parents on what to say, and which requests that parents ship their children's belongings weeks in advance, so that staffers can unpack them, make the campers' beds, and have things sufficiently home-like before the children arrive.   It's easy to imagine that all this pampering will lead to irreversible mental damage. But, the problem is: I don't quite buy it. The vast majority of these wealthy and pampered kids, so long as they're bolstered by hardy genes and have parents whose foibles don't run to extremes, will ultimately be just fine. They'll thrive, in fact, in the society of their parents' making.  (In Lareau's research, middle- and upper-middle-class kids -- however dependent, demanding, lacking in initiative and quick to get bored -- were much more successful in school than were the working-class children in part because their privileged upbringings gave them a sense of entitlement that allowed them to navigate adult institutions with ease and aplomb.)   My worry is for the rest of us. For the parents who try to teach our children to play by the rules (obey your counselors; make your bed). And for our children, who are likely to come out the losers in a society dominated by sharks.  I actually have some sympathy for the parents whose strivings and fears have built the culture I find so dangerous and distasteful. I know that their actions, at root, spring from love and that their behaviors -- however obnoxious -- often arise from ill-considered attempts to save their children from pain.   I feel much greater resentment toward the institutions -- like the camps that permit way too much parental presence and schools that encourage way too much parental involvement -- which enable the worst parent behaviors, comfort their worst tendencies and cater to their basest fears, all, very often, in the interest of making an extra buck.  The buck has to stop somewhere. It's clearly not going to be stopped by this generation of befuddled parents. It's time that the professionals we entrust with our children stopped catering to their ""clients"" and started treating them like grown-ups.     ",2008-07-31T22:26:55+0000

us,The Bomb That Changed Iraq,"(Photo: In February 2006, the dome of the Golden Mosque at the Askariya Shrine in Samarra, Iraq, lay in ruins after a bomb was detonated inside the mosque. (Photo: Hameed Rasheed/Associated Press))   Dozens of bombs blew up in Iraq every day, hundreds of sirens went off, tearing through the silence of the nights and the noise of the days, torn body parts and corpses overlying the streets and pavements, fresh blood stains the faces and the walls. But nothing made as much difference as that one bomb that went off in Samarra, shattering a holy shrine and planting the first seeds of sectarian violence in Iraq.  It was February 23, 2006, the day after the bombing, when a female correspondent of The New York Times in Baghdad and a close friend decided to go to Sadr City to cover a demonstration by followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric, against the bombing of the mosque.   It was a huge event that turned out to be really tense and dangerous. Suspicious people were everywhere in Baghdad. The government was helpless to control the city. The militias of Mahdi Army, loyal to Mr. Sadr, started to show themselves strongly in the streets in their new 4-wheel-drive vehicles. Car doors opened, and the people emerging from these doors were carrying their weapons, expressing their anger and sadness openly.   I remember arguing with my friend the reporter before going. She pushed us to go to a dangerous place to get a story. I felt it was a foolish risk. I also felt angry with her. For her, it was another thing she was observing, another catastrophe that would go into the newspaper. For me it was personal. It was my country collapsing. And I didn't like having to look at it.    She won. We drove to Sadr City, a giant area in northern Baghdad where the poorest Shiites live. There were thousands of people there. People were shouting and holding banners. Imam Ali fluttered everywhere. They were mad at being pushed around by terrorists. They were mad at having been pushed around by Saddam. They were mad at being the underdogs for centuries. And they were going to take back the streets.  With four guards and two vehicles, we arrived to find Sadr City semi-sealed off. Dust rose from the marching demonstrators' feet.  We stopped silently watching the scene wondering who to speak with. Young or old? People dressed in black (the kind that is usually worn by the Mahdi army) or those with ordinary clothes?  Children surrounded us as if we are aliens from another planet. The rest tried to figure out whether we are with or against them. Putting on a hijab and abaya, covering ourselves with black from head to toe as women do in such places, we as two women in such a tense situation tried hard to hide our identity as press from the raging crowd. But sooner or later we had to talk with someone.  We stopped and asked a man in his forties: ""Who suffered most under Saddam?"" I still remember how he looked at us. He was angry, but he wanted to tell us why.  He said it loudly over the crowd. His answer: The Shiites. ""Who has suffered most since Saddam's fall?"" Again, his answer: The Shiites. In many ways he was right. Not completely, but mostly. But more important was what I felt at that moment. That was something different. Things were changing. The Shiites were too angry. They would start to fight. He gave us his ring. He said: Keep it and remember me.  There was a lot of killing and burning of Sunnis mosques the day before. It was obvious that was done by Shiite militias. The day was the first real spark of the sectarian violence that lasted for a long time and rose questions about a civil war: Were we -- are we -- amid a civil war, the same as what happened in Lebanon and Yugoslavia?  Later that afternoon, she wanted to put the whole story all together, which meant another trip to visit burning Sunnis mosques. It was a more dangerous trip than the one in the morning. The mosques were monitored by Mahdi Army militia from distance. At the beginning we made a plan to decide which mosques to go to first and that entire trip should be done before sunset. We were lucky because the government hadn't announced the three day curfew yet.  The question about the civil war has no answer yet. Perhaps we have our own civil war which doesn't follow any other pattern elsewhere in the world. My neighborhood is different now. Many of my friends have moved away. But at the same time, things seem to be getting a little better. I think Iraq is always changing. The day of the bombing was one turning point. But many have come since then, changing things again and again. And there are many more in our future. ",2008-07-31T22:27:53+0000

us,Settlement Over Sex Scenes in Grand Theft Auto Hits a Snag,"(Photo: ) A federal judge has put the brakes on a lawsuit filed over sex scenes buried in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.  In a decision on Wednesday (full text), United States District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram wrote that purchasers of the game could not be lumped together in a class action. The claims of members of the proposed class would be affected by the law in each purchaser's home state, Judge Kram wrote, and therefore could not be resolved in a single proceeding in federal court in New York.  ""Accordingly, the court decertifies the settlement class on the grounds that common issues do not predominate over individualized issues,"" the judge wrote.  The judge's latest decision undermines a settlement agreement reached between lawyers for purchasers of the game who contended they were offended by the hidden scenes, on the one hand, and lawyers for the game's makers, Take-Two Interactive Software and Rockstar Games.  Of the millions of people who purchased the game with the scenes, fewer than 3,000 applied for compensation from a fund established under the settlement agreement.   A lawyer for the game makers, Jeffrey S. Jacobson at Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, said that the decision was under review. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached for comment.  The civil lawsuit was filed after the disclosure of the sex scenes in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004. The existence of the scenes, accessible to knowledgeable players using third-party software, drew fierce condemnation from lawmakers and sparked a frenzy online. The suit accused the game's makers of defrauding buyers by failing to disclose the scenes.  ",2008-07-31T22:43:43+0000

us,Never Say Never,"Holy cow -- Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate, is going to be the nation's 44th president. That's the only possible (or rather, the exactly wrong) conclusion to arrive at after reading a post from Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight.com.  Riffing on a Boston Phoenix article written by Steven Stark, Silver explains the fallacy of what he calls ""Match Game"" arguments about politics (""No candidate has ever [blank]"").   ""Given various intersections of geography, demography and history, there are literally thousands of plausible-sounding permutations that can be conceived to rule out any prospective candidate,"" Silver writes.   Stark comes up with four reasons why Barack Obama cannot be president: ""No Democrat who hails from north of the Mason-Dixon line has been elected since 1960,"" ""No candidate in the modern primary era has ever been elected in November after failing to win more than one of the nation's seven largest states in either its pre-convention primary or, if the state didn't hold a primary, its caucuses,"" ""No candidate in modern times has ever been elected president with a voting record that could be identified as his party's most liberal or conservative, yet in 2007 Obama was designated as the former (by the National Journal),"" and ""No candidate arguably since Abraham Lincoln has been elected president with as little political experience as Obama.""  In a self-reported 14 minutes and 2 seconds, Silver comes up with numerous counterexamples to rule out the possibility that John McCain can be elected president. Among his reasons: ""No president has ever been elected from the Mountain Time Zone,"" ""No candidate has ever been elected from the incumbent party when the sitting president had a Gallup approval rating below 40 percent,"" and ""No candidate as old as John McCain has ever been elected to a first term.""  So there you have it: I for one welcome our new libertarian overlord! ",2008-07-31T22:46:06+0000
