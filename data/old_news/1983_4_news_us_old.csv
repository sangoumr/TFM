us,Canada's 'Acid Rain' On Channel 13 Tonight,"The question about ''Acid Rain: Requiem or Recovery?'' is not whether it is good or bad television, but whether it is political propaganda. The Justice Department says it is; environmental groups and the Canadian Government say it is not. To me it seems propaganda of a benign kind, although the political content is moot. The documentary, produced by Environment Canada, a Government agency, will be shown on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight. Acid rain is the name given to the industrial air pollution created when sulfur and nitrogren oxides travel through the atmosphere and then fall to earth as either dry particles or acidic rain or snow. Factories in both Canada and the United States emit the pollution, but prevailing winds apparently cause most of it to fall on Canada. The Canadian Government has said the Reagan Administration doesn't care. Its Minister of the Environment, for example, has called acid rain ''the single greatest irritant in the United States-Canadian relationship.'' The Minister of External Affairs has raised the matter with Secretary of State George P. Shultz. On rainy days in Washington, Canadian diplomats carry umbrellas that say, ''Acid Rain Umbrella.'' The discord, however, is not reflected in the documentary, which is assiduously bilateral. If acid rain is eradicating the salmon in nine rivers in Nova Scotia, it is also eradicating the brook trout in 180 lakes in the Adirondacks; if 48,000 lakes in Ontario are threatened, the salamanders in the Northeastern states are threatened, too.",1983-04-01T05:00:00+0000

LIFE SEEN AS EARTHLY HELL","Joel-Peter Witkin's photographs have an extraordinary originality and power that sets them apart from anything else in contemporary photography. And yet they do, up to a point, fit into accepted categories. In recent years Witkin has been shown in the company of photographers who paint or draw on their photographs in an attempt to go beyond or get around the naturalism of the unmanipulated photographic image - for instance, in ''Six Markers'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1981. He has also exhibited with photographers in whose work special photographic printing processes play a conspicuous part - for instance, in ''The Photographer as Printmaker,'' sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1982.

Similar fashions are on display outside lower Manhattan rock clubs when psychedelic-revival bands like New Jersey's Trypes or the Chesterfield Kings from upstate New York are performing. The young men who play in these bands are sporting carefully layered shag haircuts, striped bell-bottom jeans, multi-colored shirts and scarves, and they can often be seen between sets talking to young women in mini-skirts and go-go boots.",1983-04-03T05:00:00+0000

Such prizes represent a considerable investment, but the more knowledgable the collector, the greater the challenge to find treasures dating from antiquity through the early 20th century. Although an international list of sources would fill a sizable telephone book, collectors find that the most prominent dealers are based in three cities - London, Hong Kong and New York. London Most Chinese ceramics merchants specialize either in wares made for use by the Chinese or for export. But a few carry both. At the top of the list is Eskenazi Limited, at 166 Piccadilly, where the Chinese ceramics range from 2000 B.C. through the 17th century, and are from $2,000 to $500,000. Giuseppe Eskenazi, one of the world's top dealers in Oriental wares, recently acquired from Herbert Hoover 3d of Pasadena four choice Ming porcelains - two bowls, a vase and a box with cover - all of which had been collected by his grandfather, President Hoover. A blue and white early 15th-century palace bowl, awash with figures of women and children playing in a palace garden, is one of the most extraordinary of such bowls to reach the market in recent years. The price -about $250,000. The vase, a narrow-necked design from the late 16th century, decorated with scenes of scholars in a garden, is almost identical to one in the National Palace Museum in Taiwan.",1983-04-10T05:00:00+0000

He goes on to point out that he has been ''a bad husband and a fickle lover,'' that he ''can't remember ever having been at peace with myself, except for brief spells,'' that he has ''inherited some bad genes.'' He is loath to probe too deeply into the workings of his unconscious, worrying that such probing might somehow damage the magic of creativity; and he so dislikes reviewing his past that he keeps his old books locked up in a cupboard instead of displayed in a bookcase. Indeed, the portrait of Mr. Greene that emerges from this series of interviews - cautious, weary, and blessed with a prankster's sense of humor - is very similar to the one left in the wake of his novels.",1983-04-11T05:00:00+0000

Strong shot. 14 BOB BOURNE: Left wing, 6-3, 202, age 29, 20 goals, 42 assists. One of few Islanders to improve on overall points from last year, but goal-scoring was down slightly.

Rookie who spent over half the season, 45 games, with the club. 19 BRYAN TROTTIER: Center, 5-11, 198, age 26, 34 goals, 55 assists, 89 points.

Has scored 29 points in each of the last three playoff seasons. Strong, durable skater. 20 MATS HALLIN: Right wing-left wing, 6-2, 202, age 25, 7 goals, 7 assists.

It had become so physically uncared-for a place that it could not signify escape from anything, except perhaps the tranquillity and dignity of its original architecture. The presence of blocked-off windows, of marble galleries filled with filing cabinets, of ornately carved ceilings punctured by fluorescent lighting, all gave a sense of scholarship as drudgery, as duty and not as pleasure.",1983-04-15T05:00:00+0000
us,SURPRISES ARE NO SURPRISE ON OFF OFF BROADWAY,"BY definition, Off Off Broadway is a floating festival of diverse theatrical events, offering something for every taste. This weekend in particular, the scene is alive with promising entertainments. The emphasis is very much on spectacle, but in typical, experimental fashion, the spectacle can be an extravagant musical drawn from the Biblical plagues, Shakespeare transplanted to ancient China or a trio of inspired tomfools. And to even the score, there are new plays by very young dramatists and a restorative revival of a drama by Tennessee Williams. Two prolific theaters are showcasing a range of work by favorite sons and daughters. In the vast expanse of La Mama Annex is a musical called ''The Plagues,'' written by Eve Merriam and Tom O'Horgan, and directed by Mr. O'Horgan. In residence on other La Mama stages are Paul Zimet's Talking Band, doing an ensemble play with music titled ''Hot Lunch Apostles,'' and Harris Yulin, a Broadway star, playing the title buncombe artist in Richard Ploetz's ''Barnum's Last Life.'' At the nearby Theater for the New City, 162 Second Avenue, at 10th Street, Leonard Melfi, a graduate of both La Mama and Theater for the New City, is showcasing a new epic musical, ''Rosetti's Apologies,'' while on another New City stage, Stuart Sherman is demonstrating his one-man, world-in-a-suitcase art with a performance piece called ''13 Spectacle'' (tickets for both $4; information: 254-1109).",1983-04-15T05:00:00+0000

In his pioneering work with Louis Armstrong in the late 1920's, Mr. Hines virtually redefined jazz piano. With what he called ''trumpet style,'' Mr. Hines played horn-like solo lines in octaves with his right hand and spurred them with chords from his left.

Give him a piece of material like ''Nicholas Nickleby'' and he will not only cram all of Dickens into it, brilliantly, but will look around for open spaces he can fill out of his own teeming imaginative energies - for good or ill. In ''Nickleby,'' for instance, he came to a moment in which a provincial touring company was to do a spot of Shakespeare, and by the time Mr. Nunn got through adding extra spots of Shakespeare from half the other plays Shakespeare wrote he'd done more than seize the moment. He'd extended it to approximately 20, improvising like a madman the while. In the current ''Cats'' he's transformed the Winter Garden ceiling into a kind of heaven for creatures who don't have nine lives, he's inflated Old Deuteronomy into some sort of God, and he's created an alley-cat saint to climb that golden stairway to the Great Beyond even though his supposed source, a slender volume of verse by T.S.

The village has tropical beauty, sun-saturated tranquillity and languor. At the same time, it is shabby and oppressively hot, like many quiet, forgotten backwaters of the third world. But Luma is anything but forgotten. It is on the island of Tau, part of the tiny Manua archipelago of the Samoan islands, which includes the larger, independent country of Western Samoa and the unincorporated territory of American Samoa (see map on page 50). It is here that the 23-year-old fledgling anthropologist Margaret Mead did her first field research some 58 years ago, arriving by boat from Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, about 70 miles across the South Pacific. She stayed for about half a year, and while clearly captivated by the people of Tau, she complained of the heat, which made it impossible for her to work for several hours at midday.

us,STANDARDS FOR MINERAL WATER,"Traditionally, a primary reason for drinking sparkling mineral waters has been belief in their health-giving properties. Because there are no Federal regulations for bottled mineral water, however, it has been difficult to determine whether it is more healthful or safer to drink than ordinary tap water. Some states, including New York, have set up their own standards governing the acceptable levels in mineral water for mineral content, herbicides, pesticides, bacteria and radiological matter. The State Health Department is in the process of certifying mineral waters that meet these standards. When a mineral water exceeds the standards it can still be certified if the company agrees to put a notice on the label advising consumers that the product should not be used as the sole source of drinking water. Exemptions are based on the premise that no one would drink more than two liters of the water per day. The state has had difficulty in getting some of the foreign producers of mineral water to comply with the certification process. Many companies list no American address on their labels, and communications to their offices abroad often go unanswered. A state regulation, currently under review but not yet in effect, would require bottled mineral waters to carry the state certification number on their labels; currently, its use is voluntary. Of the bottled sparkling mineral waters tasted last week, only Appolinaris displays its certification number. In addition to Appolinaris the state has certified the following sparkling mineral waters, which do not display their certification numbers: Ferrarelle, Montclair, Perrier, Poland Spring, Ramlosa with an exemption for fluoride, S. Pellegrino with an exemption for sulfate, and Vittelloise.",1983-04-27T05:00:00+0000

Born to middle-class black parents and brought up as a Southern lady, she taught art at a junior high school in Washington for 35 years, devoting most of her time and energy to spurring the creativity of black youngsters. Though she always studied and worked at painting, she began to make a serious commitment to it only in 1950, 10 years before her retirement. Over a decade, she progressed from academic still lifes to a vibrant abstract idiom unmistakably her own, and her first show in Washington in 1960 was an immediate success.",1983-04-29T05:00:00+0000
