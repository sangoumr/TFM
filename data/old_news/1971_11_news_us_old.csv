us,Fiddler' on a Grand Scale:Life-Style of the Aleichem Characters Is Missing Amid Production's Grandeur,"Somewhere along toward the third hour of ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" the action cuts away from the tiny Russian village of Anatevka  the home of Tevye, the poor dairyman; Golde, his shrewish wife, and their five doweryless daughtersto show us the Czar's cavalry attacking a group of young street revolutionaries in Moscow.In the stage production, this information is relayed to us through a letter, and through a short, funny, very theatrical montage that shows how the contents of the letter get successively more mixed up each time the word is passed from one citizen to another.The movie scene is also short but it's staged with such elaborate realism you could almost call it gilt-ridden. It's also typical of what's wrong not only with this film, but with almost every other movie adaptation of a Broadway show that has been so successful that it's become an industry-within-an-industry.Norman Jewison, the film's director, and Joseph Stein, who adapted for the screen his own stage adaptation of the Sholem Aleichem stories, have not tampered with the text in any obviously reckless way. They have sought only to enlarge the physical frame of the show by setting it in its time (1905) and physical place, in a real village (actually in Yugoslavia) with real houses, in real barns with real animals, in real fields and real landscapes. They want to show us everything, to give us our money's worth. In so doing, they've not just opened up the play, they've let most of the life out of it.Not quite all of the life is gone. The Sheldon Harnick-Jerry Bock score is practically all there, and it's one mixed marriagebetween Tin Pan Alley and Jewish folk music  that really works. There are reminders of the exuberant Jerome Robbins choreography, although, on the screen, it seems to lack the particular focal point that the audience provides the choreographer in the theater.There also are hints of the original wit and wisdom of Aleichem when old Tevye, his optimism almost exhausted, is told that money is the world's curse. ""May the Lord smite me with it,"" says Tevye with a special Yiddish rue, ""and may I never recover.""However, the gap between the reverential intention of the filmmakers and the film itself is constantly being emphasized by a kind of visual and aural grandeur that is at odds with the poverty and simplicity and faith of the Aleichem characters. Life for the Jews in this shtetl, we are told, is precarious at best, yet it looks and sounds incomparably rich.When the fiddler plays, it's none other than Isaac Stern. When Tevye moves about his barn singing ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" he is accompaniedvery loudlyby what sounds like the entire London Symphony. Close-ups of Tevye, played by the Israeli star Topol, reveal a vigorous young actor who, with no great effort, could probably flatten half of the Czar's troops.Also revealed is a British accent that one might accept in a highly stylized stage production but that doesn't jibe with the realistic circumstances of the film. Nor does it jibe with the various other accents in the movie, some of which, like those of Molly Picon, who is generously and outrageously authentic as the matchmaker, and Leonard Frey, who is the best thing in the film as the timid tailor, do succeed in capturing the sensibility of Yiddish expression.Mr. Jewison is a good director (""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") not given to arbitrary directional flourishes, and throughout ""Fiddler on the Roof"" he remains faithful to the literal point of view originally chosen for the film. There is a certain virtue in this, even when the result is much less stylish a film than his ""Gaily, Gaily,"" the Ben Hecht memoire, which, of course, wasn't so intimidating a project.Aside from Miss Picon and Mr. Frey, who are most entertaining, and aside from Topol who, though I feel he's miscast, displays such willingness to please it's almost rude not to respond to him, the performances are surprisingly mechanical and bland, like those of the cast of a stage show that's been playing too long.""Fiddler on the Roof,"" which opened last night at the Rivoli, has traveled a long way from its source, from pre-revolutionary Russia, from the pages of Sholem Aleichem, even from the Broadway stage, and it has become so rich and affluent it seems to have forgotten its humble beginnings in recognizable human experience.I wouldn't go so far as to advise anyone not to see it. After all, it's probably the only ""Fiddler on the Roof"" that will ever be filmed. Yet it requires its audience to display less in the way of imagination and identification than sheer physical endurance.",1971-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Kate Millett's Film of and by Women Begins Run,"Kate Millett's ""Three Lives"" is a moving, proud, calm, aggressively self-contained documentary feature, shot by on all-female crew, about what it's like to be the three very different women who talk about their lives, with feeling and a certain amount of surprise that anyone should be interested, in front of Miss Millett's camera.There is Mallory Millett-Jones, Miss Millett's intense, appealing, recently liberated younger sister  when they were children, Miss Millett once said, ""I was smart and ugly"" and Mallory ""was dumb and beautiful."" She's a product of an unhappy middle-class, St. Paul childhood, a short life of bloodless boredom with a husband who was so busy making it in the Philippines he had no time for her (""I was living in this huge Aztec sacrificial altar""), and of a break for freedom that has landed her, among other places, in her blood-sister's movie.There also are Lillian Shreve, an attractive, outgoing, middle-aged woman, a chemist whose parents were Italian immigrants and who describes her marriage as ""a very happy 23 years, all told,"" and Robin Mide, 21, who left Far Rockaway five or six years ago to seek her independence in the theater, in drugs, in sex, and in the exercise of that kind of happy egotism that might pass for searching self-analysis on the Merv Griffin Show: ""I'm very happy doing what I want to do.""""Three Lives"" is a good, simple movie in that it can't be bothered to call attention to itself, only to its three subjects, and to how they grew in the same male-dominated society that Miss Millett, in her ""Sexual Politics,"" so systematically tore apart, shook up, ridiculed and underminedwhile, apparently, tickling it pink. This film is said to be partially financed by Miss Millett's share of the $75,000 Avon paid for the paperback rights.Ordinarily I'm inclined to regard all-female film crews much as I do all-black casts of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" all-convict poetry anthologies and all-children church services. They are essentially well-meaning stunts, like Ina Ray Hutton's all-girl band, which more or less coerce favor not by what they accomplish, but how they do it, and by the very fact that they are doing it at all.""Three Lives"" is different, a movie that probably could not have been made in any other way without affecting the film's content and in some fashion exploiting it. Although the camera hardly moves, except for an occasional zoom for a tight close-up, and although the movie is limited to informed reminiscence, ""Three Lives"" is very much a moviethree highly specific novellas about three experiences that are exceptional only because, through some chance of time and circumstance, they happened to find their way to this film.There are definite limits to this sort of filmmaking but because it is a genre that has usually focused on the exhibitionists (like Shirley Clarke's ""Jason""), it's refreshing to see what can be done with experiences of a more conventional order.Men, of course, don't fare too well in these stories, even off-screen, being mostly self-centered, unfeeling, fascist pariahs or, at best, like Lillian's husband, a shadowy figure, a seemingly decent man, who once had a nervous breakdown. No explanation is given, but in the context of this film it would seem to be the result of an inability to continue the historical conspiracy. That, I emphasize, is my fantasy.""Three Lives"" opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema on a bill with Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona,"" which comes very close, I should think, to expressing in fictional terms the kind of women's experience that Miss Millett has sought to express in her film.",1971-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,El Topo' Emerges:Jodorowsky's Feature Begins Regular Run,"During its months of mid-night screenings at the Elgin, Alexandro Jodorowsky's ""El Topo"" became a secret rite of some importance in New York City. It won what not even the most fashionable success at the East Side art houses has won, genuine followers who depended not on advertising and not, God knows, on influential critical opinion, but on their own needs and their own unaided enthusiasms. Those followersI'm not sure I'd want to call them just an audiencehave also earned a modicum of fame. And some of them, the kids in capes and wide-brimmed hats, the ""El Topo"" freaks, re-materialized the other night for a sneak preview at the Forum where, yesterday, their movie began its long-awaited full-scale commercial run.During the time of the midnight screenings I asked someone who had seen it what ""El Topo"" was all about. He answered, ""Everything,"" and now that I've also seen it I know what he meant. ""El Topo"" (which means ""The Mole"") is about everything somewhat in the way that, say, William Blake's ""The Mental Traveller"" is about everythingwhich is to say it comes down heavily on first and last things, and leaves out a lot that might have been in the middle.With its circular patterns of change, with its black-suited, black-haired hero who dies halfway through and is reborn underground, a blond man in white loincloth, with its main events in large part derived from the Bible and its image of man as his own self-sacrifice, ""El Topo"" resembles not so much a well-made fiction as a prophetic book.It is also full of tests and riddles, and in looking for a fancy comparison, Borges, like Blake, comes too easily to mind. One admiring reviewer calls it, disarmingly, ""a work of incomprehensible depth."" But it is more nearly a work of incomprehensible breadth, and I am not persuaded that Jodorowsky, any more than the rest of us, altogether knows what he is about.He has made his film a Western of sorts and he has put in more phony gore than maybe 20 years of ""The Wild Bunch."" Critics have complained that the gore looks unreal, though disgusting. But surely the unreality is its point. It is a part of the self parody that controls the style of ""El Topo""to the end that the idea of castration or immolation or decomposition, or whatever horror you will, looms larger than the fact (but not the feeling) and thus supports the essentially intellectual ambitions of the film.About Jodorowsky as a filmmaker I am not sure how I feel. ""El Topo"" is a good deal more interesting and a good deal less hung up on its own pretensions than all my most intelligent friends had led me to believe. It is vastly better than the same director's ""Fando and Lis,"" but vastly inferior to Arrabal's ""Viva La Muerte,"" a work in the same tradition of surreal violence to which all other works in this tradition must stand comparison.Perhaps the ambivalence was best expressed by a man at the sneak preview who, after the film had ended, stood up and shouted, ""Viva El Topa!""finding as if by inspiration just the right combination of youthful fervor and mispronunciation.",1971-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"Jack Johnson,' Black Fighter","Time may have a way of vitiating history, but ""Jack Johnson"" emerges amazingly alive and fascinating in the documentary biography of the black heavyweight boxing champion of more than 60 years ago, which had its local premiere at the Whitney Museum yesterday.""I like what I do before a crowd,"" says Brock Peters as the rich baritone off-screen ""voice"" of the champ. And through this meticulous composition of vintage footage, stills and many of Johnson's actual words, a viewer, even a nonsporting type, also should get to ""like"" what Johnson did.As the work of Jim Jacobs and William Cayton, who have already given us careful pugilistic histories in ""The Legendary Champions"" and ""a.k.a. Cassius Clay,"" this history sticks to facts that do not force sympathy for its hero and that really need no footnotes. These are visual and aural facts that somehow limn a more detailed picture of the controversial fighter than the stage and screen versions of Howard Sacker's play ""The Great White Hope.""These comparisons are inevitable but not really necessary. What we have in this ""(Jack Johnson"" is a portrait of a towering figure, who, right or wrong, obviously was before his time. In this case, simply a good deal more of the man is exposed in these vintage films of his fights and his life outside the ring than was revealed in the previous, forceful stage and screen dramatizations.Against a throbbing modern jazz score by Miles Davis, we are given a smiling, 6-foot 200-pound muscular, bald, Texas black man who happily marries three white women in succession against the shibboleths of his day, who chases and finally wrests the championships from Tommy Burns in Australia in 1908 and on, through triumphs and adversity, to his death in 1946.Controversy obviously was the name of Johnson's game through a variety of ""white hopes"" who sought to dethrone him until that gigantic Kansas farmer, Jess Willard, did it in Havana in 1915. A good many of these scenes turned up in ""The Legendary Champions.""But there is a profusion of rarely seen shots, toosuch as his thrilling auto race with Barney Oldfield; his Chicago saloon; his life in World War I France; Spain (as an amateur matador); his flight from this country after his trial on morals charges; Russia, where he met Rasputin; his stay in Leaven-worth prison and as an aging but still happy attraction at Hubert's Flea Museum on 42d Street.This, of course, is a special case and a specialized film. But ""Jack Johnson"" does come through as the picture of a highly unusual, decidedly undefeated man full of life to the end who defiantly stated: ""I'm black! They never let me forget it. I'm black all right. I'll never let them forget it!""",1971-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"The Mystery Is, Why Did He Do That to Wilhelm Reich?:Wilhelm Reich","I HAVE never, in all my years of moviegoing, booed a film, no matter how bad, boring or insipid the film might have been. Sometimes the crime being committed in the name of cinema seemed outrageous enough to justify such a response, but I restrained myself.It is because I have a deeply rooted respect and love for filmmakers that booing has never been a part of my film vocabulary, that is, until I saw Dusan Makavejev's film, ""WR-Mysteries of the Organism."" Booing was plainly not the proper thing to do at the somewhat austere critic's screening at the Vivian Beaumont, especially since Makavejev was expected to appear momentarily for a press conference. But it was, it seemed to me, a proper response for a film that in the name of freedom, joy and the ""avant garde,"" exploited, misinterpreted and maligned the very man's work that it professed to hold dear. Unfortunately, the deception of the film is masked so slyly and subtly that its insidiousness is not easily apparent. And it was this that outraged me.Before going further, a brief description of the film might be helpful. Dusan Makavejev came to America a few years ago from Yugoslavia, with the alleged purpose of making a film about Wilhelm Reich, the controversial psychiatrist who died in 1957. Makavejev interviewed relatives of Reich, doctors who currently use his methods of therapy, and various people who he thought represented aspects of the sexual changes taking place in America. Edited into this is a political comedy located in Yugoslavia, based on a girl who, we are led to believe, is a follower and admirer of Reich's views and sees his theories as helpful to the growth of Yugoslavian Communism. (It should be noted quickly however, that the girl's understanding of Reich is so simplistic and distorted that she hardly represents what Reich believed at all, although the director would like us to think so.)For a final touch, there is footage of an old Russian film on Stalin plus assorted other film tidbits, all rather freely (but not without conscious design) edited together. Unfortunately, the intent of the editing is not to make the connection between these disparate scenes clearer but, more often than not, to obscure and often misrepresent what is really going on.It is here that the problem of the film comes into focus. For under the guise of artistic license, Makavejev takes bits of reality and truth and distorts them through the use of editing tricks, subliminal visual associations and Reich's own words used out of the context and spirit in which they were written. Such techniques of character assassination and audience manipulation are not new in film, but rarely have they been used in such a devious way.Take, for example, this use of editing. We are shown a scene of a conscious man actually being given shock treatment in a hospital. A piece of cloth is jammed in his mouth and the electric shock administered. His body writhes in pain and involuntary muscle contractions. It is a pathetic sight, Makavejev cuts from this scene of almost utter horror to a Reichian therapy workshop where people are screaming and going through strange body movements. The distinct impression caused by this scene, especially when immediately preceded by the shock therapy sequence, is that these patients are undergoing a similar experience. Although it is hard to know exactly what Makavejev meant by juxtaposing these two scenes, their effect is to present a ludicrous and negative picture of Reichian therapy.Makavejev does not bother to explain that the screaming and yelling in the workshop are a therapeutic means of getting in touch with one's anger and negativity by direct vocal expression. He does not bother to explain that the strange body movements are very specific positions used to break down tension blocks (or armor, as Reich described it) in the body so that good feelings can flow more easily.So while Makavejev, on the surface, seems to be praising Reich, the actual content of the film mocks and maligns him. Makavejev then cloaks these distortions in a web of comedy and ""avant garde"" ambiguity. It is an old trick. Hide the poison in sugar. And Makavejev's film is just that. He gives us so much sugar (off-beat poet Tuli Kupferberg, transvestite Jackie Curtis, sex scenes, music, comedy, plus political pokes at the United States and Russia) that our senses get clouded and we forget, indeed can hardly decipher what the film is about. We think it must be about Reich since he is quoted, talked about and seen so much. But in point of fact, the film bears as much resemblance to Reich and his work as Coke does to ""the real thing"" or Pepsi to Living and Giving (You've got a lot to Live and Pepsi's got a lot to Give).Some people prefer to stop at this point and ask why Reich should even be discussed in an appraisal of the film. Can't the film be judged on esthetic grounds alone?To bring the issue closer to the hearts of most film lovers, let me offer this analogy. Imagine that 30 years from now Franois Truffaut has become a relatively obscure film director. A film is made titled, ""FT-Mysteries of the Cinematic Process."" We are led to believe that the film will be a sympathetic re-discovery of Truffaut's work. The film consists in good part of scenes from Hitchcock, Renoir and Truffaut films, showing the influence of these masters on his filmmaking. But instead of explaining that part of Truffaut's esthetic was a continual homage to these filmmakers, the film deviously presents Truffaut as just a rank imitator.By not explaining Truffaut's own esthetic accurately, by taking scenes out of context, or juxtaposing them so as to downgrade him, the film totally misrepresents Truffaut. I wonder how many film lovers would elect to dismiss any comparison with the real Truffaut as being unimportant to the meaning and critical appraisal of the hypothetical film I have outlined. Yet it is this type of cinematic logic that I have found quite prevalent when Makavejev's film is discussed.In order to determine if my own feelings were true that Makavejev had misrepresented not only Reich's views but those of the Bioenergetic doctors depicted in the film, I spoke to Drs. John Pierrakos and Alexander Lowen; they brought up many objections to Makavejev's use of Reich. But foremost was Makavejev's misinterpretation, and therefore distortion, of Reich's views on sexuality.""Reich believed, and in all his writings stressed, that sexuality should be based on feelings of love,"" Dr. Pierrakos said. ""But Makavejev makes no distinction between healthy sexuality and libertinism. Ho disassociates sex from love. Almost all of Makavejev's references to sex in the film show it as either a mechanical act, masturbatory or perverse. By leaving the feelings of love out of sexuality, Makavejev distorts Reich's views. Mr. Makavejev is entitled to disagree with Reich, but he is not entitled to put his views in the mouth of Reich or to identify them with our work in Bioenergetics.""The question inevitably arises  if the film is not about Reich, or is a conscious misrepresentation of Reich, what is it really about? I submit that instead of being a tribute to Reich, ""WR-Mysteries of the Organism"" is little more than a putdown of practically everything it touches. It uses Reich as a device, to show the repressive nature of the United States government, and to show what unbridled sexual ""freedom"" might lead to. There is hardly a scene shot in America which does not seek to focus on either the bizarre or perverse, except those scenes which mock, in one way or another, Reich.By the association of Reich's theories with these scenes of current-day America, Makevejev implies that the two are connected. And as for Russia, Stalin is given his due in scenes which epitomize his stiffness and inhumanity.By contrast, the only joyful place is an apartment in Yugoslavia where two beautiful girls romp around, proclaim a sexual revolution (which has much to do with sex; but little with love) and generally make merry. These scenes are usually comic and lighthearted  especially when juxtaposed with the perversity in America and the authoritarianism of Russia. The two superpowers have gone astray, each in its own way.This seems to be the message of Makavejev's film and no doubt there is truth in it. But I question if, in the name of freedom and fun, Makavejev has not grossly misused his directorial powers. If a film is pure fiction, then all praise to the director who lets his imagination run rampant. But when the actual lives of people, both living and dead, are represented in a quasi-documentary which is supposed to be ""about them,"" the test of reality and truth must also enter into an understanding and appraisal of the film.The film certainly fails this test and, unfortunately for Makavejev, ""WR-Mysteries of the Organism"" fails also as comedy and satire. For any film based on an essentially dishonest approach toward its subject must eventually go sour. It is no wonder then that the film, which begins by proclaiming that life should be joyful, turns out to be one of the gloomiest of recent memory.",1971-11-07T05:00:00+0000

The 10 per cent surtax on imports that went into effect Aug. 16 does not apply to travelers who restrict their purchases abroad to $100, but it does affect those who exceed this dutyfree allowance. Under the new rules, not only is the regular duty applied to all items over the $100 limit, but the 10 per cent surcharge is added. All articles should be declared at the full retail value. The duty is assessed on the wholesale value of the merchandise as determined by the examining officer, but custommade and madetoorder items are taxed at their full retail value, plus the surcharge. For example, if a tourist bought a still camera with a standard lens for $200 at retail in Japan, he would be taxed on the portion that exceeded his $100 exemption after a 40 per cent discount allowance to bring the price down to the dutiable wholesale level ($200 minus the $100 exemption leaves $100; less 40 per cent equals $60). Since the rate of duty on such cameras is 9 per cent, the initial tax would be $5.40, but the 10 per cent surtax would bring the total to $11.40. In other words, he would be paying $6 more as a result of the surtax.",1971-11-07T05:00:00+0000

""Let's kill him,"" whimpers mother to daughter, after a quiet, opening breakfast scene with a sadistic father that will curl your hair. The two women set about it.Superbly directed by Viktors Ritelis and beautifully played by Yvonne Mitchell, Sharon Gurney and Michael Gough, the picture would have been a knockout if not for a last-reel sag, with the suspense stretched rather than developed. It is also an admirably bloodless film, but then so are two pivotal characters in the small cast.But for tight, merciless tension and venom, the movie is uncommonly effective and engrossing.

And that although she has been dead for a while, she is still occupying the plastic easy chair in the living room.""I wonder how she would feel now, sealed inside the frame of an 18th-century harpsichord?,"" muses Marcus, having found a hiding place for Jennifer, whom he has recently eased to her death with a gratefully accepted overdose of heroin. Of course the harpsichord won't do forever, and getting rid of Jennifer becomes the action, or at least one-half the action of ""Jennifer on My Mind,"" which opened yesterday at several local theaters.Marcus (Michael Brandon), a nice, rich, Jewish boy from New York, meets and falls in love with Jennifer (Tippy Walker), a rich and not very nice and awfully non-Jewish girl from Oyster Bay, while they are both in Venice. He pursues her through the canals of Venice and to her home on Long Island and ultimately to the top of a high-rise on the New Jersey Palisades, where she lets him kill her and where he begins the romantic reminiscence in extended flashbacks, that so oddly counterpoints the hapless removal of her remains.Noel Black (""Pretty Poison"") directed the film, and Erich Segal wrote it (after a novel by Roger Simon), and in the contest between Black's black humor and Segal's languorous humors both sides lose. In form, and indeed in content, ""Jennifer on My Mind"" resembles nothing so much as a satyr play to ""Love Story,"" if one were needed. But I am not sure the effect was intended, and with its hackneyed invention and incredible dialogue (and more incredible interior monologues), the film belongs to that desperate class of comedy that is almost never funny except when it doesn't mean to be.And yet there is a degree of interest in the film if only for its theme, which is not drug addiction but rather that nightmare fragment of the American dream in which the eager alien breaks his head and his heart in winning the native shores to find the countryside a desert and the inhabitants a mirage. Marcus is the last refinement of alien awareness, and Jennifer is not so much on his mind as in it. She is its last and cruelest illusion, carrying her perfect inaccessibility to the point of death. In an odd way, ""Jennifer on My Mind"" is about aspirations rather than relations, and on that level it very nearly evades its absurdities to come round almost to the point of admiration.",1971-11-11T05:00:00+0000

It cheerily evokes the image of groupies, warm beer, cheeseburgers, overflowing ash trays, efficient plumbing and inefficient air-conditioning, which freezes the air without cleaning it, in an endless chain of identical bed-sitters that are the homes-away-from-home for the members of a touring rock group.""200 Motels"" is not all bad, but because it's a movie with so many things going on simultaneously, it becomes too quickly exhaustingin actual effect, soporific.At its heart, ""200 Motets"" is a subjective ""A Hard Day's Night"" in desperate need of the early Beatles. It is Zappa's somewhat put-on, but mostly put-down, vision of what it's like to be Frank Zappa (played by Ringo Starr) and the Mothers of Invention while touring through a universe that is one big Centerville, U.S.A. (""a real nice place to raise your kids up""). It is a place of dim-witted slogans, loneliness and aggressive girls with nicotine-stained fingers.There are terrible sight gags, a very funny cartoon sequence (""Dental Hygiene Dilemma"") in which a bored, motel-bound musician is reduced (if I remember correctly) to smoking a stolen towel, an outrageous oratorio dedicated to all those men and women who don't measure up (in one way or another), bits and pieces of choreography, references to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" and at least several dozen potentially funny ideas that are never developed, since the movie has the attention span of a speed freak.The nonstop visual effects are initially stunning, as when the black-and-white zebra stripes on a floor seem to break loose and wrap themselves around a body, when a blob of blue dances around the frame of the film, finally attaching itself to someone's nose, and when a conventionally photographed face dissolves into a kind of line-drawing of the same face. I have no idea how these things are done but they are quite marvelous.However, they are also immensely distracting in case you have any interest in the score. The music, which includes some of the most ambitious material ever written by Zappa, tends to go into one head and out the other, as if in flight from the almost predatory optical tricks.Being easily intimidated myself, I found it impossible to respond to or even to identify the various Mothers, who move in and out of the movie like pale blobs of color, or to Ringo Starr, who is easily recognizable but always slightly ill-at-ease. Theodore Bikel also is recognizableand ridiculousas a kind of Lucifer figure who wanders across the screen dispensing hamburgers from a fuming briefcase.Like a light show, ""200 Motels"" has no particular focal point, being principally an anthology of poor jokes and spectacular audio-visual effects, a few of which might expand the mind, but all of which, taken together, are like an overdose of Novocain.",1971-11-11T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Violent 'Haunted Samurai',"Zap! Bam! Powie! That's what you'll find in ""The Haunted Samurai,"" the new sword-swinger from Japan at the Bijou Theater.Severed hands and arms fly upward. A crunching sound of steel into human flesh dominates the sound track. There's one huge close-up of a human eyeball skewered by a knife. Even a poor, squealing mouse gets it, at random.All this is cited simply to warn the unwary about the traditional chopped-hamburger aspect of many medieval adventures of Old Japan, as served up by the new one. You'd better have a strong stomach if you go to see this one.A fair-to-medium film such as this, with no particular interest or profundity, is best suited to Japanese audiences or scholars. Equipped with skittish English titles, the story follows a guilt-ridden samurai deserter who does furtive penance as a farmer and then chops up most of the cast by way of further expiation. At least that's what we see, to hi-fi wailing, grunting and yowling on all sides.Hideki Takahashi is definitely a swinger, Masako Izumi makes a pretty, doe-eyed heroine and Isao Natsuyagi is a murderously limber spy out to nail the deserter.Our favorite portion came early as the stalwart hero, lured by a cooing beach girl, finds himself on a coral island surrounded by a murderous band of briefly-clad cuties. Zap! Bam! Powie! Like electric eels, they rain death at him, even chasing him underwater. One of them, with a whooshing sound James Bond might have envied, even spits a dagger straight at him a good forty feet or so away. Indeed, the whole sequence suggests good old ""Thunderball.""However, Operator 007 has no cause to worry. Score yesterday's adventure at about 002.",1971-11-12T05:00:00+0000

(""Technically,"" say the instructions, ""a witch is always a lady."") Miss Price does a couple of barrel rolls, then a nose dive, and crashes, heaplike, into a hedge, whereupon the children decide to blackmail the woman into serving them sausages and fries and into giving them pocket money as well.One needn't worry too much about the children's readiness to blackmail since, almost immediately, they come to love and cherish Miss Price for what she is, an apprentice witch dedicated to helping Winston Churchill save England from the Nazi invasion.""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" based on a story by Mary Norton, is a tricky, cheerful, aggressively friendly Walt Disney fantasy for children who still find enchantment in pop-up books, plush animals by Steiff and dreams of independent flight. One of the more attractive props in the film is a brass bed on which Miss Price, the three children and Prof. Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), the head of the Correspondence College of Witchcraft, fly to the cartoon land of Naboombu in search of the ultimate spell.I suspect the movie will be something of a long, uninterrupted sit for the very children for whom it's intended, and an even longer one for those parents and guardians (both adults and teen-age) who will probably accompany them. Yet, its morals are as unimpeachable as its technical facilityand there really aren't many movies about which you can say that these days.The loveliest part of the filmand the section that can renew one's appreciation of the special gifts of the Disney peopleis the live-action-plus-cartoon sequence in Naboombu featuring, among other things, a tumultuous soccer game, played by cartoon animals and refereed by Tomlinson, and an underwater ballet in which Miss Lansbury and Tomlinson dance in slow-motion surrounded by cartoon fish. It recalls the best of Disney, going all the way back to the first Silly Symphonies.If, aside from its technical wizardry, Disney fantasy has any truly distinguishing feature I would say it is the kind of frigid perfection represented by Julie Andrews in ""Mary Poppins."" If ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is somewhat less successful than that film, it also benefits from the presence of Miss Lansbury, who is neither an especially winning singer nor dancer, but who can't help projecting a certain healthy sensuality, even in the most proper Disney circumstances.Robert Stevenson directed the movie and Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman wrote the music and lyrics, none of which I can remember.""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" opened yesterday at Radio City Music Hall, where it will be the Christmas attractionsix weeks before Christmas.

It then appears that your partner missed an equally brilliant countermove to defeat the slam. Do you scream at your partner? Congratulate the declarer? Or enter the score in gloomy silence and calculate the opponents' enormous cash profit?",1971-11-14T05:00:00+0000

However, the gap between the reverential intention of the filmmakers and the film itself is constantly being emphasized by a kind of visual and aural grandeur that is at odds with the poverty and simplicity and faith of the Aleichem characters. Aside from Molly Picon, who is generously and outrageously authentic as the matchmaker, and Leonard Frey, who is the best thing in the film as the timid tailor, and aside from Topol, who, though I feel he's miscast as Tevye, displays such willingness to please it's almost rude not to respond to him, the performances are surprisingly mechanical and bland.

us,Film: 'Magic of the Kite' for Children,"""The Magic of the Kite,"" second in a series of children's movies being presented by the Xerox Corporation, is good for youngsters up to about 11 years of age. The film was shown at matinees at neighborhood theaters over the weekend in Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties and will shift to New Jersey theaters Saturday and Sunday, then come to Manhattan and the Bronx on Nov. 27 and 28.This is a genuinely diverting offering for the small fry, with some built-in surprises. For one thing, it is a rare co-production of Paris and Peking moviemakers, intermingling locales and young performers of both countries. Thanks to some excellent English dubbing, the French youngsters sound like real, apple-pie children down the block, which gives the picture a cozy, American stamp. A pretty Peking girl serves as an English interpreter in the Chinese sequences.With exquisite timing, the film has arrived on the heels of the United Nations team from Peking. But with all due respect, it would be hard to find more disarming goodwill ambassadors than the Chinese youngsters who initiate the other children to Peking sights and customs in the last half of the picture. And of course this film is in color, sauced by a sprightly musical score.In the first half of the movie, the Montmartre youngsters find a derelict Oriental kite, set aloft by a Peking boy with a friendly message and address. A dream transports one boy and his little sister abroad in quest of the sender.Wisely and smoothly pitched to the level of young audiences, with no icky-poo cuteness, the story ends with nice plea for international harmony, as exemplified by childhood playmates. Chief credit should go to Roger pigaut, that fine French actor, who plloted the project as director and co-screen-writer from his original story. All that matters is that young audiences are sure to like the movie. And it should make faraway Peking seem closer to everybody.",1971-11-16T05:00:00+0000

Michele (Jean-Louis Trintignant) is a playwright in search of three characters: Nina (Florinda Bolkan), his wife; Max (Tony Musante), his best friend, who is in love with Michele but the lover to Nina, and Ric (Lino Capolicchio), Max's boyfriend, who falls in love with Nina, who is of course, in love with Michele.""I must understand why my characters do what they do,"" says Michele. For what seems like most of the time we see them doing what they do through his imagination, which exhibits all of the disciplines of a bad movie in which the dcor and costumes are more vivid than the people, in which the camera always anticipates movements and gestures, and in which the music must communicate all passion.The movie is based on a play by Guiseppe Patroni Griffi, who also directed the film. It is possible (although I doubt it) that its pretenses might be effective on the stage, where the entire work would be seen as a proscenium masquerade within its own milieu. On film, however, these conceits, which are humorless, are as grotesque as stage make-up seen in broad daylight.",1971-11-17T05:00:00+0000

us,A Film About Animals,"Some animal movies are about animals. Other animal movies are about people who love animals and who, as the story usually goes, must protect their loveand their animalsfrom the incursions of a generally adult and always unfeeling outside world.Only the second kind of animal movie really matters. And that is the kind to which Edward Mann's ""Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!"" belongs  despite its featuring horses, ponies, monkeys, goats, cats, dogs, bunnies, chickens and enough Ken-L Ration to stock a year of pet-food commercials.The proprietor of this animal farm, Barney Morowitz (Jack Klugman, playing a role based on real life), faces eviction from his West Village vacant lot because the real estate company to which he owes back rent wants to put up an expensive high-rise in his place. Barney is without worldly wisdom, his primary passion being to get kids to love animals. In this he is so successful that when the eviction finally comes, three of the kids make off with their favorite pony so as to keep it from being sold for glue.Actually they have nothing to fear. But the adventures of the three kids (one black, one Puerto Rican, and one upper-middle-class whitethus representing New York's major ethnic minorities) in hiding the pony make up the bulk of the moviewhich nevertheless seems more interested in following a sweet and hopeless relationship that develops between Barney and his volunteer stable-girl, Mary Lee (Norma French).Neither the relationship, nor the kids, nor even the animals gets handsome enough treatment to redeem ""Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!"" from general mediocrity. The film is never mawkish or silly about its animals, but it is too lax and sometimes technically too inept to develop the interesting insights it seems to have about its people. Just once, during an argument between Barney and Mary Lee, there is a sustained, schmaltzy, rather lovely livelinessand the movie seems to take on the emotional urgency of music and to be trembling on the edge of song.I can imagine its being taken all the way into musical comedy by Norma French, who does sing, and acts with great warmth, and displays a kind of strong-featured beauty I associate more with the theater than with movies. Jack Klugman is also strong-featured (though no beauty), and his Barney is perhaps a tougher, more complex, and more detailed characterization than the film can profitably handle.""Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow!"" opened yesterday at the Guild Theater.",1971-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen:Documentary on Cuba Is at New Yorker,"Felix Greene, the British cameraman-journalist-author, who gave us feature-length color close-ups of ""China!"" in 1965 and ""North Vietnam"" two years later, continues his role as a movie Marco Polo for the embattled Left in ""Cuba Va!"", his latest color documentary on a nation largely concealed by a ""curtain."" As in the previous cases, he illustrates a contented people, who admittedly haven't yet achieved their revolutionary goals but are, as the title translates, moving forward.Using some old black-and-white footage to stress the enrichment of the few wealthy, both local and foreign, and the deprivation of the masses of the poor and ignorant Latin Americans, Greene, who shot his color film over the last year or so, makes visual comparisons in generally calm and effective style.With Premier Fidel Castro appearing on a few occasions to explain that Cuban freedom could be achieved only by revolution after 400 years of foreign domination, the film's natural bias is apparent but not overpowering. It opened yesterday at the Bleecker Street Cinema.The ""85 per cent"" illiteracy that existed 12 years ago when Castro ousted the former dictator, Fulgencio Batista, is given cheerful counterpoint by happy youngsters and adults receiving free education and instruction in trades in various immaculate up-to-date urban and rural schools. The admitted fact that did not meet its 10-million-ton sugar cane goal last year is offset by various scenes showing the harvesting of eight and a half million tons, a record crop.A viewer is fascinated by workers from other areas chipping to voluntarily to help with the cane, tobacco and other harvests; by a fine teachers college, medical school with many distaff students, and an especially modern psychiatric hospital near Havana; by an orchestra devoted to Western classics that is viewed, somewhat less favorably, than an excellent modern dance team working with native rhythms as another sign of Cuba's socialistic approach to the arts.One is impressed by younger composer-guitarists such as Silvio Rodriguez, Noel Nicola and Pablo Milanes, whose fine voices extol their brave new world. And one assumes that Mr. Greene knows what he is talking about in noting that ""the cinemas are filled and a nightclub has to be booked weeks in advance.""One also get glimpses of modern highways being built and slums being razed and a climactic scene showing Cubans reacting forcefully in Havana demonstrations when their captive fishermen were freed by Americans last year. The over-all impression sought by Mr. Greene is a bright present and a brighter future. But despite his largely happy vistas, his ""Cuba Va!"" leaves a nagging feeling that it is only a partial view of current history that still desperately needs fuller explanations.Also on the bill is ""Reggae,"" a 60-minute documentary on Jamaican music filmed at a concert in London last year and intercut with observations on its origins and purposes. As an outgrowth of traditional African, calypso, rock, soul and blues, its beat is infectious.And, even though Mike Raven, a British disk jockey, explains that ""Reggae"" was the name of the first record label to feature that genre and that it is also a form of protest, it is basically an item for the buffs, who should appreciate it most.",1971-11-19T05:00:00+0000

Of course, there is more in it than thatself-doubts, mutual recriminations, a fatal accident, a suicidebut in fact ""Maddalena"" is 15 minutes of dull movie puffed out to more than an hour and a half by flashbacks, fantasy flashes, shifts of focus, pans, track, zooms, and whatever other tricks can be used to inflate cinema vocabulary and diminish the medium.""Maddalena"" is Italian (poorly dubbed), and you can trace the Antonioni attitudes flitting across the Fellini faces of all the minor characters; but the kind of bad filmmaking it represents seems above mere nationality. In my darker moments I suspect an international cabal of dreadful directors and cinematographers who have decreed that all their movies will share the same appearance of department-store mod decadence with the same lush surfaces surrounding no substance, and the same endless substitution of manufactured atmosphere for real feeling at any level.As the magical Maddalena, Lisa Gastoni seems overage, overweight and underendowed. To express passion, she twitches her eyebrows. To express everything else she walksunsteadily, fully clothed but barefootby the sea. This is a movie in which emotional abandon is taken to mean that anything may be worn to the beach except a bathing suit; and the excitement of the place, the dress, and the person is really less than one can bear.",1971-11-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Paris: Bardot -- From Star to Actress,"PARIS  ""Boulevard du Rhum,"" a new film by Robert Enrico, is not likely to impress the spectator more lastingly than a swig of the alcohol that gives it its name. It is light entertainmentand not really brilliant at thatbut it moves along briskly enough so one does not have the time to notice its shortcomings. Since to mention anything even remotely smacking of entertainment nowadays is more shameful than to confess a murder, it will surprise no one to learn that ""Boulevard du Rhum"" is, in a way, important. It marks the death of a starthe last star, perhapsand the birth of an actress: Brigitte Bardot.Arts AbroadStardom is based on worship, on belief, and belief must be blind. Nothing could have been more harmful to Miss Bardot's status as a star than the reputation of being a good actress and of appearing in good films. Fortunately, ever since Roger Vadim's ""And God Created Woman,"" she has shown downright genius in dispelling suspicion of either of these crimes. Nobody remembered whom or in what she playedand that was just the point: One recalled ""B.B."". In recent years, however, people have begun to notice, and this could mean only one thing: Miss Bardot was losing her stellar glow and descending inexorably toward earth.Re-entering our atmosphere is notoriously a complex, risky operation. Thanks to ""Boulevard Du Rhum""and there is genius in that tooshe has made it. The film matches Miss Bardot, the Gallic Marilyn Monroe, with Lino Ventura, a French version of John Wayne. It is a cross-breed of ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Quiet Man."" During Prohibition a Hollywood actress becomes involved with an adventurer who spirits rum into the United States from the Caribbean. The only really French touch occurs when, to Miss Bardot's disclosure that she is about to ditch him, Mr. Ventura, who is having lunch, replies: ""You might have waited till I had eaten my steak before telling me."" One readily understands his dismay: Miss Bardot as eyelash-batting, cheesecaking Linda Larue, fresh and alive despite her crushing harness of movieland clichs, is irresistible. How did the director achieve this miracle? Simply by remembering that, to turn a bad actress into a good one, the surest way is to make her play a bad actress.Since its overhauling, the Grand Palais specializes in mammoth retrospectives of modern French masters. After Picasso, Chagall and Matisse, the turn of Fernand Lger has come. Three hundred and fifty workspaintings, drawings, ceramicssubstantiate Lger's claim to being, for better but also for worse, ""the primitive of a century yet to come.""""Everything in art is based on contrasts, it is the only general law in all major art,"" Lger once said. It is certainly the law of his own. His paintings of 1910-1913 is the one truly original brand of cubism invented after Picasso and Braque. It combines the curves of clouds and foliage with the straight lines of houses, sets up a counter-point between flatness and perspective. At once synthetic, frontal and broken down into subtle gradations, these canvases associate what had never been asociated before: monumentality and delicacy.Despite their abstract denomination, ""Form Contrasts,"" the pictures of the next few years, remain recognizably landscapes, still-lifes and studies and figures. They turn Picasso's rectangles into cylinders: cubism becomes ""tubism,"" not out of some arbitrary straining for originality, but because of Lger's instinctive affinities with weight, mass and volume.The war made him discover people, he later said. Actually, what he discovered was technology. Lger is the first artist to bring applied science within the compass of art, not by painting industrial machines and objects, but by painting mechanically, objectively. Between 1918 and 1925, he has produced canvases as perfect and terrifying as an automated factory. They are impeccable, self-sufficient: not a trace of human hand soils their smoothness. Although often as non-figurative as a Mondrian or a Malevitoh, they don't feel abstract, for their abstractness is the cold, dehumanized reality of technology. Nobody has given us a truer, more epic statement of the second industrial revolution.Visible it did become, especially since 1945. But a source of joy? Depicting workers is not enough to create a popular art. Despite its bright, straightforward colors, Lger's technological fauvism is no more joyous than the pure color schemes applied to large-scale housing projects. His figures possess the heroic dimension, but they have that defeated air and they look at us with that sad, empty stare one sees in the subway at the rush hour.How could a talent as warm and a temperament as tonic as Lger's come to this sadness, this emptiness? The fault is not his, but that of his solution: enlargement. Beyond a certain size, the medium becomes the message: blown up a thousand times, a faceany faceno longer belongs to man, but to space. It is neutral, barren space that paints, not Lger. He was the first to come to grips with a phenomenon, which, in art as in other domains, is the great problem of our age: the new, incredibly augmented scale of life. But he has done so at the expense of its very nature. That is why the death of painting, so masterfully brought about by Fernand Lger, cannot be looked at without misgivings.",1971-11-22T05:00:00+0000

Given token aid and then dumped by his buddies, the half-dead man inches back to civilization.If only the picture had held fast to a simple uncluttered Crusoe-style survival story.Instead, methodical flashbacks jump to the past, revealing only the hero's atheism and bitterness over his wife's death.Worse, the picture also shifts to the other trappers, commanded by John Huston, who speculate at length about the absent man, while wheeling over the mountains a weird-looking, amphibious boat that looks like a Rube Goldberg version of Noah's Ark. Richard C. Sarafian, the director, has staged some scenes involving Indian attacks and wild animals that although stomach-churning are not strong.The scenery is rugged and fine. But Harris, a fine actor, looks like Rasputin drawn through a meat grinder. All we got out of this ode to the pioneer spirit was one thing: never tango with a grizzly.",1971-11-25T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 'Black Beauty':Anna Sewell's Book Provides Source,"Readers of Anna Sewell's famous autobiography of a horse will not find too much that is familiar in James Hill's new film version of ""Black Beauty."" But they will find an uncommonly interesting, handsome and sometimes quite marvelously inventive movie that might have been called ""The Further Adventures of Black Beauty,"" including such episodes as Black Beauty among the Irish gypsies, Black Beauty on the Continent and Black Beauty preserving the Empire, at battle in India.Actually, the film's story pays frequent respects to the novel. It is much concerned with the humane treatment of horses. And at the end it even goes so far as to introduce Anna Sewell herselt (Margaret Lacey), as the noble benefactor of Black Beauty's serene old age.But its stronger interests lie elsewhere; in the Romantic intensity, sharp pathos, or dark humor of episodes that involve the horse but are not so much about the horse as about the various people who own it, use and cherish or betray it. Their lives have a very special, often fateful glamour that owes a good deal to 19th-century fiction (not the ""Black Beauty"" kind of fiction) but that survives today chiefly in the movies.I think the film appreciates the fragility of even its most vivid figuresits romantic lovers, its circus-world entrepreneurs, its thieves and squires, its officers of the cavalry, its miserable dealers in coal. It has therefore surrounded them with a dense and rather difficult atmospheric beauty, which both distances them and protects them in a supporting halflight of remembered fears and pleasures.At the simplest, ""Black Beauty"" is not only good to look at, it is also challenging to look at. Whether in the dangers of a fox hunt near the beginning (a conventional sequence that for once really words) or in the darkness of the coal mines where Black Beauty almost ends his days, the film creates an environment that is partly time and place, but is also the understanding of a privileged vision.""Black Beauty"" suffers mainly from the utterly pedestrian performances of its leading players: Mark Lester as young Joe Evans, the horse's first owner; and Walter Slezak as the European circus owner who later buys him. But these players lead in cast billing only. There are other roles as important that are wonderfully played, by Ursula Glas as the circus owner's spirited daughter, by Maria Rohm as the high-born English girl whose lover (Peter Lee Lawrence) may die for her but never marry her, especially by Patrick Mower as an evil young squire who hates horses and whom Black Beauty kills for his dreadful rage.I should not normally recommend a movie for children, because I don't like restrictions and I think that children often have tastes a little different and a little tougher than adults might prefer. There is some violence in ""Black Beauty"" and also a little sex (its lovers kiss as if they cared), and I can't imagine that kids would mind. Thus, ""Black Beauty"" is perhaps sexy and violent enough for kids, but pleasant and pastoral enough for their parents. It opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters and it is worth seeking out.",1971-11-25T05:00:00+0000

The temptation was not to turn the page, but to linger over its unhurried felicities. In one of them whose title I forget something about a horse, I believe  the reader is treated to a couple of pages of outrageously funny doubletalk, culled from God knows what arcane argot of English antiquity or regional usage. Now, having just discovered that Mr. Stewart writes serious novels under his own name, I hastened to read Avery's Mission and found what I suppose I should have expected from this accomplished ironist: that this serious novel seethes with suspense.

us,Screen: 'Deathstyles':It Highlights Program in Whitney Series,"Richard Myers's ""Deathstyles,"" 60-minutes long, is the main attraction in the current program of the Whitney Museum's New American Filmmakers Series. But it is preceded by three very short films: John Knoop's antiwar ""Five O'Clock Rush,"" Anne Severson's and Shelby Kennedy's nude bodies study, ""Riverbody,"" and James Broughton's creation myth, ""This Is It."" Knoop's film is actively awful; ""Riverbody"" features too many boys and too few girls (I know I'm misreading the intention here); but Broughton, who places a 2-year-old Adam and a bright apple-red balloon in a backyard Garden of Eden, works a small miracle of the ordinary. And since that miracle is what his film is all about, he achieves a kind of casual perfection in matching means and ends.""Deathstyles"" is the second long Richard Myers film to play at the Whitney. Last year there was the highly ambitious ""Akran"" (after Akron, Ohio), bits of which show up in ""Deathstyles"" on the various picture screens or in the several windows and doors and other openings available to the projection of secondary images. There are a good many such imagesnot only from ""Akran,"" but of isolated heads, faces monumentally enlarged, lunar landscapesand they significantly condition ""Deathstyles."" Much of the time, they almost save it from itself.In somewhat unequal proportions, ""Deathstyles"" deals both in bizarre events of its own making and in the current events that are in part responsible for its having been made. Thus, Richard Nixon on the subject of death, clips of the John Kennedy assassination, the killings at Kent State (where Myers teaches and where sections of the film were shot) all appear as part of the communications mix that is the film's prevailing style.Myers has made several documentaries, and even in a fiction film like ""Akran"" he tends to become more involved with theme than with story, succeeding in part because he manages to suggest a multiplicity of stories without ever quite actually telling them. ""Deathstyles"" seems much more fragmented in its intentions, more obligated to whatever passes or is placed in front of its camera, and less committed to the demands of any inner necessityto say nothing of what might have been the inner necessity of its characters.I think this is unfortunate, because Myers has a special and quite mysterious power as a fantasist, whereas his facts are about the same as anybody else'sexcept when he hokes them up by means of a superb technical facility that has been widely praised but that may be the demon he most needs to control. His movies look wonderful (not pretty) and with electronic backgrounds provided by Fred Coulter they sound wonderful, too. But I don't think that they are about much as yetand that is why they begin so insistently in autobiography and close so predictably with the end of the world.",1971-11-26T05:00:00+0000

us,' Socrates' Mirrors the Platonic Touch of Rossellini,"Something more than wordplay is involved when one describes Roberto Rossellini's ""Socrates,"" which opened yesterday at the New Yorker Theater, as the great Italian director's most Socratic film, in his most Platonic style.Although the movie was shot entirely in Spain with lots of correctly costumed extras, who walk around what look to be the freshly painted, spruced-up remains of the sets of Anthony Mann's unfortunate ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" it concedes no more than it absolutely must to the demands of a popular cinema that seeks access to the intellect through visual grandeur and primal emotions.Like all of Rossellini's recent films, including the fine ""The Rise of Louis XIV,"" ""Socrates"" was originally made for television (that is, European television, which is apparently a lot more adventurous than our own). Curiously enough, television's limited budgets and circumscribed physical scope, which might diminish the work of any other film director I can think of (except Godard), have given a certain freedom to Rossellini, allowing him to pursue his humanistic concerns unhampered by the temptations to indulge in conventional masquerades.What we are now getting from Rossellini, who so moved us with the neorealism of ""Open City"" and ""Paisan,"" and then pioneered Antonioni country with films like ""Stromboli"" and ""A Voyage to Italy,"" is a type of teaching cinema that is not exactly stern, although it is uncompromising. It is the work of a kind of saint, whom I can admire even when I don't find him especially congenial.The passion of ""Socrates"" is the passion of its subject, which, to say the least, bears very little relation to the sort of melodramatic, window-dressed passion celebrated by something like ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Drawing freely from Plato's ""Euthyphro,"" ""The Apology,"" ""Crito"" and ""Phaedo,"" Rossellini recalls the last years of Socrates's life almost entirely in terms of Socratic dialogues.Socrates (Jean Sylvere) moves about ancient Athens surrounded by a small cloud of followers, deflating the pompus, drawing reason out of the unreasonable, defining things like piety and pity, speculating on the aspects of the souland infuriating the wise who refuse to acknowledge that the first step to wisdom is the acknowledgement that one knows nothing.As the words are Plato's, so is Rossellini's style, which is straightforward, pure and serene. This offers not much opportunity for performances, in any conventional respect, or for drama, even during Socrates's trial and execution. The film is a series of rather proper, spoken tableaus that seldom erupt with spontaneity. (One exception: when Xanthippe laments the fact that Socrates is dying ""unjustly,"" he answers with some impatience: ""Would you prefer that I died justly?""Yet there is in this fidelityin this complete refusal to let the film come between the audience and its subjecta kind of beauty and poetry that are all but unknown in the work of any other contemporary filmmaker. Unfortunately, the film is in Italian, translated by English subtitles that don't always make a great deal of sense. However, if the film sends you back to the original texts, as it did me, it will have accomplished exactly what I suspect Rossellini intended it to do.""Socrates"" employs a minimum of cinematic techniques, and makes no attempt at characterization. We do meet Xanthippe, Crito, Meletus, Anytus and Lycon, in passing, but Plato himself, who was apparently ill during the trial (according to ""Phaedo""), remains respectfully off-screenplayed by Rossellini.",1971-11-26T05:00:00+0000

Both Gideon Bachmann's ""Ciao Federico"" and Mark Woodcock's ""Two American Audiences,"" playing this weekend and next at the Film Forum, are directors' studies and both succeed in revealing something about an artist's mode of being, but nothing much about the meaning of his work.""Two American Audiences,"" which has been seen here before, intercuts a filmed seminar with Jean-Luc Godard and a group of New York Univeresity students, with scenes from 'La Chinoise,"" the movie under discussion. Godard is polite, patient and articulate (so are the students), and he can say what he felt he was doing, but, of course, not what his movie is.The chopped-up bits of ""La Chinoise"" say even less about the movie, and the dreadful color reproduction renders it an outright disservice. There is simply no reason for his film, which could as well have been a taped transcript, and the ""La Chinoise"" anthology looks as if it had been added to provide a reasonas have the cinematics, the insistent and offensive zoom shots into the faces of the student questioners.""Ciao Federico"" has its share of idiot zooms, and also its own ""Ciao Federico"" theme song, and certain pretensions to being a piece of moviemaking in its own right. Although there is a lot about it I don't like (including the zooms and the theme song) I think it succeeds as moviemaking. And it offers some quite sinfully fascinating glimpses of life on the location of ""Fellini Satyricon"" as well.Fellini himself, as the subject of ""Ciao Federico,"" provides a center of attention, but the film is immensely, sometimes too energetically aware of peripheries as well. The very setsTrimalchio's villa, the villa of the suicides, especialy that great imprbable construction, the ship upon which Lichas (Alain Cuny) marries the young hero, Encolpius (Martin Potter)which define a world half clumsy mechanics, half frenzied imagination. And the actors who populate that world, their faces masked, their souls brilliantly displayed, bring it to a life that is never so theatrical as when it is striving for contact with the real.Of course the film means to give some sense of how Fellini works as a director (and it does), but it is at its best in showing what he works throughthe incredible crowded activity that annoys him but ultimately sustains him.Bachmann is not above seeking sensation. Occasionally he is sensationally rewardedas when a little man shows up on the set with a ravishing blonde, and he begins recommending to Fellini the bizarre delights of Disneyland. Suddenly you realize that the little man is Roman Polanski, and the blonde, graceful, cool, quiet and aloof from the prevailing madness, is of course Sharon Tate.I doubt that a taste for sensationalism does much disservice to the Fellini happenings. It gives you something of the man, if nothing of the master. And in this case the man, more than most of his peers and even his betters, seems worth a movie. I should think that in the archives of the film-production branch of the human comedy, there is at least a minor place for the public intimacies of ""Ciao Federico.""",1971-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Film art it may be, but of an extremely insular kind best savored on home ground. The movie's plot, which has the two men terrorizing a peculiarly passive village, is just as baffling as the English titles underscoring medieval tradition and fatalism.However, interested some American viewers may be in the indigenous aspects of the picture, the bald fact is that an entire village sits around on its haunches until two mysterious arrivals have chopped up the whole place.
