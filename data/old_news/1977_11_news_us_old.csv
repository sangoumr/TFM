us,"Film: 'Dragon' at Music Hall:Sweet, Green Fire","DID YOU EVER see an elephant fly? You did? Well, then, how about a chubby green dragon who trots across live-action landscapes with animated aplomb, and who can casually turn himself into a cloud of blue vapor? ""Pete's Dragon,"" which opened yesterday at the Radio City Music Hall, is the most energetic and enjoyable Disney movie in a long while.Pete is a rather strenuously cute little boy played by Sean Marshall, and Elliott is his fire-breathing, often invisible friend. Together, they run away from the filthy, snaggle-toothed Gogans (Mama Gogan is Shelley Winters), who have bought Pete from an orphanage for $50 and change and mean to keep him. Pete and Elliott wind up in Passamaquoddy, a Maine town that looks remarkably like a California movie set, with a populace that includes Jim Backus as the bumbling mayor, Mickey Rooney as the tippling lighthouse-keeper, Helen Reddy as the lighthouse-keeper's wonderful daughter, and Jim Dale and Red Buttons as a pair of half-funny, half-dastardly medicine salesmen. Lots of things happen to Pete and Elliott there, and every time anything happens, someone is sure to sing about it.Directed by Disney veteran Don Chaffey, ""Pete's Dragon"" is full of performers who nicely detract attention from one another's weaknesses. Sean Marshall doesn't sing well, but Helen Reddy does, so she often accompanies his vocals. Miss Reddy is serviceable but undistinguished as an actressshe has a tendency to behave as if she were a very bright light bulb in a very small lampbut she so often finds herself in the company of Messrs. Rooney, Dale or Buttons that her scenes work well.Onna White's choreography is charmingly ragtag, especially when it comes to the Gogans, and the score by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn (whose lesser credits include ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"") has some sunny moments. At two hours and 14 minutes, the movie is a lot longer than it needs to be. On the other hand, Elliott (whose beeps and bomps and chomping sounds are supplied by Charlie Callas) is very sweet and emotive, and you don't often see children's musicals as ambitious as this one any more.Kids may love it, but adults will find themselves wondering about a thing or two. Granted, a movie starring a green dragon invites a few jokes about characters' seeing things that aren't there; even so, there is an awful lot of drinking in the script, and the film treats alcohol carelessly enough to give one pause. Also, there is something disconcerting about the musical number in which Miss Reddy and a chorus of children proclaim that ""There's room for everyone in this world."" Passamaquoddy counts a handful of blacks among its population, but the children in that scene appear to be exclusively white.",1977-11-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Voyage Into Oblivion:Failed Aspirations,"""VOYAGE TO GRAND Tartarie"" is brought to us by Jean-Charles Tacchella, the director who hadn't yet brought to us ""Cousin, Cousine"" when he made ""Grand Tartarie,"" his first feature, a comedy of such consistent mirthlessness and accidental cruelty you might believe them to be his method.Although I'm an admirer of ""Cousin, Cousine,"" which became one of the most successful foreign-language movies we've had in years, I can see some associations between its rather casual treatment of other people's feelings and the total self-absorption that Mr. Tacchella displays in ""Voyage to Grand Tartarie,"" which opened yesterday at the D. W. Griffith and Quad Cinemas, a social satire made with a heavy hand and small mind.Only someone dangerously sure of his own talents would think he could makeas Mr. Tacchella has described ""Grand Tartarie""a film that is a ""farcical trip through our society"" as well a ""satire of films which make fun of contemporary society."" If Mr. Tacchella were a shipbuilder, you might expect him to put sails on a submarine.""Voyage to Grand Tartarie,"" a title that is supposed to suggest a trip through hell, is set in a landscape that is meant to be a surreal projection of a France in the grip of social and political revolution, environmental pollution and emotional alienation.The journey is undertaken by Alexis (Jean-Luc Bideau) after his pretty young wife is arbitrarily shot down by a maniac in a cowboy suit as she comes out of a supermarket. Alexis, one is asked to believe, feels so much grief he expresses none at all. He withdraws his money from the bank, packs one shirt in a suitcase, and climbs in to his car with the intention of committing suicide when his money runs out.Unfortunately he has too many whimsical adventures ever to carry out his plan. With a completely deadpan expression, Alexis alternately observes the idiocies around him and participates in them. It's a lunatic world, Mr. Tacchella tells us over and over again, a mysterious place where a businessman works so hard he has to take sleep cures twice a year, where people carry guns to and from work, where everyone's on strike, where water is about to be rationed and where nothing is so awful at home but that news of a war in Kenya doesn't make things seem better.Alexis's life becomes a kind of elongated movie serial, a point that is emphasized by his reading ""Fantomas"" adventures in moments of repose. He has a couple of desultory affairs along the way, including one with a young woman played by Micheline Lanctot, who has a very pretty face but is otherwise so husky-voiced and androgynous I began to wonder if she could possibly be a boy. This suspicion was further increased by Mr. Tacchella's decisionwhich I ultimately took to be just another failed joketo shoot several scenes featuring Mr. Bideau in the nude while the actresses remain prudishly clothed from the neck down.Mr. Tacchella has no knack whatsoever for the cinema of the absurd. Images that are intended to strike us as revealing and ridiculous simply look like mistakes, things that should have been left on the cutting-room floor but weren'ta little girl cheerfully burying a cat alive, or a woman shining the shoes of her husband while he hangs by his neck from a tree. Only Luis Buuel has the tact and the wit to deal successfully in such expressions of rage.The movie is such a mess it even fractures the talents of Mr. Bideau, the Swiss actor who has proven himself in such films as ""La Salamandre,"" ""The Invitation"" and ""Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000."" In this film, he behaves like a zombie.""Grand Tartarie"" is not completely incapable of creating some sense of wonder, if only the wonder that the man who made his debut with a movie of so many failed aspirations could have gone on to make ""Cousin, Cousine,"" a small, beautifully acted love story, simultaneously tough and lyric, which never overreaches itself in the juvenile ways of his first endeavor.",1977-11-04T05:00:00+0000

Well, no truly rotten movie is perfect.""Heroes"" is about Jack Dunne (Mr. Winkler), a demented Vietnam veteran of repulsive winsomeness, a fellow who attempts to demonstrate the proposition that certified nuts have an exclusive franchise on truth and beauty. When we first meet Jack, skylarking around Times Square, he tries to interrupt a recruiting officer who's about to sign up six enlistees. However, Jack simply winds up back at the veterans' hospital, where he's been an off-and-on patient for five years.""Heroes"" is the story of Jack's flight from the hospital and his cross-country bus trip toward California, where he plans to start a worm farm. Jack is meant to be a lovable eccentric or, as one of the other characters says of him, a person who's ""got rainbow, honey."" It's the latter quality that apparently appeals to Carol (Miss Field), another lovable eccentric, a young woman who is taking a bus trip to Kansas City, Mo., so she can have time ""to think."" Instead, she falls in love with Jack.""Heroes,"" which was written by James Carabatsos and directed by Jeremy Paul Kagan, who directed Mr. Winkler in the television film ""Katherine,"" is something more than just a bad film. It's a frighteningly bad film because it could well be the definitive theatrical motion picture of the future.Like the medium that spawned the talents who made it, ""Heroes"" deals in concepts made so simple that their meanings would be obvious to the dimmest minds. Gestures and emotions are fore-shortened, truncated. Watching Mr. Winkler and Miss Fields ""act"" is suddenly to understand what television may eventually do to movies. Actors in television series and often in television movies simply don't have time to develop or discover characters. They must be entirely visible from the first minute they're on.One result is the sort of performance that Mr. Winkler gives in this film. It's one that seems to be aggressively cute not because he's appealing, but because the will to please is so naked and the mannerisms are so unconnected to life. Television is creating a school of acting made up entirely of signals that evoke emotions less often than they label them.I can imagine some not-too-distant time when we'll all sit around our home screens watchingand becoming emotionally involved withcomedies and dramas that show not people, but transistorized robots of the sort the Disney people have developed. They'd simplify casting, eliminate the union problem and would offer numerous merchandising possibilities.Merchandising is something else that ""Heroes"" deals in. By blaming Jack Dunne's emotional problems on his traumatic Vietnam experience, the movie somehow denies the true horrors of that war while purveying bitterness for easy, supposedly painless entertainment.Harrison Ford, who may be one of the most-seen movie actors of the day because of his role in ""Star Wars,"" is effective in a supporting role too small to make the picture worth seeing.""Heroes,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance suggested"", contains some mildly vulgar language, but is otherwise almost prudish enough to be shown on television on Saturday morning.",1977-11-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"'First Love,' Film of the 70's, Misogynistic on Ugly Affair","""I think it's loathsome that we sleep together. I feel like a you-khow-what,"" says a character named Caroline to her college sweetheart, Elgin, in ""Sentimental Education,"" the 1950's short story by Harold Brodkey on which ""First Love"" is very loosely based. The film, written by Jane Stanton Hitchcock and directed by Joan Darling, is a 70's update with a vengeance.We seem hardly to have met the two young lovers when Elgin begins asking Caroline about her orgasms, and Caroline chides him, not at all pleasantly, about those postcoital moments when ""you're no good to me anymore."" If ""First Love"" is to be believedand there's no good reason why it should bethen these days romance is a much uglier and hard-boiled business than it ever used to be.The title promises warmth and a tentative, trembling sense of discovery, but this simply isn't that kind of movie. Elgin (William Katt) a handsome and reserved college student who is looking for the real thing, becomes smitten with Caroline (Susan Dey), a fellow student who appears to have been through the real thing more times than she can count. Caroline is involved with an older, married man when Elgin falls for her, and this apparently has something to do with Caroline's father, who committed suicide in her dollhouse (it was a roomy dollhouse) when she was small. This, and a would-be contemporary air of sexual overkill, is perhaps supposed to explain why Caroline is a heartless and abrasive tease who resorts to wisecracks at even the most intimate moments. It doesn't.Miss Darling (who directed the first episodes of ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman""), by not bothering to cast much light on Caroline's nasty nature, shows herself to be as peculiarly misogynistic as such other women directors as Elaine May (in ""The Heartbreak Kid"") and Lina Wertmuller (especially in ""Swept Away""). The two main female characters in ""First Love"" are Caroline and the predatory, rather pathetic Shalley (Beverly D'Angelo), and they both pounce avariciously upon Mr. Katt, who seems passive and rather saintly under pressure. (""You can't handle a real womanyou want us all to be shy violets"" shrieks Shelley, after Elgin rejects her grabby advances.) Both Miss Hitchcock's script and Miss Darling's directing suggest that he is far too good for either lover.Though Miss Darling brings not the slightest whit of tenderness or understanding to the love scenes, the movie is not without its gentle touches. It opens with slow-motion, idyllic-looking footage of Mr. Katt playing soccer alone, and it includes a lush, very prominent score. In fact, when Mr. Katt and Miss Dey have their first sexual encounter, they are accompanied by a Paul Williams ballad.However, the music is so over-bearing that it says nothing about intimacy, but a lot about Miss Darling's fear of being alone with her characters, or of leaving anything at all to the audience's imagination. As a director, she seems comfortable only with smart remarks or with scenes that hammer home every last nuance. ""When you know this room, you'll know me,"" says Miss Dey, leading Mr. Katt through her childhood bedroom. The pictures on the wall might as well have dialogue balloons.Miss Dey's Caroline is flippant and unconvincing. But the good news is that Mr. Katt's perforance far transcends the chilliness of its surroundings. His Elgin is bursting with hope and urgency even when Miss Dey does nothing to warrant his enthusiasm, and in his rosy optimism there are hints of what might, in more sympathetic hands have been. Even so, Mr. Katt's work is passionate and resourceful, and it deserves to be seen.",1977-11-05T05:00:00+0000

Her moving wings ignited like tissue paper, enlarging the circle of light in the clearing and creating out of the darkness the sadden blue sleeves of my sweater, the green leaves of jewelweed by my side, the ragged red trunk of a pine. At once the light contracted again and the moth's wings vanished in a fine, foul smoke. At the same time her six legs clawed, curled, blackened, and ceased, disappearing utterly. And her head jerked in spasms, making a spattering of noise; her antennae crisped and burned away and her heaving mouth parts crackled like pistol fire. When it was all over, her head was, so far as I could determine, gone, gone the long way of her wings and legs. Had she been new, or old? Had she mated and laid her eggs, had she done her work?

I think it would be a mistake to try and win too fast, the coach said at the time. I don't want to do everything for a victory or two when the principal idea is to build a football team. John McKay, who had built four national champion college teams at the University of Southern California, did not realize that at Tampa Bay he would be building a tradition instead of a teama tradition of losing unmatched by any other National Football League franchise at the start of its history. In their first year, the Bucs became the first N.F.L. team ever to lose all 14 games on its schedule. This year they have lost all eight games as they await sunday's visit by the New York Giants but John Mckay is still seething over what happened in the Bucs 330 loss to the Rams last sunday in Los Angeles. In their eagerness to maintain the Bucs tradition, the Rams jumped offside on one play.After the Whistle, the referee stepped off the 5yard penalty against the Bucs instead of against the Rams. Realizing his mistake, the referee laughed as he turned and stepped it off properly. Some of the other officials also laughed. I didn't mind them making a mistake, John McKay snapped later.

On canvas, she has distilled her unique vision of nature: an expanding universe in the heart of a flower, the closeness of a lust horizon, the rhythms of life in a sundried bone. As woman, she has projected an image of courage and quiet passion, an image that spurred her husband, pioneer photographer Alfred Stieglitz, to make hundreds portraits of her (two are shown here).

us,'Turning Point' Limns Ballet Life,"The story to date: 20 years ago Deedee abandoned her ambitions to become a star of the American Ballet Theater and, instead, moved to Oklahoma City with her husband, Wayne, with whom she opened a fabulously successful ballet school, raised three fabulously sweet children, moved into a splitlevel house and acquired a fabulously long station wagon. Deedee chose loveunlike her best friend, Emma, who chose success and became Ballet Theater's prima ballerina.As our movie, which is called ""The Turning Point."" opens, Deedee and Emma are reunited when Ballet Theater comes to Oklahoma City. Old hopes are rekindled for, as all of us know, an old hope never dies in fiction of this sort, no matter how many tears are pumped on it. Emma, who gets 19 curtain calls and has ""everything"" envies Deedee, while Deedee, the one who got pregnant, still dreams of stardom. Wil Ithey ever find peace and fulfillmentthese two women who now recall theirhow shall I put it?turning points?To ask that question is to know the worst about this entertaining new movie, an old-fashioned backstage musical transplanted to the world of ballet by three people who not only know it but also love it, sentimental clichs and all.""The Turning Point,"" which opened last night at special performances at the Coronet and Baronet Theaters, begins its regular commercial engagement at the Coronet today. It's the work of Herbert Ross, the director; Arthur Laurents, the screenwriter, and Nora Kaye (Mrs. Ross), the former ballerina who is its executive producer. Their curious, collective achievement is in having found so much vitality in the sort of movie that demands that its audiences weep with sympathy for characters who have all they ever wanted but simply don't realize it yet.Among the film's principal assets are Shirley MacLaine, looking very pretty and almost matronly, but not quite, as the sharp-tongued, intelligent, deep-down furious homemaker, Deedee; and Anne Bancroft as the driven ballerina, Emma, a woman of ravaged beauty and whose frail frame could possibly lift a freight car if she willed it.The intensity of their lifelong friendship, and rivalry, is carefully and sometimes hilariously detailed as ""The Turning Point"" follows Deedee's daughter, Emilia, charmingly played by Leslie Browne, her mother and her little brother to New York, where Emilia joins Ballet Theater's school. It's not giving away too much to report that the girl's almost instantaneous success means that one day in the not too distant future she will be replacing her beloved godmother, Emma, as the A.B.T.'s major attraction.These are more or less the bones of the film, which are hardly bare, what with Emma's having to face the reality of time's passage, and Deedee's having to come to terms with her missed opportunities. Could she have danced the lead in ""Anna Karenina"" 20 years ago? Probably not, though from what we see of Emma in the role, it's mostly walking through steam.There are also the emotional crises faced in New York by Emilia, who has an unhappy affair with a young Soviet dancer named Yuri, a role played with cheerful ease by Mikhail Baryshnikov, the young Soviet dancer who chose success in the West several years ago.As Emilia learns that the love of a young Soviet ballet dancer is not foreverwhich is just as well when one has her eye on the top of the billand as Emma and Deedee are wrestling, once physically in a very funny and moving scene, with their doubts, ""The Turning Point"" gives us excerpts from more than a dozen ballets that feature, in addition to Mr. Baryshnikov and Miss Browne, the stars and the corps de ballet of Ballet Theater.The manner in which Mr. Ross handles these sequences defines the choice that he made when planning ""The Turning Point."" That is, he chose to create a backstage film about the ballet rather than a ballet film. The excerpts are lovely but often so brief that not even an obnoxious child would have time to become bored. Because this is a film about people and not dance, the film spends as much time showing us the dancers' faces and reaction shots of people in the audience as it does showing us the complete figures of the dancers in motion. The method is that of show-biz, not art.Show-biz is also apparent in the tone of Mr. Laurents's screenplay, which delights not only in backstage sentiment but also backstage bitchiness with, I'm told, all sorts of references to people living and dead. Though ""The Turning Point"" does show us that ballet is an extremely difficult, physically demanding art, the film's concentration on its female characters tends, if only by accident, to confirm the oldest ballet clich of them allthat ballet is, in this country anyway, women's work.All of the men in the film exist as little more than dance partners or as props for the drama. This is partly the result of the focus of the movie in which Miss MacLaine and Miss Bancroft give such powerhouse performances and only Mr. Baryshnikov is allowed to be a man of any substance.The others, including Tom Skerritt, who plays Miss MacLaine's blandly decent husband, are background figures. Such a comment, I realize, could also be made about any number of Bette Davis. Joan Crawford or Greer Garson movies of long ago.""The Turning Point"" is entertaining, not for discovering new material, but for treating old material with style and romantic feeling that, in this day and age, seem remarkably unafraid.""The Turning Point,"" which has been rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""), contains some mildly vulgar language and one nude love scene that is so tastefully and genteelty done, perhaps because it is actually the last scene in a ballet.",1977-11-15T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: 'Thunder' From King of Bees,"THUNDER and Lightning,"" which opened yesterday at the Victoria and neighborhood theaters, is a buoyantly slapdash comedy about bootleggers in the Everglades. Although the movie appears to have been photographed almost entirely on Florida location and although its cast includes some good actors, David Carradine, Kate Jackson, and Sterling Holloway. ""Thunder and Lightning"" is less like a live-action movie than a 95-minute Bugs Bunny cartoonwhich is one of the nicest things about it.Mr. Carradine plays an independent-minded young bootlegger, a fellow who wears an earring in his left ear and who swaggers with just a little more self-assurance than his charm allows. Miss Jackson, one of the better comedians to come out of television, is his friend, the daughter of the syndicate-backed bootlegger who is Mr. Carradine's nemesis.The movie begins with a chase involving swamp buggies, and later shifts in various makes and models of automobiles. There's hardly a moment in the movie when someone's not being pursued by, or in pursuit of someone else. It's painless, sometimes funny, good-natured, as well as extremely prolife. As in a Bugs Bunny work, no one is permanently damaged by the non-stop mayhem.

us,Screen: A Romance Of Medieval Spain,"""THE CONFESSIONS OF AMANS,"" a story of tragic love set in medieval Spain, is a most unusual movieso rigorously disciplined and composed it looks as if it were the work of someone who is nearing the end of a career and has long since abandoned the tricks of a trivial trade.Instead, it is the first feature of 28-year-old Gregory Nava, an American of Basque-Mexican parentage who studied at the film school of the University of California at Los Angeles. Using professional actors, costumes that once appeared in ""El Cid"" and a lot of the castles of ancient Segovia. Mr. Nava made ""The Confessions of Amans"" in Spain on a budget of about $20,000, including a grant from the American Film Institute. Like all successful film makers, Mr. Nava apparently has an artistic sensibility matched by an ability to promote himself and get things done.""The Confessions of Amans"" is a beautiful, muted film of the kind that takes some getting used to. People seldom raise their voices or lose control of themselves. Passion is expressed discreetly in glances or in the holding of hands.I've no idea whether this is the way life was in medieval Spain, but this is the way it seems to have been to us today. We're so far removed that we can't quite make out the feelings, only the looks on the faces, the gestures, the etiquette. Interiors are almost as barren as the lovely, lonely landscapes, as if the people who once inhabited them had died long ago or moved to the city. The movie has the manner of something slowly freezing in time, which is as chilly as death.This, I assume, is exactly the manner Mr. Nava sought. It also explains the curious neo-Bressonian distance from which we observe the story of Amans, a poor young philosophy scholar, and Anne, the young wife of the lord of the castle where Amans is employed as the tutor. Amans and Anne, whose love has no happy end, are parts of the medieval landscape.It's difficult to judge actors in this sort of film, in which every performance appears to be as much the composition of the director as his choice of the color for a costume. The actors are English stage performers who speak the mostly jargon-free dialogue in accents that have no immediate association to any particular time or place.Mr. Nava produced, directed, photographed and edited the movie, and wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Anna Thomas, another U.C.L.A. graduate.",1977-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Fassbinder Sneers at German Affluence,"IN THAT BODY of grisly-comic literature devoted to worms-that-turn, to Mr. Milquetoasts who suddenly sour, to nice family men who quietly take axes to their innocent families, ""Why does Herr R. Run Amok?"" is one of the scariest as well as one of the funniest works of all.The film, which was made in 1969, is an almost perfect example of the early cinema of Rainer Werner Fassbinderthough I suppose the reason it wasn't included in the New Yorker Theater's Fassbinder retrospective last spring and summer is that it's not technically a Fassbinder film. That is, it was codirected by Mr. Fassbinder and Michael Fengler in the days when the members of the Fassbinder theater and film company thought of their work as communal endeavors. This was the first and last time Mr. Fassbinder let that happen. Such communism, fine for ants, is difficult in the arts.In terms of the chronology of the Fassbinder films we've seen here this year, ""Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?"" comes immediately after ""Katzelmacher"" and ""Gods of The Plague"" and just before ""Beware the Holy Whore"" (1970), which was all about the difficulties of making a film on which no one had any real authority. Mr. Fassbinder is not a film maker to let an unhappy experience go to waste.If the making of ""Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?"" with Mr. Fengler was an unhappy experience, it doesn't show in the completed movie, which is as spare, blunt and sardonic as anything that Mr. Fassbinder has ever done by himself. It's also a revealing demonstration of how the style of a Fassbinder film becomes its ubject.The story is simply told: Herr R. (Kurt Raab), a paunchy, mild-mannered fellow, works by day as a draftsman in a small architectural firm. He functions as the master of T-squares, straight-edges and nonleaky pens. At night he is the proper husband to his wife (Lilith Ungerer) and the proper father to young Amadeus (Amadeus Fengler). Together they watch television, plan for the promotion Herr R. hopes to get, and say all the proper things to his boring parents, with whom they talk about television, eating and money.One night while Herr R.'s wife and a neighbor are discussing to the point of exhaustion the subject of ski clothes as Herr R. is trying to watch television, he gets up from his chair and methodically sets about expressing his irritation, using a large blunt instrument.Why does Herr R. run amok? He is bored, but because he has no safety valve of impatience, he explodes. Similarly bored is the camera that observes Herr R.'s life and times.The camera has a habit of more or less settling downas if it were someone vastly overweight filling up a chair. It watches what goes on with no special interest, but it hasn't the strength to move. The camera often can't be bothered to turn to focus on a person who's talking off-screen, knowing that if it waits long enough someone within its range will talk.As Herr R.'s work is completely absorbed by petty details that seem to have no importance in themselves, so is the film composed of a series of small scenes of crushing banality. Much of the dialogue sounds improvised, and like a lot of improvisation, it sometimes is unexpectedly funny and sometimes goes on too long, which is also an aspect of Herr R.'s existence.In addition to Mr. Raab, who is grossly appealing in the title role, the cast includes such other Fassbinder regulars as Hanna Schygulla (in a tiny but funny role), and Lilo Pempeit (the mother of Effi Briest) as one of Herr R.'s office associates, a gray, spinsterish-looking woman who giggles a lot.""Why Does Herr R. Run Amok?"" is short, bitter film. It's full of sneers for the same German affluence that has made Mr. Fassbinder's extraordinary film career possible, but that's the way with many artists these days. They must bite the hands as long as they feed them.",1977-11-18T05:00:00+0000

us,"'Summerdog,' a Movie Without Bark or Bite","Don't bring your children to see ""Summerdog"" unless you either own a hound or are prepared to pick one up on the way home. This is yet another shaggy-dog movie with a plot that hinges on the physical, moral and intellectual superiority of the family pet. Hobo, the dog of the title, isn't Lassie by a long shot, nor is he even Benji. But he is so much smarter and more appealing than either his owners or their enemies that the film amounts to one long advertisement for canine companionship.Mom (Elizabeth Eisenman), Dad (James Congdon) and their two perfect blond children (Oliver and Tavia Zabriskie) live in an unspecified city that incorporates both a small-town air and large chunks of Central Park, but they have decided to spend their summer vacation in the country. They rent a sweet little cottage, and Dad tries to write there, ""I'm afraid the words aren't flowing too well today,"" he complains at one point.Mom grows radishes. Dad: ""It's hard to believe they were just little tiny dried-up seeds a couple of weeks ago."" Mom: ""It's kind of magical, isn't it?""And the kids find Hobo, whose paw has gotten caught in a bear trap set by Old Caleb, a grizzled neighbor. ""Do you think Caleb Grimes is really a bad person or just someone who can't cope with today's world?"" Mom inquires.Everyone falls in love with Hobo, but the family can't bring him home: The landlord won't allow pets, and they simply can't afford to move. After a lot of fuss and intrigue, the problem is solved, and a song praising Hobo is sung. Needless to say, he gets to stay.""Summerdog"" is so unimaginatively made, and so full of noisily exaggerated acting of the ""More Parks Sausages, Mom!"" school, that it should be of only slight interest to older children and of no interest to adultsunless they can keep busy with puzzling out the plot's fine points, like the matter of how a family too strapped to move can magically rent a summer house without subletting their treasured apartment.However, there are a few isolated scenes here that a preview audience of small children found screamingly funny. One such episode involved a dozen people chasing madly down a circular staircase, with Hobo at the fore. Another featured a mouse, who appeared in the summer house and gave Mom a good scare.",1977-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,`Semi-Tough' Film Winson Field Goals,"""Semi-Tough,"" Dan Jenkins's best-selling comic novel about big-league professional football, has been slimmed down, beefed up and reworked to make a funny film that is as much satire as parody, as much about our time as it is about some of our more bizarre culture heroes.The movie, which opened yesterday at the Criterion and Baronet Theaters, takes us on a sort of ""Through the Looking Glass"" journey into the Sunday afternoon television screen and beyond, into the lives of Billy Clyde Puckett (Burt Reynolds) and Shake Tiller (Kris Kristofferson), prostars whose names are part of the film's comic method, and Barbara Jane Book-man (Jill Clayburgh), the pretty but failure-prone daughter of the owner of their ball club. Barbara Jane shares a platonic friendship with the two players as well as their Miami Beach penthouse apartment, a gaudy nest that looks as if it had been decorated by the people who did our Ziegfeld Theater.Other ""characters"" who move in and out of the film are Big Ed Bookman (Robert Preston). Barbara Jane's father, a hot-tempered tycoon with a fondness for patriotic songs (Gene Autry records); Friedrich Bismark (Bert Convy), the hustling head of a terrifically successful ""energy training"" course called BEAT, and Clara Pelf (Lotte Lenya), a ferocious chiropractor who calls what she does ""pelfing.""Walter Bernstein, who wrote the screenplay, and Michael Ritchie, the director, haven't been successful in giving dramatic structure to the episodic novel, but they do succeed in restraining a terrible tendency toward cuteness, not an easy thing to do in a comedy in which all men are recognized as just over-grown boys.With this film Mr. Ritchie (""The Bad News Bears,"" ""Smile,"" ""Downhill Racer"") reinforces his reputation as one of those rare directors who is able to look at Middle America critically without being especially outraged or even surprised.Mostly he is amused, not as someone who sets himself apart from the scene, but as a man who recognizes his own place in it. He may wish it were other than it is, but he doesn't rage that it isn't. He's a humanist fascinated by the manners and mores of a society in which everything, from food to mental health, has been merchandized for the take-out trade.""Semi-Tough"" is not a movie that forces a lot of plot on you. It's under way for some time before you begin to grasp what is meant to be the storythe thing that is supposed to pull you along. This is about the rivalry that suddenly springs up between the self-assured Billy Clyde, a role that effectively uses Mr. Reynolds's television talk show personality, and Shake Tiller, a fellow who is a pared-down, very hesitant version of Mr. Kristofferson's identity as a musician-singer. At the center of the quarrel is Barbara Jane.If the film's various sketch-pieces were not so funny, ""Semi-Tough"" would not have any story at all. As it is, we go along with it for the three leading players, who are good company, and for the wit that, though random, is consistent. For a film about football, ""Semi-Tough"" spends comparatively little time on the field and makes no serious attempt to trap our interest in questions about winning or losing.Winning or losing is not the concern of the film, which knows that there are always new seasons to improve old records. The film isn't even too concerned about whether Barbara Jane marries Billy Joe or Shake Tiller. Its interest is in the overall scenein the shambles of her wedding ceremonies, a very nice sequence that begins as we overhear the minister and Friedrich Bismark, the mental-health tycoon, standing at the altar solemnly discussing tax shelters.Miss Clayburgh, who's been asked to play zany heroines in ""Gable and Lombard"" and ""The Silver Streak"" by people who failed to provide her with material, has much better luck this time. She's charming.""Semi-Tough"" pokes fun in rambling fashion, but it is vulgar in intelligent ways and almost always amusing in its perceptions of befuddled people who are perfectly healthy but often convinced they're not.",1977-11-19T05:00:00+0000

us,'Iphigenia' Too Unspartan as a Film,"Because Euripides (480-406 B.C.) was Greek and Michael Cacoyannis (1922- ) is Greek, there is a tendency to applaud Mr. Cacoyannis's thoroughly ponderous attempts to make the ancient Euripidean tragedies comprehensible to contemporary movie audiences. We are asked to believe that the playwright and the film maker share some sort of deep cultural bond, as if they'd been in the same class at Athens High. Good old Mike and Rip  the Mutt and Jeff of the Acropolis.The bond may well be there, but it isn't apparent in the films Mr. Cacoyannis has made to date  ""Electra"" (1962), ""The Trojan Women"" (1971), which was a big-budget production with an international cast that spoke various kinds of English, and now ""Iphigenia,"" a Greek-language version of the last Euripides tragedy, ""Iphigenia in Aulis.""Like ""The Trojan Women,"" ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" is a bitter reflection on the war that Athens had been waging against Sparta since 431 B.C., and that Athens would lose in 404 B.C. with the complete destruction of her defenses. When it was written in 407 B.C., ""Iphigenia"" was a topical play in which the playwright substituted Troy for Sparta. Even though Euripides was then in exile, he wasn't foolish enough to believe that such an attack on state policy would get very far if staged frontally.""Iphigenia"" is not a conventional tragedy. There are no easily recognized heroes in the way Euripides dramatized the story of the Trojan War. As Euripides tells it, Agamemnon, the leader of the Greek forces waiting to sail against Troy, agrees to sacrifice his eldest daughter, Iphigenia, to please the gods and insure victory. To this end, he has Iphigenia come to the camp in Aulis on the pretext that she's going to marry Achilles. Instead, she is to die, a bit of flimflammery that outrages Clytemnestra, not because she cares about her daughter that much but because she fears how much she will suffer the loss of a daughter.There's not a truly noble person in the entire play, not even the doomed Iphigenia who, though she goes bravely to her death, goes as a deluded child for all the wrong reasons.Euripides's method in ""Iphigenia"" is oblique  nobody ever means everything that is said. This undercurrent of furious irony is something that is completely lost in Mr. Cacoyannis's ""Iphigenia,"" whose characters have been so simplified as to become tragic stereotypes. It's not that the text has been tampered with but the manner in which it's played and set.Irene Papas, with her magnificent profile intact and her eyebrows in full bloom, plays Clytemnestra as if she were Mother Earth and not the complicated, selfish, conniving bitch she should be. Miss Papas's Clytemnestra asks for sympathy, as does the Agamemnon of Costa Kazakos, though he also manages to convince us of the contradictory desires that have been his undoing. Iphigenia is played by Tatiana Papamoskou, a tall, skinny, doe-eyed 12-year-old who looks as if she might grow up to be a terrific Dior model, which has nothing to do with ancient Greece or Euripides.In ""Iphigenia,"" as in ""The Trojan Women,"" Mr. Cacoyannis employs all sorts of comparatively snappy film techniquesthe handheld camera, the zoom lens, and the subjective camera by which we look out through the eyes of the characterto make us believe that we are there. It never works and can't work. We're not meant to get inside these characters, but to stand aside and observe the spectacle as a single, headlong ritual.Mr. Cacoyannis's fondness for photographing these densely packed, poetic melodramas in scenic, real-life landscapes distracts from the text and demolishes the actors, whose grandly theatrical mannerisms look silly in sets as big as all outdoors. People in the movie tend to run in a half-crouch, the way a stage actor runs when he wants to indicate a sprint even though he's covering no more than 10 feet of stage space.The film is not without its own paradox: The best thing in it is all wrong. This is a pre-credit sequence in which we are shown the state and condition of the Greek forces in Aulis as they await orders to sail to Troy. We see their boredom as they lie about the beaches, their ships idle, their rations low, their anger accumulating. The sequence has a lazy, eerie kind of beauty, but it should be the preface for a big, overblown historical pageant like ""The Fall of the Roman Empire,"" not ""Iphigenia,"" which has no need of anything more than its action and the extraordinary text.",1977-11-21T05:00:00+0000

But in the National Football League it's the most yards a running back ever has gained in one game. To appreciate what Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears accomplished last Sunday, think of it in terms of 1 yard at a time. Only a running back understands that perspective. Running 8 yards might not seem like much, Larry Csonka of the Giants once said, until you put 11 defensive players in the 8 yards. Against the 11 defensive players of the Minnesota Vikings in a tough 107 game, Walter Payton ran for 275 yards. And today he will be on display in a nationally televised game from Detroit, where O. J. Simpson galloped 273 yards last Thanksgiving Day for the record until Walter Payton put the Chicago Bears back on the map. Through more than half a century, other Bear running backs were the mapmakres, notably the Hall of Fame four Red Grange, Bronko Nagurski, George McAfee and Gale Sayers, the most running backs in the Canton, Ohio, shrine from any one team.

us,Film: 'Another Man' Falters,"SHE (GENEVIEVE BUJOLD) is a French baker's daughter who leaves her battered homeland at the end of the Franco-Prussian war and travels by sea to America, where she and her husband, a photographer, board a wagon train and head for the Old West. En route, a Polish woman prophesies that she will be widowed and never see France again. Both things turn out to be true.And he (James Caan), he is a veterinarian. One day, he returns home and, after greeting his dogs and cattle, discovers that his pretty young wife has been raped and murdered. He is heart-broken for a few years, but gradually he begins to recover. This is most fortunate, since he and she are by now living in the same frontier town, and fate is ready to throw them together. At the very end of Claude Lelouch's ""Another Man, Another Chance,"" they fall in love.The plot sounds like vintage James Michener, give or take a couple of generations, and indeed it has the makings of a good yarn. However, Mr. Lelouch proves to be less interested in telling his story than in tippy-toeing around its edges. There is abundant cross-cutting, between images as disparate as the veterinarian's giving a local schoolteacher a friendly squeeze and a breadline in wartime France.There are filters so yellowy that the sky turns green. Most maddeningly of all, there is incessant hand-held camerawork in sequences that don't warrant it: One of Mr. Lelouch's favorite tricks is to track the camera for a while, hold it only half-still as a conversation takes place, and then track some more. The viewer is likely to feel seasick long before Miss Bujold makes her ocean voyage.It would be unfair to accuse Mr. Lelouch of pretentiousness, since more often than not one is bound to be uncertain about just what he is pretending to do. The opening bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, for instance, punctuate many scenes for no apparent reason. ""If I can't joke about death, what can I joke about?"" asks one rather bewildering character. And the film begins with a modern-day sequence in which Mr. Caan, playing one of his own descendants, is hired to photograph an ad man's vision of what the Old West must have been like.This involves a Cadillac, four horses and several women in pioneer garb, and Mr. Caan complains that it's silly. More to the point, the whole sequence is silly, especially since neither the photographer nor the present is referred to again.By the second half of the film, though, Mr. Lelouch has either cleaned up his act or lost his power to annoy. The story begins to take flight when Miss Bujold and Mr. Caan finally meet, and the rest of it is told in a reasonably straightforward manner.The performances are helpful even when Mr. Lelouch is not. The film is so poorly and inconsistently dubbed into English that the actors often seem to be shouting from across a large, empty room, but Miss Bujold nevertheless creates a feeling of intimacy. Her peculiarly childlike prettiness becomes ever more interesting as time gives her an incongruously haggard look.Mr. Caan has had few roles that show him off to proper advantage, accentuating his playfulness and physicality. Here, he struts about manfully and says things like ""Over my dead bodyyou got it?"" But he also radiates an easy charm, and his ruggedness helps keep Mr. Lelouch's sepia-toned tableaux from turning to utter mush.Jennifer Warren and Francis Huster are quite memorable as the ill-fated first spouses; so is Susan Tyrrell, in a less successful way. Miss Tyrrell is Mr. Lelouch's rather bizarre choice for the role of the good-natured schoolmarm with whom Miss Bujold leaves her daughter and Mr. Caan his son. Even in her most innocuous moods, Miss Tyrrell never quite seems like the sort of person with whom one ought to park small children.""Another Man, Another Chance"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It contains a nasty rape scene, though not a graphic one, and another sequence that makes childbearing look like the scariest thing in the world.",1977-11-24T05:00:00+0000

Haggin's Ballet Chronicle in 1970, one might think that Arlene Croce had by herselPinvented the passionately alert, exciting and usefully learned kind of dance observation collected in this book of pieces dating back to 1966 fr.om The New Yorker and other magazines. In fact, she doesn't owe much to either of her worthy predecessors. For while she lacks Denby's sensitivity to the mythological elements in dance movement or ballet libretto, she is far more willing that he to clear away the junk that keeps good things from taking root; and while she doesn't know as much about music as Haggin does, she isn't as inflexible as he in her estimations of dancers or as euphorically vague and repetitious about those she adThe reason she could have gotten along without these other critics is that she learned, as did they, from studying the greatest of choreographerincritics, George Balanchine of the New York City Ballet. From watching him she learned how much could get expressed through his dynamic adaptations of classical style, its capacities to comment on rather than merely mimic the music, its intricate crossinreferences and visual punnings that nonetheless support the large onward thrust of the whole work. I can't be sure that somewhere in the world there isn't a critic as good as Croce, but I would be willing to guess that there isn't, if only because her degree of critical intelligence can only have been developed and sharpened where a choreographer of genius like Balanchine is himself actively exercising the critical function. Everything he creates is in some sense a reinterpretation of the vocabulary of classical dance, its potentialities with respect to a piece of music and to the endowments of a particular dancer.",1977-11-27T05:00:00+0000

The background is burgundy and Jimmy Hoffa's left arm is laid across his knee, with a bit of French cuff flashing. This must be Hoffa as he wanted to be seen: not the union despot or buddy of racketeers, but the labor statesman straight out of the old whisky ads for the man of distinction. Only when Bob Lins, the incumbent president of Local 299 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, strolls across the platform to switch on the light above the painting do you notice the mockery in Hoffa's smile. In that great union hall in the sky, he must be enjoying himself as he peers down on his old local, which in the year A.D. 2after his presumed death at the hands of his old Mafia alliesnow teeters on the brink of rankinandinfile rebellion. It could never have happened when Hot fa was in power, for he would have snuffed it out. And it could never have gone very far had he lived, for the restoration that he restlessly plotted after his release from a Federal prison was to have started with the recapture of 299. But now, with Hoffa's elimination, the local faces the first real election it has known in the four decades since he established his dominance and started to reach for control over the nation's largest union. The strangest part of his ambiguous legacy is that Hoffa is now more obviously the patron saint of the rebellion than of the union hierarchy it challenges, for the first stirrings in Local 299 came only after he'd broken with his successor, Frank Fitzsimmonsthe disloyal vassal whom he'd lifted from 299 to leadership in Washington.",1977-11-27T05:00:00+0000

He was son of the Duc d'Orleans, Philippe EgalitO, who threw in his lot with the Revolution and ended under the guillotine. LouisPhilippe got out of Franc'e in time to save his own life and traveled extensively in Europe and America, trying to live as anonymously as possible, waiting for Time to do its work with the Revolution. He was know exile many times and, indeed, to die in it after being toppled from his throne by the Revolution 1848. But he had his successes and his fame.

What happens there at collection times, such as last month's pret a porter showings for spring and summer 78, sends tremors and telegrams of news to the rest of the interested world. Actually, there are groups of equally creative designers in New York, Milan and, sometimes, in London, and most of them are on the same wavelength. But that magic name of Paris cryStallizes the fashion of the moment and gives it the stamp of approval. What Paris designers are now advocating with their usual panache and unique flair is what designers in Milan and New York are also saying: The clothes for 1 978 should celebrate the body that's underneath them. The fabrics are light, semiinopaque or sheer  even if they're wool or knit; the silhouettes are loose, caught in somewhere with a sash or belt, but moving on the body in an unfettered way. Last month, as one Paris collection after another rolled by, the sight, or sense, of breasts beneath these clothes became so commonplace it ceased to be the sensation it might have been a season ago. In fact, it was often obvious that the models had nothing on under these new clothes and, while this did stir some special appreciation, it did not seem offensive or vulgar  just natural and in the character of today's fashion which is attractive and wholesomely sexy. What is significant is that this freed body fashion is evident in the clothes of all designers  from the avantingardists to the established, worldinknown design names such as Dior, Givenchy and Ungaro. Each does it in his own way, but there is no question about the direction they are all taking. But what does this mean to us  the real women of the world who are not endowed with the gorgeous bodies of fashion models, and who have occasional lumps and bumps in the wrong places? What the new fashion is saying is Take a whole new look at yourself. Celebrate your body and do away with anything that stiffly confines it. Here are highlights from the collections of some of Paris's most important designers, each of whom took an individual approach toward celebrating and enhancing  the freedom of the body.",1977-11-27T05:00:00+0000

Why is this so? The tragic but unavoidable conclusion is that the Russian people, as a whole, prefer a dictatorship, with all of its abuses, to the anarchy they fear would follow the establishment of democratic institutions.
