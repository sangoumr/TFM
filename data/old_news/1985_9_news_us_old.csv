ROGER STONE ON BELLAMY: BOLD, BUT COSTLY RISKS","IN February, when City Council President Carol Bellamy and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr. announced that they would challenge Mayor Koch, who is seeking re-election to a third term, The Week in Review asked three Republican political strategists to outline what tactics they would use if they were managing the campaigns. Last week, with campaign for the Sept. 10 Democratic primary entering its final days, Alan Finder, an editor of The Review, asked the same three consultants to review the race. Roger J. Stone Jr. is a political consultant who was in charge of New York and 13 other Northeastern states for the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 and 1984; among his clients this year is Governor Kean of New Jersey, who is running for re-election. Richard J. Behn is president of Numbercrunchers Inc., a political consulting company, and was communications director for Lewis E. Lehrman's 1982 New York gubernatorial campaign. Robert Price, the president of Price Communications Corporation, was Deputy Mayor under John V. Lindsay. Excerpts follow. From the beginning Carol Bellamy has needed a two-person race. There were two possibilities to provide that. One was if she could get Ed Koch into a runoff. That has now been eliminated as a possibility by the courts. The other was to see if Denny Farrell could be eliminated from the ballot. In my view attempting to eliminate him was a reasonable political risk to take, and I think she was bold and correct in taking it.",1985-09-01T05:00:00+0000

Lessons abound for 20th-century warriors in this instructive study of the personal and military conduct of the enlisted men in the Union Army in the middle of the 19th century. Joseph T. Glatthaar, who teaches history at the Command and General Staff College's Combat Studies Institute in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., assembles the story of Gen. William T. Sherman's troops in their own words as they drove through Georgia and South Carolina and destroyed the Confederacy. Some of the main lessons are from Sherman himself: war is total and death-defying, an enemy's industry and property should not be spared, forget chivalrous conduct toward civilians. But the major lesson to be gained from the book concerns what integrates a soldier into a fighting unit. According to the quotations here from diaries and letters, the answer is not saluting but experience, mutual respect and camaraderie with officers. ''At first glance,'' the author writes, ''the men looked more like a mob than an army. They were an unkempt, boisterous, seemingly unruly lot, in no way resembling the stereotypical professional army. But Sherman's men took pride in their ability to endure all hardships and still achieve in battle.'' Officers and soldiers fraternized; generals were called by their first names. Mr. Glatthaar also covers whites' attitudes toward blacks in Union blue (they were generally admired but there were pockets of prejudice); the wartime election (the soldiers were overwhelmingly for President Lincoln); the destruction in the South (unsparing).",1985-09-01T05:00:00+0000

The author unhesitantly defines such idealism as treason - not pure and simple, perhaps, but shameful all the same. To read that lesson in ''The Red Fox'' is a refreshing experience, given the proliferation of books and films - for example, Robert Littell's novel ''The Amateur'' or ''The Jigsaw Man,'' starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine - where the fact is in various ways obfuscated. Stripped to its essentials, the argument of such works goes that some British lord or American intellectual was disappointed with democracy (or even with some Government agency), saw the light from Moscow and acted for the enemy in good faith - therefore he can and should be exonerated.",1985-09-01T05:00:00+0000

''The Day of Trinity'' recounts the work of scientists at the Government's laboratories in Los Alamos, N.M., which culminated in the explosion in the desert of the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945. In 1965 our reviewer, William L. Laurence, who witnessed the blast, termed this book ''a remarkable achievement . . . authentic history providing facts, never told before.'' And he added, ''The author fills in the background that gives the occasion its meaning and significance.'' Two new chapters describe the scientists' subsequent lives and the state of nuclear science today. THE OLD BUNCH, by Meyer Levin. (Citadel, $14.95.) A 964-page composite story of 19 Chicago youths - 11 boys and 8 girls - from the same neighborhood. ''The Old Bunch'' follows them from their high school graduation in 1921 to the mid-1930's. In 1937 in these pages Harold Strauss called the book ''a landmark in the development of the realistic novel'' that ''brilliantly succeeds in taking the reader on a memorable tour of the world in which the old bunch lived.'' Levin later became well known for his novel ''Compulsion.'' THE ECONOMICS AND POLITICS OF RACE: An International Perspective, by Thomas Sowell. (Quill, $6.95.) Thomas Sowell tries to answer the question ''Why have some American minorities climbed the ladder of economic success more readily than others?''

The show boasted a cast of 50, costumes by the score and the staggering sets of Boris Aronson.

They fall with eyes open, knowing full well that the man in question might be inappropriate - married or too self-involved ever to commit totally. Such women think they should know better.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CRAMPTON HODNET. By Barbara Pym. (Dutton, $14.95.) The self-deluding, smug clergyman. The intelligent woman pondering spinsterhood. The imperious grande dame. The high-minded student and her married suitor, well into his midlife crisis. These and other characters familiar from Barbara Pym's later books assemble for the first time in this early work (1939-40), now published posthumously. As is ever the case in a Pym novel, the scope of the action is constricted but made compelling by understatement, an underlying sense of compassion and a precision of language through which mundane vocabulary is elevated into art. Crampton Hodnet is the name of a parish invented by the clergyman as an unnecessary alibi for an innocent walk in the woods, and it comes to signify all the imaginary excuses and rationalizations by which the book's inhabitants live. They watch themselves and each other closely, alert for any lapse of North Oxford decorum, and together preserve a world of interchangeable parts where no one is indispensable and equilibrium is maintained above all else. The novel is framed with three flirtations - two improbable, one predictable and all ultimately transitory. ''Falling in love is never ordinary to the people who indulge in it,'' a woman says, settling into her unmarried state. But passion implies a risk of uncertainty and is unstable; no character is capable of extricating him or herself sufficiently from past comforts or habits to indulge in passion for long. In pre-World War II academic Britannia, convention rules.",1985-09-01T05:00:00+0000

The second path depends on a highly trained work force that's vitally committed. That's the choice. The first path would involve cutting labor costs. For managers this path means undertaking (or threatening) massive layoffs; using bankruptcy to annul costly wage contracts; moving (or threatening to move) to lower-wage states and countries; sending work out to lower-cost subcontractors; and automating to reduce skill levels. For workers it means defending existing jobs and pay scales; grudgingly conceding lower wages, benefits and cost-of-living allowances; shifting burdens by accepting lower pay scales for junior workers; and occasionally striking.",1985-09-01T05:00:00+0000

The United States position has been that no one knew the plane was veering off course and therefore no warning could have been considered.

For years, sociologists have noted an undercurrent of worker discontent in this country. In 1973, a special Presidential task force on ''Work in America'' concluded that ''significant numbers of Americans are dissatisfied with their working lives.'' Later, Studs Terkel's best seller ''Working'' reached the same conclusions through hundreds of interviews with people in all walks of life.",1985-09-04T05:00:00+0000

The individuals, a description of their activities and the actions recommended by Mr. Bell and approved by Hutton are these: Thomas P. Lynch, vice chairman, chief financial officer and corporate secretary, will relinquish all corporate titles and responsibilities. He will remain as a director of Hutton's board. Mr. Lynch was cited in the Bell report for failing to impose adequate financial controls. Thomas W. Rae, general counsel, was cited because his department failed to fully comply with the Justice Department's subpoena of Hutton documents. But he was ''not involved in the activities that gave rise to the plea,'' the Bell report said. The legal department will be reorganized within 90 days. Mr. Rae plans to retire by the end of the year. Thomas Morley, senior vice president and money manager, has resigned from Hutton. A key player in coordinating Hutton's overdrafting activities, he was not criminally implicated but was cited for irresponsible management of Hutton's money operations. Norman M. Epstein, executive vice president, was responsible for internal auditing controls, which, Mr. Bell asserts, were lacking in regard to Hutton overdrafting practices.",1985-09-06T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"CHIN MUSIC. By James McManus. (Crown, $14.95.) In his second novel James McManus plays dark games with a sports metaphor. ''Chin Music'' involves the last hours of Chicago and Gamma Ray Zajak, a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, who wakes up in the hospital with amnesia and a monstrous headache, with the nuclear holocaust close at hand. Known for throwing at batters' heads - playing ''chin music,'' as it were -Gamma Ray has himself been laid up by a lethal fast ball to the cranium. Gradually he learns who he is and the novel follows him home through streets where murder, suicide, ground zero interviews for television and all manner of doomsday madness is transpiring. At one point Gamma Ray stumbles into a nightclub where sex and death abound and a handcuffed cheerleader is being punished for the patrons' enjoyment. Mr. McManus toys with images meant to shock - splattered brains, a dismembered body, eroticized suicide -shows some obliquely, shuffles others as though in a deck of cards and then flips them at the reader. He is clearly a talented writer, but his experiment seems naked and calls too much attention to itself. It may be ''that a syntactical series can swoop and leap like a mother and still retain deep intact structure,'' as he writes. But swooping to what end? ''Out of the Blue,'' Mr. McManus's first novel, about kidnappers who steal the wrong child, was more conventional. Composed of spare, snapshotlike segments, it was occasionally like trying to watch a banquet through a keyhole, but a vital tension kept it coherent.",1985-09-08T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A TRAVELLER'S ROOM. By Elspeth Davie. (Hamish Hamilton/David & Charles, $15.95.) ''Where does it come from?'' demands a character in one of the 19 stories in this collection, ''the idea of order - this unknown, perfect state of things that makes us feel askew. Can you get some sense of it?'' In studiously measured prose, the Scottish writer Elspeth Davie conveys a sense of the repressive power of that idea of order. Almost all of her plots turn on the characters' feelings of ambivalence about their circumspect lives. In the title story a girl imagines that a mysterious traveler is an exotic explorer, only to meet the drab man and discover ''how all adventures can be flattened at one blow, how heroes are simply tired men.'' Several stories suggest that women are particularly likely to be trapped in flat, stiff lives; yet in the end Miss Davie often liberates them. ''It would do you good to let the whole house go crooked for a change,'' one woman is advised and, goaded by thoughts of her gallivanting suitor, she abandons her orderly ways. In ''The Return'' a wife with odd, emerald-green streaks in her hair also deserts a cramped life; she disappears back to her home in the sea. Green hair grows in one other overtly fantastic story, ''Green Head,'' in which a young man sprouts flowers from his scalp. Here the idea of order, gleaned from the known, imperfect state of nature, is robust rather than repressive: ''He was lucky, he realized, to have a rooted season of steady flowering and steady withering.''",1985-09-08T05:00:00+0000

The study, based on a survey of 644 basketball players from 47 schools and 37 athletic conferences, was conducted in 1983 and 1984 by Allen L. Sack, chairman of the Department of Sociology at the University of New Haven, and Robert Theil, a statistician from Southern Connecticut State.

Derry Moore, who took the evocative photographs, and Michael Pick, who emphasizes English history, designers and architects in his witty text, include two cozy country cottages, a swatch of town houses and a London flat in this visual essay on Englishness at home. But the dramatics, and the fantasy, are left to estates with names like Kedleston Hall (the Derby house of Viscount Scarsdale), about whose massy interior marble pillars Dr. Johnson complained: ''They take up too much room.'' Many of these dwellings, like enormous old oaks, are rooted in England's past, and there is often a melancholy about them that no amount of polishing can remove. Glass cases of curiosities - the collectibles of the outer world brought home by its ''civilizers'' - line the brocade walls of some rooms. In others, ranks of mounted heads stare toward extinction in a decorative fashion that to Evelyn Waugh owed ''more to the taxidermist than the sculptor or painter.'' Mr. Pick parses English style into individuality, eccentricity, love of light and craving for warmth. At Clouds Hill, T. E.

As director, writer and sometimes actor, he had made 43 films in a career that spanned a mere 13 years. He had won international acclaim with productions such as ''The Marriage of Maria Braun,'' ''Despair'' and ''Veronika Voss.'' What is likely to survive as his masterwork, the one most monumentally encompassing his peculiar methods and fierce obsessions, is ''Berlin Alexanderplatz.'' Like much of Fassbinder's work since the early 1970's, this 15 1/2-hour epic was made for television, providing still another convincing example that the medium needn't confine itself exclusively to harmless entertainments and carefully ''balanced'' documentaries.

When Tom Seaver won his 300th baseball game recently, the sportscasters questioned him at length about the symbolic (in baseball) meaning of the number 300, but little fuss was made over his age - 40. Stanley Brandes, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes we are so in thrall of the number 40 that we expect and often create a crisis at this time of life. Assuming the so-called midlife crisis to be a fact, Mr. Brandes goes on to explain why it exists and to examine its legitimate and illegitimate foundations in biology, history and mythology. He discusses and dismisses most of the biological evidence for midlife crises, cites interesting and contradictory historical evidence from Dante to Montaigne to Erik Erikson, and catalogues at length the symbolic uses of the number from the 40 days of the Flood to the 40 days Jesus spent in the desert to ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.'' The examples, whose meanings often seem at odds with one another, indicate that 40 has been and is seen as a turning point. But in some examples, 40 is the age when wisdom begins or when rebirth takes place; in others, it is the age when one's usefulness ends or when death takes hold. Mr. Brandes concludes that a life transition at 40 is a ''collective fantasy'' that is the ''combined product of . . . cultural, social, and economic circumstances.''",1985-09-08T05:00:00+0000

Le Corbusier, Wright, Neutra and Mendelsohn are good architects, but their reputations are surely enhanced by their voluminous publications.'' A century before that, the American architect Andrew Jackson Downing had been less sanguine about the literary talent of his colleagues but no less certain about the role of the architect in shaping society's views of the art. ''While a general ignorance on the subject of architecture among us must be admitted,'' he said, ''this very innocence is mainly owing to the dry and barren manner in which architects have usually written on the real meaning or philosophy of their art.

us,HERS,"TOLSTOY'S departure from home was certainly a flurried one. If a man of means, who is also a genius, who is also in his 80's, cannot leave in broad daylight then we know we are in a dangerous predicament. Leaving home is always a mess, regardless of whether it be husband, wife, lover, friend, child or cleaner. Whether it is done precipitously or with what is laughingly called ''deliberation,'' the moment is never right and the person who is left is rarely able to stomach the need for flight.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"RETURN TO REGION. By Juan Benet. Translated by Gregory Rabassa. (Columbia University Press, $18.95.) ''Return to Region'' is a brilliant novel by one of Spain's major writers. The Region of the title is mythical and unforgettable. One imagines it in northern Spain, in the Pyrenees, a desolate, mysterious and sparsely populated place. Above it looms El Monje, a peak in the shape of a death mask; those who cross Region's river and climb into the mountains never return. There is a church called El Salvador (the Saviour) and a hotel-brothel run by an old woman named Muerte (Death). If Region is not hell, it is one of the circles on the road to hell. Old Dr. Sebastian lives in a wreck of a house, unattended but not alone. Upstairs, behind a padlocked door, sleeps his retarded godson, heavily sedated by the doctor who has an unwanted visitor, a woman who has just returned to Region, some 20 years after the end of the civil war, in the middle of Franco's long reign. The doctor and the woman exchange haunting stories of their lives in which characters appear who are common to both, and who merge, separate, become one again. The doctor has been blighted in love; the woman has had many lovers (the first a German volunteer to the Republic's cause during the Civil War), and has passed part of her time in Muerte's brothel. Underlying their respective tales is the Spanish Civil War, its fratricidal cruelties, its tragedies; their stories are haunted by fear, weighed down by guilt and impotence.",1985-09-15T05:00:00+0000

In part, this is because political postures change and opponents and proponents, loosely speaking, change positions. In the 1970's, liberal Democrats seemed ready to discard the Fairness Doctrine; political vagaries now make them its defenders. Over the years, meanwhile, the doctrine has been used, and abused, by all sides. At the moment, the Federal Comunications Commission, whose child the doctrine is, wants to disown it.

Although Joachim is remembered today for his intimate association with Johannes Brahms, he was also a composer in his own right, with over 14 published works to his credit, including four violin concertos and five concert overtures.

But this is a writer who does not play it safe and so the risks and misses are bound to be there. The pay-off is definitely worth the ride.'' Little, Brown has also reissued the author's novel, THE ANNUNCIATION ($7.95). Its heroine is Amanda McCamey, who grows up on a Mississippi Delta plantation, marries money, rejects it and moves to a university town to work and make new friends. Reviewers praised the book as rich, evocative, intelligent and strikingly original. WHEN AND WHERE I ENTER: The Impact of Black Women on Race and Sex in America, by Paula Giddings. (Bantam, $8.95.) ''When and Where I Enter'' is a history of the dogged determination of black women to survive in America. Last year in The Book Review Gloria Naylor wrote of the author that ''by sorting through a vast amount of primary and secondary material, by reading innumerable novels and conducting exhaustive interviews, she compiled a narrative history of black women from the 17th century to the present, with particular emphasis on the black women's club movement of the 1890's to the 1940's.

As played by the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Paul Gemignani and sung and acted by an illustrious cast of past and present Broadway hands, ''Follies'' filled Avery Fisher Hall with the sound of an audience losing its mind long before Barbara Cook got around to delivering the show's torch song, ''Losing My Mind.''

That was 196 years ago. The soldiers of the King of France, the representative of God on earth, were in the opera house for an evening of revelry. Singing monarchist songs, they trampled the Tricolor, which had already become the symbol of the simmering revolutionary movement. News of the soldiers' sacrilege reached Paris and, two days later, on Oct. 6, 1789, a revolutionary crowd stormed Versailles demanding that the King leave the palace and return to the city. Louis XVI and his much-disliked wife, Marie Antoinette, who appeared on a balcony of the palace to try to appease the revolutionaries' fury, had no choice. They left for Paris that night.

Last week three Boston-area researchers weighed in with one of the gloomiest appraisals to date. In ''The Shopping Mall High School,'' the three, Arthur G. Powell, Eleanor Farrar and David K. Cohen, contend that high schools have lost faith in the value of education. They are like shopping centers, the authors argue, offering ''something for everyone'' and measuring success by volume -the number of diplomas granted. The study, based on visits to 15 public and private high schools in 1981-82, describes teachers who neither require nor expect learning and students who know that they will pass if they simply attend classes. Many teachers, the researchers wrote, ''use student passivity as an excuse to cover up their own passivity.''",1985-09-15T05:00:00+0000

Korngold was hailed as one of the most prodigious young talents in musical history, right up there with Mozart and Mendelssohn, early in this century. He wrote an opera at age 21 that still survives, if only barely, in the repertory, ''Die Tote Stadt.'' However, he had been generally dismissed in serious circles by the time he wrote this concerto. He went to Hollywood in 1934 and wrote many excellent movie scores, becoming possibly the richest composer in the world before his death in 1957.

Much of it is closed, never to be reopened. 1974 - The Westway project is proposed to create a new West Side Highway and redevelop the West Side corridor. Opponents sue to block it. Hugh L. Carey, after winning the election for Governor, reverses his opposition to the project. 1977 - The State Transportation Department applies to the Army Corps of Engineers for a Hudson River landfill permit. 1978 - Edward I. Koch, after winning election as Mayor, reverses himself and backs the Westway project. 1981 - The Corps of Engineers issues a dredging and landfill permit. President Reagan presents the city with a symbolic $85 million check to buy right of way, declaring that ''the Westway project begins today.'' 1982 - Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court blocks the permit, saying the corps did not adequately consider the effects of the landfill on striped-bass hatcheries in the Hudson River. 1983 - A report commissioned by Governor Cuomo favors abandoning the Westway project and trading in the money for mass-transit funds. The Governor rejects the recommendation. 1984 - The Corps of Engineers holds public hearings on the project and its environmental impact, especially the effects on striped bass. 1985 - The corps issues a new permit, and the matter returns to Judge Griesa.",1985-09-20T05:00:00+0000

us,GOING OUT GUIDE,"Friday PLENTY MORE HARE David Hare, the British playwright who won acclaim with ''Plenty'' a while back, has a new play starting performances at the Public Theater this weekend. ''A Map of the World,'' which stars Elizabeth McGovern, Zeljko Ivanek, Roshan Seth and Alfre Woodard, is directed by Mr. Hare. Set in Bombay at a Unesco conference on world poverty, the story revolves around the ideological showdown between an Indian novelist and an English journalist, with a young American actress caught in the middle. Weekend performances are at 8 P.M. on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are $20 and $25. Also at the Public this weekend is an unusual film event, a reconstructed version of Erich von Stroheim's ''Queen Kelly.'' The film, a 1929 epic starring Gloria Swanson, was shut down with nearly two-thirds of its script still to be shot when Miss Swanson declared the director a ''madman'' and demanded that Joseph Kennedy, the producer, remove him. This reconstruction used the original shooting script to realize, as closely as possible, the director's intended vision. Showings are today, Saturday and Sunday at 4:30, 6:15, 8, and 9:45 P.M. Tickets are $5. Information: 598-7105.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE RED CITY: Limoges and the French Nineteenth Century. By John M. Merriman. (Oxford University, $29.95.) John M. Merriman, a professor of history at Yale University, has written a thorough account of the industrialization of the French city of Limoges. His microscopic lens is a mixed blessing: it illuminates at times, but it also obscures - particularly during the discussions of municipal elections. This flaw is compounded when he assumes an excessive amount of prior knowledge on the part of his readers. All the details, however, bring a wonderful intimacy to this story, beginning with the revolt, in 1830, of the bourgeois businessmen - who rightly saw themselves as the force behind the city's economic growth - against the landholders and clerics who had long dominated Limoges. As a result of their increased power and prosperity, the city's porcelain and shoe manufacturers soon found themselves scrambling, in a volte-face partnership with their erstwhile conservative foes, to stem the radical socialism of an increasing - and increasingly vocal -working class. Mr. Merriman is deft and entertaining in his use of two groups - porcelain makers and butchers - to emphasize the tension between what was and what was to come. Throughout Limoges's transformation from Restoration city to ville rouge, the porcelain manufacturers, and later their workers, formed the vanguard for virtually all social and political progress. The butchers remained defiant and even comical atavists, clinging to their religious rituals in an increasingly secularized climate and resisting every municipal effort to clean up their neighborhood, where among the ''hacked and hanging pieces of meat, the glistening livers and . . . large pools of blood'' could be found ''niches sheltering pretty statues of saints or rich madonnas with azure coats starred with gold, before which burned religious lamps.'' Mr. Merriman is at his best when he brings to life the social and political motivations of the citizens of Limoges.",1985-09-22T05:00:00+0000

After more than a decade of debate, the proposed $2.3 billion highway and development project was officially declared dead last week. Governor Cuomo and Mayor Koch said they would seek to trade in $1.7 billion in Federal highway money for mass-transit improvements and a scaled-down road connecting 42d Street and the Battery. Many officials agreed that a combination of adverse court rulings on environmental issues and growing opposition to Westway in the House of Representatives was the immediate cause of its death. But there was disagreement on why Congressional discontent had mounted and on what the end of Westway signified. Alan Finder, an editor of The Week in Review, asked two Congressional experts last week for their thoughts on the project's demise. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, is New York's senior senator.

This year the Synchronized Briefcase Drill Team - a group of executives and office employees - will be marching again in business attire, along with the Marching Leeches (in appropriate costume) and a group called the Texas Chain-Saw Massacre Drool Team, which carries chain saws with the teeth removed.

The range is from Pittsburgh's Tommy Leach, who played in the first World Series, to Detroit's Hank Greenberg, who led the American League in home runs in three different years. Lawrence S. Ritter's 1966 collection of 26 tape-recorded interviews seemed to our reviewer, Wilfrid Sheed, ''quite simply the best sports book in recent memory. . . . This one tells it right.''

Mr. Oh retired in 1980 after playing for 22 years with the Tokyo Giants and hitting 868 home runs.

Last week the Heisman Trophy winner Charles White -filling in for a still unprepared Eric Dickerson, who reported late for camp following a contract holdout -had his first 100-yard rushing game in five years. He led the Rams to a 17-6 triumph over the Eagles that kept Los Angeles in first place in the N.F.C. West. Countering 440 yards passing and four touchdown passes by Dan Fouts of San Diego, Dave Krieg rallied Seattle from a 23-14 halftime deficit to a 49-35 victory over the Chargers, throwing for 307 yards and equaling his club record of five touchdown passes, four of them to Daryl Turner.

Although there are no singsong refrains like ''hippity hop,'' ''hi ho'' or ''so it goes,'' the narrative voice still has the quality of a verbal shrug - flip, careless and willfully casual (''the people would eat up all the food, gobble, gobble, yum, yum, and it would become nothing but excrement and memories''), and the characters still bear more of a resemblance to cartoon figures than regular human beings.

us,  Le Pistolet Fumant,"As someone certain in 1973 that Watergate would blow over, I now offer France's President, Francois Mitterrand, this list of Ten Ways to Ride Out the Storm. 1. Disabuse yourself of the assumption that ''Watergate cannot happen here.'' For years, we heard Frenchmen say that Richard Nixon's transgressions would rate no more than a shrug in national-security-conscious France. But when venality combined with stupidity hits home, it hits hard, and its impact could dislodge a President in Paris as well as Washington. 2. Remember that, for the chief of state, the cover-up is always worse than the crime. No prior knowledge of the original crime did not help President Nixon, and it will not help you; concern yourself with bringing high-level culprits to justice, lest criminality in protecting them touches you. 3. Stop minimizing the original crime. That only focuses more attention on the cover-up; instead, get furious at the original attack on the Rainbow Warrior. Cut out this ''absurd crime'' nonsense, which smacks of the Nixonian ''third-rate burglary'' misconception. Let others talk cynically of the humiliation of being caught - demonstrate that you understand what is really shameful, and become incensed at the moral blindness of the bomb plotters. 4. Get ready to accurately answer the question ''Who ordered the mission? What did Francois Mitterrand know and when did he know it?'' If you and your closest Government advisers were not involved, be prepared to struggle with the French military, part of which was involved in an act that cannot be sanctioned by the state.",1985-09-26T05:00:00+0000

His Falstaff, not only wittily acted and fully formed, was astonishingly well sung.

Bernard Fontana (Mr. Volonte) is a quiet, somber, reflective television journalist, recently crippled in an accident, who is on location to do an interview with the help of his young assistant, Didier Meylan (Jean-Michel Dupuis). Their subject is Prof. Henri Kremer (Heinz Bennent), an expert on world hunger, whose studies of that problem have brought him to the brink of utter despair.",1985-09-27T05:00:00+0000

His Falstaff, not only wittily acted and fully formed, was astonishingly well sung.

us,The Stage: Lily Tomlin In 'Search for Signs',"IN ''Nashville,'' the Robert Altman film that marked her graduation from television-sketch comedienne to actress, Lily Tomlin was just one of many vivid characters in a throbbing panorama of contemporary American life. To say that this artist has continued to grow in the decade since then is to abridge the story drastically. In Act II of ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe,'' her new show at the Plymouth, we find that Miss Tomlin and her longtime collaborator, the writer and director Jane Wagner, are attempting what might well be considered their own theatrical update to Mr. Altman's epic. They treat the audience to an idiosyncratic, rude, blood-stained comedy about American democracy and its discontents - and, this time around, Miss Tomlin plays all the parts herself.",1985-09-27T05:00:00+0000

The best of the post-Watergate movies in this mode have made a point of underscoring their characters' imperfections, so that their heightened social consciousness stands out in sharper contrast. ''Marie,'' which like ''Silkwood'' and ''Serpico'' and ''Norma Rae'' depicts one person's fight against corporate or institutional injustice, is a fast-paced, well-acted drama that takes a simpler approach.

A battery-operated radio. 5. A backup set of radio batteries guaranteed to last up to six months. (In case of an unusually long hurricane.) 6. A regular-size flashlight and a giant-size flashlight. (The regular size for hunting for lost can openers; the giant size in case we have to go outside - we don't want neighbors to think we can't afford the biggest.) 7. A molded tarpaulin car cover to fit over the automobile. (Guaranteed to keep hurricane-force rains from getting through the crack in the windshield.) 8. Forty feet of tarpaulin-car-cover tie-down rope. (When tied to the car cover and lashed around the car axles, this is guaranteed to keep the tarpaulin car cover from blowing away in winds up to 110 miles per hour.) 9. Brightly colored tarpaulin-car-cover kite tail.

''Adventures in the Alaskan Skin Trade'' refers to nothing outside itself; it sets off, as you read it, none of those anticipations of significance you expect of serious fiction; it lacks the tug of profundity that pulls you through a book and amounts to a promise from the author that behind his story is his real subject and your task as a reader is to crack the narrative code disguising it.

us,"  FROM YOUNG ARTISTS, DEFIANCE BEHIND A SMILING FACADE","Anyone making the rounds of New York galleries in the last two years is likely to have noticed the emergence of something that can be loosely described as a mid-1980's style. It is identified with the East Village. The subject matter it serves is drawn from middle-class life and popular culture. It is characterized by lush, thickly encrusted surfaces and smiling, youthful faces, many of them as sweet and mindless as the faces in soap operas and comic strips. The style is accessible, seductive and hedonistic. Its appearance has generated considerable confusion. Pleasure and fun have never before been an integral part of American art. While American modernists made art that barely even paid lip service to the great American need to be liked, a young East Village artist like Rodney Alan Greenblat not only wants his work to be liked but is brazenly undefensive about it. While modernism remained generally uneasy about relations with commerce and power, for many younger artists in the East Village and SoHo the taboo against careerism has all but disappeared.",1985-09-29T05:00:00+0000

us,THEATER: JASON ROBARDS IN 'THE ICEMAN COMETH',"NOTHING glows when the lights rise on Harry Hope's waterfront gin-mill and flophouse in Jose Quintero's new production of ''The Iceman Cometh.'' What comes dimly into view is a moldering, black-and-brown cave, barely discernible in a smudged gray-green haze. The derelicts who populate Eugene O'Neill's play describe this squalid setting as ''a morgue'' and ''a tomb,'' as ''The End of the Line Cafe'' and ''The Bottom of the Sea Rathskeller.'' As designed by Ben Edwards and lighted by Thomas R. Skelton at the Lunt-Fontanne, Hope's saloon of 1912 looks as ghostly as those bottom-of-the-sea glimpses of the Titanic. But in ''The Iceman Cometh'' the bodies of the inhabitants are still visible - still terrifyingly alive, twitching in the silt. To see O'Neill's bums sprawled comatose across their sooty dive is to know one of the most harrowing images ever produced by the American theater.",1985-09-30T05:00:00+0000
