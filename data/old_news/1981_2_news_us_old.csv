us,Art View; THE CASE OF MADAME'S SHOULDER STRAP,"Sometimes a painting acquires a reputation that is almost more interesting than the artist who painted it. Circumstance conspires to separate the work from the remainder of the artist's oeuvre, surround it with notoriety, and leave it a permanent object of curiosity. Neither significant esthetic merit nor a significant lack of it is in itself sufficient to guarantee a painting this unusual status. What is required is that it connect - or perhaps one should say, collide - with established taste, cause public misunderstanding, and appear to outrage conventional morals while in reality, and certainly in the eyes of posterity, it remains a perfectly respectable and thoroughly benign work of art. What is required, in other words, is for the painting to become an unintended episode in the comedy of culture.",1981-02-01T05:00:00+0000

THE FORMULA'S THE THING ON 'SOAPS'","The scene is set in what appears to be a dank, secluded patch of woodland. Two persons in elegant evening attire emerged from a large, gas-guzzling automobile. The attractive young woman is anxious to get financial support for her oil-rich but cash-poor father. The middleaged man with a British accent will agree if she promises to marry his nephew, whom he describes as ''a Denver version of the Prince of Wales.'' Scheming Fallon Carrington would prefer to marry the ruthless uncle, Cecil Colby (names are often the most creative elements in this type of enterprise), but he is far too sophisticated to be entrapped by a passing affair. ''Passion dies, power remains,'' he tells her. As if that's not enough, he confesses that ''at my age, vengeance is as sweet as sex.'' Poor bitchy Fallon is overwhelmed by such profundities but still manages to agree to marry Cecil's harmless nephew.

us,by William Safire,"Let the Reader Beware A new linguistic form called ''haigravation'' is rearing its head in Washington. It is the tendency of the new Secretary of State to change the state of parts of speech - from noun to adverb, from noun to verb. The new top man at Foggy Bottom, Gen. Alexander Haig, studded his testimony at confirmation hearings with locutions like ''I'll have to caveat my response, Senator,'' and ''I'll caveat that ... .'' ''Caveat,'' as used by generals like Julius Caesar, is the third-person singular present subjunctive of the Latin cavere, to beware. Standing by itself, ''caveat'' in Latin means ''Let him beware''; in English, the word is a noun synonymous with ''warning.'' It is also part of the Latin phrase ''Caveat emptor,'' ''Let the buyer beware,'' the new slogan of the consumer-protection movement. Until now, ''caveat'' has been a noun; in haigravation, it has become a verb. ''I'll caveat that'' means, presumably, ''I'll say that with this warning.'' (I'll caveat the reader that this locution will soon be followed in literary circles with ''I'll asterisk that.'') Not to be outdone, Senator John Glenn asked the witness, ''Will you burdenshare?'' This is a heavy new verb formed from ''burden-sharing,'' diplomatic jargon for ''My taxpayers won't kick in any more until yours do.'' But Glenn is not in Haig's verbifying league. ''Not in the way you contexted it, Senator,'' was a four-star reply about immorality in high places. To context something, in this lingo, is ''to place it in context.''",1981-02-01T05:00:00+0000

Airline stocks benefited from a move by the Civil Aeronautics Board granting the carriers greater flexibility in raising air fares. The C.A.B. cited higher fuel costs resulting from the recent decontrol of domestic crude oil prices. Strength in the airlines accounted for a gain of 3.94 points, to 400,52, in the Dow transportation average. On the active list, American Airlines climbed 1 point, to 11-1/8.

The reasons for clutter, the need to be surrounded by things, goes deep, from security to status. The reasons for banning objects, or living in as selective and austere an enviornment as possible, range from the esthetic to the neurotic. This is a phenomenon of choice that relates as much to the psychiatrist as to the tastemaker.Some people clutter compulsively, and others just as compulsively t hrow things away.

It would also slash its financial support for the new Synthetic Fuels Corporation by about a third, or $5.3 billion, according to an unpublished document drafted by the Office of Management and Budget. The proposal also envisions that the main emphasis of the development corporation be shifted and that private sponsors be required to supply 40 percent, rather than 25 percent, of the cost of plants to be built with the help of the corporation. 'In short, Government would aid demonstration of synfuels capability but not subsidize building significant capacity,' said the working paper, though to have been written by the budget director, David A. Stockman. It said the Government would thus save $9.1 billion through the 1985 fiscal year. It would also reduce possible disruptions in the credit markets, since the Government loan guarantees would not be so large as first planned. Word of the proposals has already brought criticism from Capitol Hill and prompted expressions of dismay from other supporters of synthetic fuels projects. McClure Opposes 'Axiang' Project James A. McClure, the Idaho Republican who heads the Senate Energy Committee, said in a conversation last night that, when he heard that synthetic fuels were to be 'axed out,' he quickly asked that the proposals be reconsidered.

It often helps to use a regular drain cleaner at intervals, but bleach is not real drain cleaner.

Despite the importance of the music written for the Mannheim court orchestra, little of it is actually played today in live concert.

House: $125,000 (1979) System: $5,000 The 2,700-square-foot heavily insulated house is composed of three adjacent woodframe struc tures, ranging from one- to three stories, that step up a rocky hillside. Solar heat is captured by very large, south facing windows and skylights on the steeply pitched roofs. At night, thermal draperies are drawn to prevent heat loss through the doubleglazed glass. (The $5,000 attributed to passive solar features in the house includes the $2,000 cost of thermal draperies.) During sunny winter days, the heavily windowed southern portion of the house collects solar energy, and excess heat is ventilated to the north side of the house. A small wood stove in the kitchen and an oil- fired hot air furnace provide back-up heat. In summer, deciduous trees around the house are in leaf and pro vide shade for the large expanses of windows. In the future, active solar hot air collectors will be placed on the roof to reduce reliance on oil back-up. - Harrison Fraker, Architects, 729 Alexander Road, Princeton, N.J. 08540. (609) 452-8235.

Yet, as it happens, two of the most interesting exhibitions at the moment are devoted to paintings from the 1950's. One is Alex Katz's show at the Robert Miller Gallery. The other is Gene Davis's at the Frank Kolbert Gallery. They offer us very different experiences, of course. Mr. Katz's paintings are figurative - mainly portraits, in fact. Mr. Davis's are abstract. They differ in weight, too. Mr. Katz's paintings are wholly realized, and strike us as representing by far the more solid accomplishment, whereas Mr. Davis's are more in the nature of a quest - a search for some firm artistic ground he could call his own. Yet both these exhibitions afford us an illuminating perspective on the art of the late 50's - on the breakdown of Abstract Expressionist orthodoxy and the ensuing scramble for alternative styles.

THE TREND TOWARD SANCTIMONIOUS SENSATIONALISM","Ahysterical woman uses a hand gun to fend off two psychotic rapists. Male and female teen-agers sell their bodies on the streets of San Francisco. Inmates at a maximum-security prison openly describe the horrors of their lives. These are only some examples of the decidedly stronger fare being offered to television viewers these days. Of course, February is a ''sweeps'' month, meaning that the ratings are more important than ever to local stations; the ability of sex and violence to attrack audiences has been firmly, if not notoriously, established. And while there is nothing terribly new about the presence of rapists, prostitutes or convicts on the home screen, either in dramatizations or in newscasts and documentaries, a sweeps period, scheduled three times each year, inevitably triggers a heavily publicized avalanche of topical and titillating themes: Teen pregnancies! Male models! Pornography! The subjects are certainly legitimate enough for investigation, but, as time passes, the television treatments have become noticeably more detailed and candid. The line between concern and exploitation, between required realism and prurience, has become uncomfortably fuzzy. Needless to say, most treatments of sex-and-violence subjects are couched in the rhetoric of noble motivations. The film or news report is always offered as an exercise in consciousness-raising, designed to alert the country to some festering social problem. In fact, television seems to have entered what might be called an era of sanctimonious sensationalism.",1981-02-15T05:00:00+0000

The Federal share ranges from 50 to 70 percent, with the highest proportion going to states with the lowest per-capita income. Within broad Federal guidelines, states set rules for eligibility, covered services and payment rates. Eligible persons are entitled to have their bills paid, whatever the total cost. Spending has risen more than 15 percent a year over the last five years, primarily because of higher health costs, and the program would cost the Government more than $18 billion in the fiscal year 1982 if no changes were made. President Reagan would reduce the anticipated Federal grants to the states by $100 million in the current fiscal year and by $1 billion in 1982. After that, the Federal contribution to the program would rise at the same rate as the inflation rate in the economy. States would have to make up the difference, either by changing eligibility requirements, reducing payment rates or making their programs more efficient. States such as New York with the most generous rules would lose the most Federal dollars. Spending would be reduced by $1 billion below current estimates in 1982 and the savings would increase each year until they reached $5 billion in 1985.",1981-02-19T05:00:00+0000

At 8 o'clock, Mr. Walcott will read from his other works and Mr. MacDermot will play from his own before intermission, after which comes ''O, Babylon!'' The audience must enter and leave the Sanctuary by way of the Living Room, where a wine, cheese and fruit reception with all performers ends the evening.

He is surrounded by other waiting racers and, through a window in the hut, he looks out to the steepest part of the mountain. He sees No. 58 heading toward that pitch, plunging out of sight. ''Oh, my God, oh, my God!'' says Louis. ''What the hell am I doing here?'' But his coaches are with him, and he adds, ''O.K., I'll do it, I'll do it.''

One such speaker is Wharfedale's Model TSR-108, the smallest in a new series produced by this British company, which had been prominent in the early years of high fidelity and has lately perked up again after a hiatus. Despite its compact size (23 x 12 x 12 inches), this speaker rolls out clear and ample bass. The credit for this goes to a 10-inch woofer employing a self-damping cone of mineral-filled polymer. The properties of this material prevent the formation of false modes of vibration due to flexing and buckling of the cone which would otherwise muddy the lower notes and falsify timbres in the midrange. Evidently this woofer cone represents a successful instance among the numerous current efforts to develop cone materials capable of greater clarity in the lower frequency region. As for range, this woofer reaches down to 50 Hz at the low end, which is quite respectable for a speaker this size.",1981-02-22T05:00:00+0000

King Juan Carlos, appearing on television, denounced the rebels and pledged his faith in democracy. (Page A1, Column 6.) A call for U.S.-Soviet summit talks was issued by Leonid I.
