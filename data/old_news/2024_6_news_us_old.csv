Over the years, I’ve donated food, snacks and clothing for her to give to her students. A few months ago, my friend said there was a job fair coming up at the school and the students needed clothes; she would take anything we could donate. I went through my closet and gathered professional blazers, skirts, pants and blouses and gave them to her. Long story short: I decided to start an account on Poshmark to sell my family’s old clothes. When I looked up some of my friends’ closets on the site, I discovered my teacher friend had posted and sold all the items I gave her for her students! Not just one or two items — all 20!

For law-abiding drinkers, however, D.I.Y. was almost the only option during Prohibition, when a loophole in the Volstead Act allowed Americans to consume about two-and-a-half bottles of the stuff per household per day. The preferred grape for amateur vintners was one that wasn’t particularly popular with the professionals: alicante bouschet, described in one 1883 wine guide as lacking “elegance, force and delicacy.” It’s what’s known as a teinturier variety, meaning that, unlike most red grapes, its pulp as well as its skin are deeply colored, resulting in wines so dark that they’re almost black. This intense pigmentation allowed thrifty winemakers to press a single batch of grapes two or three times, yielding a richly colored liquid again and again. The only problem? As the author Daniel Okrent writes in “Last Call,” his 2011 history of Prohibition, the wine made from alicante bouschet tasted “truly lousy.”",2024-06-06T21:20:09+0000

The lead character, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), is a former kamikaze pilot who managed to survive and is guilt-ridden — though, of course, it’s easy to argue that the actual lead is the title monster. Koichi joins the ad hoc forces gathered to prevent Godzilla from finishing off the reeling Japan, and the final battle, which takes place at sea, is masterfully directed by Yamazaki (who also supervised the Academy Award-winning visual effects).",2024-06-07T15:00:03+0000

I just splash water on my face in the morning and I use Environ Retinol Serum 1. If I’m a good girl I use Garnier Vitamin C Daily UV Brightening Fluid and then I put more eye makeup on my already made-up eyes. I use any black eyeliner on my waterline. It’s always a pencil — you can smudge it way easier and I like my makeup looking a little bit effortless. Right now I’m using one from Givenchy, their Khôl Couture Waterproof pencil. I get eyelash extensions done every two or three weeks, so I don’t really use mascara. I used to wake up an hour before school started just to do my makeup. Now that I get eyelash extensions, I feel ready as soon as I wake up; I’ll never stop getting them. Sometimes I use a cheek tint from Jillian Dempsey that makes me look sun-kissed. I put it on my nose. Sometimes I’ll use Chanel Le Gel Sourcils on my brows. I naturally have pretty thin brows but I’ve thinned them out more recently because I saw a picture of my mom in the ’90s and she looked so good with thin brows. The only lipstick I use is by Kiko Milano — Powder Power Lipstick in shade 15. I put it on my nose, lips and cheeks. Sometimes I do my makeup before I get into the shower — it’s such a good hack. Your skin gets dewy. I know your T-zone is meant to look matte but I like it looking a little sweaty sometimes. My makeup artist uses a Chanel Baume Essentiel highlighter stick that’s so amazing.

These apparently coordinated attacks came nearly two weeks after 34 people were arrested at a pro-Palestine rally in front of the museum.

In a somewhat less conventional way, she also adored the way Les smelled, and this aroma of salt and musk, accented with a suggestion of leather from the carbolic soap he used at the pool, formed for her a lasting sense of who he was. “It was just him,” Joy said, a steadfast marker of his identity, no less distinctive than his face, his voice, his particular quality of mind.",2024-06-14T09:04:05+0000

We respectfully asked for more information during a shareholder meeting but were told that the matter was strictly confidential. All the board has said is that the final cost to the co-op was approximately $15,000. This seems low, considering a year of legal fees, mediation and the settlement itself.

Schloss Fuschl, located on an evergreen-ringed, emerald-hued glacial lake 20 minutes outside of Salzburg, is no exception. Constructed in 1461, the sprawling stone manse served for four centuries as a luxurious hunting lodge for the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg, who ruled the area under the Holy Roman Empire, as well as their royal guests. After World War II, the schloss (“castle” in German) was converted into a hotel that operated mostly seasonally, from April through October, until 2022, when Rosewood Hotels & Resorts bought the property and embarked on a restoration. On July 1, Schloss Fuschl will reopen with 98 guest rooms including six stand-alone chalets. There are six restaurants and bars on-site; indoor and outdoor infinity pools; a spa with three saunas and eight treatment rooms; and access to Lake Fuschl: Fishing expeditions, boat trips and herbalist-led nature walks can be arranged. While the schloss was never home to the likes of Cinderella or Rapunzel, it did host a movie princess: Fans of midcentury cinema might recognize the place from the German-French actress Romy Schneider’s “Sisi” films — a historical trilogy about the young Elisabeth of Austria — which were shot there in the 1950s. Today, the Sisi Teesalon bears the character’s name and will offer afternoon tea service with a wide range of homemade pastries including the Schloss Fuschl Torte, a chocolate-hazelnut truffle cake first created in the house kitchen more than 30 years ago.

In September 2019, I adopted my then 5-year-old son from China, and promised him we would return to visit his country every year. But the pandemic broke out. When China finally reopened to tourists in 2023, we got visas and booked a July flight to Beijing via Doha on Qatar Airways, paying about $1,400 total. My now 9-year-old had worked hard to maintain his language and was excited, but nervous. At that time, the Chinese government required passengers to fill out a “Health Declaration Form” in advance or upon arrival. The link on the Qatar Airways website was broken, but I confirmed online and with friends who had recently traveled to China that I could fill it out upon arrival. At the airport, Qatar Airways disagreed, and when I once again couldn’t get the form to work, we were denied boarding. My son collapsed on the airport floor, sobbing. I rebooked for the next day, and we flew to Beijing via Istanbul on Royal Jordanian and China Southern for $1,882. Neither airline requested to see the QR code showing my form had been approved: All passengers upon arrival were made to fill out new forms. Qatar Airways mostly refunded the tickets — we received $1,185 — but refused to admit it was wrong. Considering the more expensive last-minute flight and other costs (such as rebooking domestic flights and trains in China) we are out about $930. I believe the airline should provide a flight voucher that compensates us for that amount. Can you help? Elizabeth, Amman, Jordan",2024-06-27T09:01:57+0000

Both accommodations — one sleeps up to 11, the other six — were restored for Tourists Homes, a new offshoot that allows larger groups to book individual houses. “As a joke we call them the mullet houses — business in the front, party in the back — because [we preserved the] 1860s fronts but we gave the backs all the benefits of contemporary design,” says Tourists co-founder Ben Svenson. Similar to the company’s original property, both houses embody a retro, chalet-inspired aesthetic (each has a wood-burning stove) and are furnished with bespoke pieces made by local carpenters (the larger house has an oversize round Douglas fir table for family-style dining) and vintage gems curated by the interior designer Julie Pearson (the smaller house comes with an original Rhodes Mark 1 piano).

All houseguests get access to the hotel’s pool and community events, including a free concert series featuring visiting musicians who play in exchange for room nights.
