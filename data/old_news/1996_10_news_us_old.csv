The next proved that it had simple resources of conviction at its back and was likely to be pressed far.

Now, a discreet new ornamentalism is on the rise, a subtle shift that combines the spare with the sumptuous. It is intuitive collage, a modern blending of whatever works. The references are often eccentric, sometimes formal, always individual. This new direction can be found in a cavernous northern California warehouse bejeweled with a colorful mysticism, and in a TriBeCa loft where a playful connoisseurship reigns. It is in the exoticism of a lodge in the Catskills, and the exuberance of a sleek, steel California kitchen. The best of the new ornamentalism is both restrained and telling.

Like a shivering animal, a blossom burns off carbohydrates to keep warm, cranking away at one watt. Forty blooms can generate the heat of a living-room light bulb; 70 give off the warmth of a human being at rest reading a newspaper.

As a result, Mr. Clinton has not really been pressed to address some of the most pressing foreign policy issues of the day. This is not healthy. The Clinton Administration has already committed the country to several major foreign policy endeavors scheduled to unfold just after the election, which the U.S. public and Congress have barely discussed. If Mr. Clinton wins a landslide victory based solely on his domestic policies, he will be free to interpret this as a landslide for his foreign policy initiatives as well, in which case the U.S. public could be in for a few surprises.",1996-10-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Leveling the Playing Field For Smart Girls,"Since 1956, when the National Merit Scholarship Corporation was set up to select academically talented students, it has given more than $652 million in awards. But FairTest, a nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass., filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, charging that the selection method was unfair to girls, because it begins with the College Board's Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test. Boys outscore girls on that test, although girls earn better grades in high school and college. Last week the College Board said it would modify the P.S.A.T. next year, adding multiple choice questions on writing -- an area where girls do slightly better than boys. If that fails, the Education Department said it would look at other approaches. KAREN W. ARENSON",1996-10-06T05:00:00+0000

Researchers now have evidence that programs in Thailand have cut the rate of transmission of H.I.V., the AIDS virus -- the first such proven success.

They're all in search of the 63 gold coins in the Wandering Crescent Collection, which disappeared from Nazi Germany in 1943. As the action in THE NAME OF A BULLFIGHTER (Harcourt Brace, $21) unfolds, these disparate characters converge on forlorn Tierra del Fuego and their lives become inextricably entwined. The Chilean-born novelist Luis Sepulveda, who has lived in Germany since 1980, has been wildly popular in Spanish-speaking countries and in Europe since the publication in 1992 of his novel ''The Old Man Who Read Love Stories.'' In this new novel, he melds Manuel Puig's romanticism with the ingenuity of Jorge Luis Borges -- and applies them to a picaresque search for lost gold whose wry denouement leaves a smile on the reader's face, in spite of the tragedies that precede it. It's Mr. Sepulveda's sure sense of narration (aided by Suzanne Ruta's fluid translation) that makes this novel so successful. ''The Name of a Bullfighter'' is a rare find: a thrilling, well-wrought work of literature that pulses with the excitement of the best detective fiction. Christopher Atamian",1996-10-13T05:00:00+0000

So when Saddam Hussein's Kurds drove the pro-U.S. Kurds out of northern Iraq, and reintegrated it with the rest of the country, Iraqi traders went on a shopping spree. Suddenly, they could get all sorts of previously banned goods through northern Iraq. And how did they buy them? By selling their Iraqi dinars for dollars on the black market.

us,Close-Ups,"At the forefront of the talented and committed photographers who burst upon the international scene in the 1930's was Robert Capa (1913-54), born Endre Friedman in Budapest. His photographs of the Spanish Civil War, which are considered groundbreaking for the immediacy with which they depicted soldiers and civilians caught in the chaos of war, gained him immediate, widespread recognition. Along with those he took during World War II (which include grainy images of American soldiers landing in Normandy), they are some of this century's more frequently reproduced and discussed shots. That his work is so familiar is due in large measure to the persistence of his younger brother, the photographer Cornell Capa, the founding director of the International Center for Photography. ROBERT CAPA: Photographs (Aperture, $50) includes a remembrance by Cornell Capa, a foreword by Henri Cartier-Bresson (who helped Robert Capa found the photo agency Magnum) and text by Robert Whelan, the author of a biography of Capa. The book seeks to broaden Capa's reputation beyond that of war photographer, but the majority of the images come from places -- like China, France, Israel, Italy and Indochina -- where war of one kind or another was being fought. Although Capa certainly did not celebrate war, he seems to have needed its intensity and danger to produce his best work, always following his own maxim, ''If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.'' The viewer senses something momentous taking place just out of the frame: the ground shakes from battle, an anxious crowd scans the sky, a dark-eyed girl looks up from her family's tattered bags -- symbols of refugee flight. Humor and warmth animate these pictures, as well as tragedy and loss, but the few images of ordinary life lack Capa's distinctive empathy. Rosemary Ranck",1996-10-13T05:00:00+0000

The change has been criticized as a spineless way to help women score better despite their inferior math skills. But the fact is that the tests consistently underestimate the college performance of women as compared with men. Adding a writing component, a move that was requested by colleges and universities for reasons unrelated to the gender gap, may well raise women's scores -- but only toward the level they should be at to predict college performance. If that turns out to be so, this commitment to improve academic validity will warrant applause, not ridicule.",1996-10-14T05:00:00+0000

us,How to Fill a Big Screen,"Though it is hard to think of a more intimate film than ''Brief Encounter'' (1945), David Lean's first hit, he will be remembered nonetheless as a director of epics: ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), ''Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962), ''Dr. Zhivago'' (1965), ''Ryan's Daughter'' (1970) and ''A Passage to India'' (1984). Kevin Brownlow, the film historian and author of ''The Parade's Gone By,'' a classic study of the silent cinema, shares with Lean a fondness for large enterprises, fastidiousness and a certain old-fashioned reticence about intruding his point of view. The two men are well matched in Mr. Brownlow's gratifyingly comprehensive DAVID LEAN: A Biography (Wyatt/St. Martin's, $40), which is told mostly in the words of Lean, his colleagues and his former wives. David Lean (1908-91), who was born in the London suburb of South Croydon, is introduced as a forlorn middle-class Quaker child, ''dim'' at schoolwork, who, at the age of 13, saw his first movie, ''The Hound of the Baskervilles,'' and was hooked. He began his career as a film editor, and, as Mr. Brownlow observes, since he was an obsessive craftsman he soon became the best film editor in England. Although Mr. Brownlow gives due consideration to Lean's fine Dickens adaptations -- ''Great Expectations'' (1946) and ''Oliver Twist'' (1948) -- the most fascinating chapters focus on the epics, which often were excruciating ordeals, particularly for the actors, since Lean refused to give praise. His volatile collaborations with the screenwriter Robert Bolt and the cinematographer Freddie Young are discussed, as well as Lean's meticulous preparations for every shot. Although presented as a problematic person, Lean becomes more sympathetic as he ages in the course of this very long but compelling book, which should revive interest in a major director's career.

They also make a wonderful risotto, especially when flavored with white truffle oil (and, if expense is no object, topped with a few shavings of fresh white truffle). Surely Tennyson would not have scorned chanterelles, those orange, feathery trumpets, which are so good tossed with pasta and cream.

us,Remembrance of Corn Pone Past,"Lots of people dismiss small-town Southern festivals as hokum, but according to ''Ghost Dancing on the Cracker Circuit,'' a forthcoming book from the University Press of Mississippi, these events also constitute serious ''nativistic revitalization movements.''

In the modern analogue, vanished cultural symbols are similarly ritualized, usually by white Southern Smallvillians who hope, in part, to keep their towns alive by ''selling'' extinct traditions. Of course, neither hosts nor fans intellectualize matters this much -- they just like pigs and hillbillies -- but for you brainy folkways buffs, here are highlights from the 1996-97 season.",1996-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,The News From Amherst,"Judith Farr's first novel, I NEVER CAME TO YOU IN WHITE (Peter Davison/Houghton Mifflin, $21.95), is a daring attempt to flesh out the characters and events in the world of that eccentric genius of Amherst Emily Dickinson. And Ms. Farr pulls it off in style. The author of a scholarly study, ''The Passion of Emily Dickinson,'' Ms. Farr concentrates here on the teen-age Dickinson's brief tenure as a student at Mary Lyon's Female Seminary (which later became Mount Holyoke College) in 1847, a time that is reconstructed in a flurry of fictional correspondence. Ms. Farr handles speculation about Dickinson's sexuality with panache, positing lesbian tendencies but tempering them with other possibilities and -- best of all -- playing down Dickinson's sexual preference as a poetic influence. Spliced in among various letters from midcentury are others written much later by Margaret Mann, a petty schoolmarm who contacts Dickinson's publisher and friend, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, trying to sort out her own muddled memories through a poorly concealed mist of envy. For his part, Higginson counters with evidence of Dickinson's faith and anecdotes about her later days. Dickinson's sister, Lavinia, provides another perspective, and there's even a humorous turn from Dickinson's put-upon cousin Emily Norcross, who suffers as the poet's roommate. Dickinson herself is credited with some letters, perhaps Ms. Farr's most ambitious moments. ''I Never Came to You in White'' is obviously more fanciful than a conventional biography, but the novel's inventions make satisfying reading, providing artful insights into an elusive life.

us,The Art of Eccentricity,"In the judgment of the English critic F. R. Leavis, the Sitwells -- Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell -- belonged ''to the history of publicity, rather than of poetry,'' so perhaps it is only fitting that while most of their books are out of print, their exploits remain a subject of continuing interest. Their eccentric appearance, outrageous opinions and prominence in fashionable bohemian circles made them the Andy Warhols of their day; they even dabbled in what might be called performance art (their most famous collaboration, the 1923 ''Facade,'' featured Edith wailing her poems through a megaphone, from behind an elaborately painted curtain, to the accompaniment of ''experimental'' music by William Walton). And like Warhol, they exerted a considerable influence on the avant-garde of their time. It is this influence that is the subject of THE SITWELLS: And the Arts of the 1920s and 1930s (University of Texas, paper, $34.95), a pictorial biography by Sarah Bradford, Honor Clerk, Jonathan Fryer, Robin Gibson and John Pearson. Apart from innumerable pictures of the trio in languid poses and peculiar get-ups, their expressions always appropriately bored and impossibly aristocratic, there are also photographs of Sitwell friends and associates like Evelyn Waugh, Cecil Beaton and the young Dylan Thomas. Detailed in the captions and accompanying text are tales of the threesome's longstanding feuds with those who dared to mock their pretensions to genius, among whom were not only Leavis but D. H. Lawrence, Noel Coward, Aldous Huxley and Wyndham Lewis. Indeed, it sometimes seems as though the main occupation of the three was devising vendettas against anyone who failed to share their high opinion of themselves; archetypally English though they were, they lacked that most English of attributes, a sense of irony, especially where their own reputations were concerned. After a while, the account of their endless campaigns to promote themselves, furious indignation at every imagined slight and spiteful denunciations of their critics becomes more than a little tiresome; readers may find themselves sympathizing with the reviewer who called one of Osbert's books ''a long-drawn-out whine . . . a tedious and tortured tale of trivial complaint.''

Yet her reticence and dislike of being in the spotlight have never turned her into a recluse. Wit, wisdom and warmth are equally important ingredients in the mixture of qualities that makes her so unusual and every poem of hers so unforgettable.

A woman in Paris said she snatched up the only pair in a Prada shop there, even though the shoes were a size too small.

us,Leaving the Past to Die,"Born in 1960 in a small town near Shanghai, Yu Hua belongs to a generation of writers who reached artistic maturity in the years preceding the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. And the eight stories in THE PAST AND THE PUNISHMENTS (University of Hawaii, cloth, $32; paper, $14.95) have left Socialist Realism far behind. Fluidly translated by Andrew F. Jones, they show the influence of certain foreign authors like Kawabata and Borges -- whose works became available in Chinese for the first time in the 1980's -- but the dominant tone is established by traditional elements like ghost stories and numerology. (Several important characters in ''World Like Mist,'' for example, are identified only by single-digit numbers.) Personality means little in this fictional world; surface is all, and it can be graphically cruel. In the Kafkaesque title story, a scholar has come to the unsettling conclusion that ''the essence of human wisdom is the art of punishment.'' Whether this proposition is true or not, Yu Hua's characters punish one another with abandon. In one story, an ancient fortuneteller is said to have lived so long because ''he had been able to force each of his first four children back into the nether world,'' thus capturing their vital energies for himself. Political allegory is not entirely absent in these pages, and the story called ''1986'' deals directly with the devastating effects of the Cultural Revolution. In it, a young teacher is driven insane by the Red Guards, from whom he escapes to wander the countryside. Years later, he reappears in his hometown, but the people there have chosen to forget the past. Eventually, the madman becomes such a nuisance that he is bound with rope and left to die. Like the scholar in the title story, his special research interest had been the history of punishment through the ages. William Ferguson",1996-10-27T05:00:00+0000

Today, for most groups, when the music's over, the lights come on, and it's time to be introduced to music-business people, conduct interviews, sign autographs and make career decisions. There is a widespread misconception that becoming a pop star means a lifetime of no work and all music and play. The truth is, in today's super-saturated media environment, signing with a major label means more non-musical work than ever.",1996-10-31T05:00:00+0000
