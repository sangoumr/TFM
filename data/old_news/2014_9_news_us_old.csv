Chief Criticizes Seizing of West Bank Land," Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations added his voice on Monday to the criticism of Israel over its seizing of nearly 1,000 acres of West Bank land in a Jewish settlement bloc near Bethlehem. Israels action on Sunday, Mr. Ban said in a statement, risks paving the way for further settlement activity, which  as the United Nations has reiterated on many occasions  is illegal under international law and runs totally counter to the pursuit of a two-state solution. Palestinians, who aspire to create a state on territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war, denounced the new land seizure by Israel and said it would further aggravate relations, less than a week after a cease-fire agreement brokered by Egypt was reached to halt 50 days of fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in Gaza. American and British officials also criticized the land seizing, calling it counterproductive, while Egypts Foreign Ministry said it would have negative consequences on the peace process.

The revival of the fisheries began in earnest in 2000, when they were near collapse and fishing families were facing bankruptcy. A series of quotas, improvements in gear, better monitoring of catches and the creation of protected areas to preserve fish habitat brought improvements in stocks off the shores of California, Washington and Oregon, said Frank Lockhart of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations West Coast fisheries division.

Therein resides the gap that separates the notion of power practiced by ISIS from the modern Western notion of what Michel Foucault called biopower, which regulates life in order to guarantee general welfare: the ISIS caliphate totally rejects the notion of biopower.",2014-09-03T18:45:13+0000

Britain has delivered nonlethal supplies to Kurdish fighters, who are on the front line of the battle against the militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and it has helped to transport ammunition provided by others. Mr. Camerons comments suggest that Britain could begin to supply ammunition directly to Kurdish forces. In a BBC interview, Mr. Cameron refused to rule out airstrikes but said they would not take place in Iraq before the formation of a new government in Baghdad. He also suggested that there might not be any legal impediment to attacking militants in Syria without the agreement of Syrias government because it had committed war crimes against its own people and was therefore illegitimate.

BANKS (2013) Tom Hanks stars as Walt Disney in this Disney movie about the making of a Disney movie: specifically Mary Poppins, which, at the time of its creation in the early 60s, was the most expensive live-action film the studio had produced. Eventually it became one of the most beloved, too, and one of the biggest moneymakers. Emma Thompson (above, with Mr. Hanks) is the author P. L. Travers, who conjured the magical nanny, and is something of a crank. I wont have her turned into one of your silly cartoons, she says of her creation, stiffly, lips pursed. Theres a back story too, in which Travers is a little girl (Annie Rose Buckley) in a dusty town in Australia, where her hopelessly alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) can barely hold on to his bank job. Fans of the book and the earlier movie will know that Mr. Banks is the father of the children cared for by Mary Poppins, but even those entirely innocent of her previous literary and cinematic incarnations  if such people exist  will find this movie accessible and enjoyable, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times of this movie directed by John Lee Hancock. That is part of the Disney brand, of course: fun for everyone, with a spoonful of therapeutic medicine to help the sugar seem nutritious. ",2014-09-05T05:00:03+0000

The order for the general mobilization has not yet been signed, but it is believed it will be signed during the day. In the meantime the mobilization is proceeding actively by means of individual orders. Throughout the kingdom enlisting is proceeding actively. On the other hand, despatches from Milan say that between Bozen and Franzens Feste travellers have noticed numerous entrenchments prepared by the Austrian army, armed with guns turned upon Italy. In the north of Venetia large Italian forces are ready to march. The despatch of an ultimatum to Austria is expected every minute.

Bam! the gun goes off and the sad-eyed, paper-tattered toy elephant topples. Mr. Beltrans ad is one of many bamming and kerpowing across the land from candidates pandering to gun enthusiasts.

She wants the sort of bland, decorous WASP name that will label her as an unhyphenated American.

us,Inside the List,"Going Viral: Twenty years ago, Richard Preston scored a nonfiction hit with his scientific adventure story The Hot Zone, about an outbreak of Ebola virus among quarantined monkeys in Virginia  the book spent almost two years on the hardcover and paperback lists before fading away in June 1996. (That was a good time for science journalism. During its run, Prestons book shared space on the list with Oliver Sackss collection of neurological case studies An Anthropologist on Mars and Nicholas Negropontes technology primer Being Digital, which predicted the end of fax machines and CD-ROMs.) Now, with Ebola back in the news because of its fatal spread through West Africa, readers are returning to The Hot Zone. The Associated Press reported last month that Anchor Books, the paperback publisher, had printed 70,000 new copies, and the book is currently at No. 17 in its 50th week on the paperback nonfiction list. The thing is, Preston told CNN early in August, Ebola has been pulling surprises on all of us. I dont think anybody really expected that Ebola had the potential to do something like get into the cities and get out of control. But, you know, most of the experts Im talking to are saying that they are pretty well convinced that, you know, they will be able to get it under control, but theres huge concern about the possibility that Ebola could get into a major city. The viruss return is obviously bad news. But it does retroactively absolve The Hot Zone of a charge Colin Harrison leveled against it in the Book Review a few years after its publication. The outbreak in Virginia resulted in exactly zero human cases, Harrison noted, complaining about the happy frenzy of media attention the story had received. It was the first time that everyone knew about a disease that nobody had. It was the first time that a virus was famous for being famous. Now we know we were right to panic.",2014-09-05T14:51:33+0000

We have built megacities that will leave a durable footprint long after they have vanished. We have altered the pH of the oceans and have moved so many life-forms around the globe  inadvertently and intentionally  that we are creating novel ecosystems everywhere. Since the late-18th-century industrialization that marks the Anthropocenes beginnings, humans have shaken Earths life systems with a profundity that the paleontologist Anthony Barnosky has likened to an asteroid strike.

us,Girlhood Gone,"It seems endemic to the enterprise that fiction writers must fall good and hard for their characters  how else could we stand to live with them for weeks, months, years, in sometimes tortuous isolation? As in marriage or a long affair, this abiding attraction can twist and turn into revulsion or obsession. It can also wax and wane. The writer can stray and then beg for forgiveness, banging on a shut door to be let back inside. In conjuring The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain became captivated by Huckleberry Finn, Toms idle and lawless and vulgar and bad sidekick, so much so that Twain rode Huck on to glory with his subsequent masterpiece. J. D. Salingers beloved Holden Caulfield appeared in several stories, both published and unpublished, before he found his home in The Catcher in the Rye. And, as any fan knows, Salinger had a hell of a time kicking the Glass family to the curb; its members own or make appearances in all three of Salingers story collections, as well as in new collections (fingers crossed) that are rumored to be forthcoming.

Together they look at a melodramatic 19th-century genre painting of Joan of Arc, which the narrator claims is one of his favorite pictures. Lerner uses the strikingly unlovely word coconstructed to describe the shared nature of their experience: We would work out our views as we coconstructed the literal view before us. A few paragraphs on, he and an 8-year-old boy are seen coconstructing a shoe-box diorama.

In fact, the title is so straightforward that when I was asked to write this review, I felt vaguely offended by the idea that my editor would push such an obvious identity-politics project on me, perhaps believing that I, by dint of being Asian-American, must therefore have some special insight into Tizon and this search for his Asian self. I am 20 years younger than Tizon and grew up in snooty college towns and attended schools where I was taught that there was a hierarchy of race writing. The immigrant experience was not enough in itself, and when I read the self-evident title of Tizons book, I flashed back to a fiction workshop in Columbias M.F.A. program and a professor who told me that the book I was working on  a book much like Tizons  could definitely be published, but wondered if there was anything I could do to elevate it into something more interesting. I recognized the code immediately  anything labeled the immigrant experience would be considered earnest and dclass, and would therefore need to be gussied up in fashionable literary frills. For the next year, I wrote bad evocations of Lydia Davis, Lorrie Moore, Barthelme and Borges. My protagonists, God help them, became whiter and whiter. ",2014-09-05T14:57:49+0000

Gamache is moved by the plight of one neighbor, Clara Morrow, a painter whose husband, Peter, left home when her artistic reputation eclipsed his own  promising to return in exactly one year, presumably after intense soul-searching.

It was puzzling until Kendal explained what she was doing. The cream takes off some of the liner and leaves a beautiful residue and sheen on the lid, she said. This gives you that soft, dewy effect. Another surprise: dabbing on Lancme Aquatique Waterproof Eyecolour Base in Sienne, a brown primer of sorts, in lieu of eye shadow to define the eyes, without being obvious about it.

Dengue, which causes fevers and in rare cases death, is common in tropical climates, but not in temperate Japan. Officials said global warming might be playing a role in the spread of dengue to places like Tokyo. This year, Japan had an unusually hot and humid summer. The ministry said most of the people found infected had spent time in or near Yoyogi Park, where they were most likely bitten by mosquitoes that carried the disease. On Friday, health workers sprayed pesticides in the park to kill the insects. No one has died in the outbreak. ",2014-09-06T02:14:11+0000

Mr. Kenyatta, who took office in 2013, is accused of stoking violence after the 2007 election that left more than 1,000 people dead. His trial was to have started in February but it was postponed until Oct. 7 after prosecutors said key witnesses had been intimidated and access to others had been blocked.

(HBO) 12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) In this Oscar winner for best picture, written by John Ridley and directed by Steve McQueen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, above, portrays Solomon Northup, a free African-American man who, in 1841, was kidnapped in Washington and sold into slavery. Paul Giamatti plays the brutish Louisiana trader who sells Solomon to William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), a seemingly decent plantation owner, who in turn sells him to Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) a drunken madman, who epitomizes the villainy of slave ownership. Lupita Nyongo won a best supporting actress Oscar for her turn as Patsey, Epps favorite, whom he brutalizes. Mr. McQueens sympathies are as unqualified as his control, Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. There is much to admire about 12 Years a Slave, including the cleareyed, unsentimental quality of its images  this is a place where trees hang with beautiful moss and black bodies  and how Mr. Ejiofors restrained, open, translucent performance works as a ballast, something to cling onto, especially during the frenzies of violence. And while these scenes are hard to watch, the genius of 12 Years a Slave is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price.

A few days after my article was published, however, he emailed to say he wanted to talk some more about the one-hander. So last Saturday we met at the U.S. Open for that conversation. The 83-year-old Bollettieri was recently inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, an honor granted in recognition of his role in nurturing some of the sports greatest talents, including Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Jim Courier. (Another Bollettieri disciple, the Japanese player Kei Nishikori, reached the semifinals of this years Open with a five-set victory Wednesday over Stan Wawrinka, who has what many consider todays best one-handed backhand.)",2014-09-06T20:05:46+0000

The hairstylist Guido Palau ran with that concept, putting a new spin on the classic gymnasium ponytail. Its a bit futuristic, he said of the low-slung style. The tail is dry but there is a high gloss to the head. Palaus technique involved tightly combing back strands with generous amounts of Redken Hardwear 16 Super Strong Hair Gel around the crown, then misting Redken Diamond Oil High Shine Airy Mist (available in October) all over to provide a glistening effect. To finish, he secured hair with a simple black tie at the nape. I cant really move my neck too much! joked the model Mari of the ultra-sleek result. Still, she proved to be a good sport.

Sharp and Mr. Robert Bacon. The idea seems to prevail that the United States is now represented in Paris by a sort of diplomatic triumvirate. Such an idea, of course, is amusingly inaccurate. Mr. Myron T. Herrick, the American Ambassador, is in sole charge of the Embassy, and will remain in sole charge until the end of the existing crisis. Mr. W. G. Sharp, who will take over the Embassy when conditions permit Mr. Herrick to retire, is in Paris for the purpose of arranging details connected with the preparations for his residence here. As regards Mr. Bacon, who made a host of friends during his term as Ambassador, he is visiting Paris at this time on private business. The French press, in fact, in trying to read diplomatic significance into the presence in Paris of the three eminent diplomatists, is wasting its ingenuity.

us,How to Get the Purple Hazy Eyes at Derek Lam,"I like when beauty has a little twist to it, said the French makeup artist Tom Pecheux backstage this morning. When workshopping the concept behind the beauty look at Derek Lam, Pecheux tried a few different options for the designer. The first was all natural, no makeup, blah blah, he said. The girl looked like a flat wheel. So I said, Lets try a nude color, which was pretty but boring. Eventually the face painter grabbed a rich violet color and smudged it over the lids: et voil, that did the trick. Derek said, Oooh, I like that! exclaimed Pecheux, with an amused smile. Still, the bruisey shade, as Pecheux described it, required careful application. To avoid the illusion of being punched in the face, he traced MAC Fluidline in Deep Deep Brown along the upper lashes, then brushed on MAC Lipstick in Violetta, creating a soft pinky-lavender wash over the lids and up to the brows. The lipstick is bright, so you only need a thin layer, he insisted. To finish, he swept on a metallic taupe eye shadow, then etched a thin streak of white kohl pencil under the eyes to lend contrast. The last step: sheering out everything with his hands. This is your best friend, Pecheux said, waving his finger in the air. Using your fingers with makeup brings so much sensuality and femininity to the face, and thats what I want for spring and summer. ",2014-09-07T18:38:42+0000

us,The Rise of the SWAT Team in American Policing,"Posse comitatus is not a phrase that trips lightly off every tongue. It is typically translated from Latin as force of the county. Anyone who has ever watched an old Western movie will instantly recognize the first word as referring to men deputized by the sheriff to chase down some varmints who went thataway. (Rappers and their tag-alongs later gave posse a different context.) The full phrase is more obscure, but the concept that it embraces is enshrined in American law. The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878 at the end of Reconstruction and amended but slightly over the decades, prohibits the nations armed forces from being used as a police force within the United States. Soldiers, the reasoning goes, exist to fight wars. Chasing local wrongdoers is a job for cops.",2014-09-07T22:45:26+0000

(HBO Signature) BEHIND THE CANDELABRA (2013) Michael Douglas, above, in a Golden Globe-winning role, stars as Liberace, and Matt Damon is Scott Thorson, his chauffeur, lover and adopted son, in this film from the director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter Richard LaGravenese. Set in Las Vegas; Los Angeles; and Palm Springs, Calif., the film chronicles the mens relationship, as Liberace has Mr. Thorson cosmetically altered in his image and legally adopts him before discarding him for a younger model. Theres something uncanny, even brilliant, about Mr. Douglass impersonation of Liberace, Mike Hale wrote in The New York Times. Sashaying across Las Vegas stages and epic suburban living rooms with a drum majors puffed-up grandeur and a lounge lizards predatory smile, Mr. Douglas gives a performance so assured, so free of camp or cringe, that you quickly surrender any doubts you might have had about his playing a famously flamboyant, closeted-in-plain-sight gay entertainer. Still, a cerebral gloss on, and satire of, a big old Hollywood biopic, Mr. Hale added, the film is full of smart, funny details  perfectly sewn in place, like the rhinestones on one of Mr. Douglass blinding costumes  but its short on heart, or heat.

And backstage at Rodartes spring/summer 2015 fashion show today, the runway look he created was evidence of that bond. On the eyes, he buffed a dark pink-brown tone from the new Nars St-Paul-De-Vence Duo Eyeshadow palette over the lid, pulling the shade around the outer corners in a downward arc. Its inspired by how Laura does her makeup, Kaliardos noted of the quirky technique. She does this thing where she drags down the corner of her eye shadow, and I thought, Thats kinda cool.' Underneath, he traced a thin line of Nars Larger Than Life Long-Wear Eyeliner in Rue Bonaparte to lift up the eyes and dusted on a gold metallic shade for a little glitz. But the real attention-getter: the faux piercings that half the models wore on their brows. Theyre just cool facial accessories, Kaliardos said of the silver rings adhered with glue. The model Kristina Petrosiute appreciated the (temporary) shock value. I took a photo and sent it to my boyfriend, she said. He was like, You look weird! But I like it! For Xiao Wen Ju, the experience might even lead to some real piercings. The eyebrow is not my style, but maybe I would do the lip, she said. I think the lip is really sexy.",2014-09-09T18:30:12+0000

us,Diva to Die for Shakes It Anew,"Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Evelyn (Champagne) King, Vicki Sue Robinson, Amii Stewart: the disco era was prime time for divas of pop. But perhaps the flashiest disco diva of them all was actually a man who, aptly enough for a diva of any era, went by a single name. I speak, of course, of Sylvester, the flamboyant androgyne whose life has now become fodder for the latest jukebox musical to splash down onstage. Mighty Real: A Fabulous Sylvester Musical is the brainchild of Anthony Wayne (Pippin, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert), who wrote the book, directs with Kendrell Bowman and struts the stage of the Theater at St. Clements in the title role. As with many another musical drawing on chart hits, the show will weave Sylvesters finest booty shakers  You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), Do Ya Wanna Funk, Dance (Disco Heat)  into his life story. And lets not forget this bonus: The show will feature Anastacia McCleskey and Jacqueline B. Arnold as the Weather Girls. Can we hope for a singalong?

Diehl had been on Milters radar since they met a few years ago at Photo Espaa, an international photography festival.

The Spunflower pendant, for instance, has three tiers of milky white glass crowned with a rim of metal with tiny perforations. Ms. Standefer said these dots would temper any harshness. The quality of illumination in industrial fixtures is often pure, tough and authentic, she added, but a light still has to be soft and beautiful. Prices range from $1,200 to $3,500.

Marshy basking spots for Londoners are being created in the Thames; Copenhagen already allows bathing in its harbor and the Manhattan coastline could soon have a floating cross-shaped swimming hole called +POOL. Amphitheaters, zigzagging boardwalks, and artificial hummocks surround the swimming areas, so bathers are not left vulnerable in open water.

I sliced and collaged his prints, using these extraordinary fabrics, to create unexpected moments that arent entirely Enoc or me. Its really a combination of both, the designer contends.

In an era of puffy, body-swallowing gowns, she wore snug dresses that showed off her curves; she put red makeup on the tips of her ears, just for extra drama.

us,Inside the List,"Unsolved Mysteries: Do women write the best crime novels? Thats the thesis of a recent essay in Salon by the critic Laura Miller, who argues that mysteries by men have grown sclerotic and predictable  locked into a hard-boiled formula little changed since the days of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Meanwhile (Miller continues), women are mixing their crime stories with other genres, mining the emotional terrains of home and family to advance a field the editor Sarah Weinman calls domestic suspense. One novel that features prominently in Millers analysis is The Secret Place, by Tana French, which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4. A thin vein of the uncanny runs through most of Frenchs novels, Miller notes: mysteries that go unsolved, premises that flirt with impossibility, paranormal occurrences that may or may not be imagined. I dont know if Miller is right about men and women; who is? But shes not wrong about French, whose books really do cultivate an appealing lack of resolution  at least in part, no doubt, because she jumps in without a plan. When I start writing, I have the narrator, the basic premise and a load of coffee, French told The Sunday Times of London in 2008. I dont even know whodunit.  Not that she would let uncertainty keep her from a genre she loves. Crime fiction is one of the best barometers of whats going on at any different moment, she added.

Charles Darwins faith was gone; he began writing On the Origin of Species. As Ian McEwan has told interviewers, rather like Darwin when his favorite daughter died, on Sept. 11 he felt, more than ever, that there was no God, and that religion was distinctly unhelpful in making compassionate, reasonable judgments about peoples lives. On the whole, the secular mind seems far superior in making reasonable judgments.

Both talks stressed religious, rather than political, themes but in an obvious reference to the Communist-built wall that divides the city, Dr. King declared that Christian love will overcome all man-made barriers. His crossing into East Berlin was easier than most. When he arrived at the border, he realized be had forgotten his passport. But police at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point recognized him and allowed him in without it. At a press conference, he had some sharp words for Republican presidential candidate Sen.

us,Whats on TV Saturday," 8 P.M. (HBO) DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013) A fiercely gaunt Matthew McConaughey, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician and rodeo rider who, after learning in 1985 that he is H.I.V. -positive, decides to treat himself by hunting down medication not then legal in the United States. Eventually, he begins a subscription service, selling contraband medicines for a monthly fee. Jared Leto (above left, with Mr. McConaughey), in another Oscar-winning performance, plays the transgendered Rayon, who becomes Rons business partner. And Jennifer Garner is the doctor who, after initially opposing the plan, turns into an ally. What is largely missing from this drama, directed by Jean-Marc Valle and inspired by real events, is the sense that Rons efforts are part of a larger movement, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Rons bravery and determination are entirely credible, thanks to Mr. McConaugheys disciplined, high-spirited performance and the filmmakers interest in the complexity of the character. But his actions unfold in something of a vacuum. He added, There is warmth and intelligence here, and undeniable sincerity, but also a determination, in the face of much painful and fascinating history, to play it safe. ",2014-09-13T05:00:04+0000

Nobody worries about them in the gardens, and they are growing thin and worrying because they no longer see the children playing. This is not the time to leave them, for what would become of them if the Germans came into Paris? So I must stop here with them. In 70 I already passed through the upheaval of a war. But in those days I was of an age when I could shoulder a rifle, and I did not know my birds. I would have you believe that then I did not throw my powder to the sparrows. To-day, alas, I am good for nothing but to be a bird-charmer. Yet, you know, each one does what he can, and, although I am not well off, these little birdies will be assured of bread.

How that translates to the makeup is with honey skin and a tawny eye. Rowe used a selection of colors on the lids, depending on each models skin tone, to mimic the effect of a subtle shadow. She then used Burberrys New Eyebrows (out in October) to sculpt arches. Not only is the color amazing, you can create a shadow rather than a solid block of color, she said. Its completely foolproof and doesnt look drawn on; its not heavy, its more sophisticated. The models skin, meanwhile, positively glowed under an insect- and flower-printed, greenhouse-like tent. Rowe first treated the face with Fresh Glow Luminous Fluid Base in Golden Radiance before highlighting the cheeks. The Golden Radiance works on any skin tone and you cant see it, she explained. It just gives you a lift of a tan, which we want for summer. For lips, Burberrys Lip Definer in Brick Red was treated with a dusting of Fresh Glow Powder for a matte finish. Yes, the red lip can, of course, look classic, Rowe added. But we want to keep it modern  thats why we kept the eyes nude and the skin slightly darker.",2014-09-15T17:30:58+0000

That release, a mellow affair with jazzy guitar, Latin percussion and soft sax, called to mind the chilled-out feel of 70s yacht rock and the sonic perfectionism of Steely Dan.

U.S. Steel said that the Canadian company, known as Stelco before its purchase in 2007, has posted an operating loss of $2.4 billion over the last five years. With the filing, the Canadian units results will no longer be included in U.S. Steels financial statements. In 2009, U.S. Steel shut down the Canadian operation and locked out its workers while demanding pension changes. That prompted a lawsuit from the government of Canada, charging that the company had failed to live up to foreign investment laws. An agreement to make further investments in Canada ended that action, although the company continues to battle unions. A lawyer for U.S. Steel Canada told the Ontario Superior Court that it had liabilities of between 3.86 billion and 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.52 billion and $3.9 billion), and assets worth between 1.9 billion and 2.3 billion Canadian dollars, according to The Globe and Mail. The largest creditor is U.S. Steel, which the court was told is owed 1.6 billion Canadian dollars.

Ryan Cooglers feature directorial debut reconstructs the final 24 hours in the life of Mr. Grant (played by Michael B. Jordan, above, with Ariana Neal) who, after two stints in a state prison, had returned to selling drugs after losing his job at a supermarket because of chronic lateness. Octavia Spencer plays his mother, still able to boss him around, and Melonie Diaz the mother of his daughter, with whom hes trying to stay. Mr. Cooglers main intention  and his great achievement, as well as Mr. Jordans  is to make Oscar a fully human presence, to pay him the respect of acknowledging his complexities and contradictions, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. The radicalism of Fruitvale Station lies precisely here, in its refusal to turn a man into a symbol. Nearly every black man, whether or not he is president, tends to be flattened out by popular culture and the psychopathology of everyday American life, rendered as an innocent victim, a noble warrior or a menace to society. There is a dehumanizing violence in this habit, a willed, toxic blindness that Fruitvale Station at once exposes and resists. ",2014-09-17T04:19:03+0000

us,The Ultimate Cuban Comfort Food: Picadillo,"Here is one of the great dishes of the Cuban diaspora: picadillo, a soft, fragrant stew of ground beef and tomatoes, with raisins added for sweetness and olives for salt. Versions of it exist across the Caribbean and into Latin America. James Villas, the elegant hedonist who for many years was the food and wine editor of Town & Country magazine, championed one from St. Lucia, in the Lesser Antilles. But many Cubans claim the dish as their own, a taste of the pre-revolutionary island at its homey best. Picadillo has a sentimental resonance, said Betty Cortina, a Cuban-American food writer who is the editor of The Miami Heralds lifestyle magazine, Indulge. She even took a recipe for picadillo with her to college at the University of Florida. Everyone who is of Cuban descent has a recipe for it, and each one of those is the most authentic. Its a comfort food, probably the most consummate example of one in Cuban cuisine.",2014-09-17T15:27:15+0000

us,Syria: Opposition Investigates Vaccine," Officials of the Syrian opposition coalition said Thursday that they had created a commission of inquiry into the deaths of children in insurgent-held Idlib Province caused by adulterated measles vaccine administered this week. The announcement came amid new indications that the disaster had been the result of negligence and not sabotage, and that it was possibly caused by a mixing of vaccines and an anesthetic used to relax muscles during surgery. The opposition coalition, which considers itself the interim government in that part of the country, said on its website that the commission would submit a final report on Sept. 25. The announcement also said 30 children had died. Conflicting accounts on Wednesday said 15 to 50 children had died within minutes of receiving the vaccine. The World Health Organization and Unicef, which have been overseeing an extensive vaccination campaign in Syria, have expressed concern that the vaccine disaster will discourage parents from protecting their children from measles, rubella and polio. The diseases are making a comeback in Syria because of the war and the collapse of public health services. Save the Children, a charity that helped plan the vaccination campaign and financially supported it in Idlib, said in a statement that it was deeply saddened and shocked by the deaths and expressed readiness to ensure there is clarity about how this tragic situation occurred.

Following a revolt at the Skoda works, the Gestapo made hundreds of arrests. In many cases, families of arrested workers received a few days later the papers of the member of their family arrested and a primed notice warning them that they were not to wear mourning or to speak of the death. It is believed probable that the Gestapo carried out executions at Prague, in the basement of the Petchek Bank. Other executions have been reported from Brno, where a revolt has been suppressed.

If they want arms, we are ready to discuss the question in a brotherly fashion and give our help, he said. Mr. Khrushchev told the youth forum delegates: I did not look at hydrogen or atomic bombs, but I saw an assortment of weapons used for infantry, artillery, tanks and rockets. I saw them and I said: See what man has built for man. Its terrible. In his 45-minute extemporaneous speech, Mr. Khrushchev gave his third clarification of his remarks last week about Soviet weaponry. He was quoted then as saying the Soviet Union had a terrible new weapon. Today he said he had been misquoted in the bourgeois press.

Sex, childhood, postmodernism, science, the nature of evil: Yep, thats McEwan. (The paper about evil was written by a Serbian philosopher, Zorica Djergovic-Joksimovic, who later expanded her research into a book with the wonderful title Ijan Makjuan: Polifonija Zla, or Ian McEwan: The Polyphony of Evil.) McEwan recently told The Wall Street Journal that fans sometimes stop him in the street. But literary fame is quite delightful compared to Hollywood fame or rock n roll fame or footballer fame, he said, because the kind of people who like literary fiction tend to come up blushing or squirming with embarrassment, trying to make themselves disappear but just wanting to tell you before they fade away that your work has meant a great deal to them.

(Full-scale opera, with its costumes and grandeur, comes across as rather more fun.)

Voce: Rising Opera Stars in Recital, a series at Pace University started last year by the veteran impresario Matthew Epstein, has already been a valuable addition to the vocal scene. This seasons first concert, on Sunday, features the potent combination of the soprano Julia Bullock, a star at the Juilliard School in recent productions of Massenets Cendrillon and Janaceks The Cunning Little Vixen, and the tenor Joseph Kaiser, over the past few years a Met stalwart in Mozart, Handel and Britten.

It documents Mr. Bowie as a musical and performance pioneer whose means of visual expression included drawings, paintings and many shape-shifting, gender-bending ensembles  sometimes his own designs  for stage, cover art, videos and photos. Only about a third of the garments made the trip from the shows point of origin, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. But they will include 11 for Ziggy Stardust, Mr. Bowies best-known character, and the Union Jack coat he collaborated on with Alexander McQueen. There will also be ephemera dating to Mr. Bowies childhood (he was born David Robert Jones in 1947) and examples of handwritten lyrics and projections of his most influential music videos. The material should convey Mr. Bowies wide-ranging achievement and also  as the museums news release says  repatriate him into the territory of cutting-edge visual and performing art that is his natural home.

Kristen Wiig plays the crinkly-nosed co-worker on whom Walter has a crush; Adam Scott is the leader of the new tech-jerk bosses who have Walters job on the line. And Sean Penn is the mysterious photographer behind Walters travels to Iceland, Afghanistan and other stunning far-off places. Though it is a celebration of modesty, there is also quite a lot of vanity in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. There is also a contradiction: An ordinary fellow should not have to be quite so special to win our admiration. And this version of Walter Mitty undermines some of the democratic whimsy that has made his story such an appealing and durable modern myth. He used to be one of us: a self-deluded dreamer charmed by his unruly creative powers, a willing prisoner of his appetite for escapism. But now our identification gives way to envy, and he is another one of those enchanted people the rest of us can only dream of becoming.

(CBS) MADAM SECRETARY Ta Leoni stars as Elizabeth McCord, a college professor and former C.I.A. analyst turned newly appointed secretary of state, who battles office politics and circumvents protocol as she navigates issues in the White House and abroad. Then there are matters with her husband and two children at home. Tim Daly plays her supportive spouse; Bebe Neuwirth is her chief of staff; Geoffrey Arend is her speechwriter; Keith Carradine is the president, and her former mentor; and Zeljko Ivanek (above left, with Mr. Carradine and Ms. Leoni) is his Dick Cheney-esque chief of staff. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the obvious inspiration, but this is Hillary with a human face: Ta Leoni, who has a husky voice and a loose, engaging manner, is an unusually likable beauty, Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. As Elizabeth McCord, she has all the brains and determination of the original and none of the political ambition and baggage. Ms. Stanley added that a closer model for Mrs. Clinton can be found in the character of Alicia Florrick, the wife of a politician brought down by a sex scandal in The Good Wife. That shows sixth season begins at 9:30, with Alicia refusing to run for states attorney. She stands by his side for a while, then leaves him and restarts her legal career from scratch, Ms. Stanley said. Of the two series, The Good Wife stands out because it strikes the right balance of network-mandated virtue and cable-inspired vice. Madam Secretary has some good moments, but it would be better if its heroine were just a little bit worse. ",2014-09-21T06:50:12+0000

He refuted Hitlers attempt to disclaim war responsibility, said it was futile for Germany to try to dissociate France and England, and declared French soldiers would fight to the end to crush the system of threats and alarms. A Radio Agency report from Brussels said some dikes of the Albert Canal had been opened to cause floods between Antwerp and Lige, thus making it impossible for an enemy army to pass the north and northeastern frontiers with offensive weapons. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said Englands war budget would be presented to the House of Commons Wednesday. German radio stations started anti-French broadcasts.

It was expected he would be succeeded by Willi Stoph, who has been acting premier. Mr. Grotewohl, a former Social Democrat, was regarded as a traitor by West European socialists because of his leading role in merging the Social Democratic party with the Communist party in 1946 to form the Communist-run Socialist Union party. A spokesman for the West German Socialist party said Mr. Grotewohl will always bear the stigma of sacrificing the Social Democratic party in the Soviet zone of Germany. He was also responsible for the death and imprisonment of thousands of fellow Social Democrats, the spokesman said. Politically, he has been a dead man for the past few years, he said, but he still served as bait for the regime.  New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Sept. 22, 1964",2014-09-21T16:58:02+0000

In January, the Agnes Varis Trust announced a $3 million gift that allowed Gibney Dance to take over and renovate a 36,000-square-foot space at 280 Broadway, next to City Hall, that Dance New Amsterdam relinquished when it declared bankruptcy a year ago. Over three years, the Mellon gift will provide 30 artists with a three-week residency at Gibneys other Manhattan space, 890 Broadway in the Flatiron district, where the company has been based since its founding in 1991. In 2011 the company significantly expanded its footprint in the building with additional studios; with the Mellon grant, it is establishing a choreographic center there. The Dance in Process program has been in pilot mode for the past two years with virtually no financial backing. The Mellon support will give it real depth and will really ground it, Gina Gibney, the chief executive and artistic director of Gibney Dance, said in an interview. We will be able to support these dance artists at a whole new level. The residency will focus specifically on midcareer artists, a demographic often left out of major funding support in favor of so-called established or emerging artists.",2014-09-21T21:02:59+0000

(TCM) STARRING BRIGITTE BARDOT Turner Classic Movies celebrates the 80th birthday (its actually not till Sunday) of Ms. Bardot, the French actress for whom the term sex kitten was coined, with five of her signature films. The tribute begins with And God Created Woman (1956), which helped rocket Ms. Bardot to international stardom  and popularized the bikini in the process  in her role, directed by Roger Vadim, as a wanton teenage orphan in love with one brother (Jean-Louis Trintignant, above, with Ms. Bardot) but married to the other (Christian Marquand). This round and voluptuous little French miss is put on spectacular display and is rather brazenly ogled from every allowable point of view, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, calling her a phenomenon you have to see to believe. The lineup continues with Michel Boisronds Une Parisienne (1957), with Ms. Bardot as a daughter of the French president who falls in love with his chief of staff (Henri Vidal) and flirts with a prince (Charles Boyer), at 9:45; Marc Allgrets Plucking the Daisy (1956), in which she portrays a provocative Parisian schoolgirl, at 11:30; The Night Heaven Fell (1958), with Ms. Bardot, whose marriage to the films director, Mr. Vadim, ended in 1957, as a convent girl who moves in with relatives in Spain and romances a murderer (Stephen Boyd), at 1:30 a.m.; and Jean-Luc Godards Contempt (1964), in which a film adaptation of The Odyssey produced by an American (Jack Palance) and directed by Fritz Lang (as himself), causes friction between a screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his wife (Ms. Bardot), at 3:15.

G.M. recalled 2.6 million cars with the switch this year, more than a decade after engineers inside the company first spotted a problem.

The company said it was pulling out of the country entirely and would sell its assets. It has three factories, about 450 employees and annual sales of about $77 million in Venezuela. Clorox, which is based in California, said in a statement that for nearly three years it had to sell more than two-thirds of its products at prices fixed by the government, even as high inflation caused its costs to rise sharply. It said recent price increases were nowhere near sufficient. Clorox sells bleach and other household cleaning products in Venezuela. Venezuela suffers from inflation of more than 60 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods, a situation that could be exacerbated by Cloroxs exit.

And in the case of the British photographer and T contributor David Sims and the hairstylist Guido Palau, early collaborations proved to be the spark that ignited their careers. Both hail from similar backgrounds, having grown up around not sophisticated London, as Palau describes it, listening to a lot of David Bowie, punk and New Wave music. They formed an easy friendship in the mid 80s and soon teamed up behind the lens, building a portfolio of test pictures that would define their respective styles: Sims would often cast lanky kids off the street, letting them do whatever they felt like in front of the camera, while Palau created non-hair that was usually messy, unwashed and always offhandedly cool. The look was a precursor to grunge and quickly caught the attention of Calvin Klein, who hired the duo to shoot his CK campaign featuring Kate Moss in 1993. It was a pivotal moment for Sims and Palau, yet neither realized it at the time. I didnt think even for a minute wed end up making anything like a living from it, says Sims.

Early films like Albert Falzons Morning of the Earth (1971) and Crystal Voyager (1974) marked a moment when wholesome 60s representations of surfing (the Beach Boys, Frankie Avalon) gave way to depictions that were entwined with the counterculture. Both films featured exhilarating camerawork (by the surfer George Greenough, also responsible for inventing the modern surfboard fin), heady but mellow psych-rock soundtracks and an underlying message about the sanctity of nature. This month, the boutique imprint Anthology Recordings, part of the influential Mexican Summer label, reissues these two rare film soundtracks on heavyweight wax. And tonight, the label is screening a rare archival print of Morning of the Earth at Anthology Film Archives in New York (no relation to the record label).

(13) SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET IN CONCERT WITH THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC Live From Lincoln Center kicks off its 40th-anniversary season with Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheelers musical thriller, starring the Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel as the bloodthirsty barber and the British actress Emma Thompson as the adoring pie maker Mrs. Lovett. There are trade-offs in seeing Sweeney Todd in concert, of course, Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times about this production, conducted by Alan Gilbert. The plots intricate comings and goings are not easy to delineate clearly, and the horrific action is impossible without a full stage of scenery. But the upside to seeing (or rather, hearing) Sweeney played by a world-class orchestra made up for such awkwardness, he added. Mr. Sondheims score seems to grow more majestic each time you hear it (and more boisterous with raucous good-bad spirits), and the forward thrust of the drama as it reels into nightmare territory remains a model of musical theater writing.

This chilling exchange reminded me of a conversation I once had on a London bus with a Somali refugee, who swerved from banal chitchat into dark reminiscence. He recalled a moment in Mogadishu when he was forced to recite his genealogy, the string of grandfathers names that place all Somalis within their clans, and he borrowed a school friends lineage, as his own would have marked him for death.

Ward and Ken Burns, No. 6 in its second week on the hardcover nonfiction list. But every now and then a book arrives that reminds you naming can be an art in itself; the best subtitles work almost like line breaks in poetry, forcing you to re-evaluate what came before. So lets pause a moment to appreciate Caitlin Doughtys Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, new at No. 14, which has the sit-up-and-take-notice subtitle And Other Lessons From the Crematory. Doughty is a young undertaker from Los Angeles who has made it her mission to demystify death, encouraging customers and the public at large to embrace a D.I.Y. approach to funerals. They are grossed out, she told The Atlantic in a recent online interview, but thats because theyve been told their whole lives that death and bodies are best kept to the professionals and that they are dangerous. Most corpses are safer than living bodies. Corpses dont decompose immediately. Theyre not a time bomb of deadness waiting to attack. Theyre your mom or your husband, or the shell of them, at least. . . . Your average corpse is completely safe. Im not sure how soothing I find this pep talk  its not putrefaction I fear, its death  but I do admire Doughtys cheerful sang-froid. I bet shes excellent at her job.",2014-09-26T14:42:56+0000

The Germans were discovered in a position from which they were dislodged after a smart skirmish and they retired. The South African force lost one killed, one wounded and two horses killed. The patrol then fell back. Regimental Sergeant-Major Thomas, of the 5th Regiment, behaved with the greatest gallantry, picking up a wounded rifleman and removing him out of danger while under heavy fire.

Or the couturier Stephan Janson, who years ago left the limelight in order to dress a more discriminating set of women. And after creating interiors for clients like Vera Wang and Anna Wintour, the decorator Stephen Sills passed up the opportunity to move into a palatial home, choosing instead to pour his heart and soul into a tiny, perfect apartment. Elsewhere in the issue, the Brussels-based designers Jorge Almada and Anna-Marie Midy forgo modern luxuries in favor of cowboy charm in their rustic Mexican casita; Jody Rosen gets twisted up in a convention as old as time  the humble knot  and meets one of its greatest champions; Malcolm Gladwell and Sarah Silverman politely decline cookies made of crickets, among other dubious temptations; and we examine the legacy of the legendary Braun designer Dieter Rams, whose career can be best summed up with the words less but better.

Attacked in front and on their flank, the German troops retired in disorder toward Assche, leaving in our hands many prisoners and wounded as well as several caissons. To-day, apparently with the intention of avenging this defeat, Malines was bombarded by long-distance guns and important forces made a general movement along our front. Between Malines and Alost the several German attacks against us failed. Toward Alost, our division of cavalry succeeded in taking the German left wing in the rear. In short, the German attack has failed and our troops have without difficulty preserved the positions acquired from Antwerp to Malines. There, however, the station has suffered severely. Many houses have collapsed, others are on fire. A dozen civilians have been killed. The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 29, 1914",2014-09-28T09:00:02+0000

The shooting occurred in mid-afternoon in the middle of the main street. The assassin was described as a dark-haired young man of medium height wearing dark glasses and a green shirt.

It left more than 100,000 people dead and uncounted others maimed or traumatized by rape. Four years of court hearings dealt with the 11 charges, including genocide, brought against Mr. Karadzic. He is accused of being responsible for the siege of Sarajevo, the execution of more than 7,000 captive men and boys in Srebrenica, and the brutal ethnic cleansing of towns and villages in 1992.
