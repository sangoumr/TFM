But when Loyly, a commanding new structure built along the edge of the Baltic Sea, opened last week, it became Helsinkis first true public sauna. It has all the hallmarks of a true sauna, which until now have been relegated to Finns homes: It is heated by wood, features smoke and has an accessible body of water to jump into at the end. Jasper Paakkonen, a Finnish actor, avid environmentalist and partner in the project, thinks of the shell-like design as a tunturi, the Finnish word for something thats between a hill and a mountain (which stands out on the flat terrain).

It is, in its chillingly objective way, scarier than anything in Oatess new collection, THE DOLL-MASTER AND OTHER TALES OF TERROR (Mysterious Press, $24)  which, as it happens, contains a story about another teenage girl who gets in the wrong car. The smooth-talking male predator in this new one, Big Momma, keeps a very large metaphor as a house pet: the title character is a 20-foot-long reticulated python. Theres nothing of the supernatural in either story, or for that matter in any of the tales of terror in the present collection, but Oatess brand of horror has never required the invocation of other worlds: This world is terrible enough for her. Everything she writes, in whatever genre, has an air of dread, because she deals in vulnerabilities and inevitabilities, in the desperate needs that drive people like Connie and poor young Violet of Big Momma to their fates. A sense of helplessness is the essence of horror, and Oates conveys that feeling as well as any writer around, whether the powerlessness in question is that of a victim or, as in the title story of The Doll-Master, that of someone who is unable to stop doing harm to others: Obsession can be a kind of vulnerability, too.",2016-06-01T16:19:32+0000

us,Five Super-Simple Swimsuit Brands to Know,"Since launching her eponymous line in 2012, the designer Shaina Mote has won die-hard fans, who rely on the Los Angeles-based label for its versatile, elevated basics. Those fans, however, have had to fend for themselves in the swimwear category  until now. Today, Mote launches a capsule line of swimwear that stays true to the distinctive, functional aesthetic shes perfected in her main line. The expansion was borne out of Motes struggle to find a suit that fit into her own life: I felt there was a little bit of a void for a type of swimwear that can be used in an active environment as well as one thats leisurely, she says. To fulfill that mandate, Mote created a six-piece collection, which was inspired by the clean lines found in the work of the Mexican architect Luis Barragn. One innovation she struck upon: She eliminated the top stitch typically found on swimsuits, so that each style would mesh into the body, and lie more flush with the skin. With so much attention paid to the fit and cut, its no wonder Mote decided to keep the color palette as simple as possible. Every piece in the line, which has been crafted from dead-stock Italian fabric, is black. I wanted to make sure I was presenting the customer with something that was really accessible and travels well, she says. Since this is my first swimwear collection, I really wanted to nail down those basics and core styles.",2016-06-02T15:39:03+0000

Cernan soared into orbit today [June 3] after a perfect takeoff, but problems threatened the scheduled linkup with a target vehicle in space. Geminis orbital manoeuvres started off well with a successful docking adapter (ATDA). But then, with the target only ten feet away, the astronauts found their linkup blocked by a shroud over the docking cone that made the target look like an angry alligator with its jaws agape. Ground control then postponed the linkup indefinitely, leaving open the possibility that Lt. Comdr. Cernan might be sent into space to dislodge the shroud. As Gemini-9 approached the ATDA on the first rendezvous Lt. Col. Stafford reported: Ive got a weird-looking machine up here. Its got alligator jaws.

That was the interpretation in well informed quarters tonight [June 5] of the Nazi raid last night on Alexandria, Great Britains main naval base in the eastern Mediterranean. More than one hundred persons were killed and hundreds of others were wounded. One of Fuehrer Adolf Hitlers first objectives, following the capture of Crete, would be to render untenable the British naval headquarters in Egypt, cripple the Royal Navy and leave Germany in control of the eastern Mediterranean, informed circles at London declared. The more the Nazis could disorganize the British fleets positions in those waters the easier a sea invasion of Cyprus and Syria would become, it was pointed out. It was believed here that last nights attack on Alexandria was the forerunner of increasingly heavy bombing raids on that port. The Nazi planes, operating, it is believed from airports in Greece and the Dodecanese Islands, poured tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs on Alexandria, according to a communiqu issued by the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.

But other aspects of the case suggest a different interpretation, signaling that the cultural and legal responses to rape are shifting, in the direction that victims and their supporters have long fought for. Turners light sentence means that the reform they advocate is incomplete. But his conviction, the punishment he received from Stanford and the public outcry over his sentence all suggest that men who act like Turner have far more reason to think theyll pay a price than they once had.",2016-06-09T20:26:06+0000

us,National Briefing,"Roman Catholic legislators say they have been publicly shamed during Mass and disinvited from parish events as the Philadelphia Archdiocese campaigns against a bill that would give victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue the church. State Representative Nick Miccarelli said he was shocked to learn that the weekly bulletin at his church targeted him. Under the headline Just So You Are Aware, the announcement read, State Representative Miccarelli voted in favor of House Bill 1947, which states that private institutions can be sued as far as 40 years ago for millions of dollars, while public institutions may not be sued for any crimes. Last weekend, a letter by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput was given to all 219 archdiocese parishes urging parishioners to ask their state senators to vote against the bill. Archbishop Chaput wrote that potential lawsuits would unfairly affect schools and parishes that had nothing to do with the long-ago abuse. He also said the financial ramifications could cripple the ministry. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill in April, and it is being considered by the Senate. (AP)",2016-06-10T02:07:12+0000

us,Inside the List,"Bad News: On the surface, Noah Hawleys novel Before the Fall  new on the hardcover fiction list at No. 2  is a standard thriller: It opens with the crash of a private jet off Marthas Vineyard, then backs up to examine the lives of the passengers in an effort to figure out what went wrong. Dig a little deeper, though, and the book turns out to contain an unexpected strand of media criticism. David Bateman, who hired the jet, runs a television station very like Fox News, and one of the novels main story lines involves the efforts of his channels populist blowhard anchor to demonize a survivor. Its definitely a look at the dangers of personality-driven media, Hawley told USA Today last month. We have these personas like OReilly or Chris Matthews or Megyn Kelly, the people who in some ways become the story as well. But Hawley (who, as the showrunner for Fargo on FX, works in the same Rupert Murdoch-owned universe as Fox News) emphasized that he had no particular models in mind. My job as a novelist isnt to draw a thinly veiled version of real people and institutions, he told me via email. It is to try to find the truth of a thing by recreating it in a different form. In this case, he added, the goal was to point out the danger of leaping to conclusions based on limited facts: What happened? What does it mean? These are different questions. Historically the news medias role was to answer the first and leave the second to informed viewers. But somewhere around the turn of the century a shift occurred. Our news now comes prefiltered for meaning, the relevant facts arranged to fit a certain worldview  conservative, liberal  and then delivered as if they were objective truth. Facts that dont fit that worldview are left out. As a result, conservative people live in a different America than liberal people. Not only can we no longer agree on the meaning of events. We literally cant agree on the events themselves.",2016-06-10T14:51:33+0000

For visa specialists, branding wizards, a high-powered sports lawyer. It had him hacking through jungles of marketing jargon. His Midtown Manhattan office was cluttered with cartons of new business cards, boxes of hats, sample jerseys. There was a litter of unorganized receipts on the desk. In 18 months hed racked up 250,000 frequent flier miles. Hed watched the Rugby World Cup in London from the Royal Box at Olympic Stadium; someone joked he could plunge New Zealand into a national depression if he lured their stars to America. Hed delved into venue contracts, hot-dog sales projections and turf heights on rugby-compliant fields. In conversation after conversation, on the phone, by email and in person, at mixers and conferences, in airports and foyers and hallways, he pitched his plans, parried critics and cajoled skeptics into the fold. Some guardians of amateur rugby were threatened by the prospect of losing prized club players to a pro league.

On the paperback trade fiction list, a debut collection called Milk and Honey, by the Canadian writer Rupi Kaur, is going strong at No.8 after nine weeks. Kaur is a 23-year-old social media phenom from Toronto who gained attention last year when she fought Instagrams removal of a photo she posted showing menstrual blood. As her audience grew  she now has 475,000 followers on Instagram and 34,500 on Twitter  Kaur earned a reputation not only for her photos and sketches but also for brief, plain-spoken poems tackling feminism, love, trauma and healing in short lines that can be as smooth as pop music (love will hold you/love will call your name) or as jagged as rusty metal (the hurt/the loss/the pain/the breaking). Much of Kaurs appeal comes from this artless vulnerability, like a cross between Charles Bukowski and Cat Power, and from an ingnues willingness to blurt out whatever is on her mind. I was always writing for myself, she told The Times of India this month. I wrote what I needed to write and hear  thats what makes it powerful. And its this honesty that has got me where I am today. Well, that and some serious marketing savvy: Besides Milk and Honey, which she initially self-published, visitors to Kaurs website can also buy jars of artisanal honey branded with her name, from the hives of distinguished queen bees. And she has ideas about how to expand her reach. There have been articles saying that all women need to read my book, she told The Times of India. I ask, why not all men? In fact, that would be even more valuable because we women want to sit down with men and tell them  this is how we feel, this is what we go through.",2016-06-17T17:33:59+0000

Some have pointed to 1976, when Republicans were split in two and had to settle their differences at the national convention that summer. Others point to the chaos and violence of 1968. But a more pertinent example may be the election of 1936. The country was lifting itself out of the Great Depression, helped by the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, but the climb back to prosperity was long and slow, and a mood of populist unrest began to steal across the land. The followers of the demagogues mostly came from the old lower-middle classes, now in an unprecedented stage of frustration and fear, menaced by humiliation, dispossession and poverty, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote in The Politics of Upheaval, published in 1960. They came from provincial and traditionally nonpolitical groups in the population, jolted from apathy into near-hysteria by the shock of economic collapse. Many also came from the evangelical denominations; years of Bible reading and fundamentalist revivalism had accustomed them to millennial solutions.

The local and state authorities had ruled that the death was an accident, concluding that Mr. Johnson had been unable to breathe after getting stuck upside down in the middle of the rolled-up mat while reaching for a gym shoe. But his parents insisted that someone must have killed their son, and they pushed to reopen the investigation. They got a judges order to exhume the body so a second autopsy could be performed. The private pathologist hired by the family reported finding hemorrhaging beneath the skin of Mr. Johnsons jaw and neck and concluded that he had suffered a fatal blow near his carotid artery that appeared to be nonaccidental.

us,Inside the List,"Man in Motion: The singer Bobby Brown has a memoir on this weeks hardcover nonfiction list  Every Little Step, co-written with Nick Chiles, debuts at No. 9. Brown rose to fame with New Edition in the 1980s before drug problems and a turbulent marriage to Whitney Houston made him a mainstay of police blotters, cementing his tabloid reputation as the bad boy of R&B. Those days are behind him now, according to the memoir, but Brown is still willing to share the wild details. Among frank passages about liaisons with Madonna, Janet Jackson and an entertainer at his bachelor party (Let me say the night with the midget blew my mind), Brown casually announces hes also had a close encounter of the paranormal kind: One memorable night, one of the ghosts descended from the ceiling and had sex with me. ... And let me add this: This was before I ever touched any drug besides weed and alcohol. The book isnt all sex and drugs, though. Theres plenty of rock n roll, too. My God, funk was everything to me, Brown says of his listening habits when he was growing up in Boston. When I put on the funk, Id start the dancing. He adds that, in the rough projects where he lived, his sense of rhythm offered him a kind of protection. Although violence was always around us, one of the main ways I battled back then was not with my fists  it was with my dance moves. I wasnt necessarily confident about my singing yet, but I knew I could whup anybodys ass in a dance battle. ... Break dancing, pop locking  man, I was unbelievable.",2016-06-24T14:58:07+0000

Inspired by car fairs and grocery stores, the extreme environment sets the tone for Humeaus fourth-ever solo show, spurred by her interest in what she calls luminous horror. Its trying to create things that at first look very bright and attractive, but are actually horrific. Luminosity is something I think of when looking at the Apple store; they sell light, Humeau says. To me, its the same premise that many religions have sold: to become immortal, you have to become immaterial.",2016-06-24T14:58:59+0000

Now, almost a year late, the square black room, one corner of which is taken up with an open kitchen, is ready. I did not want one of those long, narrow dining rooms, Mr. Berselius said. The restaurant has a spacious garden and a downstairs white-brick bar and lounge. (The dining room has no bar, like a growing number of restaurants.) For his 12- to 15-course tasting menus, which change daily, he is considering dishes like hake smoked in hay, and dry-aged beef with cured beef fat and salted gooseberries. Mr. Berselius is planning to find as many ingredients as possible in the Northeast; caviar from Finland will be one of his few imports.

us,Morning Agenda:  Banking in the Time of Brexit,"BANKING IN THE TIME OF BREXIT Asian and European stocks rallied on Wednesday as the immediate effects of Britains vote to leave the European Union eased a little, Reuters reports. The pound continued to slide before steadying later in the day.Market sentiment was improved by assurances of support from central banks, but uncertainty meant that haven assets like gold and the yen continued to advance.European Union leaders are gathered for the second day of a summit meeting in Brussels to discuss Britains withdrawal and leaders were keen on Tuesday to make sure that Britain and any others tempted to follow in its path knew that leaving would carry a heavy price, as Andrew Higgins and James Kanter report in The New York Times.Shares in banks like Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Barclays recovered some ground on Tuesday, but fears about their ability to sell billions of dollars of derivatives, securitized mortgages and other hard-to-value and sell securities have not waned, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook.One of the best ways to assess a banks broad risk profile is to look at itsexposure to Level 3 securities, which are so opaque and complex they trade rarely, if at all. Risk managers have to literally guess how much a Level 3 asset is worth.According to their annual reports in 2015, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are sitting on the largest piles of Level 3 assets. Reflecting investor concern about the risky assets they own, these three banks trade at a steep discount to their book value. And there are few signs that the selling will let up, as hedge funds have increased their bets against European banks.Concern about Britains future in Europe and its place as a financial hub has made it even harder to offload these securities. All this Brexit uncertainty is drying up the markets, Jan Riepe, a finance professor at the University of Tbingen, said. And because many of these assets are traded over the counter in London, it is even more difficult to value them. Its very dangerous for the banks.Credit default swaps tied to the creditworthiness of European banks do provide some reassurance, Peter Eavis writes in The Upshot. The cost of insuring against defaults by large banks is still far lower than it was during the financial crisis and when European debt markets were plunging. Of course, the cost of the swaps is still much higher than the was the day before the referendum.But it is not Europes Lehman Brothers moment, Neil Irwin writes in The Upshot. After Lehmans bankruptcy, banks hoarded cash and became reluctant to lend to anyone. There are few signs of that happening in response to Britains vote to leave the bloc.The premium that banks charge to lend to one another rose much more after Lehmans collapse than it has done in Britain since last week. Banks still face huge costs as they consider whether to relocate from London to Europe, but it appears that investors still believe that they will weather the storm.In the United States, the Federal Reserve will tell the nations largest banks on Wednesday whether they passed or failed their annual stress tests. All banks proved their resilience in the first round of results, Gina Chon writes in Breakingviews.And as lenders have become better at passing these exams, their payouts have improved. They may be able to continue that this year, but not as much as might be suggested by improved economic conditions, Ms. Chon writes. Britains looming exit from the European Union adds another layer of caution.",2016-06-29T10:36:58+0000
