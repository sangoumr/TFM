Included are volumes and catalogues on a wide variety of Soviet avant-garde movements, from architecture to ceramics, advertising to clothing. (Indeed, there is now so much arcana being uncovered that perhaps the next wave might include a title like ""Sports Heroes of the Russian Avant-Garde."") The most recent is an interesting document for what it says about contemporary Soviet art. First issued in the Soviet Union for export to the West, and now published here, is THE SOVIET ARTS POSTER: Theatre, Cinema, Ballet, Circus, 1917-1987 (Penguin, Paper, $24.95), edited by Nina Baburina and translated by Boris Meerovich and Era Mozolkova. Included are innovative film posters of the early 20's, which, when compared with the best of the later posters, illustrate how bad Soviet applied arts were forced to become under Stalin. Yet much of the book showcases the Western- and Polish-inspired poster images done in the spirit of glasnost.

us,Answering The Mail,"Q. The roof on the south side of our house is shaded most of the day and keeps collecting moss. How do I remove the moss without damaging the shingles, and what can I do to keep it from coming back? A. Garden-supply stores sell numerous products for removing moss, and one I am familiar with is called De-Moss. You can also wash moss off with a copper sulfate solution (one-half ounce to 10 gallons of water). This solution has some residual effect to keep moss from coming back for a while. Because the solution can damage shrubbery and cause harm to metal, flush it off thoroughly. Copper pieces along the roof ridge will help prevent moss growth for about 10 feet down from the ridge. Also, string copper wires horizontally along the roof to protect sections further down. Each wire will prevent moss growth for about four feet below it. Q. Our bathroom has tile around the tub, with pink tiles scattered among the white ones. The effect is atrocious, and we would like to paint all the tile white. Can you suggest how to paint ceramic tile? A. Ceramic tile can be painted with any good grade of alkyd enamel. Clean the surface first with a strong detergent or scouring powder. Rinse off with plain water, then allow the surface to dry for a day or two. Apply a bonding primer coat of white, pigmented shellac like BIN or Enamelac and then apply two coats of the enamel, sanding lightly between coats. Once the tile has been painted, it should be repainted periodically.",1991-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Headliners; Two for the Records,"One takes bases, the other denies them, and both do what they do more than anyone has done it before. On the same day last week, Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers pitched his seventh no-hitter, breaking his own record, and Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics stole his 939th base, edging past Lou Brock as baseball's career stolen base leader. Ryan's game was all the more thrilling for the fact that at 44 years old -- he is also the oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter -- he gave one of his strongest performances ever. Summing up a game in which two-thirds of his 122 pitches were strikes, Ryan said, ""This is my most overpowering night."" Henderson, too, had something more than just another record. At 32, he had stolen more bases in 12 years than Brock did in 19, and did it in 1,000 or so fewer games. Brock, who was on hand to help celebrate, said the new record holder was ""the greatest competitor that ever ran the bases."" Henderson, never one to let praise go unimproved-upon, said, ""Brock is the symbol of great base stealing, but I'm the greatest of all time.""",1991-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Answering The Mail,"Q. The roof on the south side of our house is shaded most of the day and keeps collecting moss. How do I remove the moss without damaging the shingles, and what can I do to keep it from coming back? A. Garden-supply stores sell numerous products for removing moss, and one I am familiar with is called De-Moss. You can also wash moss off with a copper sulfate solution (one-half ounce to 10 gallons of water). This solution has some residual effect to keep moss from coming back for a while. Because the solution can damage shrubbery and cause harm to metal, flush it off thoroughly. Copper pieces along the roof ridge will help prevent moss growth for about 10 feet down from the ridge. Also, string copper wires horizontally along the roof to protect sections further down. Each wire will prevent moss growth for about four feet below it. Q. Our bathroom has tile around the tub, with pink tiles scattered among the white ones. The effect is atrocious, and we would like to paint all the tile white. Can you suggest how to paint ceramic tile? A. Ceramic tile can be painted with any good grade of alkyd enamel. Clean the surface first with a strong detergent or scouring powder. Rinse off with plain water, then allow the surface to dry for a day or two. Apply a bonding primer coat of white, pigmented shellac like BIN or Enamelac and then apply two coats of the enamel, sanding lightly between coats.

Also, string copper wires horizontally along the roof to protect sections further down. Each wire will prevent moss growth for about four feet below it. Q. Our bathroom has tile around the tub, with pink tiles scattered among the white ones. The effect is atrocious, and we would like to paint all the tile white. Can you suggest how to paint ceramic tile? A. Ceramic tile can be painted with any good grade of alkyd enamel. Clean the surface first with a strong detergent or scouring powder. Rinse off with plain water, then allow the surface to dry for a day or two. Apply a bonding primer coat of white, pigmented shellac like BIN or Enamelac and then apply two coats of the enamel, sanding lightly between coats. Once the tile has been painted, it should be repainted periodically.",1991-05-05T05:00:00+0000

No one answered so I called the number listed on my contract, Europcar's central office in Milan. They assured me that a car would be sent to me immediately so I could get to the airport. One-half hour later a service truck appeared with two men to take the car to a nearby town for repairs, but they had no knowledge of a replacement car.

us,Answering The Mail,"Q. The roof on the south side of our house is shaded most of the day and keeps collecting moss. How do I remove the moss without damaging the shingles, and what can I do to keep it from coming back? A. Garden-supply stores sell numerous products for removing moss, and one I am familiar with is called De-Moss. You can also wash moss off with a copper sulfate solution (one-half ounce to 10 gallons of water). This solution has some residual effect to keep moss from coming back for a while. Because the solution can damage shrubbery and cause harm to metal, flush it off thoroughly. Copper pieces along the roof ridge will help prevent moss growth for about 10 feet down from the ridge. Also, string copper wires horizontally along the roof to protect sections further down. Each wire will prevent moss growth for about four feet below it. Q. Our bathroom has tile around the tub, with pink tiles scattered among the white ones. The effect is atrocious, and we would like to paint all the tile white. Can you suggest how to paint ceramic tile? A. Ceramic tile can be painted with any good grade of alkyd enamel. Clean the surface first with a strong detergent or scouring powder. Rinse off with plain water, then allow the surface to dry for a day or two. Apply a bonding primer coat of white, pigmented shellac like BIN or Enamelac and then apply two coats of the enamel, sanding lightly between coats. Once the tile has been painted, it should be repainted periodically.",1991-05-05T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary/May 5-10,"COMPANIES An Overloaded Occidental Is Shedding Debt When the late Armand Hammer was chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, he dismissed at least one would-be successor who dared say the company should pare down its debt. But now that Dr. Hammer is gone, Ray R. Irani, Oxy's new chairman, has a free hand. And last week he started moving toward his stated mission of trimming the company's $8.8 billion of debt by $3 billion this year. He made a deal to sell 50 percent of Trident Energy Inc., a producer of liquefied natural gas, for $600 million to a subsidiary of Hicks, Muse & Company, a Dallas-based investment firm. After taxes and other costs, the deal will yield $432 million for Occidental. Then he sold Oxy's North Sea oil and gas holdings for $1.35 billion to France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and Enterprise Oil P.L.C. of Britain. Mr. Irani is now more than halfway to his goal. And the market likes it. Occidental shares closed the week at $21.125, up $2.125. NCR -- Who Is the Real Winner? Who benefits most from A.T.& T's $7.4 billion purchase of the NCR Corporation? The American Telephone & Telegraph Company says it does; the deal puts it back in the computer business. But the real winners may be the Wall Street firms that advised the companies during their five-month fight. The advisers get millions in fees at a time when dealmaking is all but dead. Dillon Read & Company and Goldman Sachs & Company, which advised NCR, will each receive about $18.5 million. Morgan Stanley & Company, which advised A.T.& T., will get $13.28 million. Proxy solicitation firms also did well. Morrow & Company will receive $1.7 million and Georgeson & Company will receive $2 million for trying to sway NCR's stockholders. And then there were the lawyers. Two firms will split $20 million for the paperwork. Metromedia's Mighty Returns John W. Kluge, the billionaire chairman of the Metromedia Company, has been making money even in the money-losing cellular-telephone business. His formula has been simple: unload as much of your holdings as you can. Last week, he sold Metromedia's cellular telephone company in Philadelphia for $1.1 billion. The buyer was the Comcast Corporation, an operator of cable television systems there. Metromedia, based in Secaucus, N.J., is one of the nation's largest private partnerships. Since 1986, when it began selling its cellular systems in New York, Washington, Baltimore, Boston and Chicago, the partnership has received $3 billion. The company invested just $20 million in Philadelphia a decade ago. Not a bad return for Mr. Kluge. Troubles for G.M.'s Saturn The General Motors Corporation spent $3.5 billion just to get the Saturn Corporation off the ground. It was supposed to be ""a laboratory for all of G.M.,"" said Ronald Glantz, an automobile analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. But last week it announced it would be replacing 1,836 of its 1991 model cars that were filled with the wrong coolant. And another laboratory -- one at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- said Saturn was not as safe as any of the other cars in its class in a front-end collision. Should G.M. and the nation's Saturn owners be worried? ""The data bear little relationship to reality,"" Mr. Glantz said. ""Saturn is under a magnifying glass right now. It was a smooth startup and it's a good product."" USX Bidding Farewell to Steel Carl C. Icahn wants the USX Corporation to sell its steel business, the nation's largest. Mr. Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder, is finally getting his way. Last week, shareholders approved a plan to separate the company's stock into two groups. One would comprise the steel business; the other, the Marathon Oil Company. With two groups of stock, the steel business would be easier to sell. Charles A. Corry, the company's chairman, is talking to potential buyers. Of Batteries, Beer and Bunnies First there was ""Harvey,"" the six-foot rabbit in the 1954 movie starring Jimmy Stewart. This time around, there are two: one mechanical and one played by Leslie Nielsen, the star of ""Naked Gun."" And the bunny masters are suing each other. Eveready, the battery-making subsidiary of the Ralston Purina Company, alleged last week in a lawsuit that the Adolph Coors Company was unfairly parodying its mechanical rabbit in a new series of commercials starring Mr. Nielsen. Coors, in a countersuit, is trying to stop Eveready from interfering with its new campaign. The problem, said Eveready, is that it doesn't want people to associate its bunny with beer.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"The West may have been this country's Manifest Destiny, but in the mid-19th century it had yet to make itself manifest -- few knew what the frontier looked like. In 1863 Albert Bierstadt charged a 25-cent admission to view his 6- by 10-foot panoramic painting ""The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak."" Crowds came, captivated by such minutely observed details as a prairie dog sniffing the air near an Indian encampment. Nobody was better at self-promotion than Bierstadt (1830-1902), who made his initial trip along the Overland Trail in 1859 and found the subject that would make him famous until styles changed; he died forgotten. In ALBERT BIERSTADT: Art & Enterprise (Hudson Hills, $75), Nancy K. Anderson, an assistant curator of American art at the National Gallery of Art, and Linda S. Ferber, chief curator at the Brooklyn Museum, reintroduce and insightfully reassess a painter who gave America a vision of itself. Bierstadt's exalted landscapes, often more grand and pure than reality, offered hope and ""the promise of a second chance at Eden"" for a nation torn by the Civil War. The title's allusion to commerce is a pointed reference to Bierstadt's entrepreneurial instincts, which some felt exceeded his talent. Bierstadt was canny enough to capitalize on the myth of the wilderness, so crucial to the American psyche. But the opportunist who rechristened a painting ""Mount Corcoran"" in a blatant (and successful) effort to shoehorn his work into the newly established Corcoran Gallery also produced remarkable oil sketches of Yosemite National Park. Despite reservations, one contemporary critic acknowledged, ""In the quality of American light, clear, transparent, and sharp in outlines, he is unsurpassed.""",1991-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Elizabeth Murray may well be the finest painter working today, and it is wonderful to see her work gaining a wider audience. Murray's paintings reveal the universal through her concentration on the personal and the domestic. Concentration, like meditation, can be heightened by focusing attention on a simple or familiar object like a dish or a flower. This is a way of clearing one's mind of distractions, permitting the entry of more complex thought. The point of focus becomes an anchor. In this way, Murray's domestic images take on the character of her thought -- her coffee cups burst with the shock of sudden insight. Familiar objects, in her studio or close by, become fused with the fire of her observations. DEBORAH EVERETT Brooklyn",1991-05-12T05:00:00+0000

Some studies show that, after a fall hunt, two to three times as many fawns are born than in a reasonably competitive, nonhunted population. In the long run, when left to their own devices, wildlife populations regulate themselves. We need only look at the millions of acres of national parklands in which hunting and trapping are prohibited to see demonstrated the ability of wildlife to regulate their numbers. JESSICA T.

Beginning in the 1920's, as many as 500 hotels and bungalow colonies catered to the ""organized pursuit of pleasure"" of thousands of vacationers. Ironically, write Myrna Katz Frommer and Harvey Frommer, while the avowed purpose of hotels like the Concord and Grossinger's was to give city people a chance to enjoy the fresh mountain air and the beautiful countryside, memories cling to the inside -- the dining room, the nightclub, the dance studio. (The comedian Mal Z. Lawrence quipped, ""They have an outside here, too?"") Entertainers such as Eddie Fisher, Tony Martin, Neil Sedaka, Jackie Mason and Sid Caesar faced the most critical audience they would ever meet; the Catskills resorts served as a springboard for the pursuit of the American dream. The area was also the true home of improvisation -- the architecture itself was a product of fantasy and necessity -- from the proprietors, who sometimes rented the same room twice, to the musicians who doubled as waiters and bellhops, to the entertainers who nightly played the same show at three hotels, to the medical and law students who earned tuition as busboys.

Recommended colors are gray, brown and green because they distort colors the least; blue lenses can cause the wearer to misinterpret the reds and greens of traffic lights.

(The place names alone are enough to make an Anglophile drool.) Glamis Castle, according to tradition the scene of Macbeth's murder of Duncan, is also included. There, in 1793, Sir Walter Scott wrote that he felt himself ""too far from the living, and somewhat too near the dead."" Mr. Marsden, a photographer and the author of ""The Haunted Realm,"" is not just a dilettante ghost hunter. He calls himself ""an independent folklorist"" who collects stories of inexplicable phenomena in order to ""restore a little imagination into a world that is daily being dispossessed of any mystery through the relentless and consuming march of science and technology."" There are, he says, themes and recurring stories that come down to us through generations, and we must remember our ancient mysteries lest we lose our past.

A string of miniature barns in front of a mammoth concrete grain silo measure the distance between the reality of mega-agriculture and the myth of the family farm.
