Ms. Hartman made her name documenting the Studio 54 scene in the 1970s. (Her most famous image may be of Bianca Jagger at the nightclub, astride a horse.) Today she remains a tireless fixture of Manhattan night life, flitting about in her tinted glasses, cropped blond hairdo and high-end designer plumage, attending openings, parties and fashion events, in pursuit of revealing glimpses of the glitterati.

Although it isnt clear precisely what Barron means here  arent an abundance of  talent and a surge of creativity kind of the same thing?  his enthusiasm, for both horror in general and Fracassi in particular, is unmistakable, and his words carry some weight: Barron was himself the genres hot kid 10 years ago and is now, after a bunch of nominations and awards, practically an minence grise. By modern days he appears to mean since the 1970s and 80s, a period he calls the heyday of North American category horror (while citing, among other touchstones, a couple of novels written in the 50s and 60s).

Tempting as it is to picture the sentient heads of Crichton and Tolkien preserved in jars somewhere, Futurama style, spinning new stories, the reality is more mundane: Both books were exhumed from the authors files in varying states of readiness and prepared for publication by their estates. In Tolkiens case that means readers will find copious notes from his third son, Christopher Tolkien, who traces the storys evolution through a series of epic poems that are  like much of the Middle-earth canon  wildly inventive and technically flawless and also sort of insufferable at times.

One of the imams who preached at the mosque was a part-time real estate agent. The attempted military coup last July lasted until the wee hours of the night, yet my little green mosque was, as usual, open and ready early the next morning for prayer; the locksmith whose shop was part of the complex waddled in by 9 a.m., and the happy blend of prayer and small-time hustle in Istanbul continued unabated.",2017-06-14T09:00:09+0000

Every day, he and his wife Deanna take a walk down to the pier for what Templeton calls a daily photo mission, a mental and physical exercise that continues to hone the situational awareness he developed as a skateboarder. Being out in the streets, a lot of times in bad neighborhoods, trying to skate spots, is what gave me an eye for looking 20 paces ahead and being ready for something, Templeton says. Many of the fleeting moments that Templeton has captured throughout his career, from teenage kissers to surfers and skaters, are loosely arranged by theme in the exhibition Amalgamated Fragments, on view at Danziger Gallery in New York City through July 27.",2017-06-15T17:02:35+0000

Visible only to children, this catlike woodland spirit springs from the imagination of the great Japanese animator and auteur Hayao Miyazaki. In this 1988 Studio Ghibli film, totoros  from dustball size to as large as a bus  provide joy and solace to Satsuki and her younger sister, Mei, who have accompanied their father to a rural area far from home while their hospitalized mother recovers from a mysterious illness. Although the girls odyssey ends happily, the film never denies the omnipresent specter of mortality or the power of childrens fears. GKids and Fathom Events will present the movie, accompanied by international shorts, in select theaters on Sunday at 12:55 p.m. (in English) and on Monday at 7 p.m. (in Japanese with English subtitles) as the opening event in Studio Ghibli Fest 2017, a six-film monthly Miyazaki series.

Where responsibility once referred to the duties of the nation to its citizens, or of the citizens to the nation, or of fellow citizens to one another, it now came to mean the obligations of the individual to himself. Responsibility was personal responsibility. You might date the beginning of this shift to 1968, when Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, announced in a speech at the Republican National Convention that it was time to stop blaming society for peoples failings and to start accepting that each individual is accountable for his actions. You might date the completion of this shift to 1993, when President Bill Clinton exhorted Americans in his first Inaugural Address to demand responsibility from all and to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing.",2017-06-30T09:00:09+0000
