us,Playbook Full of Tricks Gives Boise State Dramatic and Defining Victory,"GLENDALE, Ariz., Monday, Jan. 2  After a hook-and-lateral, a Statue of Liberty play and a halfback toss launched the Boise State football team to an upset that will long resonate in college football lore, the star tailback Ian Johnson might have saved the nights most memorable surprise for the postgame interview. With the national television cameras focused on him after the chaos of Boise States 43-42 overtime victory over Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, Johnson proposed to his girlfriend, the Boise State cheerleader Christine Barbara Popadics. Popadics was so stunned and thrilled that she could barely speak. Just like everyone else watching. She had no idea it was coming, Johnson said. Neither did Oklahoma. Johnsons proposal capped a dizzying, riveting, back-and-forth game that will be remembered as one of the most exciting in college football history. Boise squandered an 18-point second-half lead, tied the score with seven seconds remaining on a hook-and-lateral play, then used two more trick plays in overtime to cap a perfect 13-0 season. (Ohio State is the only other undefeated team.) This probably goes down in the history of college football, Boise quarterback Jared Zabransky said. It can be argued as the best game ever. The lasting memory of the game will most likely be the combination of three crazy trick plays  called Statue, Toss Halfback Pass and Circus. But the lasting effect  with a team that plays on blue turf competing against one of college footballs bluebloods  may be the removal of doubt about whether teams from smaller conferences can beat champions of the six major conferences. No one can doubt the daring of Boises play-calling. On the final play, Broncos Coach Chris Petersen decided to leave his offense on the field for a 2-point conversion attempt after Boise matched Oklahomas touchdown to open overtime. The call was for Statue, in which Boise lines up with three wide receivers stacked on the right side. The real guts by Petersen and Bryan Harsin, Boises 30-year old offensive coordinator, may have come with sticking with the play after Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops called a timeout. Boise went with the same look, with the stacked right side, showing a formation from which they often throw a wide receiver screen. Instead, Zabransky faked a screen pass to Legedu Naanee on his right, then hid the ball behind his back with his left hand. Johnson never moved, staying frozen until the fake was properly sold. Johnson then broke left against the grain of play, grabbed the ball from behind Zabranskys back and strolled untouched around the left side into the end zone. The final 2 yards of his 101-yard night will forever be remembered in Boise history. The 2-point conversion made it 43-42 and set off a wild celebration on the Boise sideline and in the stands, where a majority of the 73,719 fans were decked out in Bronco blue and orange. We needed a play like that to get it over with, Petersen said after the game with a smile. But the two plays that got them there may have been even more creative. After Oklahoma tailback Adrian Peterson took the first play of overtime 25 yards for a touchdown, Boise needed to convert on a fourth-and-2 from the 5-yard line. Things got crazy, though, when Zabransky left his usual spot under center and broke in motion to the left. Vinny Perretta, a tailback who hadnt thrown a pass all year, then lined up under center and threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Derek Schouman. That call was for Toss Halfback Pass, and it was the first time Boise had run it in a game this season. Weve been practicing it for the past month or so, and it couldnt have worked out any better, said Schouman, who also caught a 10-yard pass on third-and-8 to extend the overtime drive. Just to get to overtime, though, Boise pulled off perhaps the grandest of its three trick plays. On fourth-and-18 play from midfield, the Broncos called a hook-and-lateral play, Circus. They think so little of it that they hadnt run it in a game or practice all season. They only did it while goofing off during informal Friday walk-through sessions. And even then it didnt really work. Usually we just run it when were joking around, Schouman said. I never thought that wed actually run it, never mind for a touchdown. Boise lined up with three wide receivers to the right and Drisan James alone on the left. James caught the ball about 12 yards from the line of scrimmage, with the defense playing soft to prevent him from getting a first down. The key to the play was Jamess ability to fake that he was going to try and run for a first down. He tucked the ball and ran about 4 yards, which drew all the Oklahoma defenders toward him. Then he pitched the ball 4 yards behind him to Jerard Rabb, who had run over from the cluster of receivers on the other side of the field. I didnt even want to look after I pitched it, James said. But the pitch went seamlessly, and Rabb knew almost instantly that James had executed the perfect fake. When he caught it, he sucked the defensive backs, safeties and corners, they all came straight to him, Rabb said. He held it just long enough for me to escape around the side. As soon as I got the ball and took about two steps, I was gone. Other than the time I was getting chased by a pit bull, it was the fastest Ive run in my life. Rabbs mad dash to force overtime with seven seconds left also chased away some of Boises demons. Thanks to Paul Thompsons four turnovers, which included a pick-six by Boise defensive back Marty Tadman and a fumble deep in Oklahoma territory, Boise was able to build a 28-10 third-quarter lead. But Oklahoma gutted its way back into the game, and scored two touchdowns in the final 90 seconds of regulation to go ahead. The first score came on a 5-yard pass from Thompson to Quentin Chaney to cut the Boise lead to 28-26. The drama came on the 2-point conversion; Oklahoma attempted it three times, thanks to a pass-interference call on Boise and a pre-snap motion penalty on the Sooners. On the third play, Thompson found Jauquin Iglesias in the end zone to tie the score at 28-28. Oklahoma cornerback Marcus Walker then seemingly decided matters when he returned an interception 33 yards for a touchdown with 1:02 remaining. The game isnt over until the clock hits zero, Walker said in a stunned Oklahoma locker room. Many players wept openly. But you would think the game is over then, right? By then, it had only just begun. And on a deeper level, the Broncos were able to legitimize the very game that they were permitted to play. For the first time this season, there are five B.C.S. games this season instead of four because the smaller conferences fought hard for access to the B.C.S. and won. In one surreal night, the long battle spearheaded by Tulanes president, Scott Cowan, seemed worthwhile. The gap is decreasing fast, Johnson said. The smaller schools are going to start getting recognition now. Just because we havent been around forever doesnt mean we dont play great football. Johnson and his teammates showed the college football establishment they have a few tricks up their sleeves. And if you dont believe him, just ask a certain Boise State cheerleader.

The often circuslike atmosphere of the trial, as well as the murder of three defense lawyers, led groups like Human Rights Watch to condemn the tribunal as flawed and illegitimate. And the charge for which Saddam Hussein received the death penalty did not include his most heinous acts. His execution must still remind the world of the horror of the atrocities he committed while in power.

Napoli, an artist born and bred in New Orleans, returned to her hometown a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, she sifted through the detritus in her neighborhood. She found sofas and pianos and hand-sewn lace, but she picked up only the abandoned dresser drawers. Originally she envisioned them as receptacles for a new project. But the more drawers she salvaged, the more she saw promise in them alone. I began to realize that these drawers could be a symbol of the households that were lost, Ms. Napoli said. She collected 700 drawers from across the city, meticulously labeling each with the address where it was found. They became the basis for Floodwall, above, an installation now on view on the Liberty Street Bridge, near the World Financial Center. Balanced along the span of the bridge like luggage left behind, the drawers are revealingly empty: once home to family secrets and worldly goods, they now contain only layers of liner paper and imprints from letters and photographs. But they are not anonymous. Working with neighborhood associations, Ms. Napoli found some of their owners.

Napoli, an artist born and bred in New Orleans, returned to her hometown a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit, she sifted through the detritus in her neighborhood. She found sofas and pianos and hand-sewn lace, but she picked up only the abandoned dresser drawers. Originally she envisioned them as receptacles for a new project. But the more drawers she salvaged, the more she saw promise in them alone. I began to realize that these drawers could be a symbol of the households that were lost, Ms. Napoli said. She collected 700 drawers from across the city, meticulously labeling each with the address where it was found. They became the basis for Floodwall, above, an installation now on view on the Liberty Street Bridge, near the World Financial Center. Balanced along the span of the bridge like luggage left behind, the drawers are revealingly empty: once home to family secrets and worldly goods, they now contain only layers of liner paper and imprints from letters and photographs. But they are not anonymous. Working with neighborhood associations, Ms. Napoli found some of their owners. With a partner, she began an ambitious oral history and database, cataloging the lives of New Orleans residents through this most steadfast of possessions. My father surprised me with that cedar chest for my trousseau, one woman recalled; another kept her sons belongings in a drawer, decades after he was murdered.

us,Living With Fidel,"Within the revolution, everything; outside the revolution, nothing, has long been a favorite saying of Fidel Castros, the memorable, simple-sounding formula he has cited when he has felt the need to silence a critic, justify an apparently indefensible repressive measure or simply remind Cubans that his all-seeing eye is ever upon them. Jess Dazs ambitious novel The Initials of the Earth was published in Cuba in 1987, which makes it by definition a within-the-revolution product. But that distinction was, it seems, hard won  the prize at the end of an arduous journey from nothingness to the sanctifying light of full, Fidel-approved being. In an essay appended to this first English-language edition, Ambrosio Fornet, a friend of the writers, tells us that Daz wrote a version of the book in the late 70s that was condemned ... to the limbo of a tacit censure. When the censure was lifted (presumably also tacitly) in the early 80s, Daz had, we are told, the composure and professional sobriety to sit down and rewrite the novel from scratch.",2007-01-07T05:00:00+0000

Well, reconsider, and do yourself a favor by reading Blechmans charming book. For once, a subtitle that doesnt exaggerate! For many of us, pigeons are just nuisances who foul the ground with their copious droppings. Yet the pigeon also inspires cults of rabid admirers who race them, breed them and show them off in pageants as bizarre as any snooty dog show. Blechman wittily traces the history of this gentle, intelligent, misunderstood bird  pigeon hatred, he shows, is a recent phenomenon  and journeys into its obsessive subcultures.

us,Wrestling with Gravy," My parents battled through an acrimonious divorce right at the end of the war that supposedly made their generation the Greatest. They were almost central-castingly perfect opposites: Don Reynolds was short and fat, and at first meeting seemed like a hick from the dustbowls of Oklahoma and Texas; Edith Remick was a tall, dark-haired beauty, a refined and privately schooled graduate of Smith who had been brought up in Quincy, Massachusetts. She was given to upper-middle-class maladies like mild depression, frequently saw doctors for no apparent reason, and spent an inordinate amount of time resting at home. He was a whirlwind, she a lovely and fragile icicle. In the late thirties, he briefly owned part of a Quincy newspaper. One of his biggest advertisers was an upscale department store specializing in men's clothing, named Remick's. They met at a company picnic, and he swept her off her feet. She'd never seen anyone like him: such energy, such surprising smarts, such wild visions of the future. And such a sexual drive. I don't know whether he loosed her panties the very first night or was forced to wait till marriage-but I would bet the ranch, if I had one, that it was on his mind, raging, from the moment they met and every moment thereafter. He told her-and her family-that he intended to live in Quincy for the rest of their lives together. Within a month of their marriage, he sold his interest in the Quincy newspaper and announced that they were moving to Texas. He didn't ask her and hadn't forewarned her or anyone in the family; he just announced it, and off they went. Men could get away with things like that then. He then proceeded to hit the road in search of additional businesses. My sister, Nancy, was born in San Antonio in 1938, and the three of them moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he established the Southwestern Publishing Company, a solely-owned enterprise that operated half a dozen small newspapers. I was born in February 1942, barely two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Dad was drafted shortly after that. He grumbled about the army but finagled his way to Europe, where all the glamour was. ",2007-01-07T16:54:00+0000

us,American Fascists," I grew up in a small farming town in upstate New York where my life, and the life of my family, centered on the Presbyterian Church. I prayed and sang hymns every Sunday, went to Bible school, listened to my father preach the weekly sermon and attended seminary at Harvard Divinity School to be a preacher myself. America was a place where things could be better if we worked to make them better, and where our faith saved us from despair, self-righteousness and the dangerous belief that we knew the will of God or could carry it out. We were taught that those who claimed to speak for God, the self-appointed prophets who promised the Kingdom of God on earth, were dangerous. We had no ability to understand God's will. We did the best we could. We trusted and had faith in the mystery, the unknown before us. We made decisions - even decisions that on the outside looked unobjectionably moral - well aware of the numerous motives, some good and some bad, that went into every human act. In the end, we all stood in need of forgiveness. We were all tainted by sin. None were pure. The Bible was not the literal word of God. It was not a self-help manual that could predict the future. It did not tell us how to vote or allow us to divide the world into us and them, the righteous and the damned, the infidels and the blessed. It was a book written by a series of ancient writers, certainly fallible and at times at odds with each other, who asked the right questions and struggled with the mystery and transcendence of human existence. We took the Bible seriously and therefore could not take it literally. ",2007-01-07T16:54:00+0000

Alex Goldfarb with Marina Litvinenko will tell the story of Mr. Litvinenko and his career as a spy in the style of a political thriller. Mr. Litvinenko died of a high dose of the radioactive isotope polonium 210 in London in November, and before his death he accused the Russian government of poisoning him. Free Press is an imprint of Simon & Schuster.  The Sobol Award for Fiction, an online contest recruiting unpublished fiction writers, has been canceled, according to a statement on the contest's Web site (sobolaward.com). The statement said that an insufficient number of manuscripts were submitted. The promised prize for the winner of the contest, first announced in September, was representation with Sobol Literary Enterprises and a book deal with Touchstone, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. All entrants will be refunded the mandatory $85 entry fee, the statement said. The creators of the contest have endured criticism that the contest unfairly exploited unknown writers for money.  The Central Intelligence Agency has blocked Valerie Wilson from writing about her experience as an undercover officer for the agency in a new book, Newsweek reported. But the flagship imprint of Simon & Schuster is still planning to publish her book sometime this year. Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, declined comment. ",2007-01-09T10:52:00+0000

House of Meetings is Amiss 19th book. His first, a novel called The Rachel Papers, was published in 1973, when Amis was 24. It did not receive a warm welcome in this newspaper. Writing in the Book Review, Grace Glueck described the book as a crotch-and-armpit saga of late adolescence that would probably not put Amiss father, the novelist Kingsley Amis, in a competitive mood. In the daily newspaper, Anatole Broyard wrote: Considering the advantages he has had, Martin has not covered himself with glory. Even allowing for his youth there is too much difference between his best and worst lines. Broyard went on to call Amis  and this is not the kind of criticism a young novelist wants to hear  a lousy writer about the minutiae of love.

Incarcerating people in overcrowded facilities is inhumane and always expensive: it costs $29,500 a year to imprison each person. This problem did not develop overnight. The prison population rose steadily from the late 1980s until 2003. And the recent increase is not surprising, especially in light of last years rising crime rate. But the important thing to remember is that prison is not an answer to crime; bigger prison populations reflect societys failure to find answers. ",2007-01-14T05:00:00+0000

And Senator Joseph Bruno, the Republican leader of the other half, finds himself in trouble with investigators and thus in dire need of a few positive headlines. ",2007-01-21T05:00:00+0000

In the next issue of the Book Review, the following note ran under the best-seller rankings: Last week Robert Stones A Flag for Sunrise was reported in ninth place on the hardcover fiction list. This was the result of a computer error. The actual sales of the novel placed it quite far off the list. Quite far off the list  did they have to rub it in? Well, Stone told me earlier this month, I got to be on top of the world for a week. Its too soon to tell if Stones new book, the memoir Prime Green, will appear here. ",2007-01-21T05:00:00+0000

us,You Are What You Expect,"Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Put so starkly, the question has a fatuous ring. Unless you are in the grip of a bipolar disorder, you are probably optimistic about some things and pessimistic about others. Optimism tends to reign when people are imagining how their own plans will turn out. Research shows that we systematically exaggerate our chances of success, believing ourselves to be more competent and more in control than we actually are. Some 80 percent of drivers, for example, think they are better at the wheel than the typical motorist and thus less likely to have an accident. We live in a Lake Woebegon of the mind, it seems, where all the children are above average. Such optimism bias, as psychologists have labeled it, is hardly confined to our personal lives. In fact, as Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Jonathan Renshon argue in the current issue of Foreign Policy, it may help explain why hawkishness so often prevails at the national level. Wasnt the Iraq war expected by proponents to be fairly easy (John McCain) or a cakewalk (Kenneth Adelman)?",2007-01-21T05:00:00+0000

In the West, Khan claimed, probably accurately, that his was the first generation in which there had not been a murder. He told a friend: ""In my country, life is very cheap.

With relatively calm waters, a steady breeze and short distances between anchorages, the islands have long been a draw for the sailing and yachting crowds. But it's become more popular in the last year or so, thanks to increased marketing efforts and expansions by charter companies. Barefoot Yacht Charters, www.barefootyachts.com, one of the longest running operators in the islands, organized about 400 sailing trips last year, up 45 percent from 2005. Prices for staffed yachts vary widely depending on the size and amenities. A 47-foot, air-conditioned catamaran with a two-person crew and accommodating six guests costs about $9,660 for seven nights. A week-long charter of a 126-foot sailboat that can accommodate 12 guests will run about $64,000. Footloose Sailing Charters, www.footloosecharters.com, a 12-year-old company based in Florida, opened a new base on the island of St. Vincent in October and is offering 10 percent off five-day May charters booked by Feb. 5.",2007-01-28T05:00:00+0000

A few months earlier, at the Royal Court Theater on the edge of Chelsea, John Osbornes Look Back in Anger had its first performance. Osborne was 26, a member of the generation that would oppose Suez, and the attitudes of his first major play and the astonishingly irreverent and fluent invective of its young protagonist, Jimmy Porter, captured a disenchantment in postwar English life that had never been seen on stage before. It shattered the well-bred conventions of English theater  to a large extent killed them off  and in the wider world became a symbolic text for people who wanted a different kind of Britain; one that, for example, would not have bombed Suez. Osborne, thanks to an alert theater press office, became the first Angry Young Man. Kenneth Tynan wrote famously in his review, I doubt if I could love anyone who did not wish to see Look Back in Anger.

Barbados, which has a total of seven courses, played host to the World Golf Championships for the first time last month.

Traditional croquet rules apply to the Somerset extreme course, with a few variations, including a ball being fair play if its whacked into the water, each player having to complete his turn within 10 seconds, and an arm wrestling match that determines who starts the game.

The reason they give is disagreement with the assertions made by President Carter in his new book, Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, which argues that Israel bears a large share of the responsibility for the failure to achieve peace in the Middle East. In a letter to the former president, the resigning councilors declared that while the center they admired and supported has always played the useful and constructive role of honest broker and mediator between warring parties, the former presidents new book showed him to be abandoning his historic role of broker in favor of becoming an advocate for one side. That side is of course the Palestinian side, and it is that sides views  complete with assertions of fact the letter writers find false and even malicious  that are now, they assert, being voiced by Carter.Originally I had thought to include this controversy in last weeks post on the controversy at Southern Methodist University over whether the George W. Bush library and museum should be housed on its campus. I argued (on Jan. 22) that those protesting the library because they were outraged by Bushs policies made the mistake of conflating the question of the ethics of his administration with the question of whether the records of that administration were a valuable addition to a campuss intellectual resources. The university (this or any other), I said, does not have a social or moral agenda that might lead it to reject materials because it disapproves of the values they embody. Universities have only an academic agenda (made up in equal parts of teaching and research), and being faithful to it does not require, and indeed precludes, making moral or political judgments on public figures.

But it is unlikely that the program will initially offer shoe-scanning technology, said Larry Zmuda, the companys partner for homeland-security-related business. In an interview, Mr. Zmuda said the major concern for Unisys was ensuring the programs predictability for members, who will undergo a federal background check and pay an annual fee to receive biometrically encoded I.D. cards and access to a special lane for expedited passage through the security checkpoint. Mr. Zmuda cited early snags with shoe-scanning technology being tested in Orlando by Verified Identity Pass, which already operates a Registered Traveler program called Clear at Orlando and four other airports. The Clear shoe-scanning technology, developed by General Electric Security, was intended to detect traces of explosives and suspicious metal, and to allow most travelers to pass through Clear lanes without having to remove their shoes. But the scanner rejected an unexpectedly high number of travelers shoes in Orlando, requiring members to remove their shoes just as they would at regular checkpoints. Mr. Zmuda said Unisys, which plans to be operating in 6 to 10 airports within a year, will probably offer only a special lane for the I.D. cards in Reno while the company continues to study options that will provide more benefits. Steven Brill, the founder of Verified Identity, has said that not having to remove shoes is the biggest potential benefit sought by customers.

She also looks at how nature assimilates the body once life has left it, and in doing so confronts American attitudes toward death, through photographs examining the scars left on her property after an armed fugitive, being hunted by police, shot himself; landscapes from the Civil War battlefield of Antietam; a forensics study showing human decomposition; and images of the bones and skin of a pet greyhound long since departed.",2007-01-31T05:00:00+0000
