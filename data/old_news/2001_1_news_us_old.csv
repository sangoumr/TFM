Customer Service Representative for Villeroy and Boch in New York and a retired professor of English Literature, died in his apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, December 18. He was 66. Born August 5, 1934, in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the only son of Sidney Landman and Kathlyn Parker Landman.

A former NC State senator, county commission chairman and town mayor, his career in the manufacture of socks, gloves, and abrasive equipment spanned most of the 20th century. Shuford, who maintained a residence in Manhattan, was a supporter of the performing arts in New York City. He was married to international concert pianist Dorothy Lewis-Griffith, who survives. A memorial service will be conducted Wednesday at 11 A.M. at Trinity United Church of Christ in Conover. A private interment was held today at Conover City Cemetery. Before his death Shuford had designated that memorials in his honor should be directed to Trinity United Church of Christ, 217 Second Avenue NE, Conover, NC 28613; The YMCA of Catawba Valley, PO Box 280, Conover, N.C. 28613; or Catawba College, 2300 West Innes Street, Salisbury, NC 28144. Shuford became a statewide figure of prominence in North Carolina while serving as a state senator. A life-long Democrat, he was elected to two terms in the Senate in the 1960's. During that period he was chairman of the Committee on Higher Education and helped spearhead the expansion of the University of North Carolina system. On Monday, NC Governor Jim Hunt issued a tribute to Shuford when he learned of his passing: ''I am sad to learn of the death of my friend Adrian Shuford. Senator Shuford was an exceptional leader of North Carolina and a true gentleman. Much of North Carolina's progress today in education and economic development has come because of his leadership in the state Senate. I am grateful for his life and extend my deepest sympathy to his family.'' Shuford served as mayor of Conover and as chairman of the Catawba County (NC) Board of Commissioners. At the time of his death he was trustee emeritus of Catawba College in Salisbury, NC. First elected to the Board of Trustees in 1944, he served as secretary of that board and was its chairman 26 years, from 1951 to 1977. Catawba College honored him with a Doctor of Humanitarian Service degree. In addition, the performing arts center on that campus was named from him and his wife. In his native community Shuford was honored in 1999 by the City of Conover by the establishment of the Adrian L. Shuford Jr. Conover Citizenship Award. He was cited for his contributions toward creation of the municipality's downtown park and town center. Shuford was the instigator of the founding of what is today the YMCA of Catawba Valley. He gave the property that is the site of the Adrian L. Shuford, Jr. YMCA Conover branch, established the endowment fund and was the first president of the YMCA. Educated at Cornell University and UNC-Chapel Hill, he returned to Conover in 1932 to become associated with the textile industry as president of Conover Knitting Mill and secretary of Warlong Glove Company, family businesses. Later he was a director of Riegel Textile Corporation and was a director of the Southern Hosiery Manufacturers Association and chairman of the National Association of Hosiery Manufacturers. While a young man Shuford was associated with Conover's first bank, Citizens Bank. He became president of Shuford National Bank and was a director of First National Bank of Catawba County and First Union. During World War II he was a Navy lieutenant, 1943-45. In 1959 he established Jackson Buff Corporation, which manufactured buffing and abrasive equipment, by buying several buffing equipment businesses around the country and moving them to Conover. The Rev. Dr. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate Church in New York City wrote Mrs. Shuford several weeks ago to inquire about her husband's health and declared: ''I have never met a more gentle, humble or sweeter human being. He is a very dear man, truly a beautiful soul.'' His first wife was the late Dorothy Cilley Shuford, who died in 1984. In addition to his second wife, he is survived by a son, Adrian L. Shuford, III of Newton, NC; a daughter, Dorothy Anna Shuford of Newton, NC; three sisters, Betty S. Yount of Winston-Salem, NC; Mary S. Palmer of Ann Arbor, MI; and Annie S.

His dedication to Jewish renaissance and renewal, especially among Jewish youth, has benefited many through the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation, whose generous giving helped establish the first Hillel in the FSU. Charles also served with great distinction as co-chair of Hillel International Board of Governors, a member of the JDC Board of Trustees, member of the Board of Governors for Technion, and much more. As a founding partner of STAR, Synagogue Transformation and Renewal, Charles pursued his passionate commitment to the revitalization of the synagogue community in North America to stem assimilation and attrition. Honored in his community of Tulsa and the State of Oklahoma as an outstanding philanthropist, Charles championed numerous institutions and causes. Among them were the University of Oklahoma, the Parent Child Center, Planned Parenthood, and Anytown USA, a week-long residential program for high school students from throughout the state that enhances leadership development and human relations skills.

The company made the changes quietly, by posting the lowered prices on its Web sites with no public announcement. A spokeswoman said the company was currently in a quiet period and would have no comment. The company said last month that it was planning to make a series of moves to reduce inventory, and a person close to the company said recently that Apple was hoping to reduce its inventory drastically to put its business problems behind it quickly. The company reduced the price of its entry-level G4 tower computer by $300 to $1,299, while the price of its G4 Cube computer, which has met disappointing demand, was lowered to $1,499 from $1,799. Apple's retailers said it had also reduced prices on portable systems, and its G3 Portable now sells for as little as $2,199. Prices were not lowered in either the iMac desktop or iBook portable systems. Apple is expected to introduce new computers at its annual Macworld event next week in San Francisco and several weeks later in Tokyo. John Markoff",2001-01-03T05:00:00+0000

Fifty years on, parties are still the main sales channel for Tupperware, and there are over 70,000 sales agents. (Consultants, please; never Tupperware ladies.) One of them, Brini Maxwell, just happens to be a drag queen. For a Tupperware party at the apartment of Chad Evans, a clothing designer, Ms. Maxwell donned a polyester shirtdress and a flippy blond wig and trilled to a group of mostly gay men: ''Look at this marvelous pitcher in mint green. It's so cleverly designed.'' She praised Tupperware's ''brilliant modular mates that stop cabinet clutter'' and encouraged the crowd to order products. The party netted $199 in sales, with Mr. Evans receiving $15 in free Tupperware for serving as host and Ms. Maxwell earning a 35 percent commission. Ms. Maxwell, the alter ego of Ben Sander, got her Tupperware start two years ago at a benefit for the Lesbian and Gay Community Center. Ever since, she has sold Tupperware at bridal showers and gatherings in apartments and bars. Hosts book her online at brinimaxwell.com. ''People like Tupperware parties because they're fun and silly,'' she said. ''They remind you of your youth, when your mother or aunt had them. Besides, everyone could use Tupperware.''

''Monique and I loathe acrylic,'' she explained. ''It's bad for your lungs and damages your nails. We're focusing on nails that don't look like extensions or claws. With the gel overlay, you don't need polish, and if you do wear it, the polish lasts longer.'' It takes about an hour and a half to apply a full set of nail extensions with gel overlay.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Making It Neu,"Germany was a center of modern advertising, typography and book production between 1900 and 1933. Before the rise of the Nazis, German graphic arts were the most progressive of any industrialized nation and the most influential elsewhere in Europe. Designers ''sought to raise the standards of printed culture by integrating experimental ideas from avant-garde art,'' Jeremy Aynsley writes in GRAPHIC DESIGN IN GERMANY, 1890-1945 (University of California, $60), the first comprehensive study of German commercial graphics. The field of graphic design (which includes logo, poster, typeface, magazines and books) owes its stature to three German designers. Peter Behrens, the father of modern corporate identity, developed the first standardized corporate logo system for AEG, the leading German electrical company. Lucian Bernhard invented a new advertising method known as the sachplakat, or ''object poster,'' which emphasized the simple eye-catching rendering of a product rather than the turgid texts and uninspired images so common in advertising at that time. Jan Tschichold codified the neue Typographie, or ''new typography,'' characterized by asymmetrical composition, the use of bold, sans-serif letter forms and primary colors. These ideas forever altered commercial art's form and function through the rest of the century and led directly to the International style after World War I. The Bauhaus, the innovative design academy the Nazis would close down in 1933, flourished, and contemporary design styles were adopted by German industry. Germany was a magnet for iconoclastic applied artists from Russia, Eastern Europe and Italy. And Aynsley artfully details the rise and fall of the German graphic profession from the early period of decorative jugendstil (art nouveau) to the introduction of Nazi propaganda, which assailed progressive design as ''degenerate art.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Eating Her Way Out,"Nothing surprises us in dreams, Jean Cocteau said. But LEFT-HANDED DREAMS (Delphinium, $20), Francesca Duranti's new novel, is both full of surprises and a dream of a book; it never stops awakening you to the world. It begins in Italy, the country where Martina Satriano was born and to which she has returned to visit her ailing mother. Alas, at the very moment Martina's plane from New York touches down, her mother dies and Martina spends the rest of the novel pondering what she calls ''destiny's perfect timing.'' Ponder, in fact, is pretty much all this troubled soul does. A college professor, Martina is so fond of abstraction that she turns chaos into curlicues, formlessness into philosophy. Unable to form a satisfactory relationship because of her obsession with a long-dead affair, she would be a dreadfully unsympathetic character were it not for the fact that her self-absorption is tempered by self-awareness. Even as Martina laboriously records her dreams for her college research, it is clear that she wants out of this entropic reverie. One of her favorite routes of escape is food, and the book is larded with culinary detail (in a kind of appendix, Martina even gives us a few of her favorite recipes; I can vouch for the gteau des adieux). Duranti's otherwise unruffled prose stirs itself into action as it describes a cluster of mushrooms, a whiff of mint or even Julia Child preparing a tarte Tatin on TV -- evanescent, rapturous moments that turn life and dreams inside out and, finally, pull Martina through.

This Dunkin' Donuts is kosher; everything is prepared under strict supervision. Ramesh (Ray) Patel bought the franchise in 1988, and when he tried to sell it in 1991, found no takers. He conferred with local residents and realized that his was mainly a Jewish neighborhood, a largely observant one at that. So he did what any good businessman does: having found the need, he filled it. That meant serving only kosher food, hence no meat (as the place served dairy), and certainly not bacon, ham or sausage. But there still were kosher bagels, coffee, doughnuts, muffins and egg and cheese sandwiches. Then he introduced kosher tuna salad and egg salad. They were big sellers, but the Dunkin' Donuts corporate hierarchy stepped in and forbade him from buying the salads because they did not come from company-approved vendors. Mr. Patel is awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge of the same edict by kosher Dunkin' Donuts in Elizabeth and Teaneck. Mr. Patel, who spends his afternoons as a civil engineer in Woodbridge, says that 1,100 to 1,200 people are served daily in the 24-hour operation. The shop also sells kosher dougnuts, bagels and other food to Jewish schools and institutions. Norm Oshrin",2001-01-07T05:00:00+0000

The deal ends Blue Circle's yearlong attempt to fend off a hostile approach from its French rival. The acquisition, announced yesterday, was helped by Lafarge's willingness to raise the price to 495 pence a share from the 450 pence that Blue Circle's shareholders rejected last May, and 8 percent higher than Blue Circle's stock price on Jan. 5, the last day of trading before the deal was announced. Lafarge and its adviser, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, own a 32.2 percent combined stake in Blue Circle as a result of that earlier attempt. Lafarge estimates it can realize $95 million in cost savings from the transaction, which will expand its operations in Europe and Asia. ''This is a major step for Lafarge's development,'' the Lafarge chief executive, Bertrand P. Collomb, said at a news conference in Paris. ''We're very happy that this offer became friendly.''

The practice began in the late 1940's and early 1950's and has accelerated rapidly. Nobody knows precisely what volume of antibiotics is used today. But new estimates released by a public interest group this week suggest that the amount of antibiotics used nontherapeutically in American livestock has grown to 24.6 million pounds per year, a number that may be as much as 50 percent higher than it was in 1985.",2001-01-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Metro Business Briefing; INSTANT-MESSAGE INVESTMENT,"Odigo, a Silicon Alley instant-messaging-service company, announced late Tuesday that it had secured $15.35 million in financing from several private investors led by Lazard Technology Partners. Odigo has been a catalyst in a battle with America Online over instant-messaging standards. Odigo is expected to use this new round of financing to expand its instant-messaging services to wireless uses, company officials said. In the battle over standards, America Online has argued that it should not be forced to open up its instant-messaging program to communicate with those provided by other companies because of privacy concerns. But Odigo engineers have repeatedly designed software that has circumvented America Online security measures, allowing Odigo users to communicate with people using AOL's Instant Messenger.

Senator Hatch, a Utah Republican who will be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 20, made his remarks at the opening of a conference sponsored by the Coalition for the Future of Music. About 400 recording artists, technologists, record executives and lawyers gathered at Georgetown University for the two-day event to discuss how the Internet is affecting the creation and dissemination of music. The traditional record industry has been criticized for being slow to offer music online and to provide affordable licenses to Internet companies that are seeking to do so. Senator Hatch, who presided over hearings on the subject last spring, noted that some creative business alliances have since been struck. But he continued to raise the specter of regulation. ""It is critical that policy makers be vigilant about keeping the pipes wide open,"" the senator said, adding that as a songwriter himself he shared the frustrations of artists who find it hard to get adequate distribution and compensation for their music. ""If the digital pipes are significantly narrowed by gatekeepers who divert fans to preferred content, a unique opportunity will be lost for creators of music and those fans,"" he said.

us,VOTE OF SUPPORT FOR NAPSTER,"Senator Orrin Hatch called on the recording industry yesterday to catch up with consumer demand for online music, warning that he intended to ''do what I can'' to see that the major record labels provided for fair, nondiscriminatory licensing of music. Senator Hatch, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made his remarks at the opening of a conference sponsored by the Coalition for the Future of Music. About 400 recording artists, technologists, record executives and lawyers gathered at Georgetown University for the two-day event to discuss how the Internet is affecting the creation and dissemination of music. The traditional record industry has been criticized for being slow to offer music online and to provide affordable licenses to Internet companies that are seeking to do so. Senator Hatch, who presided over hearings on the subject last spring, noted that some creative business alliances have since been struck. But he continued to raise the specter of regulation. ''It is critical that policy makers be vigilant about keeping the pipes wide open,'' the senator said, adding that as a songwriter himself he shared the frustrations of artists who find it hard to get adequate distribution and compensation for their music. ''If the digital pipes are significantly narrowed by gatekeepers who divert fans to preferred content, a unique opportunity will be lost for creators of music and those fans,'' he said.

As a teenager she lived with her older brother and his wife in Manhattan, moving from apartment to apartment when the rent was due. She met and married her husband, Peter Ferrara, a good-looking young Brooklyn man. After many years of marriage, Peter died, July, 1969. For the past 31 years, Sunnie once again displayed her strength and endurance living life to the fullest in her new home in Pompano Beach, Florida. She reigned over her family with the utmost love and respect. She is survived by her children, Adeline (Addie), Carole, Alex and Jo (Josephine), her grandchildren, Nycole and Jodi and her cherished great grandson, Gavin; her brother, Anthony and Frank Castle; her sister, Rose Mac Sems. She has now joined her sisters Peggy and Lena and her brother Joe. She will always be for her children their strength and the wings beneath their feet. She will be missed and loved always.

Including noncash charges and one-time items, the company lost $104 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $42 million a year earlier. Its revenue increased 41 percent, to $132 million. The company cut its estimate for profits in 2001 by 4 cents, to 7 to 9 cents a share, because it plans to spend $5 million to expand its e-mail business. Last month, Doubleclick called off a plan to buy NetCreations, an e-mail marketing company. Yesterday, Yahoo sharply cut its revenue and profit forecast for 2001 because of soft demand for advertising. Doubleclick said its business would be less affected by this slowdown because an increasing portion of its revenue comes from selling advertising-related software rather than the advertising itself.

Dean & DeLuca filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in May to raise as much as $69 million through a stock sale.

Remec's bid was originally intended to rescue Allgon from a hostile all-stock bid from a Swedish rival, LGP Telecom Holding A.B., which withdrew its offer, then worth $352 million, in October.

The story of a poor man whose striking physical (if not spiritual) resemblance to Martin Luther King Jr. lands him a job as a stand-in for the civil rights leader becomes an exploration into the soul of inequality and a probing inquiry into King's life and times. ''Johnson takes bold creative risks,'' Dennis McFarland wrote here in 1998. ''He delivers a lively tale that leaves the reader with enormous concerns to contemplate.'' Scribner has also reissued Johnson's first novel, Faith and the Good Thing ($11), a philosophical ''Pilgrim's Progress'' fable about a black girl's search for the Good Thing in Hatten County, Ga. In 1974 our reviewer, Annie Gottlieb, called this ''a flawed yet still fabulous book, at its best a many-splendored and ennobling weaving-together of thought, suffering, humor and magic.''",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Certainly black is practical for every day and great for saving on dry cleaning, while for its upkeep, the bipartisan rainbow coalition cloth coat is a luxury. A surprise was the number of pastel duffel coats, usually cut in neutral beige and brown. This year, they're seen in melting, soft colors. Top row, a range from peach through rose and mauve; bottom row, the spectrum from blue to yellow.

Our board of directors has decided not to use the reserve fund for window replacement or to impose an assessment against our maintenance charges. The reason seems to be so that shareholders can get excellent selling prices for their apartments. Instead, the board has voted to let individual shareholders replace their own windows if they want to. Is there any way to determine what portion of a reserve fund should be used to improve the quality of life for shareholders rather than provide a benefit to the shareholders who are selling? Is there any rule of thumb for determining what a healthy reserve fund is? . . . Elena Pavlov, Manhattan",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; The Narrow Path,"For more than a century, the Hutterites have farmed the prairies of the American West and Canada, attracting little notice from the outside world. Hard work, political pacifism and piety based on the Anabaptist movement are among the tenets they have observed over the course of their 472-year history. Alternating waves of prosperity and persecution have borne the Hutterites from Moravia to Russia and, finally, in the 1870's, to North America, where most of them now live in small, communal settlements, surrounded by the raw, expansive landscape they call home. When the photographer Laura Wilson first encountered the Hutterites in 1983, she was struck not only by their disciplined lifestyle but also by her own ignorance of the ''enclosed world'' she had stumbled upon. In HUTTERITES OF MONTANA (Yale University, $39.95), Wilson's vivid photographs and engaging text focus on two Hutterite groups. Penetrating their society was no easy task: it took Wilson months to persuade the Hutterites to let her photograph them; in all, she spent 14 years on the project. Her black-and-white photographs reveal the minimalist settings of Hutterite life -- the neat, sparsely furnished houses; the unornamented sanctuaries where the Hutterites worship at least once a day, not a candle or stained glass window in sight; the well-tended farms and pastures. The Hutterites are physically striking: the men, broad-shouldered, often with trimmed beards, wear tall hats and black pants; the women dress in crisp cotton blouses and skirts, their triple-starched scarves bestowing on them ''the look of alert, still-winged birds.'' While Wilson notes that the Hutterites, now 40,000 strong, are the largest communal group in the Western Hemisphere, she worries that they will not be able to withstand the far reaches of the high-tech, high-anxiety world. Her book inspires appreciation of a culture that, so far, has managed to resist the temptation. Suzanne MacNeille",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

And since 1992, when Bill Clinton recognized that the end of the cold war made George Bush's victory in the Persian Gulf very nearly irrelevant as a political asset, foreign policy has become an electoral afterthought. In this past campaign, Al Gore and George W. Bush delivered the speeches on diplomacy that are still required in order to scale Mount Gravitas, and in their second debate they engaged in a blurry, amiable 45-minute discussion of foreign affairs. After a brief, failed attempt to get Bush to concede that he would not necessarily intervene abroad even to prevent genocide, Gore essentially gave up trying to draw sharp distinctions with his opponent, apparently reasoning that deploying his immensely superior knowledge of the world might make him seem pedantic rather than seasoned. (Bush was held to have won the debate after successfully reciting the names of four large Middle Eastern countries.)

Hughes's stance, practiced most visibly as the art critic for Time magazine over the past 30 years, is polemical; his prose style, in his editor's words, ''muscular mandarin.'' Many artists have been roughed up by his reviews. Francis Bacon: ''Some art is wallpaper. Bacon's is flypaper.'' Julian Schnabel: ''Schnabel's work is to painting what Stallone's is to acting.'' Even his praise has barbs. In 1987, he described the German painter Anselm Kiefer as ''the best painter of his generation on either side of the Atlantic. If we consider the mediocrity of most of the talent we have,'' he added, ''this may not sound like much of a compliment.''",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

But for the countless tie-dyed hippies and jazz aficionados who have followed bands like Phish around for years, this combination is just right. The band achieved a bit of notice in 1998 when its cover of the Dead's ''Sugar Magnolia'' appeared in the 1999 Julia Roberts film ''Runaway Bride.'' And tape recorders are welcome.

Not literally; under the previous owners, offerings were scrawled on cardboard and propped against the wall. On the surface, La Isla still seems like that kind of place. A faded blue ''Restaurant/Cafeteria'' sign hangs above the doorway. There are twice as many stools at the counter as there are tables. But Mr. Giner, a Cuban-American from Jersey City, isn't interested in appearances. His concern is with putting out copious plates of what he calls ''homespun meets nouveau Cuban'' fare. ''I take what's in the Cuban diet and reinvent it,'' he said. ''But I do it in such a way that the ingredients don't lose their identity.'' This means that old favorites like media noche -- a sandwich of ham, pork, and Swiss cheese on sweet bread ($4) -- and braised pork with fried plantains, black beans and rice ($10.95) share the stage with pan-seared red snapper with a coconut-polenta cake ($17.95). With kicky Cuban music and Spanish-speaking servers, La Isla is full of island soul. By the end of the night, you'll be ready to buy one of the restaurant's black T-shirts with ''Cuba'' on the front and ''No!'' on the back. Mr. Giner said the second word was ''like 'holy cow.'

The first group sees him as Prince Hal, a natural leader seasoned by his rapscallion youth; the second sees him as smug and callow, a Richard II attaining power by accident of birth. But whether they are pulling for Hal or scoffing at Richard, they cite the same biography: that Bush was an incurious student and an unsuccessful young man who just 14 years ago was sitting on top of a collapsing oil firm; that he opted out of the ideological and military conflicts of his generation; that he drank too much for many years; that his experience in public service consists of six years in the bully pulpit of a state with a part-time Legislature -- and that he spent two of those years running for president.

us,"Books in Brief: Fiction; Scent of Jasmine, Taste of Snickers","For all its tenderness and warmth, Vineeta Vijayaraghavan's first novel, MOTHERLAND (Soho, $23), has a gutsy air of daring about it. Rather than trying to distinguish itself from the well-worn coming-of-age genre, ''Motherland'' places itself so squarely within the tradition that it winds up being something of a revelation. Like its 15-year-old narrator, ''Motherland'' winningly combines youthful exuberance with the conviction that there is nothing wrong with being a little bit old-fashioned. Maya, a sullen, Americanized teenager, is grimly resigned when her parents pack her off to India to spend the summer with her extended family. But as the hot, lazy days stretch into each other and fate propels the girl and her grandmother to a new closeness, Maya goes from boredom and frustration to self-assured maturity. There's nothing new about the ''summer I grew up'' novel, and here even the family secrets have an air of inevitability about them. (The book's one big twist, a political subplot, seems out of place and disappointingly forgettable.) Despite its lack of originality, however, ''Motherland'' has abundant charm. It teems with sumptuous, loving details of everyday life. Vijayaraghavan shares her protagonist's pleasure in everything from the scent of jasmine in a girl's hair to the sticky sweetness of a Snickers bar in the mouth. And Maya's insights thankfully lack the overreaching fussiness that plagues works written by adults in the voice of adolescents. Her awkward, heartfelt attempts to reconcile her Western and Indian selves feel genuine. The novel may be set in a world of saris and spices, wild boars and arranged marriages, but its rhythms have the familiar, reassuring hum of home. We may have a clear idea of what to expect when we head with Maya off to Grandmother's, but it doesn't make getting there any less of a pleasure. Mary Elizabeth Williams",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Like a lot of Amerian moviegoers, I'd never heard of the 28-year-old Belfast-born upstart who had directed, written the screen adaptation and starred in the title role. Then one day I happened upon Mr. Branagh's scene with Emma Thompson, as Katherine, on television, and couldn't take my eyes off it. The whole film is powerful, dark, complex, riveting and every bit as great as Laurence Olivier's 1945 version, right down to the St. Crispin's Day speech. Derek Jacobi plays the Chorus, Ian Holm is Fluellen, Judi Dench is Mistress Quickly, and Paul Scofield is the King of France. Mr. Branagh may have taken a few Shakespearean missteps (''Love's Labour's Lost'' as a 1930's-style Hollywood musical most recently), but his, his directorial debut, is solid proof of his genius - Sunday at 11:15 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., Monday at 8 a.m. on IFC.",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

When the restaurant opened in 1996, the effervescent former schoolteacher was the cook, comedian and sometime singer (occasionally from the kitchen while working) at the relaxed storefront spot that specialized in down-home Southern and American heartland dishes with a few Caribbean and Italian choices. She developed a cult-like following there that last November stormed her new, larger quarters at 276 New York Avenue (631-424-2181), where the Colonial Diner had been for many years.",2001-01-14T05:00:00+0000

Its composer, Carl Maria von Weber, took a German folk tale about a huntsman who uses diabolic magic bullets to win a shooting contest, studded it with folk songs and Italianate scenas and crowned it with the well-known Wolf's Glen scene in which the hero, Max, and the evil huntsman, Caspar, cast the bullets at midnight in a cloud of demonic spirits. In the densely orchestrated score, Weber associates specific keys and musical motifs with characters and situations, presaging the Wagnerian leitmotif. Dramatically, however, the piece is more like a hybrid of ''The Waltons'' and ''Frankenstein.''",2001-01-16T05:00:00+0000

Burt had an illustrious career in the Army Air Corps during World War II and in the Air Force Reserves thereafter. He was a Wall Street attorney, business executive, venture capitalist, rancher and real estate investor. The third child of Chauncey H. and Marion Brennan Burt, he was born in Plainfield, New Jersey and grew up in Manhattan, attended the Bovee School, was a member of the Knickerbocker Grays, a junior training unit of the Seventh Regiment.

Mr. Burt interrupted his schooling with four years working for American Airlines in New York City and six years of military service in Washington and London. While at American Airlines, he was among the pioneers of commercial air freight, and he is credited with inventing the model for the modern credit card. His wartime experience is chronicled in his book, ''Adventures with Warlords: Insight into Key Events of World War II,'' published in 1994. Upon his 80th birthday in August 1994, Mr. Burt was honored by Idaho Governor Cecil D. Andrus at the State Capitol in Boise for creating a fellowship and scholarship programlinking the Idaho Fish and Game Department and the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

Groove Collective, from Brooklyn, started out with other acid-jazz groups as 1970's revivalists and revisionists, pushing smooth jazz and funk toward the dance floor. But over the years the group has broadened its reach and its ambitions. On ''It's All in Your Mind,'' Groove Collective remains fond of the 1970's but cruises the African diaspora. The album includes pugnacious Nigerian Afro-beat, easygoing tunes with wordless oohs and ahs that suggest Earth Wind and Fire, snappy funk and glimmering electric piano meditations. The opening tune, ''Time Pilot,'' has the stately serenity of something by the French group Air, while an airborne Latin-jazz jam, ''Stargazer,'' has Groove Collective easily keeping pace with the brilliant Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes. Tunes that could get by with a vamp and a melody unfold with multiple themes as arrangements layer on jazzy harmonic convolutions. ''In Your Mind'' free-associates from jazz to funk to Beatles-flavored rock; ''Earth to Earth'' imagines what pygmy funk might sound like. Groove Collective's identity lies not in one fixed style but in its capable hospitality to whatever might keep hips swaying. JON PARELES",2001-01-19T05:00:00+0000

She estimated that online advertising would climb to $7.3 billion this year, from $5.3 billion in 2000, and reach $16.5 billion by 2005. Advertising for products like automobiles, health and travel would compensate for reduced spending by dot-coms, Ms. Gluck predicted. Jeffrey Mallett, above, chief operating officer at Yahoo, agreed that ''traditional companies are finally stepping up'' to buy ads online. He noted that more than two-thirds of Yahoo's 15,000 clients a month were traditional companies.

With new yoga centers opening up in New York City faster than you can inhale; a mainstream advertisement featuring a woman in lotus pose, meditating in her high-speed train seat; and publications like The Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker talking about the phenomenon, yoga is, in some ways, the aerobics of the new millennium. But yoga has a lot more staying power than a step bench. In addition to its being a 5,000-year old tradition, yoga is a way of life -- not just an hour set aside for pumping up your heart rate, gaining muscle mass and burning off calories and cellulite. Yoga offers all those benefits, but best of all, it helps you calm your mind, which is more difficult to do than even the most challenging handstand. ",2001-01-19T05:00:00+0000

If someone had told me in advance that my life (not to mention my body) would be turned upside-down by the experience, I wouldnt have believed her. I felt like the bumblebee that flies simply because it doesn't know that, aerodynamically, it shouldn't be able to. Even better, upon leaving the class, I noticed that my emotional drama had not sucked up a single molecule of thought during the hour-long session. Not only did my body feel refreshed, my mind did too. Needless to say, I was hooked. I attended three more classes that same week, have been doing yoga roughly four times a week ever since, and am just about to finish a yoga-teacher training course. ",2001-01-19T05:00:00+0000

At the same time, we see our role on the Web as being similar to our traditional, print role -- to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide to our customers information they need and can trust,"" said Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., publisher of The New York Times. The site looks quite a bit different than it did in five years ago, but its aspirations are largely the same: to be the best news and information site on the Internet. With that in mind, Bernard Gwertzman, editor of The New York Times on the Web, and Martin Nisenholtz, chief executive officer of New York Times Digital, sat down to discuss their five years on the Web, the state of Internet journalism today, and what we can expect in years to come. The discussion was moderated by Bill Goldstein, the Books Editor of NYTimes.com. BILL GOLDSTEIN: Martin, I was hoping that you could tell us a little bit about how you came to be at The New York Times On The Web and what you and Arthur Sulzberger were planning, really, when you came here, what company you were envisioning. MARTIN NISENHOLTZ: Okay. Those are really two separate questions. I had spent my career as a practitioner in this nascent field of interactive media. I was a research scientist at New York University in the late 70s, working on some of the very earliest experiments in consumer online media. They were called teletext and videotext services. And the first wave of this stuff happened in the early 80s. And I moved from NYU to the advertising firm Ogilvy and Mather in 1982 because I felt that one of the very important things that needed to happen for this to become a real business was for the marketing community to embrace it and to somehow make it financially viable, and I thought that if that was going to happen anywhere, it would happen as part of a major advertising agency. So, in 1983, we started the first interactive marketing firm in the United States, called the Interactive Marketing Group at Ogilvy, and I spent 11 years doing that. ",2001-01-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; A Better Orchestra,"CROOKED RIVER BURNING (Harcourt, $27), Mark Winegardner's bulky yet brilliant new novel, has a familiar plot: West Side guy from union family falls for rich East Side girl whose father is a political boss. The guy, David Zielinsky, dreams of being mayor; the girl, Anne O'Connor, yearns to be a war correspondent. The book follows their sometimes intertwining paths from the late 1940's through the late 60's. What gives the book its edge is its setting: Cleveland. Winegardner weaves the love story through the fabric of a tumultuous era in which Cleveland, one of the birthplaces of rock 'n' roll, slides substantially in population, becomes the butt of many jokes and sees the Cuyahoga River catch fire more than once. The book is peppered with well-known figures, from Eliot Ness to Dr. Sam Sheppard. Winegardner's portraits, for instance, of the legendary disc jockey Alan Freed and of Dorothy Fuldheim, a television commentator who worked into her 90's, are classics. No surprise that Winegardner, who wrote the much-praised baseball novel ''The Veracruz Blues'' (1996), includes a healthy dose of Cleveland Indians action. (Any Indians fan will cringe at his description of Willie Mays's famous catch in the 1954 World Series.) As we follow the adventures of David and Anne, we learn about a gritty, rich and misjudged city. ''What's the difference between Cleveland and the Titanic?'' asked one of the jokes told after the Cuyahoga burned in 1969. ''Cleveland has a better orchestra.'' And, as Winegardner's book shows, so much more. Peter Khoury",2001-01-21T05:00:00+0000

His ten-year battle with cancer ended with his wife and children by his side. Dr. Bloomer was born in Denver Colorado, December 20, 1916, son of the late Charles and Winifred Bloomer. After moving to California, he graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1934, and received his Bachelor of Science degree from Stanford University in 1938. He received his M.D. from Yale University School of Medicine in 1942, and completed his internship in surgical service at Stanford University Hospital in San Francisco in June of 1943. Serving in the United States Army Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946, he was stationed in Texas, England, and finally at Letterman Hospital in San Francisco, California. After the war, he returned to Yale University School of Medicine as a Fellow in Thoracic Surgery, and completed his residency in general and thoracic surgery at Yale New Haven Hospital. He was certified by the American Board of Surgery in 1952, and the Board of Thoracic Surgery in 1956. Following a fiveyear period as Assistant Professor in Surgery at Yale, Dr. Bloomer moved to California in 1959, enthusiastically embarking upon his lifelong career in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery. He joined Drs. Jerome H. Kay and Robert M. Anderson in private practice at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles. He was a Clinical Assistant Professor in Surgery at University of Southern California from 1959 to 1961. It was at this time that he published his most important work, ''Surgical Anatomy of the Bronchovascular Segment,'' coauthored by Drs. Averill A. Liebow and Milton R. Hales, which demonstrated his innovative techniques for using injection-molded plastics to study the anatomy of the lung. In 1960, Dr. Bloomer joined Dr. Robert M. Anderson in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. From 1961 through 1967, he was the Chief of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at Los Angeles County Harbor General Hospital. He became an Associate Clinical Professor of Surgery at UCLA School of Medicine in 1961, holding that position until his death. In 1966, he joined Drs. Jerome A. Cope and Arthur J. Beland in Long Beach. He began his solo practice in 1969, based primarily out of Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. Dr. Bloomer was a member of numerous medical and surgical societies, to include locally, the Los Angeles and Long Beach Surgical Societies, regionally, the New England Surgical Society and Western Thoracic Surgical Association, and nationally, the American College of Surgeons, the Society of University Surgeons, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery, and Sigma Xi.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Fairest of Fowls,"The world of chickens is a world of wonders. Consider the 179 photographs by Stephen Green-Armytage beautifully reproduced and collected in EXTRAORDINARY CHICKENS (Abrams, $24.95). The flamboyant, unlikely, extravagant birds depicted in studio portraits come in all sizes (bantam to colossal) and shapes (Botero-plump to pitiful) and colors and textures; I am particularly taken with the frizzles, although the silkies give them a run for their money. Many wear headdresses that would make a Las Vegas showgirl blush; others sport absurd beards, muffs and whiskers. The Faverolles salmon hen, for example, looks like an outraged society matron wearing a boa, while the bald head and lavish muttonchop whiskers of the Araucana white rumpless hen would become any Victorian elder statesman. The detailed sections on feet and spurs and, especially, combs make one ponder about the adaptive and evolutionary purposes that lead to peculiarities like, say, the comb of the Minorca black hen, something like a many-fingered red rubber glove abandoned on her head. Green-Armytage, whose book grew out of an assignment for Life magazine, has also provided a useful text, including a brief history of chicken fancying (Queen Victoria was an early poultry fan) and short descriptions of the breeds pictured, from the Appenzeller Spitzhauben, new on the show circuit, to the showily long-tailed Yokohama.

At the aerospace research laboratory where I was working, a new employee had just started. She was into science fiction, so I thought that tickets for opening night would impress her favorably. They did, but when the film was over, I was struck not by its space-age flourishes but by its view about human evolution -- so similar, I thought, to Nietzsche's view about the emergence of the ''superman.'' My date, however, was not into such philosophical speculations. So, ruining all chances for further developments in our relationship, I rushed her home and spent the rest of the night rereading my Nietzsche.

Gristede's said that if it determined that Great American was violating wage laws, it would suspend the company's contract or rescind it. Charles Baur, owner of Great American, did not return several calls to his office yesterday. Supermarket officials said the deliverymen were employed by Great American and not Gristede's.

Under the agreement, Stop and Shop would join Bradlees in selling 105 stores, the Bradlees corporate headquarters in Braintree, Mass., and three distribution centers. United States Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton R. Lifland will review the proposal in a hearing on Thursday in Manhattan. If it is approved, Stop and Shop and Bradlees will hold auctions to sell the leases. Stop and Shop and the Bradlees creditors will split the proceeds if the properties bring in more than $150 million.

On a cash-flow basis, before accounting for taxes, interest and depreciation, the company lost 125 million euros, or about $116 million. Though analysts had expected a big loss, several said the results raised new questions about the quality of T-Online's sales. Profits from access fees evaporated as the company offered customers low monthly flat rates. And although revenue from advertising and e-commerce climbed 75 percent, analysts said more than half that growth came from sales to the parent company, Deutsche Telekom. Edmund L.

He was a brilliant communicator of modern psychoanalytic theory and technique, an elegant thinker, a stimulating and supportive teacher, and a man of great wisdom and kindness. His papers on modern psychoanalysis have taught generations of clinicians how to apply Dr. Spotnitz's techniques with narcissistic patients. He welcomed MMI into the community and championed its directors, always encouraging them to step forward with their ideas. A man of capacious mind and heart, he was unique and is completely unforgettable. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Deborah Margolis, his wife; to his daughter, Helen Michael, and her husband, Mel, and to their family.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction & Poetry; Poet and Concubine,"One of Vietnam's greatest poets, Ho Xuan Huong -- whose dates, as far as we know them, roughly correspond to those of Jane Austen -- lived through a time of national upheaval and personal frustration. She was a concubine (''like the maid, / but without pay,'' she writes in one poem) and, according to legend, she ran a tea shop in what is now known as Hanoi, from which vantage point she railed against her fate, being a talented, intelligent woman in a world dominated by the male Confucian establishment. Ho's stature rests on her mastery of classical technique, her mordant humor and on what John Balaban, in his excellent introduction to SPRING ESSENCE: The Poetry of Ho Xuan Huoung (Copper Canyon, paper, $15), the first substantial anthology of Ho's poetry in a Western language, calls ''her exquisite cleverness.'' Ho delighted in puns and double entendres, tonal play, anagram-like subtexts and elaborate rhyme schemes that were even more intricate than the established formal patterns warranted. Many of her poems conceal an alternate meaning, usually sexual, sometimes obscene. In the simple landscape of daily objects -- jackfruit, river snails, a loom, a chess set, and perhaps most famously a paper fan -- Ho found metaphors for sex, which she turned into trenchant indictments of the plight of women and the arrogance, hypocrisy and corruption of men. She could vent her disapproval on members of her own sex, too, as in one poem where she scolds a young widow for overindulging her grief. In still other poems, she paints miniature portraits -- a village schoolmaster, a retired doctor, a Buddhist nun, a lustful monk -- that are by turns funny, chiding, picturesque or sarcastic. Though not a definitive gathering of Ho's work, Balaban's deft translations are a beautiful and significant contribution to the West's growing awareness of Vietnam's splendid literary heritage.

In JUST LIKE A SHADOW (Steidl/ Scalo, $29.95), sequences of three or four film frames, often sliced randomly midframe, are presented with sprocket holes and scratchy optical soundtracks intact. Mekas's images are jerky with movement, either washed out or underexposed, and seemingly shot from the hip, but all have a feeling of spontaneity and the immediacy of life. Norman Mailer's quizzical, pained expression is juxtaposed against the American flag; the ailing but indomitable George Maciunas, the founder of the Fluxus art movement that links many of the subjects in the book, is shown smiling in his hospital bed. There is a marvelous sense of intimacy to Mekas's art of simply filming experience: a sequence of his young son vying with a large ginger cat is an ephemeral yet timeless moment. ''My film work is one long film which is still continuing,'' Mekas says in an interview with Jerome Sans. ''I don't really make films: I only keep filming. I am a filmer, not a filmmaker.'' Eric P.

At the peak of his career, in the 1930's and 1940's, he was thought by many to be the most famous American alive. For much of that period, he was undoubtedly the most admired. The cycle of ''Road'' pictures with Bob Hope established Crosby as a great comic actor. Yet by the 1960's, the ocean began to roll over Der Bingle, and though he continued to sell millions of records -- chiefly holiday songs -- he had morphed into a grand old man while retaining little of the bite of his contemporary, Louis Armstrong, or his aging offspring, Frank Sinatra. Crosby's reputation faltered along with his music after his death, in 1977. When his eldest son, Gary Crosby, published a bitter memoir describing the unflappable Bing administering vigorous corporal punishment, his halo tilted and crashed. Soon the afterlife of his career imploded. Jazz lovers kept his memory alive, mainly because of his early records and the later collaborations with Armstrong, Louis Jordan, Les Paul and others. But jazz lovers are by nature classicists, and Crosby had spent most of his life on the other side of the divide: the pop world, where success is measured in numbers -- a world remade by rock, in which even the oldest of oldies postdate ''Heartbreak Hotel.''",2001-01-28T05:00:00+0000

Dear brother-in-law of James and Viginia McCrory. Loving uncle of Thomas (Marlene), Gail (Willard), Nancy (Anthony) and Amy (Vincent). Fond great-uncle of Kelly, Corey, Stephen, Scott, Demetri and Louise. Born in Vlasim, Czechoslovakia, on September 16, 1924, the son of the late Karel and Vlasta (nee Smahova) Sichrovsky, he attended Charles University in Prague from May 1945 to February 1949, and passed his first state exam. As a refugee in Ludwigsburg, Germany, Karel received a scholarship to the University of Geneva, Switzerland, graduating in November 1950 with a degree (licensie) in political science. In April 1951 he joined Radio Free Europe in Munich as a writer serving on the Czech desk until August 1956, when he came to live in the United States. There he was a senior writer at RFE's New York office until September 1959, reporting chiefly on labor. He continued his studies of political science and history at Columbia Univeristy, receiving an M.A. in 1958 and the Certificate of the Program on East Central Europe in 1959. He became a US citizen December 27, 1960. Until he retired in 1987, his scholarship, language and editorial skills gained him the respect of those with whom he worked in the world of publishing.

''All it takes is flour, water, salt and a little bit of yeast,'' said Ivan Rodriguez, who has managed Hoboken's 63-year-old Antique Bakery since 1987. He speaks so matter-of-factly -- just a few ingredients, right? -- that you find yourself vowing to head home and dig out a mixing bowl. But after one bite of Antique's crusty white peasant round, you realize that the idea of baking such an extraordinary loaf is akin to standing in front of a Jackson Pollock painting and saying, ''I could do that.'' With its crackled crust and chewy texture, the pagnotta, as the round loaf is known, is the perfect complement to fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil. The pagnotta comes in three sizes, small ($1), medium ($1.70) and large ($2.35), and keeps for two or three days. The semolina and whole-wheat rounds, which spend about 10 minutes less in the coal-fired brick ovens than their white-flour counterparts are less crusty. Antique is the opposite of a yuppie hangout: no tables to linger at, no organic whole-wheat loaves with currants and hazelnuts, no cappuccino. It's a working man's bakery, turning out some 3,000 loaves and rolls a day, 75 percent of them destined for restaurants and delis in New York City, Jersey City and Hoboken. Focaccia (plain, $2; with tomatoes, $2.50) or bread stuffed with sausage, peppers and onions ($3.75) is about as fancy as it gets. Unless you count the green and red neon ''Antique Bakery'' winking in the window. Gretchen Kurtz",2001-01-28T05:00:00+0000

''The European Commission has exclusive competence to review mergers that fall under its rules,'' as this one does, said a commission spokeswoman, Amelia Torres. Spain claims jurisdiction because EDP is 31 percent owned by the Portuguese government, and Spanish law requires Madrid to rule on deals involving state-owned companies, a provision that has set off disputes with the commission in the past.
