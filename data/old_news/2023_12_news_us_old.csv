In 1986, across the avenue at Lafayette in the Drake Hotel, was where New York first noticed him; Bryan Miller awarded Lafayette four stars in The New York Times two years later. Scores of restaurants and decades later, at Four Twenty Five, Mr. Vongerichten is relying on a seasoned veteran, Jonathan Benno, who was the chef de cuisine at Thomas Kellers Per Se and the executive chef at Lincoln Ristorante before having his own place in NoMad. The menu in the new restaurant is  la carte and seasonal. January, not July, comes to mind with Nantucket bay scallop tartare; tricolor cauliflower; chicory salad with walnuts and pears; winter squash agnolotti with brown butter vinaigrette; a main dish of celery root done francese-style; pan-roasted steelhead trout with pumpkin seed gremolata and roasted squash; chicken breast cloaked in black truffle crumbs and served with black truffle butter; and charred duck breast with roasted cabbage. Theres also a seven-course tasting. Some dishes, notably the pastas and crudos, announce Mr. Benno, while others, like steamed black sea bass with winter mushrooms, are clearly from Mr. Vongerichtens portfolio. Black sea bass is the best fish in America, he said. The 84-seat restaurant, designed by Norman Foster (like the building that houses it), is on the second floor, softly done in tones of gray and burgundy, with a gleaming kitchen behind a wall of glass, and a soaring ceiling. Theres a bar on the ground floor, with a vibrant Larry Poons painting above it, where small plates like sliders and chicken samosas will be served. Through the end of the year it will be dinner only, with lunch to follow next month, and eventually breakfast. (Opens Wednesday)",2023-12-05T19:06:33+0000

If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning, she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth  the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room  and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, The Birth Project series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicagos retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, building a form language almost from scratch, one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the shows curators, the series has never been shown in full.",2023-12-06T15:20:15+0000

us,No Ortolans Were Hurt During the Making of This Film,"The Taste of Things, a French food film, will be shown in theaters this week in order to qualify for the Oscars and to make you really, really hungry. The 145-minute film by Tran An Hung, starring Juliette Binoche and Benoit Magimel, is based on the 1920 novel The Life and Passion of Dodin-Bouffant, Gourmet by Marcel Rouff, inspired by the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, who gave his name to a cheese and a cake. The film is set at a modest chteau in the Loire region, the centerpiece of which is the robust kitchen where Dodin-Bouffant and his cook, Eugnie, prepare sumptuous meal after meal for Dodins small coterie of gourmands, as their own love story gently simmers. The pice de rsistance is a classic pot-au-feu. The chef Pierre Gagnaire was the consultant for the cooking, and in an interview in New York he said everything is real; there was no faking. (Not quite: There was backup gas fuel for the wood-burning stove, and small quail stood in for ortolans, a delicacy that is illegal.) He said the stars knew how to cook and jumped right in. Ms. Binoche told me that the food haute cuisine but not pretentious.  From Dec. 13 through 20, there will be a menu at Frenchette, in TriBeCa, with three dishes from The Taste of Things: a ballotine of duck, pot-au-feu and baked Alaska ($90 or  la carte).

A collection of real bags on the floor before her doubled the optical illusion for passers-by, who might have been carrying their own bags from the nearby Versace or Dolce & Gabbana stores. But the gallery, Sprth Magers, is not the kind of place where most people can casually drop in and buy something; the artworks sold there fetch prices in the tens to the hundreds of thousands. If Fleurys work poked fun at the view that art is just a commodity, it was also a nostalgic reflection on the moment the empty shopping bags were first shown by the gallery, in 1991  a time when neither she nor her dealers could have afforded a permanent storefront in Mayfair.",2023-12-11T20:22:59+0000

The original Caf Boulud, an Upper East Side neighborhood hangout and destination since 1998, has moved south about half a mile to an area where its customers are likely to be driven more by destination. Its now installed in a somewhat grander setting near the Plaza Hotel and amid a coterie of other French restaurants. Still, those who know and love the restaurant will recognize the menu; its divided in quadrants addressing Le Voyage, La Saisons, Potager and La Tradition, with seasonal updates for each. Right now expect to be tempted by short ribs, crabmeat, mushrooms, sunchokes and desserts sparkling with citrus. The executive chef is Romain Paumier, who worked at the original Caf Boulud and was the executive sous chef at Mr. Bouluds flagship, Daniel. Hes the latest in a kitchen that, over the years, has been an incubator for names like Andrew Carmellini, Gavin Kaysen and Aaron Bludorn. Katalina Diaz, formerly the executive sous chef for pastry at Daniel, is the executive pastry chef. Of all his restaurants, this is the one to which Mr. Boulud is most deeply attached, given that his great-grandparents opened a Caf Boulud 100 years ago near Lyon, France, his hometown. The new Caf Boulud, designed by Jeffrey Beers, moves into the space that previously housed Vaucluse and before that Park Avenue Cafe, Prigord Park and Voisin. Now with pale gray walls that echo the color of the recently redone Daniel nearby, the new Caf Boulud has artwork, traditional detailing, velvet and leather seating in deep teal blue and amber; the space beckons with airy comfort, as yet another reaffirmation that fine dining is sticking around. There are a number of other spaces, including a bar that will open in February, and a series of elegant salons opening in the spring that will be the New York headquarters for Maison Barnes, an international realty company based in Paris, and Mr. Bouluds new partner.

Sworn enemies Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) pretend to fall in love at a destination wedding so that their friends and family (Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, Bryan Brown, Michelle Hurd and GaTa) will quit trying to trick them into liking each other. Its a loose reworking of Much Ado About Nothing, and, presumably, the first Shakespeare adaptation where a dog does yoga  and certainly the first in which a man (GaTa) serenades a koala. Nevertheless, the film, directed by Will Gluck, who wrote the screenplay with Ilana Wolpert, is so awkwardly assembled that our attention gets pulled away from the leads to the bizarrely lavish buffet spreads in the background.

Ian (Johnny Berchtold), after the death of his mother, Mary (Jennifer Pierce Mathus), is left to sort her belongings. The willowy young man is adrift and forlorn, which seems like a legitimate response, but actually isnt: Hes a synthetic artificial parallel of the actual Ian, who died of cancer, and was created to assuage Marys grief. Logically, Ian should be taken out of commission since his purpose is gone. But gradually both he and Olivia (Catherine Haena Kim), a representative of the company that built him, realize that shutting down a parallel is more fraught than turning off an appliance. Considering that people now clone their pets, the issues raised in this elegantly directed, acted and designed (far from a given among modestly budgeted indies) movie are a breath away from coming true.",2023-12-22T16:00:02+0000
