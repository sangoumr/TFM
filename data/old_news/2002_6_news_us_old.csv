People at neighboring tables, mostly fair-skinned, stare at him as if he were a matinee idol. Enwezor, a tall, long-limbed Nigerian who moves with balletic grace, takes this in stride, nonchalantly ordering a bottle of Champagne. He sticks out here, and not just because he is the best-dressed man in a small provincial city. Kassel is the home of Documenta, the most prestigious exhibition of contemporary art in Europe and perhaps the world, and Enwezor, the show's artistic director this year, has become one of the town's most famous residents. ''The Germans are very inward-looking,'' he says, when I remark upon the startling effect he has on the room. He gazes around him at the sea of blond hair.

''What do you get -- soup, rolls, and the check?'' Yes, an early bird special at elegant Amanda's, no joke. From 5 to 6 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, guests can order from a prix-fixe menu (actually, $10.01) that includes choices among three appetizers (soup, salad or polenta), four entrees (salmon, chicken, steak or pasta) and three desserts (apple strudel, chocolate mousse or Key lime pie). The menu never changes, but that's fine by me: I could eat the polenta with three-cheese sauce followed by the grilled skirt steak every night of the week. And apparently some do. ''Some people come in two or three times a week, then tell me they'd like to try something different,'' said Joyce Flinn, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Eugene. ''I just laugh and think, 'That's what the regular menu is for.' '' The atmosphere at Amanda's is intimate, with two fireplaces and with windows overlooking a well-tended garden. It's the perfect spot for a special occasion, which is to say, the last place you'd expect to find such a bargain. So why do it? ''This is the way we advertise,'' Ms. Flinn said. ''It costs us $10 for the cloth napkins and the basket of bread, but it gets people in the restaurant.'' The hope is they'll return for the regular menu, where entrees alone cost two to three times as much. My only complaint is with the hour, but eating at 5 p.m. is a small price to pay for a small price. Gretchen Kurtz",2002-06-02T05:00:00+0000

As the first complex machines produced by man, automata represented a proving ground for technology that would later be harnessed in the industrial revolution. But their original uses were rather less utilitarian. Automata were the playthings of royalty, both as a form of entertainment in palaces and courts across Europe and as gifts sent from one ruling family to another. As well as being a source of amusement, automata provided a showcase for each nation's scientific prowess, since they embodied what was, at the time, the absolute cutting edge of new technology.

us,Reyna and Mathis May Not Start," SEOUL, South Korea, June 3 -- After waiting to play the very last game of the first round of the World Cup, the United States is suddenly running out of time to recuperate from injuries. Both Claudio Reyna, the dependable captain, and Clint Mathis, the most explosive offensive force on the team, are in doubt for the opener against Portugal on Wednesday. Reyna said this afternoon that his chances are ""50-50"" to play the first game, while Mathis left practice this morning to have an MRI on his surgically-repaired left knee. The test was negative, but Mathis is also unsure for Wednesday. Often bothered by injuries in his career with the national team, Reyna said he felt a twinge in his right quadriceps while reaching for a ball 10 days ago. It has not healed despite treatment. On Monday afternoon, he appeared at a press conference and, when asked about the injury, he did not deny it. ""Me and Clint are a little banged up,"" Reyna said. ""In the worst-case scenario, I'd only miss a game. But I've got another day to get treatment."" He said the decision would be made on Tuesday. Coach Bruce Arena, who was seated next to Reyna when the captain made his 50-50 statement, raised his eyebrows. Asked about the prognosis, Arena said, ""I don't know, I'm not a mathematician."" But Arena also said, ""We've been used to injuries. We rarely have the full lineup."" He said all teams have to get used to them because of the long league seasons, including cup games, and the heavy national-team schedule tucked into the league schedules. ""Would we like Chris Armas to be here?"" he said of another regular midfielder who tore up his knee last month. ""It's not going to happen. Would France have liked Zidane to play in their first game? It didn't happen."" And he gave several other examples of injuries. Mathis tore up his knee exactly one year ago to the day of Wednesday's game with Portugal, had surgery, and did not play for the national team again until late January. Arena has suggested that Mathis is not in the best possible shape, but today's visit for an MRI was a new development. ""He practiced briefly today,"" Arena said. ""He took a precautionary MRI -- nothing. There's a little inflammation, but it went well."" Could Mathis play Wednesday? Arena replied, ""I'm told he could."" Arena would not speculate on who would replace either player, but then again, he has declined to discuss potential starting lineups, saying, ""I've never seen where it does me any good."" Reyna said it was not his job to make out the lineup, but he noted that Earnie Stewart could move into his role in the midfield, or that Pablo Mastroeni, a newcomer to the team, ""has done well there."" If Mathis cannot go against Portugal, this would open room for another offensive-minded player like Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, Josh Wolff or Joe Max Moore to work with Brian McBride up front. There are also hints that Frankie Hejduk has been training at left outside back perhaps to start instead of David Regis, who took a while to adjust after a long grueling season with his team in Metz, France. The U.S. is not that deep that it can afford to lose players like Reyna and Mathis against a powerful team like Portugal. But Reyna said he knows his own body, and right now he cannot play. Mathis did not comment. He was taking treatment. ",2002-06-03T05:00:00+0000

Included in its liabilities is $91 million that the company owes to Bertelsmann, which lent Napster money to help it develop a for-pay music service.

Board of Trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services acknowledge with great sadness the death of Frances L. Beatman, a nationally respected professional social worker, family therapist and family theorist. Beginning as a young social worker in 1938, she became a key force in the development of services to alleviate family conflict. Throughout her career as executive director of Jewish Family Service (a JBFCS predecessor agency) from 1958-1977 and later as a JBFCS trustee, Frances was a creative and visionary leader. She was instrumental in expanding JFS' reach into the community through such innovations as a fee-for-service model, new family treatment approaches, a quick response unit and mental health consultation. Frances valued public support of demonstration projects aimed at preventing more serious problems. She was extremely devoted to her husband Joseph, a JFS board member for whom our Riverdale out patient mental health clinic is named. After the merger with Jewish Board of Guardians, Frances remained involved with JBFCS as an active Vice - President and member of many board committees. She believed the merger stimulated the creation of more services to troubled families and children. Frances understood the critical role JBFCS was obligated to play in helping those most in need. She was a bold thinker and receptive to new ideas but always challenged assumptions not based in sound clinical thinking. Frances will remain an inspiration to all of us.

The ''unregistered child may be unable to apply for a passport or formal job, open a bank account, get a marriage license (or) stand for elective office or vote,'' according to research by the fund in Italy. This violates the automatic registration outlined in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 191 countries have ratified. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)",2002-06-05T05:00:00+0000

The holder comes with a mate, a potato peeler with a sharp, thin blade. Mr. Bryant's wife, Christine, who handles marketing, said the holder helps people who have arthritis and can't hold a potato or carrot easily. So why doesn't it have a cushiony handle? ''Those peelers are too heavy, so they take off too much when you use them,'' she said. It's also left- or right-handed.

This has been a good season for blowfish, found off Long Island's south shore and the north New Jersey coast. The tails are delicious morsels, with a single slender bone running their length. But few markets in Manhattan sell them because, the owners say, few people buy them and many do not even know what they are. I cook them like jumbo shrimp, dusting them with flour before sauting in butter and garlic, or I briefly sear the tails on the grill. Sometimes I add them to paella or bouillabaisse.

The directors of the company, which has been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, met on Saturday and agreed to explore Adelphia's options, including asset sales, private equity investments and bank loans. However, there has been no indication that the company has been able to find fresh sources of capital. As a result, fixed-income analysts who follow Adelphia as well as some major bondholders say that a bankruptcy filing is imminent. The company has until June 15 to raise the money to make $50 million in interest payments on some outstanding bonds. Separately, the company filed documents with the government yesterday confirming that it would not cover the legal costs and expenses for four members of the founding Rigas family and another former employee. The filing also said that Adelphia had hired Christopher Dunstan as chief financial officer and Steven Teuscher as chief accounting officer. Geraldine Fabrikant (NYT)",2002-06-07T05:00:00+0000

Twenty-five such kids signed up this year to be umpires for the Darien Youth Club, which for most of its 41 years has been hiring 12- and 13-year-old boys to officiate little kids' games. But in early spring, the Darien Youth Club's baseball commissioner received a phone call from the Illinois Department of Labor. Illinois state law stipulates that it is illegal for children under 14 to work for money (except to baby-sit, deliver newspapers, do yardwork, caddy or act in films); 14- and 15-year-olds must first obtain work permits. Following umpire sign-ups this winter, somebody filed an anonymous complaint against the Darien Youth Club. While the baseball commissioner tried to discern whether this call was a practical joke, the civil servant on the line informed him that his league was in violation of 86 counts of the state child labor laws, carrying a fine of up to $655,000.",2002-06-09T05:00:00+0000

us,'The Emperor of Ocean Park'," The news of the Judge's death reached us several times in the years before the event actually occurred. It is not that he was ill; he was, as a rule, so vigorous that one tended to forget his wavering health, which is why the heart attack that at last cut him down was, at first, so difficult to credit. It is simply that he led the sort of life that generated rumor. People disliked my father, intensely, and he returned the favor. They spread stories of his death because they prayed the stories were true. To his enemiesthey were legion, a fact in which he gloriedmy father was a plague, and rumors of a cure always raise hopes in those who suffer, or love those who do. And, in this case, some of those my father plagued were not people but causes, which, in America, can always count their lovers in the millions, unlike individual people, who die unloved every day. Not one of his enemies but hated my father, and not one but spread the stories. Self-styled friends would call. They were always whispering how sorry they were. They had heard, they would say, about my father's heart attack while promoting his latest book up in Boston. Or his stroke while taping a television interview out in Cincinnati. Except that there would not have been one: he would be alive and well in San Antonio, speaking to the convention of some conservative political action committeethe Rightpacs, Kimmer calls them. But, oh, the gleeful rumors of his demise! My mother hated the rumors, not for the heartache, she said, but for the humiliationthere were standards, after all. But not in the rumor mill. Waiting in the checkout line at the supermarket, just before my son Bentley was born, I was astonished to read on the cover of one of the more imaginative tabloids, just beneath the weekly Whitney Houston story (TALKS CANDIDLY ABOUT HER HEARTBREAK) and just above the latest way to lose as much weight as you want without diet or exercise (A MIRACLE DOCTORS WON'T TELL YOU), the gladsome tidings that the Mafia had put out a contract on my father, because of his cooperation with federal prosecutorsalthough, when Kimmer made me go back to the store and buy it and I read the whole thing, all one hundred fifty words, I noticed a pointed lack of detail as to what my father could possibly have to cooperate with prosecutors about, or what he might know about the Mafia that would be so dangerous. I called Mrs. Rose, the Judge's long-suffering assistant, and finally caught up with him on the road in Seattle. He took the opportunity to warn me yet again on the insidiousness of his enemies.

If he knew then what he knows now, he may have given ''soup'' a place in that title. There is no denying that Mr. Sable's hot dogs are a cut above the rest. The jumbo stadium-style hot dogs are placed neatly inside a kaiser roll, big enough to contain the heaps of toppings Mr. Sable endows them with. The Junk Yard Dog ($2.75), for example, covered in cole slaw, sweet and hot relishes, chopped onions and mustard, is as filling a meal as any overstuffed deli sandwich. But since the store's early days, it has been Mr. Sable's homemade soups that gain most of the attention. Hungry customers line up outside the store and into the adjacent alley to grab one of three daily soup specials (it's standing room inside, too, as there are no tables). The soups come in three takeout sizes, 12 ounces ($2.25), 16 ounces ($2.85), 24 ounces ($4.25) and 32 ounces ($5.35). There are also sandwiches ($1.75 for a half, $3.50 whole): tuna, chicken salad, roast beef, baked ham and roast turkey and cheeses. Mr. Sable, who has always been the store's only employee, has no set schedule for soup recipes. He decides his flavors only the night before and posts them on his Web site, www.soupmeister.com, early in the morning so his customers can easily check if their favorites, everything from sausage gumbo to split pea, are being served.

Before he starting writing books for children, before he began his quarter-century-long hobby of creating the luminous images collected in LEWIS CARROLL, Photographer: The Princeton University Library Albums (Princeton University, $49.95), Charles Lutwidge Dodgson taught mathematics at Oxford. He was a man of science at a time when science had taken a decidedly dark turn -- geologists pondered the implications of extinction, chemists calculated how many years were left before the sun would stop shining, geometers contemplated what lay beyond the eternal fixities of Euclid. In 1860, the British Association for the Advancement of Science met at Dodgson's college to discuss, among other things, the theories of Charles Darwin. ''The ensuing debate,'' Roger Taylor, a British photographic historian, writes, ''has gone down in history as a defining moment that saw the evolutionists successfully argue their case against the fundamental beliefs of the established Church.'' Dodgson set up an outdoor studio to document the meeting. The many hundreds of collodion-process photographs included in the book (out of an estimated lifetime total of 2,500) include striking tableaus of the very latest in comparative anatomy, the juxtaposed skeletons of monkey and man. Dodgson's portraits of the living (among them Tennyson, Ruskin and Faraday) exhibit faces as gaunt and haunted as their fleshless peers, but tucked between the legs and sitting on the laps of these tortured Victorians lounge their ethereally composed children. Yes, Dodgson liked to photograph children. Naked ones, too. Taylor and Edward Wakeling's studied yet entirely accessible book shows that the children in Dodgson's studio harbored no apprehensions about what they were doing or who they were doing it with.

This posthumous novel by Bradbury (1932-2000) employs two voyages -- that of an unnamed English novelist (the author's stand-in) on an academic junket to St. Petersburg, and that of the Enlightenment writer Denis Diderot to Russia in the 18th century -- to advance a wacky theory called postmortemism: that great writers are never really dead and buried, in either the physical or literary sense.

us,Metro Briefing | Connecticut: Hartford: Enron Law Firms May Be Sued,"Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said yesterday that within weeks, he would file lawsuits against individuals or firms that helped devise a $220 million deal last year between the Enron Corporation and the state trash agency. He did not identify the targets, but in the months since the money the agency gave Enron was lost in the company's collapse in December, he has repeatedly criticized the two law firms advising the trash agency, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority. One firm, Murtha Cullina in Hartford, the trash authority's longtime counsel, helped draft the deal; the other firm, Hawkins, Delafield & Wood, of New York City, was the agency's bond counsel. The firms insist that the deal was a legal energy transaction; Mr. Blumenthal has called it an illegal loan to Enron made to increase the trash agency's revenue.

The currents briefly slowed and the sea became calmer over the weekend, allowing divers to recover six more bodies, bringing the total to 109. But aviation officials said waves up to 13 feet and strengthening currents interrupted the diving again yesterday. The recorders, in water nearly 200 feet deep, are designed to emit locator beacons for 30 days. Keith Bradsher (NYT)",2002-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Microsoft had argued that Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington should dismiss the case because the states did not have the authority to ask for restrictions that would apply to the entire nation. The software maker also said that the states had not proved that their citizens were injured by the antitrust violations it had committed. Microsoft underestimated the Court of Appeals, Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote in her ruling, noting that the higher court had an opportunity to rule on the states' role in the case in its decision last June.

us,Technology Briefing | Software: Alliance Will Acquire Liquid Audio,"Liquid Audio, a company based in Redwood City, Calif., that makes software for online music distribution, said yesterday that it would be bought by the Alliance Entertainment Corporation, a home entertainment distributor, for about $118.3 million in stock. Alliance distributes video games, compact discs, DVD's and videotapes. The companies hope that the deal will create a major media delivery company with both online and off-line impact. The move comes two weeks after Josh Schechter, a dissident Liquid Audio shareholder who owns a 9 percent stake, called on executives to sell the company after it reported a large drop in revenue. Liquid Audio's first-quarter revenue fell to $135,000 from $1.7 million a year earlier and $768,000 in the fourth quarter. However, another shareholder, Musicmaker.com, which has a 6.9 percent stake in Liquid Audio, criticized the proposed merger in a letter to Gerald W. Kearby, Liquid Audio's chief executive. He described the deal as a ''shotgun wedding.'' Still, Mr. Kearby said that ''the combination with Alliance offers the most significant return of value to Liquid Audio stockholders.''

He was born October 14, 1904, in New York City, the second son of Walter L. Goodwin and Elizabeth Sage Goodwin (later Elizabeth Sage Hare). He grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, attending Kingswood School and later Groton School in Massachusetts. He went to Yale University first as an undergraduate and then as a student at the School of Architecture, graduating with an M.F.A. in 1927. A few years later he and his colleague Robert Schutz opened the architectural firm Schutz & Goodwin in Hartford, out of which for the next thirty years, together and separately, they designed many houses, offices, schools and libraries in the Hartford area, most notably the Hartford Public Library, whose innovative design placed it astride a major highway going under Main Street. Goodwin also designed the restoration of the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. In 1962, Goodwin retired from the practice of architecture and turned fulltime to his lifelong passion for painting and drawing. Over the next thirty years he produced three illustrated books and hundreds of oil paintings commenting with wit, irony and sometimes romantic nostalgia on various aspects of American life. His paintings have been exhibited in New York, Paris and in the greater Hartford area at such places as the University of Hartford, the Canton Gallery on the Green, the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, Connecticut, the Goodspeed Opera House and the New Britain Museum of American Art. Goodwin served in the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific during 1942-45. In Hartford, he served on the Boards of Trustees of the Hartford Conservatory and the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art. He leaves behind two sons, Phillip Manning Goodwin of West Sussex, England, and Rufus Stockton Goodwin of Boston, from his first wife, Anne Stockton (still living). He leaves one daughter, Judith Goodwin Pott, of New York City, from his second wife, Susan Taylor Goodwin (deceased). Also surviving are eight grandchildren, one great-grandchild, two stepdaughters from his second wife, and their families. All of them will miss him deeply and will continue to draw inspiration from his creativity, inner strength, and self-reliance. A Memorial Service will be held at Christ Church Cathedral, corner of Church and Main Streets, Hartford, CT on Friday, June 21, 2002, at 1:30 P.M. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Canton Gallery on the Green, Canton Green, Canton, CT 06019, or to the Connecticut Hospice Inc., 270 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT. 06032.",2002-06-14T05:00:00+0000

We know that, of course, if only from the American experience of the 19th century, when utopian communities flourished briefly before fading away. And if you think about it in a certain way, we also know it from the more recent history of the Internet. So many of the early user groups, the early computer clubs and the early Web sites began as places where like-minded people could gather -- at least virtually -- to offer one another advice and small talk, support and comfort. So many of them also had an idealized vision of how Internet communities would act: generously, selflessly, honorably. But as these communities grew -- and especially as the Web sites morphed into real businesses -- that early utopian spirit invariably gave way to the harsher realities of both human nature and American commerce. As for what was left, well, a good place to look for that answer is eBay , the Internet's dominant auction site. ",2002-06-15T05:00:00+0000

us,'Lone Patriot'," The enemy took John Pitner, by subterfuge and surprise, on a hot midsummer Saturday when no one could really have been expected to stand and fight, and the result was that John lost his liberty before he had a chance to save America. The date was July 27, 1996, the time was five in the afternoon, and the place was a low, gray, prefabricated house&#8211;the prosecutor said &quot;trailer&quot; and the papers &quot;mobile home,&quot; but the company that made it said &quot; manufactured home&quot;&#8211;hidden in a small riverine clearing in the woods of Whatcom County, Washington, about eighteen miles inland from Bellingham Bay, and not much farther than that from the Canadian border. In Bellingham, at five, people were already shaking off the day&#8211;getting into their cars and heading down to the harbor to watch the kayaks come in and then, maybe stop, for a drink and dinner while the sun melted into a pink line over the San Juan Islands. But out in the county, in the tangled scrub and wayward ash woods that a few very old Whatcom loggers could still remember as breathing forest, the air was heavy, and people were sitting around watching reruns, too listless to enjoy the liberty they had. John himself wasn't watching anything. He was thinking about the real estate agent who had called twice to tell him she was on her way, and, of course, he was also thinking about the invasion of the New World Order, wondering whether, given the imminence of the invasion, it was worth his while to put a second coat of gray paint on the wooden deck of a house that was up for sale anyway. John was very concerned about his liberty. He believed that liberty was something God had guaranteed to men like him, men who were Patriots, and that now the New World Order was chipping it away, like the deck paint on his own porch.

us,Air-Conditioner Surcharge in a Co-op,"Q: I live in a studio apartment in a 200-unit co-op building in Manhattan. Electricity and heating costs have always been included in the maintenance charges, which are billed based upon the number of shares owned. Recently, however, the board instituted a $40 a month per apartment air-conditioning surcharge to make up for the higher electricity costs in the summer months. This fee is added to the maintenance bill from June to September. To some extent the fee is optional since a tenant who chooses not to use an air-conditioner does not have to pay it. The building, however, includes studios, one-bedroom apartments and several multiroom apartments. All tenants who use air-conditioning pay the same fee, no matter how big their apartments are or how many air-conditioning units they have. The surcharge seems to fall unfairly on those who own smaller units with fewer shares and should pay a proportionally lower fee. Can a co-op simply elect to bill electricity surcharges to tenants without regard to the number of shares or the number of air-conditioning units they use? . . .

Tough talk, but even experts seemed uncertain how much to care. Start 2 was never more than informally binding because the two nations never ratified identical versions. And last month's nuclear accord in Moscow cut active arsenals well below Start 2's 3,500-warhead level.

In addition to his music interests, he was an Eagle Scout and remained fond of camping, alpine skiing, and sailing. He also built a harpsichord and furniture and was an amateur photographer. He retired from the army in 1974 and became the Chairman of the Music Department at Central Michigan University. Upon his retirement in 1981, he returned to NY & conducted occasionally; he participated annually in the USMA Band's reunion concert held each June.

us,The Attorney General Goes To War,"A few years ago, Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, was invited to speak before the Federalist Society, the legal group whose members abhor the use of courts to force political change -- at least liberal political change -- and have helped formulate the key conservative tenet that power should devolve from the central government, including the federal courts, to the states. ''I told them that I had had an epiphany and I was now a fervent Federalist,'' Spitzer said. ''Having won this job as attorney general of a state, this devolution of power was a wonderful thing: they were limiting the feds, they were shifting to us, so we could go off and sue the tobacco companies.'' Spitzer claims that his audience was ''ashen.''

And yet, I don't think the owners named the establishment just to be noticed by The Times. For on this auto parts/tires-fixed/car wash/body shop stretch of Routes 1 and 9, not many care to linger for more than, well, a quick bite. This deli makes that possible. For the on-the-go traveler, there is the usual assortment of candy, chips, cigarettes, cold-relief products, Krazy Glue and toothbrushes. For those of us with a little more time, there are three booths where you can sit, enjoy a meal and watch the traffic heading north to the George and south to the Holland. Breakfast offerings include hot bagels, omelets, pancakes, French toast and the menu's priciest item, steak and eggs ($6.75). For lunch and dinner, there are hot and cold sandwiches (all served with fries), wraps, soups and salads. I ordered the char-broiled pizza burger deluxe ($3.95). My traveling companion selected the turkey wrap ($4.95, with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, bacon and mayonnaise). The one-man crew took the order, prepared the food, brought it to the table, and kindly asked how everything was. I told him, and I'll tell you: ''Very good.'' The Quick Bite has even made a stab at dcor, with artificial flowers in vases on the tables, artwork on the walls and a couple of hanging plants. And the deli is spacious, perhaps too spacious.

us,'Think of England'," On that night, a Sunday in February, Jane read under the covers with a flashlight, skimming a novel for a page she wanted to read again. Every so often, she closed the book and looked at the cover, where her own name appeared in the title. It was exciting to see it that way, in carved letters. It made the book hers. She had a pen and her notebook with her, too, just in case; she liked to write things down. She was the kind of girl who felt New Year's should be in the fall, at the beginning of school, the kind of girl who begged for chores and saved quarters in a jar to buy a pony. Beneath her nightgown she wore a pair of fresh underpants &#151; she'd spent the night with a girl who put them on before bed and she'd copied the idea. As usual she'd braided her hair to make it look smoother for school. Her brother Sean slept in the other bed, flat on his back with his hands dangling. Their little sister and brother &#151; twins &#151; were in their room down the hall. At nine Jane had begun to want a room of her own. She was writing a book. ",2002-06-16T05:00:00+0000

us,Free Fallin',"Parachuting into Panama with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, the unnamed narrator of Raul Correa's darkly comic first novel, I DON'T KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN TOLD (HarperCollins, $24.95), tells us: ''It was like falling through a painting that you see real and in person. It's too good, too much like everything should be.'' Or maybe it was just the mescaline he and his squad had ingested. These kinds of observations litter Correa's coming-of-age story of a military misfit who enlists for lack of a better choice. Stationed at Fort Bragg, the young paratrooper finds camaraderie among a pack of underachieving ''doper scouts'' and their maverick Platoon Daddy, who keeps a casual eye on his unruly unit. It's 1980 and the book zeroes in on the minutiae of military life in peacetime: reconnaissance exercises, cultivating cool nicknames, meeting women in foreign countries. Correa sandwiches this inside a plot about a loosely sketched, ill-fated scheme to steal arms for a man known only as Mr. Big. The plot unfolds in sporadic flashbacks over the course of one miserable night in New York City 20 years later. His Airborne days behind him, the narrator is again a wounded loner, exploring the city's underbelly in his free time. His only comforts are a copy of ''Huckleberry Finn'' and a letter from Paola, a Panamanian prostitute. The narrator's story feels aimless, and he admits as much: ''My Army stories that surround my Paola story are mostly just about walking around places in the world with a weapon.'' Correa served as a sergeant in the 82nd Airborne, and the glimpses of the languorous side of military life are frank and funny. Some of the dialogue has just the right pitch, balancing innocence and savvy. For Correa's narrator, reminiscing is meant to be cathartic, but the story's stream-of-consciousness style occasionally feels as if it's in a free fall of its own.

Earl Robinson's friend, Woody Guthrie, spotted young Perry's talent and encouraged him to pursue music. The family moved to New York City, where Perry Robinson grew up to become a leading clarinetist and exponent of the 1960's free jazz movement, recording with Charlie Haden, Carla Bley, Archie Shepp and Dave Brubeck, and outside jazz with, the Fugs, Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan. Mr. Robinson was also in the Navy Band, once led a Middle Eastern music group and worked as a professional magician. In his book, written with Florence F. Wetzel, Mr. Robinson tells anecdotes about people like Benny Goodman, Paul Desmond, Sonny Rollins, Chet Baker, Ginger Baker and Mr. Robinson's cousin, the actor Alan Arkin.

us,Let Your Fingers Do the Walking,"How can you resist a book that opens with a two-page color-splashed illustration of an infant's twitching feet and an approaching giant hand, accompanied by the words ''Me papa tickle me feet / he call it 'finger treat' ''? With its singsongy cadences and ebulliently thick brushstroke illustrations, TICKLE, TICKLE (Roaring Brook Press, $14.95; Ages 2 to 5), by Dakari Hru and illustrated by Ken Wilson-Max, manages to turn a father-and-son tickling session into an infectious homage to one of life's simplest pleasures. The playfully scrawled text by Hru, a poet and children's book author who died in 1994 at the age of 42, adopts a baby's-eye view of the world -- He tickle me tummy, me chest, me arm / his fingers fly so wild'' -- where resistance is futile: ''Me twist and swing and laugh and kick / but he hold me anyway.'' Not that either really cares -- Me scream and run (but oh, what fun!) / when papa tickle me feet.'' Wilson-Max's vibrant paintings, rendered in bright primary colors, work well with the book's large format; there's a captivating freshness in the broadly drawn figures -- father, son and mother. The ethnicity of the characters, and the slightly unfamiliar ring of lines like ''He say, 'Come here, little man. You my ticklin' chile,' '' seem entirely inconsequential, which is the point, of course. The message is universal: the pure exuberance coursing through the pages of this charming book is bound to make even the most jaded, bleary-eyed parent smile -- and more than a few fingers start wandering.

In the last six months, clothing purchases have sometimes outpaced book sales, said Mary Brett Whitfield, a senior vice president at Retail Forward; just 25 percent of online shoppers bought clothing last August. ''Now that apparel has caught up to books,'' she said, ''I think we'll see these two categories jockeying for best-seller position.'' Software and music compact discs were in the second tier of online shopping categories, with 22 percent of consumers choosing those items. Bob Tedeschi (NYT)",2002-06-18T05:00:00+0000

CEO and owner of Spectrum Fabrics, Inc., died Sunday, June 16, 2002, at Duke University Medical Center where he and his wife Ruth were benefactors. The Alberts, who live in Purchase, NY, and Palm Beach, Fla., became personally involved at Duke in 1998, when Ruth received treatment that restored her vision. The couple established the Ruth Albert Endowment for Eye Research at the Duke Eye Center. Later that year, convinced of the importance of genomic research to advance human health, they presented a major gift to the Duke Center for Human Genetics. Both Mr. and Mrs. Albert were members of Duke Advisory Boards and in December, 2001, they announced plans to bequeath the bulk of their estate to the Medical Center. Their gift will create the Ruth and Herman Albert Eye Institute for Research at the Duke Eye Center, and the Herman and Ruth Albert Lung Cancer Genomics Fund for research at the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center. Ralph Snyderman, MD, Chancellor for Health Affairs, and CEO of the Duke University Health System, called Herman Albert ''a truly great man, one of the strongest I've ever known. The legacy that he and Ruth created at Duke will live and benefit the health and lives of generations to come.'' Herman Albert was born on November 23, 1922. At the end of WWII he began his career in an entry-level position with a home furnishing textile manufacturing firm in New York City. With a combination of innovation, hard work, and calculated risk, he rose through the ranks to become CEO and owner of the company. In May, Mr. and Mrs. Albert were honored at a dinner at the home of Duke University President, Nannerl O. Keohane, where they received an official proclamation approving construction of the Albert Eye Institute.

Construction companies, retail stores, restaurants, export-import businesses and communications enterprises all shed jobs, more than offsetting modest growth in the financial sector. Underemployment, particularly a problem in the construction sector, edged up to 3.1 percent from 3 percent. As Hong Kong's border with the rest of China becomes ever more open, many manufacturing and retail businesses are moving to lower-cost cities nearby. Hong Kong's government warned yesterday that a fresh crop of high school and university graduates now entering the job market could keep unemployment high in the near future.

Esmond Martin had an astonishing mind, alive with dynamism and originality that knew no horizons. Often a paradox, he was shy yet gracious and always a gentleman. His creative mind was interested in everything around him. He was a brilliant chess player, having been selected as a backup to Samuel Reshevsky in an international tournament. He was a discerning philatelist of long standing, a well-known orchid cultivator, with a patent on a species of his own creation, as well as a collector of fine pocket watches, books and English antique furniture. His magnificently restored estate and elegant gardens appeared in many feature films over the years and in the Smithsonian Institute. He was a very talented amateur lawn and court tennis player, having beaten the likes of Pierre Etchebaster, the then reigning 20 year world champion in court tennis, and even chalking up a 60 victory over Pancho Gonzales during a challenge match in the course of Gonzales' reign as world champion. For many years he was the world's fly-fishing record holder for Atlantic salmon that he landed on the Cascapedia River, Canada, in 1939. He excelled in many of his personal financial affairs, successfully wildcatting in gas and oil and other varied investments. Esmond Martin is survived by his twin brother, Alastair, his daughter, Serina Sanchez of Palm Beach, Florida, his two sons, Esmond, Jr. living in Kenya, and Peter, resident of the S.W. of France and five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

Forrester surveyed 6,000 online consumers, and 36 percent said they would permit their World Wide Web surfing habits to be tracked in exchange for a $5 discount on their monthly Internet service. Half said they would permit their television viewing habits to be tracked for the same amount. The report said that women are more likely to permit others to track their Internet and television viewing than men, with 39 percent of women saying they would permit such surveillance online for $5 discounts, compared with 33 percent of men. The reason for the difference, Forrester said, is that ''men partake of more behaviors like visiting adult Web sites that they might not want the world to know about.''

us,A Dutch Oven From France Turns a Home Into a Hearth," Most home cooks need only one heavy Dutch oven, and one usually lasts a lifetime. Mine  more than 50 years old  belonged to my mother. But I am sorely tempted to buy one by Staub, a French brand adored by top chefs and now available in America. These casseroles ""conduct heat beautifully, and yet they're elegant enough to go into the dining room,"" said David Waltuck of Chanterelle, which uses them. The black matte finish gives the pots a cast-iron look, but heavy enamel actually covers the cast iron. The pots are rustproof and need no seasoning. The lids have brass knobs, and studs on the underside encourage cooking juices to condense onto the surface of the food, automatically basting it. The pots range from one cup to 12 1/2 quarts. Sur La Table in Manhasset, N.Y., and around the country sells the cookware, which is $29.95 for the one-cup version to $235.95 for an eight-quart size. It can be ordered from (800) 243-0852, www.surlatable.com or from Staub, which carries the entire line and whose prices are slightly lower.

Silverstein, the real estate developer who controlled the World Trade Center, suffered a legal setback this week in his attempt to recover more than $7 billion in insurance for the Sept. 11 terror attack. Mr. Silverstein has argued that he is entitled to two $3.6 billion payments for two separate attacks on the two buildings; the insurers argue it was one attack. But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that employees at Willis, Mr. Silverstein's insurance broker, must testify about conversations last fall with Mr. Silverstein's lawyers. The insurers suspect that Mr. Silverstein and the broker initially considered the destruction a single event for insurance purposes. Lawyers for Swiss Re, one of the insurance companies, could start deposing Willis brokers next week. Jonathan D. Glater (NYT)",2002-06-21T05:00:00+0000

(Then, as now, a rising tide lifted all boats.) Today, Park City's reputation is more genteel, with affluent skiers and house-hunting celebrities crowding the town's restaurants and bars, but it remains a world apart from most of Utah, which is staunchly conservative and comparatively low key. Skiing put Park City on the map a generation ago, and the Winter Olympics in February widened its fame. But this city of 7,000 people remains mostly overlooked by tourists in the off-season, when its few streets are quiet and the night air is crisp. Winters here at 7,000 feet are fine, to be sure.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  VON BERNUTH, CHARLES M.","von BERNUTH-Charles M. Of Lyford Cay, Bahamas, passed away on May 25, 2002, at the age of 89. Beloved husband of the late Eloise Fiamingo. He was educated in the U.S. and Switzerland, and joined the family business, Bernuth Lembcke Co of NY, creosote importers and a shipping company. During WWII, originally he was a Calvary officer in the U.S. Army at Ft. Riley, KS, and later was recruited as a Captain into the O.S.S, where he was awarded the Silver Star for bravery in action. At war's end he returned to the family business, retiring in 1962, when he moved with his family to Rome, Italy, living there for over 30 years. A superb horseman, horses were the center of his life. He trained horses, judged at the National Horse Show, played polo at Meadowbrook with the very greats, receiving honorable mention; he just genuinely loved horses. He was a world traveler visiting all seven continents with his late wife, multi-lingual, multitalented, a writer, actor, dancer, composer-lyricist, skier, yachtsman, leatherworker, even conquering the unicycle. Actively involved in community affairs, he was a member of Squadron A, The Sleepy Hollow Country Club and The Lyford Cay Club. On the human side there are no superlatives to adequately describe his dignity, his charm, his honesty, his generosity, his humor. Elegant and stunningly handsome with all the social graces, he lived a wondrous and joyous life. He is survived by his first wife Shirley Paige Bernuth, their four children, Antonia Cook, Ticia Agri, Victoria Bernuth and Charles P. von Bernuth, four grandchildren, his nephews, Ernest P. Bernuth Jr. and James T. Bernuth and his neice Barbara King, his loving friend Dorothy Kohler, together with a host of other adoring friends.

The best performance, though, comes from Edmond O'Brien as a hard-drinking senator who supports the president. The film still packs a punch thanks to Rod Serling's lean screenplay (based on the popular novel), but there's no mistaking that the story is three decades old: a subplot involving incriminating love letters seems downright quaint, and a sturdy cigarette case ultimately saves the nation -- Tuesday at 6 p.m. on TCM.",2002-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,'Herman Melville'," The first volume of this biography ends with Herman Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne in the dining room of the Little Red Inn at Lenox, Massachusetts, on an afternoon in mid-November 1851. There Melville had been holding his publication party for Moby-Dick, to which he had invited a single guest. The two authors had shocked Lenox by dining in public in a village where by custom the hotel was for guests only, and the indigenous yokels (according to a new resident) had taken turns peeking in at them, sure that the two most notoriously reclusive literary men in the county had perversely chosen this indecorous way of meeting each other instead of going to Melville's Arrowhead outside Pittsfield or Hawthorne's rented little red cottage outside Lenox. The local belles and beaux, the newcomer wrote some weeks later, had found long-lasting amusement in this peculiar attempt at acquaintanceship between such dissimilar men, the dour author of the Puritanic The Scarlet Letter and the free-and-easy Melville, author of Typee and Omoo, books which had made him the first American literary sex symbol. There, alone in the dining room after the hotel guests had dined, the two had lingered with the first presentation copy of Moby-Dick while Hawthorne accustomed himself to the astounding dedication: &quot;In token of my admiration for his genius, This Book is Inscribed to Nathaniel Hawthorne.&quot; Afterward they had made their farewells, for Hawthorne, unknown to most of the townspeople, was leaving the Berkshires.

us,QUICK BITE/West Paterson; Fresh Fruit That Showers in Chocolate,"Chocolates typically take a back seat to ice cream and Popsicles when it comes to summertime sweets. But that might change if word gets out about Bromilow's seasonal specialty: chocolate-covered fresh fruits ($13 a pound, available through Sept. 30). Every morning, Bromilow's owner, Thomas Stewart, heads to a farmer's market to select the day's ripest fare. Strawberries and bananas go in his basket, along with pineapple, blueberries, oranges and grapes. Back at the store, the fruit is washed, peeled and sliced, then placed on the enrober, a conveyor belt that passes through a spray of milk chocolate -- ''like a chocolate waterfall,'' Mr. Stewart said. Whole strawberries are his best sellers, but my vote goes to the banana chunks. Besides fruit, there are also chocolate-covered Twinkies, Devil Dogs, Rice Krispies treats and potato chips ($12.50 a pound). With so many chocolates to choose from (44-year-old Bromilow's makes about 160 varieties), your best bet is to nibble your way through an assortment. Try some plantations (taffy center), sponges (honeycomb candy center) and meltaways (flavored chocolate center). Add a few creams and truffles, some chocolate-covered dried fruits, and of course the store's signature butter crunch, toffee covered in chocolate and rolled in Brazil nuts. If stored away from heat and moisture, the chocolates have a good shelf life, but the fresh fruits must be eaten the day of purchase. Somehow, that's never a problem in my house.

He was educated in the U.S. and Switzerland, and joined the family business, Bernuth Lembcke Co of NY, creosote importers and a shipping company. During WWII, originally he was a Calvary officer in the U.S. Army at Ft. Riley, KS, and later was recruited as a Captain into the O.S.S, where he was awarded the Silver Star for bravery in action. At war's end he returned to the family business, retiring in 1962, when he moved with his family to Rome, Italy, living there for over 30 years. A superb horseman, horses were the center of his life. He trained horses, judged at the National Horse Show, played polo at Meadowbrook with the very greats, receiving honorable mention; he just genuinely loved horses. He was a world traveler visiting all seven continents with his late wife, multi-lingual, multitalented, a writer, actor, dancer, composer-lyricist, skier, yachtsman, leatherworker, even conquering the unicycle. Actively involved in community affairs, he was a member of Squadron A, The Sleepy Hollow Country Club and The Lyford Cay Club. On the human side there are no superlatives to adequately describe his dignity, his charm, his honesty, his generosity, his humor. Elegant and stunningly handsome with all the social graces, he lived a wondrous and joyous life.

The lot is accessible from the street through a remote-controlled gate. Only owners of parking spots have the ability to enter and leave the lot via the gate. Our board recently decided to have the gate replaced, with the money coming out of the condominium's funds. Since parking-spot owners pay a separate charge for their spaces, shouldn't the cost of a new gate come out of the parking-lot fund rather than the housing common charge?

Though Bonaparte exercised power only for a decade and a half, his impact on the future lasted until nearly the end of the twentieth century, almost two hundred years after his death. Indeed, his influence may not yet be spent. People love reading about him and his spectacular rise, just as in Roman and medieval times they read about Alexander. And they ponder the question: Might I, in comparable circumstances, have done as well? Few persons of ambition have failed to see Bonaparte as an exemplar or a spur.

During the infamous police riots he was struck two or three times by a cop with a nightstick, and when he managed to get back to his hotel he found himself pissing blood. He eventually recovered, wrote his piece and left out the attack on himself. &quot;Michael,&quot; I asked my always elegantly dressed, highly polite friend, &quot;how could you leave it out? You weren&#146;t protesting. It shows the scope of the violence. It&#146;s important.&quot; He respectfully disagreed. &quot;I wasn&#146;t sent to write about myself,&quot; he said, with a certain amount of hauteur. New Journalism was in the air back then&#151;an approach in which the observer was taken to be as important, or more important, than the stuff observed (Tom Wolfe, for instance, writing about auto shows, well before taking on the more ambitious role of American Balzac).

us,'The Dream of Scipio'," JULIEN BARNEUVE died at 3:28 on the afternoon of August 18, 1943. It had taken him twenty-three minutes exactly to die, the time between the fire starting and his last breath being sucked into his scorched lungs. He had not known his life was going to end that day, although he suspected it might happen. It was a brutal fire, which took hold swiftly and spread rapidly. From the moment it started Julien knew it would never be brought under control, that he would be consumed along with everything around. He didn't struggle, didn't try to escape; it could not be done. The fire ravaged the house&#151;his mother's old house, where he had always felt most at ease, and where he always thought he had done his best work. He couldn't blame those nearby; any sort of rescue would have been foolhardy. Besides, he wanted no assistance and was content with the privacy they had granted him. Eight minutes between the fire starting and his collapsing into unconsciousness from the smoke. Another three minutes before the fire reached him and began to make his clothes smoke and skin bubble. Twenty-three minutes in all until his heart gave out, his breath stopped. Another hour until the fire finally burned itself out and the last charred rafters crashed to the floor over his body. But to Barneuve, as his thoughts broke into pieces and he stopped trying to hold them together, it seemed to have taken very much longer than that. ",2002-06-23T05:00:00+0000

us,A New Leaf,"During the early 20th century, when visionary European painters revolutionized art through Cubism, Futurism, Neo-Plasticism and Suprematism, type and typography were as much a part of change as brush and paint. Graphic design was employed in an assault on antiquated and official art and literature. Pass decorative motifs were rejected in favor of unbridled expression rooted in geometric and abstract composition. Radical formal concepts were further conveyed in books, magazines and posters through unconventional, indeed taboo, methods of page layout, typified by a clash of typefaces in different weights, sizes and styles that violently disrupted traditional reading habits and forced the eye to move from bottom to top, right to left, and diagonally up and down a page of print. Texts were often simulations of sounds, like a sputtering plane engine or an exploding artillery shell or falling rain. The Italian Futurist writer F. T. Marinetti called this typography Parole in Libert (words in freedom); the German typographer Jan Tschichold codified it as ''the New Typography''; and up to the 1920's it became the vernacular of progressive artists and designers. Jaroslav Andel analyzes the most innovative of these designs -- produced for everything from limited-edition art books to commercial magazines and newspapers -- in AVANT-GARDE PAGE DESIGN: 1900-1950 (Delano Greenidge Editions, $60). The extraordinary message of this book is not only that these pages set a standard for contemporary practice, but that they remain fresh-looking today. Steven Heller",2002-06-23T05:00:00+0000

During WWII, originally he was a Calvary officer in the U.S. Army at Ft. Riley, KS, and later was recruited as a Captain into the O.S.S, where he was awarded the Silver Star for bravery in action. At war's end he returned to the family business, retiring in 1962, when he moved with his family to Rome, Italy, living there for over 30 years. A superb horseman, horses were the center of his life. He trained horses, judged at the National Horse Show, played polo at Meadowbrook with the very greats, receiving honorable mention; he just genuinely loved horses. He was a world traveler visiting all seven continents with his late wife, multi-lingual, multitalented, a writer, actor, dancer, composer-lyricist, skier, yachtsman, leatherworker, even conquering the unicycle. Actively involved in community affairs, he was a member of Squadron A, The Sleepy Hollow Country Club and The Lyford Cay Club. On the human side there are no superlatives to adequately describe his dignity, his charm, his honesty, his generosity, his humor. Elegant and stunningly handsome with all the social graces, he lived a wondrous and joyous life.

us,Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Newark: Inquiry Into Verizon Marketing,"Federal regulators are investigating whether Verizon Communications illegally marketed its long-distance service in New Jersey before receiving government permission to sell it there. On Monday, the Federal Communications Commission announced that it had approved Verizon's petition to enter the New Jersey market. In May, Verizon said that one of its direct-marketing companies accidentally sent out a mailing urging New Jersey residents to buy its long distance service. But a rival, A T & T Corporation, complained that Verizon had also included long-distance advertisements in Verizon local-service bills sent to more than 500,000 New Jersey customers. Verizon has agreed to send letters to customers informing them that the F.C.C. had not yet approved Verizon's application. If the F.C.C. decides against Verizon, it could impose a hefty fine or even revoke the company's license for New Jersey's $2.2 billion long-distance market.

The company said it was uncertain about the reasons for the search, given that the affidavit supporting the search was sealed. The F.B.I. could not be reached for comment. But officials from Speedera said that they received a civil complaint yesterday from a competitor, Akamai, that might be related to the search, both companies said. The complaint from Akamai contends there was trade secret theft by Richard Day, Speedera's co-founder and chief technology officer. According to the complaint, Akamai says its proprietary information about customer Web site performance was stolen by Speedera from the computers of Keynote Systems, a company that tracks Web site performance. Gordon Smith, head of marketing at Speedera, said the company denied the allegations. Mr. Smith said Speedera, based in Santa Clara, Calif., was visited on Monday by four or five F.B.I. agents, who removed documents and computer files from Mr. Day's office. Mr. Smith said Speedera was outraged by the search and believed it to be related to a patent infringement lawsuit brought against Speedera by Akamai in February.

us,Technology Briefing: E-Commerce," ORBITZ PASSES AN ANTITRUST REVIEW Orbitz, the online travel booking site owned by five major United States airlines, said yesterday that a Department of Transportation review of its business had found no anticompetitive problems. Both the Department of Transportation and the Justice Department have been watching Orbitz for potential antitrust violations since it was founded a year ago. Competitors like Expedia, a subsidiary of USA Interactive , and Travelocity, a subsidiary of Sabre, have charged that Orbitz's ties to the airline industry give it an unfair advantage. Orbitz, however, says it has generated more competition in the ticketing business, benefiting consumers with lower ticket prices. Since last June, Orbitz has grown to become the nation's third-largest online ticketer. It spent more than $50 million on sales and marketing last year, driving traffic to its Orbitz.com site by blanketing the Web with advertisements. In a statement, Jeffrey Katz, the chief executive of Orbitz, said, ""We look forward to the Department of Justice reaching a similar conclusion that Orbitz has energized competition and improved the Internet shopping experience for consumers and that the government should not intervene in the marketplace except to remedy actual problems and not speculative ones.""

Both the Department of Transportation and the Justice Department have been watching Orbitz for potential antitrust violations since it was founded a year ago. Competitors like Expedia, a subsidiary of USA Interactive, and Travelocity, a subsidiary of Sabre, have charged that Orbitz's ties to the airline industry give it an unfair advantage. Orbitz, however, says it has generated more competition in the ticketing business, benefiting consumers with lower ticket prices. Since last June, Orbitz has grown to become the nation's third-largest online ticketer. It spent more than $50 million on sales and marketing last year, driving traffic to its Orbitz.com site by blanketing the Web with advertisements. In a statement, Jeffrey Katz, the chief executive of Orbitz, said, ''We look forward to the Department of Justice reaching a similar conclusion that Orbitz has energized competition and improved the Internet shopping experience for consumers and that the government should not intervene in the marketplace except to remedy actual problems and not speculative ones.''

Portugal Telecom's first-quarter earnings were 90 million euros this year, and it had a profit of 307 million euros in 2001. Analysts said the write-down would not affect results or the share price.

Respected ''Beat'' poet, Zen Buddhist monk, abbot, teacher, original thinker and key figure in the literary canon of the second half of the twentieth century, died June 26th in San Francisco at the age of 78. Whalen hailed from Portland, Oregon, born October 20th, 1923. He was drafted in 1943 into the U.S. Army and later went to Reed College on the G.I. bill where he met up with poets Gary Snyder and Lew Welch. By the fifties, the three wound up in the Bay Area, encountering Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Michael McClure, Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, and Joanne Kyger to name a few, and the explosive American poetry revolution began. He is credited by some as one of the progenitors of both the Language School poetry movement and of Zen poetry in America. He published his first major book of poems in 1960, ''Like I Say''. Whalen's inspirational sources and great loves were diverse: Kyoto, Buddhist practice, calligraphy, Gertrude Stein, peanut brittle, and Dr. Who, however he was not a dilettante. He was perhaps the wisest and wittiest of his Beat cronies and surely the most elegant with vast resources of literary and historical knowledge at his fingertips. He referred to his writing as ''a continuous nerve movie.'' His fans termed it the stream of consciousness of a brilliant man. His many friends found him affectionate, cranky, perfect, daring, and necessary. His buddy Robert Winson called him ''a large, soft, bear-elephant w/ clever speech.'' Whalen wrote dozens of books of poetry and two novels in over 40 years, including ''On Bear's Head'', ''The Diamond Noodle'', ''You Didn't Even Try'', ''Canoeing up Cabarga Creek'', ''Overtime: Selected Poems'' and the recently released ''Goofbook''. He is survived by his sister Velna Whalen of San Diego. Donations in memory of Philip Whalen can be sent to Poets In Need Inc.

Several thousand men from the ranks of the SS-the Nazi Party's Schutzstaffel, or defense echelon, a police and security service that answered directly to Adolf Hitler and operated outside the constraints of German law-were ordered to report to Pretzsch for training and assignment. They were not told what their assignment would be, but their commonalities offered a clue: many of them had served in SS detachments in Poland, which Germany had invaded and occupied in 1939, and preference was given to men who spoke Russian.

Though intrigued by the concept of a coin laundry place that served beer, I feared overindulging and mistakenly downing a shot of All Tempa-Cheer. But now, a few years down the line, I noticed the grand opening of Hoboken's Spinnin' Spirits, a cafe, laundry and bar. I decided to give it a spin. Early one Sunday, I entered through the laundry side. There were 10 standard washers ($2) and 5 jumbo machines ($4.50). I separated my whites and colors, and headed to the cafe side. The bar, which doesn't serve till noon, offers Yuengling ($2.75 a pint) and Coors Light ($2.50 a pint) on tap, wine ($3), mixed drinks ($3), soda, juice and bottled water. There's a smaller espresso bar, too. Two sets wired with DirecTV adorned the walls. Amid the modern, computerized washing machines entered an Old World mother in a blue apron. ''Would you like something to eat?'' she asked. ''Eggs, bacon, a bagel, some coffee? Three eggs -- you are strong and young. Sit in the garden, relax, while I make it.'' Was she an apparition, a signal to seek out the simple pleasures of home? I pondered this, sitting under an umbrella on the patio furniture out back. But she was real, and she makes a wonderful breakfast ($5.50). Apparently, the menu is whatever Mom chooses to cook that day. Before finishing my eggs, I shifted my clothes to one of 11 dryers in the sunny back room. Farther back, in a small sitting room, there are potted plants, paperbacks, magazines and a television and VCR.

For his role in the rebellion, Salim is sent to prison for nearly two decades, most of the time spent in the dungeons at Tazmamart, a honeycomb of underground cells with a regimen designed to kill the occupants as slowly and painfully as possible. Salim survives many tortures, but the worst of these is perpetual darkness. ''This Blinding Absence of Light,'' fluently translated from the French by Linda Coverdale, is a kind of gloss on suffering, with some passages achieving an almost mystical beauty (''My survival, my wretchedness, my agony were inscribed on the veil of night''). Salim entertains his fellow prisoners by reciting from memory long passages from favorite books -- notably the Koran and Camus's novel ''The Stranger'' -- but at length he succumbs to the idea that he himself has become ''a book no one would ever open.'' This novel sold well in France last year; it seems that people did indeed want to hear Salim's story just as it is presented in this sad and splendid book. William Ferguson",2002-06-30T05:00:00+0000

us,'Dostoevsky'," The last ten years of Dostoevsky's life, the subject of the present volume, mark the end of an extraordinary literary career and of a life that touched both the heights and depths of Russian society. It became customary during these years, even among people who disagreed (and sometimes quite violently) with Dostoevsky on social-political issues, to regard him with a certain reverence, and to feel that his words incarnated a prophetic vision illuminating Russia and its destiny. One of his favorite poems, which he often read aloud, was Pushkin's powerfully evocative &quot;The Prophet&quot;; and each time he did so, his mesmerized listeners invariably felt that he was assuming this function himself. The unprecedented stature he attained astonished even his friends and admirers, and transcended all personal and political boundaries. In the eyes of the vast majority of the literate public, he became a living symbol of all the suffering that history had imposed on the Russian people, as well as of all their longing for an ideal world of (Christian) brotherly love and harmony.

us,'Charles Dickens'," Charles Dickens was a public man and a famous man, and he assumed both of these slightly different roles in his early twenties. His first sketch, &quot;A Dinner at Poplar Walk,&quot; was published in the Monthly Magazine in December 1833. Dickens, born on February 7, 1812, was only twenty-one, but because of his work as a parliamentary reporter (he had taught himself shorthand and was able to take down speeches word for word), he was already familiar with seeing his name in print. Nevertheless, he related later that &quot;I walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there.&quot; Further sketches published in monthly and weekly magazines over the following months attracted considerable notice, and when Sketches by Boz appeared in volume form in February and December 1836, they were well reviewed. What everyone, including Dickens himself, considered especially remarkable was their breadth of scope, and in particular the variety of lower-class characters and scenes depicted, perhaps a first in English literature. One reviewer called them &quot;a perfect picture of the morals, manners, and habits of a great portion of English Society.&quot; ",2002-06-30T05:00:00+0000

I see myself lying in the garden, muffled under antidepressants, sunk in a silent mourning that was impinged on only by the constant trilling of the cicadas in the bushes behind me, and by Michael Holroyd's two-volume biography of Strachey. The books came as a boxed set, like the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, which added to their aura. They have been with me through several apartments, and by now they might almost be taken for antiques, with their embossed endpapers, faintly penciled underlinings and yellowing pages. Volume II, ''The Years of Achievement, 1910-1932,'' lost its dust jacket somewhere along the way, but otherwise they sit intact on a bookshelf within view, as they have always done. (Holroyd went on, with astonishing industry, to publish a wholly new one-volume biography in 1994, drawing on previously inaccessible material -- much of it to do with Strachey's homosexuality -- and although this book duly stands next to the earlier version, it does not have the talismanic value of the cased edition that got me through that unhappy summer.)",2002-06-30T05:00:00+0000
