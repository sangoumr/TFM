us,Parallel Sensibilities,"""There is something ridiculous and miserly in the myth we inherit from abstract art,"" the painter Philip Guston once said. ""We are image makers and image-ridden."" A latecomer to the circle of Abstract Expressionists that included Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, Guston (1913-80) was never completely at ease with the modernists' rejection of what he called ""the known image."" By the late 1960's, when abstraction was still enjoying its heyday, Guston was filling his canvases with everyday objects -- books, light bulbs, shoes, bottles, clocks. It was a heresy for which the artist paid dearly. Unnerved by the New York art critics who derided the new works as crude and cartoonlike, Guston retreated to upstate Woodstock, where he turned to a group of poets and writers for artistic solace. These alliances led to a series of collaborations in the 70's with the poets Bill Berkson, Clark Coolidge, William Corbett and Stanley Kunitz. PHILIP GUSTON'S POEM-PICTURES (University of Washington, paper, $19.95), with text by Debra Bricker Balken, the curator of an exhibition of these works, illustrates this critical turning point in Guston's career. The works Guston created with his poet colleagues were not traditional collaborations; rather they were conflations of parallel, independent sensibilities in which he tested the relationship between pictures as images and words as images. As William Corbett writes, these works were not illustrations; they show Guston ""expressing his reader's imagination."" ANDREA BARNET",1995-09-03T05:00:00+0000

Not unlike people in a big city. As a result, the chickens turn violent and cannibalistic. To keep them in line, producers chop off their beaks. But that may become a barbarism of the past, thanks to William Muir, a genetics professor at Purdue. At the first North American Symposium on Poultry Well-Being, held last month in Edmonton, Canada, Muir revealed a kinder, gentler bird. If chickens have to live wattle to wattle, Muir first reasoned 14 years ago, why not breed them to cooperate? So he raised families of young chickens in commercial-size coops, noted which families produced the most eggs and then bred those families together. Seven generations later, the results are truly rare birds. ""They quit pecking, trampling and fighting,"" says Muir, ""stressing each other out.""",1995-09-03T05:00:00+0000

About 12 people, including several police officers attempting to break up the fight, suffered cuts, bruises and other minor injuries, the police said. Four people were taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center for treatment and later released. Hundreds of people were aboard the party boat, the Skyline Princess, when the fight broke out as it was returning to the dock, said Officer Debra Kearns, a police spokeswoman. [ B2. ] REGION POWERBOATS DRAW CRITICISM Tim Clancy was out fishing on Lake Hopatcong late one night when his boat was almost run over by two sleek cigarette boats, one 30 feet long, the other 27 feet, he said. Both were cruising slowly. Mr. Clancy is convinced the operators saw him but did not care about his boat and fishing lines. ""As far as I'm concerned, they're both too big for a lake this size,"" he said. ""It gets hairy out on the lake now, to the point of being dangerous."" As summer draws to a close on Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey's biggest and busiest lake, an anti-boat chorus is strong and steady. [ B5. ] Chronicle B4",1995-09-05T05:00:00+0000

Just read, amid the more damning diary entries, the blow-by-blow description of a senatorial hairdo. But where that mastery will leave the real void, now that he's resigning, is on the Senate Finance Committee, which he heads. He somehow understands the intricacies of taxes and Medicare -- and, it is said, can explain it in English (quite a trick!). So while one colleague said, ""I don't think any senator is indispensable,"" others said his departure ""complicates things"" and leaves a ""substantial void"" in areas where the Republicans crave big changes. What now? Bob Dole is expected to run the committee, from offstage, till yearend. STALKING CHRYSLER This Time, Kerkorian's Serious When Kirk Kerkorian made noises in the spring about buying Chrysler, people stopped listening after a while, and Mr. Kerkorian seemed to fade into the upholstery. He didn't. He was, apparently, scouting around for an ally who'd be taken seriously, and last week he found one, luring Jerome York, former Chrysler finance chief, away from I.B.M. The markets are taking it very seriously, with Chrysler's stock rising as relentlessly as I.B.M.'s falls. And Chrysler took it seriously -- doubling, to $2 billion, its stock buyback. Mr. York, it is agreed, wants to run Chrysler -- so he probably won't be satisfied with what Chrysler may offer: a board seat. CUBA Island of Capitalism The official line, still: Cuba is an evil Communist empire, a lurking threat to the very barbecues and bowling leagues of democracy. But each day that image meanders further from reality, as Fidel Castro's once-defiant island looks more and more like a bastion of capitalism -- lacking only American capitalists. Last week Cuba passed a law allowing foreign investment in anything but defense, health care and education. To be sure, the door could have been opened wider -- the Government must give its nod case by case, and ""anything that doesn't benefit"" Cuba's development ""will be excluded."" Still, some American businesses -- which would love to get a foot in this fast-revolving door -- saw a golden opportunity to rethink our trade ban. AUTOS Trucks in Cars' Clothing They're priced like luxury cars. They're filled with luxury-car goodies, like CD players, phone outlets and serious leather. But Jeeps, Explorers and Suburbans drink gas like trucks. How do they get away with it? Because they're ""light"" trucks, ruled by much looser mileage standards. This is no small matter, for of every 10 new passenger vehicles sold, 4 are light trucks, and this surging popularity has slammed into reverse the nation's solid gains in fuel efficiency. ""Outrageous,"" said a Sierra Club official. ""Ridiculous,"" said Automotive News. Indeed, the Administration might raise mileage standards for trucks -- fiercely opposed by auto makers, of course, and the regulation-busting House. JAPAN Few Jobless, but Few Jobs In the United States, by the strange math of economists, 6 percent unemployment is often considered ""full employment."" So Japan, with an official jobless rate of 3.2 percent, would seem a job-seeker's paradise. Far from it. On Monday, as most Americans basked in a Labor Day untainted by labor, more than 12,000 Japanese college students flocked from across the nation to a Tokyo stadium for what was essentially a huge job fair. With Japan stuck in recession, top companies were not exactly clamoring for their talents. Top seniors competed for jobs as clerks and construction workers, others competed for any job at all -- and women were left with the scraps. It was the dark side of lifetime employment -- don't hire in the first place. CHARITIES Rewarded Before Heaven The men and women who head the nation's nonprofit organizations naturally do so out of dedication to good works, but starvation wages are not usually part of the deal. Even after the president of United Way was sent packing after he lived it up on the charity's money -- a scandal that snapped the public to attention -- salaries are rising steadily. And a survey out last week found that the top salaries, by far, went to the heads of big city hospitals: Mount Sinai, $900,000; Sloan-Kettering, nearly $800,000. The Salvation Army's president, though, made just $58,000, while the president of Philip Morris made nearly $2 million. And Newt Gingrich? $133,600 (without royalties). EDUCATION Mr. Moon Goes to School Is a university just another business? After all, if it can't pay its bills, it'll be as bankrupt as a failed dry cleaner. So can anyone with ready cash simply ""buy"" this ""business"" and do with it what he will? That was the extra-credit question last week as the University of Bridgeport bestowed an honorary degree on the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who saved the school from bankruptcy by giving it $98 million since 1992. Enrollment has risen from 1,100 to 1,800, but the ""Moonies"" have not ""taken over,"" said the president -- a 20-year friend of Mr. Moon's. ""This is a normal American university with a unique funding source."" Critics, though, say Mr. Moon's followers have lured foreign students with big scholarships -- with church training part of the deal. PUBLISHING A Magazine, by George! Government-bashers will love this one: a model as President. Even those irreverent souls who said Ronald Reagan was merely acting the part wouldn't have had such a wildly cynical fantasy. But there she is: Cindy Crawford as a seductive George Washington on the cover -- unveiled last week -- of an odd new magazine called, yes, George. This isn't just any magazine, though. It's ""post-partisan,"" whatever that means. It's the MTV of politics. It's full of Georges, of all stripes: Wallace, Stephanopoulos, Bush (well, Barbara anyway). Oh, and by the way, a fellow named Kennedy edits it (no, not George: that's the actor; this is confusing enough!). This one, if memory serves, is related to some former President.

The difference is added to the loan, thereby increasing the principal balance by the amount of unpaid interest, until a predetermined ceiling has been reached.",1995-09-10T05:00:00+0000

In Zuckerman's own word for it, the novelist must be, above all else, a ""personificator."" Over the 10 years since ""Zuckerman Bound,"" Roth has published five books that contrive to make ""fake biography, false history"" by calling their narratives into question -- by confusing the distinctions between art and life, truth and falsity, the real and the imagined. Most recently, in ""Operation Shylock,"" he invented a second Philip Roth with whom to confront Philip Roth the protagonist; and while subtitling that book ""A Confession,"" he claimed in a final note to the reader that it was all made up, wholly imaginary.

Instead, despite his impatience with dance technique of all kinds, he chose to be a dancer, teaming up with another unlikely candidate for the profession, an aspiring photographer named Arnie Zane. They became an offstage couple from their first meeting in 1971, as college undergraduates, and during the next 17 years they also choreographed and ran a dance company together. After his partner's death from AIDS in 1988, Mr. Jones continued to choreograph and to run the company alone, as well as to perform. His themes in his dances, and in his memoir, LAST NIGHT ON EARTH (Pantheon, $30), include racial fury, black and white; self-exposure; ""transgressive"" sexuality; protracted death, and communal healing. He has drawn an international following, prizes, fame and sympathetic collaborators -- among them his co-author, Peggy Gillespie, a freelance journalist. His onstage belligerence and posturing have also occasioned strong critical reproof. In his book, Mr. Jones takes himself solemnly as an artist, as the embodiment of Eros and, in his discussion of ""Still/ Here,"" his evening-length spectacle about mortality, as an instrument of therapeutic self-knowledge for his dancers and admirers. He treats his own much-publicized H.I.V.-positive status as an opportunity to go global -- even though his vision, as he describes it, is already both encompassing and authoritarian. Don't plan to consult the book for his response to Arlene Croce's essay in The New Yorker that dismissed his work as ""victim art."" He doesn't mention it. MINDY ALOFF",1995-09-10T05:00:00+0000

The trick here has always been to point out the terrible injustice of the $685,000 you were paid last year without seeming either ridiculous or ungrateful. A rumor that you have received a big offer from a rival firm is helpful, so long as you aren't caught spreading it. It's treasonous to complain too loudly, but it's suicidal not to complain at all. The person who rises above the bonus fray is as Godforsaken as the man who stands back from the luggage conveyor belt at the Calcutta airport. He'll spend the rest of his life waiting for his bags to arrive. (Nice guy. Shame it happened to him.)

us,The Bottom Line: A Balancing Act,"Here is how 4 community school districts in Brooklyn plan to achieve some of the savings needed to cope with budget cuts as well as with increases in teacher salaries and student population. Some districts are cutting the number of teachers, even as the number of students rises. Others are expected to keep the same number of teachers as last year or get a few more. But even in those districts, the number of teaching positions relative to student population may drop. This will be reflected in larger average class sizes. Class sizes are in flux because enrollment and transfers continue through most of September.

In recent years he has expanded his repertory by at least a movement, the Adagietto of Mahler's Fifth Symphony. Better still, through the Kaplan Foundation, he has diversified his efforts on behalf of the composer, issuing further recordings and publishing manuscript facsimiles and a discography and editing THE MAHLER ALBUM (Kaplan Foundation/Abrams, $75), a magnificent collection of photographs and other images. The book represents an expansion and updating of a photograph collection published in 1922 by Alfred Roller, a stage designer and Mahler collaborator at the Vienna State Opera, and contains Roller's evocative prose portrait of Mahler (translated from the German by Norman Lebrecht). ""The job of a collector,"" Roller wrote, ""is simply to collect and set down without distortion,"" and that spirit seems to have governed the enterprise. The most telling detail appears on the dust jacket, which shows Mahler's reading glasses on the front and, in negative image, the back. For the record, Mr. Kaplan tells us, Mahler's ""right eye was about 50 percent weaker than his left eye and had a moderate astigmatism (his left eye had none)."" Could this imbalance relate in any way to the lopsided whimsy in Mahler's music? If so, Mr. Kaplan can be counted on to explain the connection in the near future. JAMES R.

us,'The Gingerbread of Living',"In an author's note to his charming new collection, PIG COOKIES: And Other Stories (Chronicle, paper, $10.95), Alberto Alvaro Rios sketches his childhood history: his grandfather, who was ""inextricably involved"" in the Mexican Revolution, liked to keep the family ""at the edges of the Republic"" so they could escape should things go badly. Yet ""if there was uncertainty in those years,"" Mr. Rios remarks, ""there was also its opposite. It was the law of physics. . . . These were the constants from the realm of certainty: The seasons, the circus, a good dinner at the finish of a day. This was the gingerbread of living."" In that spirit, his stories acquaint us with the daily dramas of a tiny village in northern Mexico during the early decades of this century, a village of haunting characters whose circumscribed lives are filled with a gentle pathos. The 13 tales fold in and out of various chronologies and moods; some of the events we glimpse are slight, while others are clearly momentous. In one story, a coffin maker at work in the funeral home receives a terrible fright when a corpse sits upright. And in the title story, named for the gingerbread pigs that were a local delicacy, a young man becomes a baker in order to court his true love. Much of the drama in Mr. Rios's plotting hinges on misconceptions and the pervasive gossip so characteristic of villages everywhere, but the stories barely hint at psychology, wresting insight instead from the immeasurably deep traditions of folklore. The village, indeed, is a communal character, and Mr. Rios brilliantly conveys the potency of custom and censure in shaping its individual citizens. Part of the delight of his stories comes from their lyricism and part from their wisdom. Mr. Rios has a poet's eye and a storyteller's voice. He does not interpret, except to say: Here is life -- worth the living, worth the telling.SANDRA SCOFIELD",1995-09-17T05:00:00+0000

A Resting Place In Cyberspace","WHAT -- The Virtual Memorial Garden, a cyberspace obituary page on the World Wide Web, where friends and family can display electronic epitaphs, pictures and even sounds of those who have shuffled off this mortal coil. It was started earlier this year when Lindsay Marshall, a 42-year-old Briton who teaches computer science at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, created an obituary page of famous people and invited Web browsers to contribute. ""Rather than send me famous people, people were sending me their grandmothers and their mothers and their cousins and their family's friends,"" he said. ""These people didn't fit into the obituary page. They weren't famous enough. And so I thought, wouldn't it be nice to have somewhere where people could do that?""WHO -- The page (http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/ Obituary/memorial.html) includes links to bereavement services and sites featuring the dead and the famous, including Jerry Garcia; Lana Turner; Wolfman Jack; Warren Burger, the former Chief Justice, and the model Kristen Taylor. But there is also a growing number of odes to more than 300 regular Joes and Janes and more than 50 pets. Mr. Marshall returned from a holiday recently to find 95 new memorials in his E-mail box. ""My Dad was just an ex-cop in Philly,"" one person wrote. ""He loved grandkids, the Philadelphia Phillies, fishing and me. When I cast off I always feel another line in the water."" Another person recalled a woman who has been dead for 24 years: ""She was a fine, strong-hearted, intelligent woman who swore like a sailor and smoked like a chimney. Everyone she came in contact with was touched by her spirit. Although she seldom gave you what you wanted, you always got what you needed."" Passed-on pets, too, merit memorials.

Smile When You Call Us Girls, Stranger","The unusual yet quintessentially American world of COWGIRLS: Contemporary Portraits of the American West (Crown, paper, $24) features black, white and American Indian rodeo participants and rugged ranchers and their families. Although the subtitle suggests this tribute is purely pictorial, the accompanying narratives are as engaging as Ronnie Farley's stunning photographs; both rescue cowgirls from rhinestone-studded stereotypes and document the gritty realities of Western life. ""Through every story,"" Ms. Farley, the author of ""Women of the Native Struggle,"" writes, ""runs a common thread of hardship, determination and independence."" One tough rodeo veteran recalls the day her doctor told her that she had unknowingly suffered a broken back. A mother remembers an all-day losing battle in waist-deep snow, small children in tow, to save a flock of sheep. While some cowgirls see the West as a refuge from industrial culture, others feel their land is slowly being destroyed by it. Widespread alcoholism and natural disasters are the dominant dark strains in these isolated ranch families' lives. ""The rewards,"" says Mary Owens, a rancher, ""are that when . . . you're walking with your sheep, you really know that God is right there, and that's about as religious as most ranchers are.""MARGOT MIFFLIN",1995-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Diary,"BENETTON Going Where the Suffering Is Benetton, often accused of exploiting human suffering, has opened a store in a capital of suffering, Sarajevo -- and has made sure to pile sandbags in front of the windows. TELEVISION Is the Buzz the Message? You didn't watch ""Central Park West"" last week? That took great strength of character, considering the mind-boggling effort that CBS, desperate to lure younger viewers with something glitzy, put into hyping the show. It went way beyond buzz -- the network enlisted every bee in its hive to promote this one: the stars' faces adorning Manhattan buses, ""advertorials"" (horrible word), board games, even a World Wide Web site. The goal, as one marketing type put it: ""entertainment-fashion-media-advertising synergy."" Whew! That's a mouthful. HEALTH CARE Will This Fix Medicare? House Republicans were determined to slash $270 billion out of seven years' worth of projected Medicare spending, and last week they said they'd found a way. But have they? Yes, premiums would rise -- slightly for most, sharply for the rich -- but the plan is short on incentives to nudge the elderly into H.M.O.'s. Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich insist that a free market in health care choices will make it all better -- even without those incentives. But critics like Representative Henry Waxman said cuts in payments to doctors would ""destroy Medicare in a few short years."" And many elements of the plan are still vague, prompting Democrats to say crucial details are being hidden. ROCKEFELLER CENTER It's Hard Being a Trophy How can this happen? One of the world's prize properties, Rockefeller Center, is caught up in such convoluted financial games that billions are being lost on it. The answer is that no one really ""owns"" such a place, one merely owns the right to collect rents and pay the bills -- but that right is a dubious trophy indeed when the bills exceed the rents. Last week Mitsubishi Estate decided it wanted no more of such losing math and bailed out -- and expects to pay $1 billion for its lesson in New York real estate economics. At which point more investors -- like Sam Zell and Goldman, Sachs -- rushed in, cash in hand, to make it even more complicated. The venerable buildings didn't even sway. POLITICS Tobacco Money for the G.O.P. At a time when it faces various regulatory threats -- Government efforts to label nicotine an addictive drug, for instance, and to reduce sales to teen-agers -- the tobacco industry is pouring money into Republican coffers. In the first half of this year, the industry contributed $1.5 million, five times as much as last year's first six months. Nearly half that sum came from Philip Morris. Representative Henry Waxman said the tobacco industry ""has gotten its hooks into the Republican leadership."" And the head of Common Cause called the heavy donations ""a desperate last effort."" But a spokesman for Brown & Williamson -- also a donor -- cited his company's belief in the Republican vision of ""less government, less red tape."" COMMUNICATIONS Policing the Internet Computer networks are indisputably glorious things. No stamps, no paper, no fuss. A generation that thought letter-writing had surely died in a sun-washed 19th-century morning room has suddenly started to communicate. Now, alas, comes the dark side. Some people are using this strange new toy to send out child pornography or even lure children to sex. This gets complicated, for even if you get past the ethical question -- isn't private communication private? -- a huge practical one remains: how can you possibly monitor the zillions of 1's and 0's zooming through cyberspace? You can't always, of course, but last week -- after a four-year F.B.I. investigation -- came dozens of arrests for on-line porn and solicitation. THE WORKPLACE Women's Progress, Stalled Are women moving steadily closer to equal status in the workplace? Surely nothing could stop the momentum of recent years. Or could it? In a poll out last week, only 56 percent of women said the role of women was continuing to change -- down from 73 percent five years ago. Do women ""face more restrictions"" than men? Yes, said 84 percent, with 77 percent saying sexual discrimination ""remains a serious problem."" And 76 percent said there was sexual harassment in the workplace. STATISTICS Do-It-Yourself Inflation Numbers flow mercilessly from the Government -- statistics with little apparent purpose except to keep statisticians busy -- and many are easily ignored. But not the Consumer Price Index. ""This is real,"" said Pat Moynihan. ""Everything else is talk."" This mighty inflation gauge, after all, dictates cost-of-living increases for Social Security and adjustments in tax brackets, and the tiniest blip translates into billions of dollars. What a gift to budget-cutters, then, if the index was found to be flawed. Sure enough, last week a Congressional panel said the index greatly overstates inflation -- and fixing it could trim $634 billion from the deficit over 10 years. This wouldn't exactly be a gift to retirees, though. Part of the index's flaw, it seems, is that it doesn't pick up shifts in buying patterns in response to higher prices. So if this ""flaw"" is fixed, Social Security recipients struggling to stretch their budgets would, in a sense, be doing the Government a favor, not themselves. TRANSPORTATION Tunnel of Lost Cash Talk about a money pit! The Channel tunnel cost such a staggering sum to build -- $15 billion -- that it now faces interest costs of more than $3 million a day. A day! The tunnel's doing fine, mind you -- Eurostar trains are 75 percent full. But there's no way it can shell out that killer interest, and last week the company that runs it said it would simply not pay much of that interest for perhaps 18 months. Which means, of course, that big changes are coming -- and investors will be out a lot of money. But it will certainly keep running. ""You cannot sell a hole in the ground for much,"" said a Eurotunnel executive, ""if you've closed it."" THE MARKETS Stocks Are Up. Period.

NAJJAR, who was the coach of Lincoln in Brooklyn for the last 12 years, watched helplessly as DEJON WELCOME, a senior halfback from Piscataway, rushed for four touchdowns and 95 yards to catapult Piscataway over his new team, 46-20. CASHING IN: Taking advantage of two fumbles, Delbarton (1-0) yesterday beat Essex Catholic, 9-0.

Delbarton's second score was set up by MIKE MCGOWAN, a defensive tackle, who recovered an Essex Catholic fumble on the opposition's 34-yard line. Five plays later, RODNEY TRAFFORD on a quarterback sneak, scored on a 3-yard run. CERMINARO FOR THREE: Highland Park defeated Memorial of West New York, 28-8, Friday night, behind the strong arm of MARK CERMINARO who tossed three scoring strikes to JAMES BOYD (35 yards) in the first quarter, BRET ZDANOWIZ (12 yards) in the second and NILO GARVIN (5 yards) in the third. WESTCHESTER: In Roosevelt's 18-6 victory over Mount Vernon yesterday, Coach TONY DEMATTEO earned his 170th victory to become Section I's career leader in wins.""There were so many former players and friends here that I just wanted them to play hard for me,"" he said. ""Nothing would have embarrassed me more than if the team didn't play hard for me. But they came through. They played harder than any team that I've ever coached. I'm real proud of them."" Roosevelt's first score, an 18-yard run by JASON MANDARA, was set up by linebacker LEWIS WEBB'S 36-yard interception return. On Roosevelt's next possession, CARLTON MAJOR capped an 11-play, 95-yard drive with a 6-yard scoring run. In the third quarter, COREY SAVAGE raced 88 yards off tackle to account for Mount Vernon's only points. The Indians closed out the game's scoring on their next possession, when DAVE GOLDBERG dove in from 1 yard out to punctuate a 51-yard, 9-play drive. With the victory, Roosevelt upped its record to 2-0. CONNECTICUT: Quarterback PETER MAZZA (7 of 9 for 112 yards) rushed for one touchdown and threw for another and BRIAN PERRY added two short-yardage scores as Cheshire (1-0) cruised past Hamden, 26-0. MAZZA hit JOE MAESTO with a 21-yard touchdown and ran one in from 1 yard out. PERRY'S scores came on 1-yard and 2-yard bursts. IAN MCINTOSH, of Cheshire, was the game's leading rusher with 123 yards. Cheshire's defense picked off three passes on the day, two by MAESTO, playing cornerback, and one by BRENDAN QUINN. The Rams defense held Hamden to 26 yards rushing and 32 yards passing. PREPS: Tailback ALEX SHULMAN rushed for two touchdowns and BEN BERG caught an 80-yard pass from JOHN FINLEY and also scored on a 6-yard run as Riverdale (1-0) routed Xaverian (0-2), 42-7. JOE MCGOWAN (60 yards) and RON KIM (2-yard run) each contributed touchdowns to the blowout. Linebacker MATT VALSIC (14 tackles), ALEX KITCHENS (9 tackles) and DEON REED (7 tackles) led Riverdale's defense.",1995-09-17T05:00:00+0000

Dee Breger, who runs the scanning electron-microscope laboratory at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., finally couldn't stand it any longer. So she collected some of her own favorite images in a book, with no agenda other than to display her world. The result, ""Journeys in Microspace,"" is due out later this fall. It contains micrographs of everything from fossils to stockings. Breger notes in her book that these micrographs are neither digitally enhanced nor produced by computer manipulation. They are the result of bombarding the material with electrons. Above are several micrographs of industrial materials, elegant patterns produced by technology turning to view itself. At left is a surface detail of a partly burned tungsten wire (magnified 14,500 times).

A1 SERB STRONGHOLD AT RISK The Bosnian Serb military vowed to take a stand at a stronghold with Government troops closing in and the area filled with refugees, fearing that a loss would mean the end of their republic in Bosnia. A10 STRUGGLE FOR LAND IN BRAZIL A bloody confrontation between squatters and troops aided by landowners' hired guns shows the failure of an effort to equalize distribution of Brazil's land. A1 NO NEW TERM FOR HAITI LEADER The President of Haiti confirmed that he will step down when his term ends next year, consistent with a pledge made to the United States, despite pressure from his followers to stay in office. A5 AN EARTHQUAKE'S LEGACY Many stories are still told of the earthquake that hit Mexico city 10 years ago, but the major one is that the inability of the Government to cope weakened the stranglehold that it had on the people. A3 DELAY IN PALESTINIAN PACT Negotiators were not able to complete the agreement for expanding Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, postponing a signing ceremony, but talks continued to try to remove a last obstacle. A13 A preliminary settlement to aid Philippine dictator's victims. A6 With a democratic victory in Hong Kong, a threat from China. A8 An Iraqi defector has become an albatross to Jordan.

A1 CLINTON DEFENDS CREDIT FOR POOR The President attacked Republican proposals to cut tax breaks for low-income families, warning that he might veto any such plan as ""inconsistent with those basic, bedrock values this country should be standing for."" A1 THREAT TO ON-LINE SHOPPING A security flaw has been discovered in Netscape, the most popular software for computer transactions over the Internet, threatening to cast a chill over the emerging market for electronic commerce.A1 EFFORT TO CURB MINE AGENCY Under legislation now in Congress, the Mine Safety and Health Administration would be stripped it of its independence and ability to make unannounced inspections. A14 RICHMOND OFFICIAL RESIGNS A Richmond councilman resigned after officials said he had been videotaped selling heroin. A14 CHAOS AT SIMPSON TRIAL As the Simpson case nears completion, prosecutors completed their rebuttal -- conditionally. A15 GINGRICH ETHICS CASE PROGRESSES The House ethics committee has decided to begin interviewing lawyers to be the outside counsel for its inquiry of Newt Gingrich. A16 NEW DRIVE FOR TERM LIMITS Several groups advocating term limits are starting a drive in the states for a constitutional convention, a laborious process that could last a decade. A17 FLORIDA'S NEW ROLE IN CAMPAIGN Florida is emerging as one of the most consequential early states in Presidential politics for Republicans and Democrats alike. A17 CLINTON BEGINS TOUR The President embarked on a five-day trip that will mix raising campaign money with an effort to rally public opinion against the Republican budget-balancing plan.

The Giants have scored just 23 points -- tied with New England for fewest in the league. Comment: The Giants haven't won for good reason. The Saints have caught a couple of tough breaks, losing their three games by an average of 3 points. Jim Everett has thrown for 883 yards -- the most in the N.F.L. Dave Brown threw 50 passes last week at Green Bay, but not one of them went for a touchdown. The Giants' offense is reeling right now. The Saints' defense won't give them a break. Game Score: New Orleans 22-12. Chicago (2-1) vs. St. Louis (3-0) Key stat: The Rams are the only team in the N.F.L. without a turnover and lead the league with a plus-12 turnover ratio. The Bears have committed 15 penalties for 98 yards -- the fewest in the N.F.L. Comment: The Rams have been one of the biggest surprises in the league this season. This is an opportunity for them to make a few more believers. The Rams' defense brings pressure from the front seven, and then the secondary pounces on the mistakes. St. Louis leads the league with 9 interceptions. The Bears' passing game isn't that strong to begin with. Quarterback Erik Kramer might find the pressure a little too hot to handle. Game Score: St. Louis 19-17. Washington (1-2) vs. Tampa Bay (1-2) Key stat: Gus Frerotte's average of 8.83 yards per pass play leads the N.F.L. The Bucs are holding opponents to 32.5 percent on third-down conversions. Comment: While Heath Shuler's shoulder heals, Frerotte has people wondering whether the Redskins are going with the right young quarterback. He completed 60 percent of his passes last week, but the Redskins came up short against Denver. Tampa Bay has beaten the Redskins in the last three meetings. Frerotte will help Washington break that streak. Game Score: Washington 26-17. Minnesota (1-2) vs. Pittsburgh (2-1) Key stat: The Vikings' defense is giving up 5.3 yards per carry. Chad Brown leads the A.F.C. in sacks with 4.5. Comment: For the first time since quarterback Neil O'Donnell and cornerback Rod Woodson went down with injuries, the Steelers weaknesses were exposed. The Dolphins did it with pressure on Mike Tomczak and some pinpoint passing from Dan Marino. Warren Moon is capable of the same type of aerial attack, and the Vikings' defense can bring plenty of heat and shut off the run. That's enough to derail the Steelers. Game Score: Minnesota 25-19. SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES Jets (1-2) vs. Atlanta (2-1) Key stat: Jets cornerback Otis Smith has had an interception in each of the team's three games. Eric Metcalf's 30 receptions lead the N.F.L., and his 339 yards in receptions are No. 2 in the league. Comment: The Jets got a confidence boost last week with their victory over the Jaguars. The Falcons aren't an expansion team. Quarterback Jeff George can fill the air in Atlanta's run-and-shoot offense if the Jets don't get enough defensive heat on him. Boomer Esiason will see a lot of Chris Doleman, who leads the N.F.L. with 5.5 sacks. That kind of disruption can stall the Jets' offense. Game Score: Atlanta 28-23. Denver (2-1) vs. San Diego (2-1) Key stat: Natrone Means leads the A.F.C. in rushing with 294 yards on 64 carries. Four of John Elways's 15 career victories against the Chargers have been on fourth-quarter comebacks. Comment: Both teams needed late touchdown plays to win last week. Means managed to roll up 122 yards rushing on 23 carries against the Eagles' defense. But one of the Chargers' best weapons against Denver might be running back Ronnie Harmon, who is averaging 5.5 yards per catch against the Broncos. Denver's strong passing attack could be grounded by the Chargers' defense. Game Score: San Diego 31-25. Houston (1-2) vs. Cincinnati (2-1) Key stat: Carl Pickens has caught a touchdown pass in eight straight games -- the fifth-best mark in the N.F.L. Comment: Jeff Blake had a field day against the Oilers last season, passing for 354 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Oilers will welcome him this year with the No. 1 pass defense in the league. It might not matter because the Oilers' offense is hurting. Quarterback Will Furrer, replacing an injured Chris Chandler, had a rough time against the Browns last week. Things won't get any better against the Bengals. Game Score: Cincinnati 27-15. Kansas City (3-0) vs. Cleveland (2-1) Key stat: The Browns have allowed just 9 touchdowns in their last 10 home games. The Chiefs have converted 4 of 4 fourth-down attempts. Comment: Steve Bono is looking more and more like his predecessor, Joe Montana, including his penchant for fourth-quarter comebacks. With Bono, the Chiefs are never out of a game. But the Browns are tough at home, particularly on defense. Safety Stevon Moore leads the N.F.L. in interceptions with 4. He and the Browns' defense will bring Bono back to earth. Game Score: Cleveland 16-6. Arizona (1-2) vs. Dallas (3-0) Key stat: Cowboys' offensive line has given up just 2 sacks. The Cardinals are giving up 195 yards rushing a game, the most in the N.F.L. Comment: Emmitt Smith is going to go nuts against the Cardinals' porous run defense. Smith leads the league with 427 yards rushing (6.4 yards a carry). Without defensive end Eric Swann, the Cardinals don't have the force up front to deal with Dallas's offensive firepower. This game has the potential to get ugly on several layers, mainly for the Cardinals. Game Score: Dallas 34-13. Philadelphia (1-2) vs. Oakland (2-1) Key stat: Kelvin Martin's 14.6 yards per punt return is No. 1 in the N.F.C. The Raiders are holding opponents to 5.3 yards per punt return, tied for second-best in the A.F.C. Comment: The Eagles will be visiting Oakland for the first time since 1971, and they bring with them the N.F.C.'s No. 3 rushing offense and No. 3 rushing defense. The Raiders will have to be on the mark on both sides of the ball to counter that. Defensive end Nolan Harrison is out with a back injury, but his absence shouldn't be a major problem for the Raiders. The Eagles will fall to their second straight A.F.C. West opponent. Game Score: Oakland 31-28. SUNDAY NIGHT GAME Green Bay (2-1) vs. Jacksonville (0-3) Key stat: The Packers have outscored their opponents by 21-0 in the first quarter. The Jaguars have scored 17 of their 30 points in the fourth quarter. Comment: Quarterback Mark Brunell leads his team in rushing with 113 yards on 15 carries. Mostly, he spends a good deal of time running for his life. With Reggie White and Sean Jones rushing from bookend positions on the defensive front, Brunell will spend a lot of time sprinting around the field. And the Jaguars will go nowhere. Game Score: Green Bay 35-12. MONDAY NIGHT GAME San Francisco (3-0) vs. Detroit (0-3) Key stat: In seven games against the Lions, Steve Young has completed 69.4 percent of his passes for 9 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. The Lions, defense is giving up 142 yards rushing per game. Comment: The Lions are down and out. It's certainly not the time to face the 49ers. But with the way San Francisco is playing, there might not be a good time to face them. The real fun in this game will be watching Barry Sanders scoot around the field. If he can get past the line of scrimmage, Sanders can make things interesting for the Lions. Whatever he does won't be enough to lead Detroit past the 49ers. Game Score: San Francisco 27-14.

In this group show of Oriental and Occidental artists, the standouts are Kunie Sugiura's assemblages of X-ray photographs displayed in postcard racks and Ruth Pastine's square canvases of closely valued colors merging almost imperceptibly into one another, like melted-down Rothkos (Pepe Karmel). ""VIETNAMESE PROPAGANDA ART,"" O. K. Harris Gallery, 383 West Broadway, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo (through Oct. 7). How could a small, impoverished country like North Vietnam have defeated a large, wealthy nation like the United States? That country's victory seems even more amazing when you see what drab, uninspiring propaganda posters it had (Karmel). RON TAYLOR, Richard Anderson Fine Arts, 476 Broome Street, SoHo (through Oct. 14). Ghostly elongated figures on dark grounds with hissing neon highlights: Pavel Tchelitchev for the 90's (Karmel). MARILYN MINTER, ""Coral Ridge Towers,"" Postmasters Gallery, 80 Greene Street, SoHo (through Oct. 8). The black-and-white photographs in this show -- of the artist's mother, a Florida recluse sustained by drugs and a ruined 1930's glamour -- date from 1969, just after Ms. Minter had been in contact with Diane Arbus. They're certainly in the grotesque, darkly comical Arbusian vein, but infused with a tough empathy (Holland Cotter). HELEN SOREFF, M-13 Gallery, 72 Greene Street, SoHo (through Sept. 30). For more than two decades, Ms. Soreff has been producing somber, painterly abstractions based on the Minimalist grid. This time she's whited or blacked the grid out, giving the show an interestingly muffled, ghostly, last-minute-decision look (Cotter).",1995-09-22T05:00:00+0000

us,COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT,"KEY GAMES OF TOP TEAMS Texas A&M (2-0) at Colorado (3-0) A neat matchup of two of the best. In little more than half of a 52-point victory last Saturday over Northeast Louisiana, Koy Detmer set a Colorado single-game passing record of 426 yards. In two games, Leland McElroy of the Aggies has 345 yards rushing, 177 receiving and 122 on kickoff returns. Stanford (2-0-1) at Oregon (3-0) Oregon looks more and more like a bowl contender. It beat U.C.L.A. by scoring on a 3-yard pass with 62 seconds left and then stopping Karim Abdul-Jabbar on the 1-yard line as time ran out. Stanford rallied four times to tie Wisconsin. Southern California (2-0) at Arizona (2-1) A good conference test on the road for Southern California and its spectacular receiver, Keyshawn Johnson (8 for 176 against Houston). Arizona lost a 9-7 heartbreaker to Illinois on a 52-yard fumble return in the fourth quarter. Texas (2-0) at Notre Dame (2-1) Less than two weeks after surgery to remove a bulging disc in the neck, Coach Lou Holtz is more or less back with Notre Dame. Texas is a gritty team that beat Pittsburgh with two touchdowns in the last 2 minutes 14 seconds. EAST Penn State (2-0) vs. Rutgers (1-1) at East Rutherford, N.J. Rutgers ran well against Navy, but Penn State is not a finesse team like Navy. If the Rutgers defense is hammered early, the game could get out of hand. Ohio State (2-0) at Pittsburgh (2-1) Ohio State is a top team. Pitt has improved, but if it throws five interceptions, as it did in losing to Texas, it will be blown out. Minnesota (1-0) at Syracuse (1-1) Syracuse is favored over a Minnesota team with a good sophomore quarterback in Cory Sauter and young receivers to match. The Gophers' defense leads the nation, allowing only 176 yards in its only game. St. Mary's (Calif). (2-1) at Columbia (1-0) Columbia beat Harvard wih 19 seconds left. St. Mary's, although not the power of a half-century ago, may be as good as any of the Ivies. Penn (1-0) at Lafayette (1-1) Penn's 22-game winning streak is the best in the nation. As long as Penn has Miles Macik to catch passes (12 for 158 yards against Dartmouth), it will be all right. Dartmouth (0-1) at Fordham (1-2) Dartmouth took advantage of Penn mistakes in the first half, but had no offense in the second. This should be a competitive game. Bucknell (2-0) at Princeton (1-0) Princeton should win, but it must get better output from its ground game, which gained only 89 yards in 40 carries against Cornell. Yale (1-0) at Lehigh (1-1) In Yale's 42-38 upset of Brown, Chris Hetherington passed for 223 yards and rushed for 166. This could be another offensive show for both teams. MIDWEST Air Force (2-1) at Northwestern (1-1) An appealing matchup of teams that have been good or ordinary. In losing to Colorado State, Air Force wasted its 424 yards in total offense with penalties and fumbles. East Carolina (2-1) at Illinois (1-2) The slick passing game of East Carolina faces a big hurdle in Illinois's defense. Linebacker Simeon Rice of Illinois made four interceptions against Arizona. SOUTH Mississippi State (2-1) at Tennessee (2-1) Forget Tennessee's 62-37 blowout loss to Florida, an elite team. Peyton Manning's passing should pull the Vols through. Virginia (3-1) at Clemson (2-1) A stiff test for Virginia, but it should win if Tiki Barber repeats last week's rushing performance of 105 yards and four touchdowns. Miami (1-1) at Virginia Tech (0-2) Tech's stagnant offense will suffer. As its coach, Frank Beamer, said of his forces, ""It's a good team. We just haven't played good yet."" Rice (1-1) at Louisiana State (2-1) This should not be tough for Louisiana State, a team on the rise. The Tigers held Auburn to 274 yards and two field goals and saved a 12-6 upset with an end-zone interception as time ran out. Duke (2-1) at Maryland (3-0) Maryland's paper-tiger defense is just a memory. The unbeaten Terps held West Virginia to 211 yards and collected seven turnovers. Georgia (2-1) at Mississippi (1-1) If Mike Bobo's passing (270 yards and two touchdowns) was not a gift from New Mexico State's defense, the Bulldogs have a worthy successor to Eric Zeier. Memphis (1-2) vs. Arkansas (2-1) Up-and-down Arkansas upset Alabama, 20-19, on a touchown pass with six seconds left. This week, it should be more comfortable. FAR WEST Army (1-1) at Washington (1-1) Washington self-destructed against Ohio State (nine penalties for 96 yards in the first half alone) and still lost by only 10 points. Army seems out of its class. U.C.L.A. (2-1) at Washington State (1-1) Forget Ryan Fien's two concussions in two weeks and a slightly separated nonthrowing shoulder. U.C.L.A. still has its quarterback, but its best defender, linebacker Donnid Edwards, is out for four weeks. MISMATCHES Central Florida (2-0) at Florida State (3-0) Central Florida has beaten Eastern Kentucky and Carson-Newman. No. 1 Florida State has run up 70 points against Duke, 45 against Clemson and (with 737 yards from scrimmage) 77 against North Carolina State. Pacific (1-2) at Nebraska (3-0) With Nebraska's best tailback, Lawrence Phillips, suspended because of legal problems, Clinton Childs rushed last week for 143 yards and freshman Ahman Green for 111. The beat goes on. North Texas (1-2) at Oklahoma (2-0) Oklahoma should get the solid game it needs to prepare for Colorado next week. It led Southern Methodist, a mediocre team, by only 9-3 at halftime before stretching out to a 24-10 victory. Akron (0-2) at Kansas State (2-0) The last time out, Kansas State squeaked by Cincinnati despite five first-half turnovers. But its defense is sound, and Akron will be fortunate to stay within six touchdowns.",1995-09-23T05:00:00+0000

Even the vest takes on a new identity when paired with jeans and a T-shirt, and the trousers become casual when combined with a crew-neck sweater. These principles of dressing apply to everything from elegant gray flannels to sporty Donegal tweeds, making the suit a prime way to get maximum value. Worn formally from Monday through Thursday, it can be reinterpreted at the end of the week with items like a sport shirt, a sweater vest or corduroy trousers.

us,DIARY,"COMMUNICATIONS Breaking Up Is...Oh, You Know It was certainly truth in advertising. After AT&T dropped its bombshell about breaking up, it said in a full-page ad aimed at customers, shareholders and communities it touches: ""That probably means you."" Yes, it's the most widely held stock -- 2.3 million Americans have some. And it's a presence in nearly everyone's life. So now what? Well, for phone customers, it's nothing like the '84 breakup, which created the service mishmash we have now; it's just corporate musical chairs. For investors, it's good news now -- the stock shot up 10 percent. But over time, it's a question: will those fabled ""widows and orphans"" wind up with AT&T's stronger or weaker pieces? And oh yes, how about the company? The equipment business, experts say, could do terrifically, could do terribly. A global expansion might be helped, might be hurt. The only consensus: the business world will really feel it. MEDIA GIANTS Time Warner Makes Its Move Time Warner and Ted Turner finally made up their minds: Time Warner will shell out $7.5 billion in stock for the Turner empire, making it the No. 1 media company, even ahead of Disney-ABC. For Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, it's a big shift: from buying cable systems to getting things like CNN and the Cartoon Network. And Ted Turner gets to be vice chairman, with, as he said, his ""life savings"" in Time Warner stock. It's not over, though. US West, a Time Warner partner, said the deal didn't have its consent, and Consumers Union attacked the deal, saying it would raise phone and cable rates. Stay, as they say, tuned. POLITICS Welfare Overhaul, Squared It can hurt to get your wish. President Clinton wanted to ""end welfare as we know it,"" and that's what the Senate gave him last week. But it was if he asked for a banana and got a huge fruit bowl in crinkly green plastic, for the wise senators voted more to demolish than to tinker. Block grants would go to the states, $70 billion would be cut from anti-poverty spending over seven years, and there's no expansion in education, training, or subsidized jobs. All of which, said Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, wouldn't end welfare but ""create 50 welfare systems"" and could mean ""real tragedy for the children."" But another Democrat, Tom Daschle, called it ""the best bill we are going to get."" And Mr. Clinton, having orated himself into a corner, just may have to sign whatever bill emerges. AUTOS Safety, Before the Law In the wrong hands, with the wrong luck, cars are mass murderers. Yes, they're getting safer -- with seat belts, air bags, stronger frames, high brake lights, other goodies. And as each safety item proves itself, the lumbering regulatory process makes it mandatory -- too quickly for some, too slowly for others. Then when cars kill anyway, auto makers can argue -- unless there's some defect -- that they've paid their legal dues. But have they? That was the question last week as a New Hampshire court ruled that a trial could be held to test Ford's liability in the death of a woman in a car with no air bag -- even though it was an '88 car, built before air bags were mandatory. In other words, should car makers rush to add any safety device as soon as it exists? AIRLINES All the Earthly Comforts Last week British Airways introduced snazzy new first-class compartments, or ""pods,"" complete with armchairs that turn into beds, tables for two, video units, phones -- and privacy. It's all designed by a specialist in yacht interiors. Now, said a travel agent, business people ""can use their time in the air as if they were in their office."" But is that sameness what our souls crave, or are we nurtured by variety? Some days, we've got the comforts of home; others, the mind expansion of travel. They're gradually blending into one. Oh, good news, though: the first-class New York-London fare is still only $3,367. One way. CANADA New Life for Tobacco Ads A crucial tobacco battleground is advertising: antismoking activists want it banned, saying it lures young people to smoking, while tobacco companies insist it should be legal to promote a legal product. Smoking foes looked to Canada as a model, since in 1988 it banned nearly all tobacco ads. But last week Canada's Supreme Court struck down that ban, saying it was unconstitutional because it violated free expression. This stunned antismoking activists, one of whom said of the tobacco companies, ""They are unmatched in terms of their resources and lack of ethics."" But a tobacco industry spokesman said new ads would be aimed at ""people who have already decided to smoke."" EDUCATION When Johnny Can't Pay The personal finance articles make it all wonderfully simple: sock away 98 percent of your income every month, and paying for college will be a breeze. All right. Fine. Meanwhile, out in the real world -- the one where 2 percent of your income won't quite pay the mortgage, plus buy new shoes every week (those growth spurts!) -- parents just can't pay those scary college bills. The result: loans are soaring. In a report out last week, the Education Resources Institute said loans hit $23.1 billion in 1994, up from $7.9 billion a decade ago. Federal loan programs, it said, disbursed more in the last four years than in their first 20, and half of students now graduate in debt. POLITICS Taking His Marbles Home ""Foreign investors will not understand what is happening here,"" one economist worried. Of course they won't. How could they be anything but mystified as our legislators try to reinvent the entire American way of life in time for tonight's cocktail hour? But this concern had a specific cause: Newt Gingrich's threat last week to snap the congressional wallet shut and send the nation into default for the first time ever if the President refuses to dance to the Republican music. ""I don't care what the price is,"" Mr. Gingrich said -- a price, by the way, that would include failure to make November Social Security payments. VISIONARIES Farewell, Mr. Popcorn Orville Redenbacher. Hmm. Probably some suitably homespun-looking character actor recruited to lend his name and face to overpriced popcorn. Sorry, you're way off. An agricultural scientist, he spent years coming up with the first real improvement in popcorn since long, long before the Pilgrims -- a fluffy wonder that expands up to 40 times its original size, not the puny 20 times of old popcorn. He and a partner made their breakthrough in 1965, he peddled the popcorn from his station wagon until Marshall Field's introduced it in 1970, they sold out to Hunt-Wesson in 1976 -- and their popcorn became the leader in the nation's $1 billion annual market.

us,Books in Brief; New York in the Hoof,"The New York style of walking is antivisual; it's fast and competitive, and eyes tend to stay focused on the fellow pedestrian just ahead or on the patch of concrete straight down. ARTWALKS IN NEW YORK (Michael Kesend Publishing, paper, $14.95) tries to do something about this. In 26 walks, covering all five boroughs, Marina Harrison and Lucy D. Rosenfeld, who previously wrote ""A Walker's Guidebook"" and ""Art on Site,"" ask readers to slow down and take a good look at works like ""Civic Fame,"" the gold-clad heroine atop the Municipal Building; the Hans Hofmann mosaic in the lobby of 711 Third Avenue, or the 350 sculptures by Isamu Noguchi at the Noguchi Museum and Sculpture Garden in Astoria, Queens. There are excursions to restaurants, artists' studios, office building lobbies and galleries and the often overlooked international cultural centers like the Swiss Institute and Goethe House. The authors are diligent and nonpartisan, limiting themselves to clear descriptions of the work and relying heavily on the word ""interesting."" They are snoopers and burrowers, with a sharp eye for art in unexpected corners. They cannot leave the Chanin Building lobby without mentioning the jeweled clocks and bas-reliefs by Rene Chambellan, as well as the bronze gateways that conceal the fire hoses. The authors do cheat a bit, however, by extending the definition of ""art"" to include the botanical gardens of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island. However, ""Artwalks in New York"" is bouncy, well written and filled with good tips. It gives 26 good reasons to slow down and take a look. WILLIAM GRIMES",1995-09-24T05:00:00+0000

From Versailles to New Jersey in 200 Years","WHAT The Hallunda chair, a reproduction of a classic 18th-century Swedish chair originally produced by the Stockholm chair maker Johan Peter Manserus. The hardwood chair, upholstered with blue-and-white checked linen, is part of a new Ikea limited-edition line of 18th-century Swedish furniture. The Hallunda chair has appeared on the set of MTV's ""Real World,"" on an episode of Lifetime Television's ""Our Home"" and on CNN's ""Style"" program.HISTORY LESSON With its distinctive spoon-shaped back, bowed rails and turned, fluted legs, the Hallunda is an elegant style that typifies late-18th-century Swedish furniture. Nevertheless, the prototype for the chair was actually French. When King Gustav III visited Louis XVI at Versailles in 1783, he so admired the dining-room chairs that he commissioned 48 of them to be made for his royal castle. That chair was the antecedent of the Ikea chair.MUSEUM QUALITY The Hallunda chair is a faithful reproduction. Lars Sjoberg, the curator of the Swedish National Museum, was appointed by the Swedish Board of National Antiquities to supervise the design and construction of Ikea's new furniture line. Mr. Sjoberg's attention to authenticity included hand-detailing and using original period materials. For instance, hemp is used in the construction of the seat frame, natural rubber and coconut fibers are part of the upholstery and the distinctive checks are copied from a pattern popular during the Gustavian and late Gustavian periods (1780-1810).A GOOD THING Although the Hallunda is available in either a light grey lacquer or a brown stain finish, many people have chosen to order the unfinished or ""white wood"" model so they can customize the chair to suit their own taste. Martha Stewart devotees take note: For an authentic vintage look and a patina that house guests will envy, finish your Hallunda with a light, opaque linseed oil paint (preferably yellow) and allow to dry for about 200 years.WHERE AND HOW MUCH The Hallunda chair, which is not listed in Ikea's standard catalogue, is available only at Ikea's flagship store in Elizabeth, N.J. The only choice for customers who wish to order is to visit the store. They should expect to wait three weeks for delivery. The chair costs $225, excluding a $69 delivery charge and 3 percent New Jersey sales tax. An added bonus: No Allen wrench required. RENE CHUN",1995-09-24T05:00:00+0000

Rabbit Gets It Together","THE UNITED STATES, democratic and various though it is, is not an easy country for a fiction writer to enter: the slot between the fantastic and the drab seems too narrow. An outsiderish literary stance is traditional; such masterpieces as ""Moby-Dick"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"" deal with marginal situations and eccentric, rootless characters; many American writers have gone into exile to find subjects of a congenial color and dignity. The Puritanism and practicality of the early settlers imposed a certain enigmatic dullness, it may be, upon the nation's affective life and social texture. The minimization of class distinctions suppressed one of the articulating elements of European fiction, and a close, delighted grasp of the psychology of sexual relations -- so important in French and English novels -- came slowly amid the new world's austerities. Insofar as a writer can take an external view of his own work, my impression is that the character of Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom was for me a way in -- a ticket to the America all around me. What I saw through Rabbit's eyes was more worth telling than what I saw through my own, though the difference was often slight; his life, less defended and logocentric than my own, went places mine could not. As a phantom of my imagination, he was always, as the contemporary expression has it, there for me, willing to generate imagery and motion. He kept alive my native sense of wonder and hazard.",1995-09-24T05:00:00+0000

In this city, after all, ""New Yorkers walk fast, talk fast and think fast,"" says George Frohlinde [ noam doublechecking ] , the owner of the Village Chess Shop. Many of those fast thinkers have been immigrants, and with each wave of immigrants, New York's standing in the chess world has risen. Of the 41 American grandmasters, 22 live in or around New York. [ noam doublechecking ] Here are some of the high points of its history: 1857 -- Paul Morphy, the prodigy from New Orleans, creates a stir in New York when he arrives to win what was considered the first national tournament. 1886 -- Wilhelm Steinitz, an Austrian who later became a U.S. citizen, wins a world championship match. He died in 1900 in an insane asylum on Wards Island. 1905 -- Jose Raul Capablanca, one of the most intuitive and gifted players ever, arrives from Cuba to attend Columbia's engineering school. 1920 -- Samuel Reshevsky, who was later widely thought to be the world's great chess prodigies, arrives from Poland to begin a North American tour in New York at age 8. He later takes up residence in the city. 1924 -- One of the great all-time tournaments is held at the Alamac Hotel. The field includes Capablanca, Emmanuel Lasker and Alexander Alekhine, world champions all. Capablanca spent some of his years as champion living in New York. 1945 -- The Soviet Union demolishes the United States, 15 1/4 to 4 1/2, in a match played by by radio telegraph. Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, above, makes the ceremonial first move at a Manhattan hotel ballroom. 1959 -- Bobby Fischer, who grew up in Brooklyn and is considered one of the strongest players in history, drops out of Erasmus Hall High School to pursue chess. He is already United States champion and the youngest grandmaster in history. ""It's a good thing he did,"" says his first coach, John W. Collins. ""I don't think he would have succeeded in too many other things."" 1972 -- Fischer wins the world title from Boris Spassky as a worldwide television audience watches. The New-York based commentator for PBS, Shelby Lyman, becomes a celebrity in his own right. 1989 -- Gata Kamsky defects from Russia at the New York Open, where he was the youngest entrant, at 14. He is now a Brooklyn resident and the highest-ranked American player. 1990 -- ""Chess"" makes its debut on public access television, Channel 16 in Manhattan. The host of the Saturday morning show, Jim Savage, analyzes games and interviews players in a studio on 23d Street. 1992 -- The first Chessathon is held in Central Park. The annual event, now held at Grand Central Terminal, pits thousands of children against masters. 1993 -- The film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" opens. Perhaps the best-known chess movie, it tells the story of Joshua Waitzkin, a real-life New York chess prodigy. Like the film ""Fresh,"" released last year, it spotlights speed chess as played in Washington Square Park as a source of street-based creativity. A New York specialty, speed chess uses a clock that keeps track of the time players spend thinking. Players are usually allowed five minutes a game.

The city is swelling with pilgrims from all over the world. Tens of thousands of mourners, fans, impersonators, icon-sellers, former Elvis entourage members and hangers-on are flooding into this oven-baked Egyptian-named Mississippi River metropolis, the place that midwifed the birth of the blues on Beale Street and bore witness to the death of Elvis on his Graceland toilet. For days, a Canterbury-like fusion of carnival and spiritual impulses has been building toward the convergence on the grave in a climactic ceremony referred to simply as ""Candlelight."" It's the central ritual in Elvis Culture, a phenomenon that has lately transcended the familiar contours of a dead celebrity cult and has begun to assume the dimensions of a redemptive faith.",1995-09-24T05:00:00+0000
us,Woodstock Family Values,"Not many families are as eccentric as the one in Jonathan Strong's latest novel, OFFSPRING (Zoland, paper, $14.95). Linc and Izzy Trace are unregenerate hippies happily ensconced in a Chicago suburb; their three young sons, misfits with Old Testament names who prefer pencils to computers, spend all their free time digging an elaborate tunnel in the dirt cellar beneath their home. To the astonishment of their extended family, Linc and Izzy have forged an exceptionally durable bond, somehow managing to keep their children close inside a protective circle of love. This is a deeply happy household -- or so it seems. Yet external forces, from difficult relatives to interfering school officials, are beginning to assail its battlements. And as the Traces' oldest son, Obadiah, inches toward adolescence, Linc and Izzy are in for some surprises that will shake their slightly smug certainty in their own private realm. A timely fable of family and cultural values, Mr. Strong's tender novel is somewhat undermined by its too conventionally unconventional protagonists and the cliche of the counterculture as repository of wisdom and probity. But ""Offspring"" is saved by its exquisite writing. With spare, fluid prose, Mr. Strong envelops the Traces in a dreamy, womblike world, delineating in knowing and delicate detail all the bliss and the blundering that are part of parental, filial and conjugal love.
