Tilden, was the Democratic nominee, and won a plurality of about 250,000 popular votes; but his total of electoral votes was sufficiently disputed to force the creation by the Congress of special Electoral Commission, which proceeded to give the Presidency to Tilden's Republican rival, Gov.

Not because the cadaverous properitor, a man with all kinds of spooky and disagreeable resources at his command, will cheat. But dreadful things happen to customers who try to cheat him. The movie, which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, demonstrates them.John Collier used to write lovely short stories about this kind of thing, drawing odd and ironic genies out of his old bottles. The episodes in ""Grave,"" based on stories by R. Chetwyn-Hayes, are crude and obvious. Each punch is telegraphed, each twist is a stranglehold. They overcompensate with blood for their lack of deftness. And the blood is rotten quality: dark, transparent stuff.However, the producers have hired some distinguished and underworked British actors for several of the parts. In spite of the blood, none of the episodes goes much below a certain harmless tedium. And in one or two cases the actors bring in a real if momentary liveliness.By far the best is ""The Elemental,"" and the reason is the late Margaret Leighton. She is a medium brought in to exorcise a nasty spirit that has embedded itself in the stuffy left shoulder of a businessman, played by Ian Carmichael.In yellow wig and dark glasses. Miss Leighton hasand bestowsa hilarious time wrestling the spirit all over a prim and proper Surrey cottage, filling the air with feathers, smashed crockery and outraged exclamations.In ""An Act of Kindness,"" Ian Bannen has some good moments as a long-suffering husband getting rid of his shrewish wife. As the wife, Diana Dors is also fine. I particularly liked herafter her husband has stormed from the dinner tableuprighting the upset sauce bottle and continuing to chew.The other two episodes, ""The Gate Crasher"" and ""The Door"" are pure stodge.

us,Board and seize,"It is one of those routine summer days in the Gulf of Alaska, a place where people put to sea only for profit or duty. The sky hangs tow, the gray sea rolls in sluggish swells six feet high, a 40knot wind kicks whitecaps off the wave crests, and the driven rain angles into every unsealed crevice. In a slippery, pitching open boat, seven men hunch into bulky orange lite jackets as cold water trickles down their necks. Nearby, the 378foot Coast Guard cutter Boutwell lies in attendance, her sleek white bow curying from the water like a shot trajectory. Several hundred yards away rides a blackhulled ship 300 feet long, with oriental characters and a name ending in Maru printed on the side. The word Maru identifies the vessel as Japanese, while heavy Hshaped towers and a stern that breaks open into a wide chute proclaim it to be a fishing trawler. In the motor surfboat are a crew of three seamen, plus a radioman who once served in Japan, a young Coast Guard officer, an agent of the National Marine Fisheries Service and myself, a civilian observer. The latter four are headed for a courtesy boarding to inspect the trawler, which lies more than 12 miles off the U.S. coast. Their authority to do so is based on fishing agreements between the U.S. and Japan.",1976-03-07T05:00:00+0000

The last decade has seen an unprecedented boom in museum building all over the country. Collections, too, have been made and all the aberrations of taste and in what they arehas never been so high. The reasons for this historic growth are many, of course, and some of them are undeniably meretricious. Examples of buildings erected to house someone's ego, rather than to serve some serious artistic purpose, are not hard to find, and the unlovely scramble to acquire what is inregardless of its qualityis easy to ridicule. Yet, when all the criticisms have been made and all the admirations of taste and intelligence duly acknowledged, the fact remains that this museum boom is one of the glories of our cultural life. It has brought to many people a kind of pleasure, knowledge and spiritual splendor not to be found elsewhere, and only a fool would deny it.",1976-03-07T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: About Failure:'Vincent, Francois' Is New Sautet Story","""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others,"" Claude Sautet's new French film, is about the sustaining friendship of three middle-aged, middle-class men whose lives in almost every other respect are failures.Vincent (Yves Montand) is separated from his wife, losing his mistress and in the process of going quietly bankrupt. Franois (Michel Piccoli) is a society doctor whose wife sleeps around with his tacit, exhausted approval. Paul (Serge Reggiani), a successful newspaper writer, has been unable to bring himself to finish the definitive World War II novel for almost 20 years.Every Sunday afternoon, Vincent, Franois, Paul, as well as a younger comrade named Jean (Gerard Depardieu), with their wives and mistresses, meet at Paul's country house. The friends drink, argue, play football, eat. Usually they reassure one another, but sometimes they explode in impotent rage. The failure of one is often intolerable to one or more of the others.On the Sunday afternoon that opens ""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others,"" the flames from a pile of burning leaves set a tool shed on fire. For a few minutes there is pandemonium in the yard. Someone remembers a cylinder of cooking gas in the shed. There is the danger of an explosion. Mothers pull their children away. One man goes into the shed and finds the cylinder (which turns out to be empty).The fire is put out amid a lot of laughter and joking and good humor. At the same time we realize that something terrible could have happened  something irretrievable. The menace has been contained, at least for the moment.Mr. Sautet, a director who is highly thought of in France, is a film maker about whom I have very mixed feelings. It's not only that he regards the bourgeoisie with solemnity unrelieved by any humor, but also that he seems as fascinated by the quality of their houses, the cut of their clothes, the make of their automobiles and the decibel range of their stereos as by the state of their emotional lives. Our envy of the good things of their lives competes with our sympathy and sometimes squashes it flat.Of the three Sautet films I've now seen, ""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others"" is the most successful in keeping a decent balance between these interests. Though the director indulges his taste for fancy photography  romantic, shimmery images often shot through windshields or as mirror reflectionsthe film is haunted by a genuine feeling of menace barely contained, of love that's run out, of futility, which have the effect of defining the meaning of friendship. It's not love, but it's better than nothing.Mr. Montand is fine in the key role, his face seeming to collapse from middle age to old age in the course of the film. Mr. Piccoli, too, gives a strong performance as the doctor, though we never know as much about him as Mr. Sautet thinks we do. As the youngest member of the group, Mr. Depardieu is forceful and funny, though we suspect that his life will not  ultimately  be much different from those of his friends: barren but well-upholstered.The women are largely dcor since the film is, after all, about friendship not love, though Stphane Audran has one superb scene. It's mostly one long, agonized reaction shot when Vincent, floundering from one false hope to another, asks her to reconsider their separation and divorce.It's curious that friendship, something that is so important in all our lives, is so difficult to dramatize effectively. Perhaps that's because in our romantic way we assume it to be some lesser breed of relationship, one that, execpt in war or on the football field, must always be suspect. In this ornate but thoughtful film, it is taken seriously.""Vincent, Franois, Paul and the Others"" opened yesterday at the Regency and D. W. Griffith Theaters.",1976-03-08T05:00:00+0000

He wanted to be a wide receiver but he wasn't fast enough or big enough. But the coaches never cut anybody. If a youngster wanted to cut himself by no longer practicing with the team, that was the youngster's business. The coach didn't cut him from the squad as long as he showed up for practice. Roberto always showed up. He also read instructional books on football. He didn't read that well but slowly his reading improved. So did his marks. So did his poise. When he was graduated, he went on to college. He's in law school now. His coaches are convinced that if it hadn't been for football, Roberto might be on the streets now, maybe on drugs, maybe in a jam with the police. His name happened to be Roberto and he happened to be Hispanic but there are thousands of public high school youngsters like Roberto for whom sports provide a motivation to study. Many of those high school sports programs are jeopardy because of the city's financtal distress. But the Board of Education has rejected an offer by the BristolMeyers Company to save high school sports by restoring nearly $1 million that the city has slashed from Its annual budget. According to the Board of Education, legal problems and its policy prompted its decision. Apparently the BristolMeyers offer was too commercial.

us,"'Confrontation,' a Swiss Film on Nazis and Numbness","Like Oran in Camus's ""The Plague,"" Zurich is sick. It is sick with the sickness of history: apathy and disconnection while horrors take place all around. Just over in Germany, Hitler is putting together a formidable method out of madness.""Here it is like living under the rim of a cheese dish,"" a Zurich Jew says, trying in vain to stir up his fellow Jews at a kosher restaurant. They are alarmed but calm; optimistic not from evidence but from need. They worry, they eat, they joke.In ""Confrontation,"" which is being shown at the 68th Street Playhouse, the Swiss director Rolf Lyssy films numbness virtually in physical form, as if it were architecture or statues.Into this numbness of the normal comes the abnormal agent. He is Frankfurter, a Yugoslav Jew who leaves his medical studies in Germany when the pressures begin to build up and seeks a haven in Switzerland. He finds companions, a girlfriend and peace; or at least he would have peace if he didn't also have an extraordinary sensitivity to evil in the air. The evil is Nazism.Frankfurter has a wasting illness that requires numerous operations. Mr. Lyssy preserves the ambiguity or the irony: Is Frankfurter's sensitivity a part of his illness, or is it sanity, and sanity a kind of illness in a sick world?Frankfurter notices symptoms and is obsessed by them. He notices the headlines in a Zurich Nazi paper; he notices the swastika in the lapel of a passer-by. He retreats from his friends and from his studies, and one day he buys a gun, goes to the house of a local Nazi leader and kills him. He is arrested, tried and jailed.Mr. Lyssy has made a highly intelligent movie but perhaps not a very successful one. He has adopted a flat and deliberately uninflected style, which has some hint of the work of Jean-Marie Straub. The sequences move rapidly, abruptly, bitten off at the end, and almost without transitions. This is effective, in fact; what does not work so well, and turns an original and disturbing film into something of a political pamphlet, is the long trial scene.Mr. Lyssy wants to show the imperviousness of the mechanisms of society to genuine moral questions. He lays out in full the speeches of counselthe state prosecutor, the Nazi lawyers representing the widow, the old defense lawyer who reads endlessly from articles about Nazism in an attempt to justify his client.They are boring, they are mechanical, and they miss the moral point that is mutely reflected on the face of Frankfurter, magnificently played by Peter Bollag. It is not just evil that is banal, the film suggests, but good, or at least the narrow kind of good that society conceives itself as upholding.The trouble is that this banality, this thickness is not merely stated or suggested. It plays on and on in the courtroom until we, like some of the courtroom public, feel like getting up and leaving.Here too, of course, Mr. Lyssy makes his point; we show a callousness that could spawn new monsters if we, like those in the courtroom, get bored with the mumbled reading-out of Nazi atrocities. Except we are not in a courtroom; we are at a movie. Our moral obligations are vastly different. Our freedom is different.It is too long, it is hard to take, and the ending pulls it out of shape. But on the way Mr. Lyssy accomplishes some remarkable things. There is a marvelous, laconic scene, for instance, showing Jews in an old-age home in Germany. Through the windows come the chants of a Nazi rally. The old men feebly discuss Hitler; is he a real danger or a momentary thing? Finally one patient says simply, ""They'll elect him Chancellor."" He collapses tiredly onto his pillow and suddenly the rambling conversation becomes tragic.",1976-03-09T05:00:00+0000

Then someone hit it with a load of moral ambiguity, and it all caved in.Twenty years or so ago there was a great fad for wine cookery. The idea floated over from Europe: the execution  literally  was thoroughly American. Pour wine, cheap wine, on any old mess. Pour it on TV dinners. The result was gourmet cooking.Nowadays moral ambiguityalso. Europe-bornhas trickled down into cheap action films. It swamps them. It's all right to have a switch or twoa hero who turns out to be a skunk or a villain who is really working for the March of Dimes. But with much more moral complication than that, the attention is sidetracked from the actionthe film's whole purpose in the first placeand focused relentlessly on the characterization. Since there isn't any, you sink.For about half of its length, ""Killer Force,"" which opened at Showcase Theaters yesterday, is a bumpy but entertaining story about a mine security agent, played by Peter Fonda, assigned to penetrate and foil the efforts of an outside gang to break into the mine camp and steal diamonds.Mr. Fonda has a girl (Maud Adams) who loves him and a boss (Telly Savalas) who hates him. He has a mystery to crack: Someone inside the camp is working with the robbers.There is some excitement at the start, and the security precautions at the diamond mine are interesting and perhaps authentic. Mr. Fonda's tendency to languid skittishness is held in check for a while by a beard and a few good lines.The unmasking of the inside man at the mine manages to be a surprise: Unfortunately, it also wrecks the movie's framework. It would be difficult to say who wins out in the end; the good guys or the bad. It would be even harder to care.In the role of camp security chief, Mr. Savalas is a curiosity. His face is designed expressly for television. On a small box you miss nothing of his exaggerated features and expressions, even when the reception is bad. On a movie screen he looks like an enlargement.",1976-03-11T05:00:00+0000

us,5 Shorts by Bruce Baillie at Film Forum,"Bruce Baillie makes avant-garde films with the gifts of a painter and the objectives of a sign painter. A visual sensibility and a delicacy in balancing images founder in a determination to hammer these elements into sweeping and often crude social messages.In five films, made in the 1960's and being shown this week and next at the Film Forum, Mr. Baillie gives evidence both of his talent and the distance by which it outruns his artistic judgment.As for the talent, take the first of the five films, a tiny and beautiful piece entitled ""All My Life."" The soundtrack has Ella Fitzgerald singing the song that gives the film its name. The camera travels along masses of brilliant red flowers growing against a fence under a blue sky.It is very simple, and it would simply be a pretty thing to watch except that Mr. Baillie has struck upon a visual correlative of the singing that goes much further.The flowers are wild and unkept, amid weeds and overgrown scrub, in the back lots of a slum somewhere on the edge of town. They are dusty flowers. It is obvious that there is broken glass and bits of rusty tin in the underbrush. Flaming red and a tenement roughness: Ella Fitzgerald has been remarkably seized and set to film.The two major pieces in the program, ""Mass for the Dakota Sioux"" and ""Quixote,"" show moments of the same lilting use of the camera. Both pictures are roughly similar: long assemblies of bits and pieces of American life, some seen plainly; others blurred, abbreviated or superimposed for complexity of mood. They are aimed in their whole at conveying a sense of emptiness, of cheapness, of violence, of futility.""Mass"" is done with more subtlety; and for the first third or so it promises to embody hauntingly the lament of Chief Sitting Bull that serves as epigraph: ""No chance for me to live, Mother."" But it goes on too long. There is a sameness and, by now, a triteness in juxtaposing advertising slogans, battleships firing, politicians making speeches and high school parades and filming it darkly and blurrily to suggest oppression.""Quixote"" is much the same, but much longer. Forty-five minutes is excessive for this continual hammering of weighted images. And the weighting is even cruder. Mr. Baillie shoots a Rotary-style banquet and intercuts the diners' faces with views of pigs at a trough. Or he shows a high-school basketball game.Now the movements in a basketball game, however little interest you take in the sport, are by any conceivable judgment buoyant, cheerful and often of considerable grace. Mr. Baillie edits and chops so it is all sharp elbows and gaping expressions. It becomes jerky and violent.Similarly we see a horse on the ground, apparently dying. No, it is not dying; it is getting up. Projected at a certain speed and cut in a certain fashion life becomes death. Out of this, all possible messages can be made; and when they are, none commands belief or respect.",1976-03-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"Screen: 'My Michael,' Gloomy Picture From Israel","To call ""My Michael"" a modest film is to exaggerate. It is downright imperceptible.This Israeli import, which opened yesterday at the Festival Theater, is made with seriousness and some skill. Its depiction of a shut-in, obsessed marriage is a vehicle for exploring a fenced-in, surrounded quality in Israeli society. But we are more aware of the vehicle's own airlessness and monotony than of the landscape it is trying to take us through.Based on the novel by Amos Oz, ""Michael"" is the story of Hanna, a young teacher who marries an archeology student in Jerusalem. The marriage is impetuous; neither has any money, and they move into a cramped apartment.It is more than the apartment that is cramped, however. They are nice, educated young people; full of tolerance and good will. But life closes in on their marriage. She has a baby, he has to go on with his studies; time and space seem to dry up on them.It is an arid, reasonable marriage. Michael, the husband, escapes into stolidity and a flirtation with a fellow student. Hanna fantasizes about being ravished and carried away. Not by pirates or airline pilots, butthis being Israelby Arabs""What are we living for?"" she asks her husband at one desperate moment before she drifts utterly away. ""People don't live for anything: they just live,"" he replies.Now all this could be a wry accusation that Israeli society lives amid Arabs while it avoids all psychological contact with them. The formal message is that such a posture has to be paid for by a loss of reality, by a drying-up of life. As a child, Hanna had two Arab children as her best friends; as an adult she dreams about naked bodies, black mustaches andto pin down the nationality beyond doubtchecked keffiyehs floating out behind.So costumed, the imaginary sequences are ludicrous. But ludicrousness is not the problem with ""My Michael."" In fact, done as a slapstick comedy about an Israeli housewife with Arab fantasies, it might have been not only funny but pointed as well.The problem is the film's deliberate attenuation; its deadpan development of married banality in a painfully banal style. Every possible soaper clich is brought out: the announcement that she's pregnant; his sulky mopping of the floor while she sits, sulky and distended; his efforts to study while the baby cries; his flirtation; her sexual teasing of a young boy.True, a number of these scenes are done with economy and charm. There is good acting, particularly from some of the older characters with small parts.The performance of the principals is less satisfying.

Though produced on a limited budget, it is technically no better or worse than hundreds of conventional ""white"" silents of the period. As history, however, it is a devastating reminder of the obstacles that black Americans had to overcome before they could begin to identify the goals of social progress.A little card at the beginning of ""Scar of Shame"" promises that the theme of the film will be the effects of environment, how ""the childhood training"" and ""the companions"" of one's youth determine whether or not one spends his ""useful time on this earth"" in pursuit of ""the higher things in life."" All this sounds harmless enough, but the film that follows demonstrates a system of contradictions that have only recentlyin the last 30 yearsbeen hooted and jeered into oblivion.""Scar of Shame"" is the story of a poor, beautiful slavey named Louise who is saved from her wicked step-father when a rich young concert pianist, Alvin Hillyard, marries her. A few months later Louise learns that Alvin has never told his socialite mother of his marriage, and Alvin, who is meant to be a sympathetic character most of the time, explains, ""caste is one of the things mother is very determined about, and you don't belong in our set.""In a fight with a gangster, Alvin accidentally shoots Louise in such fashion that, according to a newspaper account, it ""left a hideous scar on her neck which completely marred her beauty."" Alvin is sent to jail. Louise takes up the life of a night-club hostess, wearing a scarf to hide her hideous scar, which could easily be covered by a small Band-Aid. Alvin escapes, falls in love with a girl of his set, and Louise, distraught because she still loves him, commits suicide, paving the way for Alvin's future happiness.It's necessary to go into the plot in this detail to appreciate the odd things the film is doing as it attempts to meet the fantasy needs of its black audiences while providing them with uplift.The black caste system we see is simply an extention of the white bourgeoisie's: white is perfect, light-skinned is acceptable, black is ugly. The values and the manners, ""the higher things in life,"" have been borrowed from white society with no questions asked. Louise's sin is not that she does anything wrong, or that she had evil companions in her childhood, but that she wasn't a member of Alvin's set.Poor Louise simply didn't measure up. Which is something that ghetto audiences of the time apparently understood and accepted. Militant blacks have subsequently expressed outrage at this sort of nonsense, but that may be to overlook some of the positive effects of such films. Among other things, they portrayed a black society that was educated, had its own lawyers, doctors, intellectuals and artists. At a time when Hollywood was still getting laughs out of the amount of fried chicken eaten by little Farina in the Our Gang comedies, these fantasies and distortions were comparatively healthy ones.",1976-03-18T05:00:00+0000

The county was settled in 1643 by colonists from Stamford, Conn., led by John Carman, and was incorporated 77 years ago. As recently as 20 years ago there were large dairy farms in Nassau. But the postWorld War II exodus from the city has made the county into what Lee E. Koppelman, Long Island's chief planner, calls a thoroughly suburban set of communities. However, a sufficient number of bucolic areas remaid and there are more than enough beaches and parks to insure a sense of openness.

To be sure, Edward's power was itself much diminished from that wielded by his redoubtable mother, Victoria, as she reigned over Great Britain and its Empire from 1837 to 1901 and, being prolific as a broodmare, gradually populated most of the thrones of Europe with her offspring or their children.

us,Screen: Moving and Distressing 'Juvenile Liaison',"Sergeant Ray of the Lancashire Constabulary hasn't the remotest resemblance to the fictional English detective who wears disgust and weariness as elegantly as his tweeds. Sergeant Ray wears shiny dark jackets with ugly yellow squares, a white shirt, a greasy tie, hair slicked back and thinnish, a black leather coat that makes his bulk look brutal.His disgust and weariness come out as violence, barely repressed and sometimes not even that; as cunning, quite unrepressed and showing through. He is the head of a three-member squad set up to deal with truant, shoplifting or otherwise unmanageable children in Liverpool. He is the central figure in a moving and distressing documentary, ""Juvenile Liaison,"" being shown at the Film Forum, 15 Vandam Street.It is a film that is far more intelligent than its viewpoint. This, in a documentary, is praise: It does not restrict the viewer to its own conclusions.The viewpoint is clear enough. We see the sergeant, huge and menacing, cross-examine an 8-year-old Indian girl at her school. Her teachers say she has a consistent record of pilfering things from her schoolmates' bags and desks. Continually hinting that he can take her down to the police station if she doesn't tell the truth, he badgers her about an apple, about some missing pencils.It is a painful sight: This big, ugly man reducing a frail and lovely little girl to incoherence and tears. And yet she is, as it turns out, a liar and a thief. She has produced, around her, all kinds of small chaos, small injustices: She has embedded them in the minds of the children around her. They have lost apples and pencils, the little securities of childhood, and have found no recourse.The movie stresses the disproportion between the tiny miscreants and their large and strident pursuers. There is an immensely affecting scene where a policewoman snarls and scolds at a fat adolescent girl who has been shoplifting. She batters at her: Isn't she ashamed? Doesn't she think of her parents? Does she want a criminal record?' The great balloon of a girl sits stolidly and silently and then, as the buzz-saw voice goes on, tears squeeze from her eyes. And she admits, most touchingly, to one real ambition: She wants to be a prison warden. ""Not a chance,"" the policewoman says.There are other, similar scenes. The film makers show the threat of brutality rather than real brutality, though at one point Sergeant Ray drags a 15-year-old boy  who has beaten his mother  out of bed by the hair.The intended message is that the youth squad is a blind and cruel response by society to its errant children. Sergeant Ray's explanation  that by making a show of firmness, by making it clear to the children what will happen if they don't reform, some are saved from later, serious involvement with the law  is treated as a rationalization.Maybe so. But as we watch these ill-prepared, harassed, unequipped, desperately tired officers go about their job, a troubling sympathy grows up for them. In these working-class, often fatherless homes, Sergeant Ray, coming from the same class, uses far more patience, far less violence than the fathers themselves might have used.The sergeant and his colleagues believe in what they are trying to do, even though they have no illusions about their success. They are medical corpsmen, sent out to treat the wounds of social dismemberment with splints.They are rough and sometimes mean, but they are also heroic. The film does not see the heroism, but it lets us see it. It sees the entrapment used by the police officers on the children; it lets us see the entrapment in which the officers find themselves.In the harshest scene, Sergeant Ray feigns to arrest a little boy and sits with him in a jail cell to show him what it is like. The film stresses the child's terror and the barbarity of the device. But what we really see is two people in jail  the boy and the policeman  companions in frustration and helplessness.",1976-03-26T05:00:00+0000

Judging from the results, the scriptwriters and the actors seem to have worked for next to nothing.The movie is about an American industrialist whose wife and children are kidnapped from their Athens home by a gang of political terrorists. They are taken to an abandoned monastery on a needle-shape crag.The police can do nothing, but the wife's first husband, played by James Coburn, can. Pondering the problem, he sees a couple of crows flying overhead. His eyes widen, his nostrils dilate.He finds a flying circus of hang glider riders. In just two or three days they teach him to glide, and he teaches them to fight. On a night of the full moon, they swoop in, and the moonlit swooping is authentic, difficult and lovely.There is enough shooting for two civil wars, and the terroristswho wear red T-shirts with terrorist insignia on them  are eventually chomped up. But nothing has happened to make us care much, one way or the other.The dialogue, the motivations, the politics are cardboard. The acting is unalloyed lead.

us,Screen: 'Moses' Opens:Burt Lancaster Stars in TV Series Revision,"""Moses"" is a movie that appears to have been made by the yard, a bargain-basement Bibical epic that can be cut and shaped to fit any need.The film, which opened yesterday at the Ziegfeld Theater, has been put together from a lot of the same footage that went into the six one-hour ""Moses"" shows presented on CBS-TV last year with Burt Lancaster in the title role, with the Old Testament as source material and with additional dialogue by Anthony Burgess, Vittorio Bonicelli and Gianfranco De Bosio.Because I did not see the television series, I don't know how much of the film duplicates the small-screen shows, though I assume there are certain obligatory scenes that appear in both versions. You can't very well do six hours of Moses on television and not get around to his Red Sea venture, which is one of the theatrical feature's noisiest and most tepid highlights.The movie at the Ziegfeld makes C. B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" look like a work by Eisenstein. It is long and loud and so silly in some scenes that the piety in others is effectively denied. The screenplay covers the life of Moses from his birth and subsequent adoption by an Egyptian princess, to his death years later, after he had successfully led the Israelites to the land of Caanan.At its best moments, the film's style is that of Kipling's ""Just So Stories"" adapted to Sunday school concerns. Thus we learn how the Passover feast came to be, and we are there when Moses more or less invents the Sabbath. The film displays some power when it demonstrates the ferocity with which Moses punishes the lawbreakers, including executions by stoning some victims, by hurting others off a cliff, and by pouring molten gold into the mouth of one man who would have had the Israelites worship the golden calf.These brief but vivid glimpses of a harsh, primitive world are softened and sentimentalized by the drab direction, the woodenness of most of the performances (except Mr. Lancaster's) and by dialogue that sounds as if it had been cut out of a failed Neil Simon play. Mr. Lancaster, no longer in his first youth, has the elemental physical and emotional strength to make a fine Moses, if this were a better film.One accepts the childlike nature of Moses' people, who may witness their leader turning the Nile to blood on Monday and a rod into a serpent on Wednesday, but who still may wonder on Friday what he's done for them lately. What one doesn't accept is the language in which these doubts are spoken.Says a petulant tribesman during the journey through the wilderness when water is running short, ""You said you knew this place like the back of your hand."" Moses: ""Will you people never cease to complain?"" Irritation is the spur.This film, which is a co-production of RAI, the Italian Government-sponsored radio and television company, and Independent Television Corporation of England, a commericial company, was shot in Israel and Italy and has a cast of dozens and dozens, representing most races and creeds. The English Anthony Quayle plays Aaron, the Swedish Ingrid Thulin is Miriam, and the Greek Irene Pappas is Zipporah. Mariangela Melato, who has since become a star in Lina Wertmuller's films, has a small, sort of glide-on part as the princess who finds Moses in the bull-rushes.In addition to contributing to the screenplay, Gianfranco De Bosio is credited as the film's director, which I take to mean he was the film's traffic manager.",1976-03-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Books of The Times,"Toward the close of the 1952 Presidential campaign and of John Bartlow Martin's definitive biography of Adlai E. Stevenson, the author quotes a speech by Dwight D. Eisenhower's runningmate, Richard M. Nixon: Stevenson himself hasn't even backbone training, for he is a graduate of Dean Acheson's spineless school of diplomacy which cost the free world 600 million former allies in the past seven years of Trumanism. Mr. Nixon has suffered a change or two in the estimation of his political party and country. Mr. Stevenson, as another Presidential campaign arrives 24 years later, remains the beau ideal of Democratic, liberalism more than any candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt. All the skills that Mr. Martin brought to the art of investigative reporting in the responsible years of magazine journalism following World War II are put to use in his big Stevenson biography. He is, first of all, ruthless but not careless with small details; next, he takes details and builds them into a structure of facts; finally, the interpretation of his subject, derived from many sources, becomes the property of the reader rather than of the author. This transference is quite unlike much of the new journalism and semibiography, which often depends on fixed notions, psychoanalytical justification and stylish clairvoyance. Leon Edel, Henry James's Boswell, set finer guidelines: The biographer may be as imaginative as he pleasesthe more imaginative the betterin the way he brings together his materials, but he must not imagine the materials.",1976-03-27T05:00:00+0000

The Jewish community is so small and so isolated that it can scarcely believe its ears: I had begun to think that in this godforsaken town we were the last Jews on earth, a member of the council murmurs. Zalmen, the local rabbi's hoptoad of a sexton, takes on prophetic stature whenever the two men are alone: he urges the aged, philosophically resigned rabbi to shake off his torpor and speak out to the strangers during his sermon, thereby relighting the flame Jewish unity throughout the world.

His writing has always been experimental in the best sense: he poses a problem, embeds it in a familiar sf context and then bombards it with highenergy language to see what particles of insight he can dislodge. By the very nature of this technique, Delany is bound to be more successful in some books than others. In last year's Dhalgren, the high purpose was more evident than the narrative drive.

For a quick, allencompassing look, try the $9 Cityrama tour or choose a tour of either historical Paris ($6.50), modern Paris (same prise) or Left Bank sites with a motorboat cruise along the Seine ($12.50). Departures are from 3 Boulevard des Capucines and other points; ask a travel agent or hotel porter.

Controversy rages as to whether to replace them in the name of nature or keep the square without trees, as it was when Henri TV designed it as a formal promenade and tournament ground. For the moment, visitors can take advantage of the void to admire this extraordinary ensemble of townhouses as no one has been able to see them for generations.
