It is a library that has grown to several thousand pieces through the years. It has lived in large houses where it could expand apace and in confined places where it could only inch ahead.

Secondarily, they are related to the traditions of artistic photography and of art in general, as well as to the history of the medium's technological progress. In the functionalist view, photographs are cultural messages first and foremost, to be deciphered according to their uses and related to social history, not art history.

In an extreme and let us hope mythical case, a newly rich concertgoer hears Beethoven's Ninth yet another time and is suddenly taken aback: the great choral finale, which sounded so stirring in his idealistic youth, has come to sound like a midsummer night's brawl in a bad neighborhood, with everyone trying to outbellow the next one.

Each is named for its protagonist: ''Justine'' was published in 1957, ''Balthazar'' in 1958, ''Mountolive'' in 1958 and ''Clea'' in 1960.",1982-08-01T05:00:00+0000

Habib, senior Lebanese officials said. Agreement was reached on all major points, they said, but Syria, Jordan and Egypt had yet to agree formally to accept the guerrillas. The officials said that Mr. Habib hoped to complete the final details by Sunday, when he wants to have a meeting of French, American and Lebanese military specialists to set the day the withdrawal would begin. (Page 1, Column 1.) Despite reports of progress in talks on a Palestinian withdrawal from Lebanon, United States officials stressed that the reluctance of Arab governments to accept substantial numbers of the guerrillas remained a critical problem. They said that the withdrawal could take place ''within a week,'' but there were three immediate problems still to be resolved. These were the timing of the withdrawal of the 6,000 guerrillas in west Beirut, the final destination of the guerrillas and assurances of the maintenance of a cease-fire.

us,"A BOLD 'LEAR' AND 'PEER GYNT'; STRATFORD-ON-AVON As a national center of theater, history and tourism, Britain's Stratford - the Royal Shakespeare Company's home away from London - crosses the bridge between tradition and experimentation. After several seasons, a Shakespeare play may be repeated but in a new and often inventive way, and continually the company is expanding its non-Shakespearean repertory to include other classics and, occasionally, modern plays. The troupe operates year-round in two theaters, one for large-scale productions, the other a small open space for intimate drama. This season ''King Lear'' and ''Peer Gynt,'' two Promethean masterpieces, are given bold dramatic treatment. Adrian Noble's production of ''King Lear,'' starring Michael Gambon on the Royal Shakespeare Company's main stage, draws from a lavish palette of sights and sounds. Ron Daniels's ''Peer Gynt,'' starring Derek","Mr. Noble's ''King Lear'' begins with a tableau: the Fool and Cordelia sitting together on Lear's throne entwined in a cat's cradle of string, representing a child's game and perhaps a hangman's noose. As two sides of the king's conscience, they are metaphorically joined even unto death. The image is compelling, and it is followed by a ''Lear'' of remarkable expansiveness. There is far more to this version than Lear himself, with Mr. Noble accentuating the parallel story of Gloucester and his sons and placing extra emphasis on the role of the Fool. Mr. Gambon's Lear and Antony Sher's Fool equally share, in Lear's words, ''this great stage of fools,'' a line that is a hallmark of Mr. Noble's approach. Along with other characters such as Kent, Edgar and Edmund, the two are role-players who are carried away by their own performances. As the King, Lear can play the Fool, and the Fool is both coxcomb and wise man of the kingdom. Mr. Gambon is as willful as he is commanding, flexing his ego as he solicits testimony from his daughters, toying with Cordelia's suitors as he refers with almost incestuous envy to their ''amorous sojourns.'' Abandoning responsibility while seeking to retain power, he calls for his Fool, who curtly puts him in his place.",1982-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Prime Minister Menachem Begin said that there were grounds to believe that the besieged P.L.O. guerrillas ''will leave shortly and that we will not have to enter west Beirut.'' This was his first indication that he seriously considered a peaceful withdrawal of the Palestinian guerillas to be likely. Mr. Begin also said that he informed Secretary of State George P. Shultz that Israel had accepted the proposal for a multinational peacekeeping force to enter Beirut, but only ''after most of the terrorists leave Lebanon together with 1,500 Syrians who are besieged there.'' (Page A1, Column 6.) Precise logistical plans for the P.L.O.'s withdrawal from Lebanon were set tentatively at a meeting in Beirut held by the United States special envoy, Philip C. Habib, with French, Lebanese and American military specialists. In another meeting, Mr. Habib presented the outlines of the tentative plans to Israel's Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon.

Half a century ago, the Goethe tale, as filtered through the sentimental music of Ambroise Thomas and the Carre-Barbier libretto, seemed an unshakable cornerstone of the international repertory. Its five meaty roles were vehicles for the likes of Bori, Pons, Teyte, Swarthout, Schipa, Gigli and Pinza. Every operagoer could hum along with its famous tunes: Mignon's ''Connais-tu le Pays,'' Philine's ''Je Suis Titania'' and Frederic's Gavotte. Now, however, ''Mignon'' is so far from being popular that the current Santa Fe Opera production has to be regarded as a curio.

WESTON, Conn. - Bad Times have visited the Arabs before.  From 1096 to 1204, Crusaders ravaged the Fertile Crescent.

Past catastrophes provided occasions for renewal and change, investing Moslem civilization with unusual resiliency. The Arabs' current predicament is without parallel. Never before have they experienced a similar combination of wealth and weakness, material resources and moral bankruptcy.","Economically, the Middle East is the richest region in the third world; strategically, the most important.

The British, who had advocated a ''national home'' for the Jewish people in Palestine with the Balfour Declaration of 1917, found their position in the Palestine mandate west of the Jordan increasingly untenable after World War II. In the face of conflicting claims and bloody strife involving Palestinian Arabs and a growing Jewish population, Britain turned the problem over to the fledgling United Nations. In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly recommended the partition of Palestine and the establishment of separate Arab and Jewish states. The Jews proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948.",1982-08-12T05:00:00+0000

PRINCETON, N.J. - Will Rogers once said, ""Things will get better despite our efforts to improve them.'' As a former United States official who in the 1970's worked on ways to reform welfare programs, I always thought that there was a lot of embarrassing truth in this remark and that it was aimed at Government reformers like me. But I'm not so sure now that I believe that things will get better for the poor. Research on the effects of the Administration's dramatic shift in domestic policy - it is based at Princeton University and being carried out across the country - is the reason for my new pessimism.","President Reagan's budget victory in 1981 was a historic piece of social legislation - historic in that it marked a reversal of a long period of growth in programs for the poor. The group hit hardest is the working poor, which had been aided under various welfare ''entitlement'' programs. Many people in this group no longer receive benefits under the following programs: Aid for Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid, housing, reduced-price school lunches for children. This has occurred despite Budget Director David A. Stockman's original hope that the cuts would fall evenly on all groups in our society.",1982-08-13T05:00:00+0000

They broke up during the 11-hour Israeli bombardment of west Beirut. The P.L.O. leadership gave the special United States envoy, Philip C. Habib, a list of the geurrillas to be withdrawn and the names of the Arab countries willing to accept them. The cease-fire that went into effect at dusk Thursday was still holding firm on almost all fronts. (Page 1, Column 6.) Hope was still alive in Washington that a settlement in Lebanon was possible. President Reagan said that while ''technicalities'' remained unresolved in the negotiations to evacuate Palestinian guerrillas from west Beirut, there was ''great reason for hope'' that a settlement could be reached. United States officials expressed concern about the conduct of the Israeli Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon. One American official involved in the Beirut negotiations said there was growing concern in the Reagan Administration that Mr. Sharon ''was doing all he can to sabotage the negotiations.''

And just now there was the Santa Fe Opera's production of George Rochberg's first opera, based on Melville's ''The Confidence Man,'' about as prickly a book as anyone ever tried to turn into lyric theater.

UNCOVERING A HIDDEN TROVE OF EARLY PHOTOGRAPHS;
LENOX, Mass.  Photography is a relatively young medium within the fine arts.  While it sometimes seems that its short history already has been sifted with a very fine-toothed comb, it remains possible to discover the accomplishments of photographers unknown to the world or, if one is lucky, to happen upon a collection of photographic masterpieces in a relative's attic. It is, in short, possible to make photographic history as well as to learn it, a fact which gives the field an excitement lacking in the rest of art history and which attracts some of today's brightest and most ambitious young scholars.","In recent years we have seen the excavation and elevation to the photographic pantheon of 19th-century exploratory photographers Samuel Bourne and Carleton Watkins, of 20th-century portraitists E.J. Bellocq and Mike Disfarmer, and of commercial journeymen on the order of Charles Van Schaick, Joe Steinmetz and the Howes Brothers. The accomplishments of these newly esteemed practitioners are by no means equal, but they represent the fruits of a field unique to our time: photographic archeology. As part of this activity, some major repositories of 19th-century photographic treasures have been found, often right under our noses. One wonders if the supply of such recoveries is inexhaustible.",1982-08-15T05:00:00+0000

''The act,'' notes the American novelist William Styron in his introduction to ''The Wheat and the Chaff,'' Mitterrand's 10th book, ''was both symbolic and fraternal - the gesture of a politician who is also an intellectual and a literary man.'' Mitterrand began keeping diaries for ''The Wheat and the Chaff'' in 1971, when he assumed the leadership of the badly eroded Socialist Party. In these passages, he reflects on the career and the character of Charles de Gaulle, who had defeated him in the 1965 presidential elections and whose death in 1970 marked the end of an extraordinary era during which the larger-than-life figure of the general seemed to symbolize France.Francois Mitterrand is President of France.

If the Guild can be declared a monopoly, and then more or less trust-busted with a great big stick, dramatists thereafter will be free, singly, to agree to whatever contract any producer offers them, with or without coupons redeemable at the nearest supermarket.

In past years, a comparably unwieldy novel might never have been adapted at all. Or, having been given a drastically simpler story or an upbeat ending, it might have arrived on screen in a bowdlerized form. But today, Hollywood appears to be approaching serious fiction with an ever more enlightened, respectful attitude - one that cannot help but increase the difficulty of the translation process, since serious novels are now apt to be less conventionally cinematic than ever before.",1982-08-15T05:00:00+0000

The Cabinet announcement also said that the Israeli Government insisted that ''a check be made of the lists of terrorists to leave Beirut and Lebanon.'' This also represented a softening of an earlier demand that Israel be provided with the names of the guerrillas being evacuated. (Page A1, Column 6.) Reports that Israel's stand had eased in the negotiations on the withdrawal of the guerrillas were treated cautiously by Lebanese and P.L.O. officials. Philip C. Habib, the special United State envoy, was expected back in Beirut today with the latest Israeli negotiating position, which reportedly makes concessions on previous demands that a list of all guerrillas leaving west Beirut be turned over before the evacuation and that a multinational peace force not be deployed until a week after the P.L.O. withdrawal begins.

But as the years went by, they realized they had missed something in life by not having made any serious study of the humanities. About four years ago, the couple, who live here, enrolled in an unusual continuing - education liberal-arts course - based on the curriculum of St. John's College of Annapolis, Md. -that they say has stirred their ''intellectual juices.'' Allan Hoffman, the volunteer instructor of the weekly session at the Peninsula Public Library in Lawrence, said St. John's, which has a branch in Santa Fe, N.M., was the only college in the nation with a curriculum offering no electives. The Lawrence course includes the works of Plato, Aristotle, Archimedes, Sophocles, Euclid and Homer, as well as the Old and New Testaments, plays by Shakespeare and Moliere and ancient Greek, Roman and Icelandic epics and sagas. Some of the ancient classics studied at the Annapolis campus have to be imported from there since they are not available in local libraries. ''If the Founding Fathers of this nation were to come back to life,'' Mr. Hoffman said, ''they would find that only St. John's of Annapolis provides the same kind of curriculum that they undertook in their college days.'' Students at St. John's - the third oldest college in the nation - pay $9,000 a year in tuition and fees.",1982-08-22T05:00:00+0000

But there were also those who seemed to be in their 30's and 40's and 50's, and there were a few teen-agers and virtually all of them clapped when the music was syncopated and looked wistful - perhaps tearful - when it was lilting and slow.

The next day, the unseen Administration official whose job it is to bring the President's vocabulary into sharper focus - akin to the fellow in the circus who follows the elephants with brush and pail - told The New York Times that ''the President should have said he was 'hopeful' rather than 'optimistic' at his news conference.'' (I stubbornly use the old-fashioned press conference; the White House, fearing that press does not cover the electronic media, and eager to impress the world that the conference is a Presidential device to make news - not an institution belonging to the scribblers - uses news conference. That was Ron Ziegler's only permanent victory.)",1982-08-22T05:00:00+0000

Expert after expert agrees that nothing hurts a child more than to hurry him - except, of course, to hold him back. This is as true for girls as for boys. And yet today's parents seemingly are urged to teach their baby the trivia - math at 9 months, the alphabet at 2 years, and please, let him read before kindergarten. At the same time it has become the custom to keep a child young, by doing for him what he would be proud - or at least willing - to do for himself. Both techniques are contrary to nature.

In June 30, in San Diego, Benjamin H.

It has been almost 10 years since that kind of crime was last arraigned in an American court, and just its mention summons up the almost-forgotten language of an age when it seemed such crimes would have no end: registration, classification, re-classification, deferment and induction; 1-A, 2-S, 3-A and 4-F; hawks, doves, pigs, gooks, straights, freaks, frags and dodgers; General Hershey and general strike; ''Not With My Life, You Don't''; ''Hell No, We Won't Go,'' and ''You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.''

''Shore birds'' is a catch-all term encompassing four or five families of long-legged North American birds, most of them colored in combinations of black, brown and white, that range in size from just under five inches to just over two feet from the tips of their bills to their toes.

A cooperative conversion is planned for the building and the ''red herring'' is already out. ... K.B., Freeport, L.I. Answer: According to several lawyers, yours is a difficult situation and a court action is probably the only way to determine the answer. That fact that you have been living in the apartment as a roommate of the lessee for 10 years does not mean that the owner has to include your name on the lease. That the rent has been paid out of a joint account does not necessarily mean the landlord has accepted your tenancy, especially if there is no evidence that he knows you are living in the apartment and thus no evidence that he has accepted you, implicitly or explicitly, as a tenant.

Whatver the medium - whispery taffeta or silk, supple satin or leather, soft wool or knit - European designers have a special knack for shaping strong silhouettes. So it is no surprise that for this fall season, when designers everywhere are emphasizing the feminine form by shaping clothes close to the body, those from Paris, Milan and London are especially dramatic. But what will make many of these clothes particularly appealing for the fashion-conscious customer is that so many of them are also quite wearable, something that is not always the case. In Milan, the collections of Ferre, Fendi and Krizia were singled out for special praise by the professionals. And in Paris, all of the superstars, from Saint Laurent and Lagerfeld to Sonia Rykiel and Kenzo, were acclaimed for their originality. -CARRIE DONOVAN D Saint Laurent's rustling taffeta ballgown, delineated with ruffles.",1982-08-29T05:00:00+0000
