us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Former Children,"In Reluctant Witnesses: Children's Voices From the Civil War (Westview, $24), Emmy E. Werner lets children tell what it was like to fight and endure the first modern war. As many as 400,000 children and adolescents served in the armies of the Civil War, the youngest as drummers and bugle boys, the older ones as soldiers. Many more suffered as civilians. Much of what they say in battlefield letters, diaries and memoirs from the safe harbor of old age is an unsurprising rehash -- war has always brought privation, terror, compassion and death. Yet even in war, children see things their own way. Flushed out of a berry patch by the noise of artillery, a 13-year-old from Gettysburg views a battle perched on a rail fence until waves of troops swarm over a hill toward him and he scoots home. An Atlanta boy looks out an upstairs window to see famished Union troops ravishing the fruit from his family's grapevines like ''a flock of hungry bluebirds.'' The best stories are the least-told tales of former slave children, particularly Susie King, who spent much of the war in a Union camp teaching emancipated children and soldiers to read. Unlike other combatants, whose war began in exhilaration and often ended in despair, hers began in fear and ended in hope. Werner, a developmental psychologist at the University of California, Davis, has written several books on the resilience of children. This one is too much a collection of quotations, providing only a lean meal. However, these voices make an important point: when both sides fight on home soil, there are no victors.

Seamus's 17-year-old daughter, Tory, who hasn't seen her father in years, flies from America to Dublin to attend his funeral -- and the boozy wake -- in order to make a final peace with him. Instead, the two are caught up in a hilarious, breathless ride across Ireland, pursued by mysterious kidnappers. Dick Wimmer, who created Seamus in an earlier novel, ''Irish Wine,'' has brought him back in BOYNE'S LASSIE (Zoland, paper, $12), complete with his endless thirst for Guinness, his roaring love of life and his captivating Irish brogue. Tory is no less a distinctive character, an engaging and enthusiastic match for her dad -- even when he's disguised as a monk and blasting across the countryside on his flashy American motorcycle. Their reunion brings a true reversal of fortune (and eventually reconciliation) as Tory gets under the skin of the man she has been ''creating'' in her mind ''out of newspaper clippings and magazine articles'' and a few glorious childhood memories. Wimmer is a master of voice, expertly playing Seamus's middle-aged blarney against Tory's coming-of-age bleat in this wonderful -- though teasingly short -- comic novel.

On August 3, 1998, surrounded by her loving family, she passed gracefully away in Key Biscayne, Florida. Throughout her life she enjoyed modern and classical dance, theatre, music and art both vicariously and personally. Few people loved culture so and devoted as much time and effort to making art, dance, and music available to the community at large as did Sylvia Ortner, a founder and one of the first Presidents of the Five Towns Music and Arts Foundation. A native New Yorker, she moved to Woodmere, Long Island in the 1940's and through the Foundation brought opera divas, artists, musicians, and writers to the suburbs. For two years she studied at Teacher's College Columbia University. A lifelong educator & proponent of Progressive Education, she first worked at the Little Red Schoolhouse, then served as Principal of the Ethical Culture School, and later taught at the Brandeis School in Lawrence, Long Island. Her specialty and passion was teaching reading to the very young and instilling in them a love of books and literature. She also studied at the Traphagen School of Design and applied her talent in art and design as an interior decorator. Her homes were distinguished by their grace, beauty and truly remarkable openness. Friends, neighbors, even strangers were welcomed with enthusiasm and generosity. Her tireless energy and insatiable zest for life will be long remembered by her family and her many many friends. Sylvia never stopped learning and growing. At the age of fifty she returned to Hofstra University and took great pride in participating in graduation ceremonies & receiving her belated Bachelor of Arts. Within herself Sylvia lived with obdurate dignity in a time & place when a woman could walk down Central Park West wearing white gloves and a pearl necklace. She is survived by her two devoted children Peter Bruce and Toni Ortner and her three much beloved grandchildren: Lisa Michelle Lampe, Lian Margaret Ortner, and Katherine Mao Qun Ortner. The family will celebrate Sylvia's life on August 10th and 11th, and receive visitors at their summer cottage in Southold, New York.",1998-08-04T05:00:00+0000

In the 1960's, Sergio Mendes prolonged America's affection for the bossa nova by meshing Brazilian rhythms with songs like ''Fool on the Hill'' and ''The Look of Love.'' More recently, on albums including ''Brasileiro'' (Elektra) and ''Oceano'' (Verve Forecast), he has drawn his material from Brazil's best songwriters.

With a slight leap of the imagination, a visitor can go back to an earlier era. The people in the park are an unassuming lot, 9-to-5'ers out for a smoke, men killing time on benches. Although the grass has been reseeded, there is something scruffy, even Hopper-esque, about the place. Keeping Conkling company in a southward vigil are other bronzed shades: Adm. David Farragut, who captured New Orleans for the Union during the Civil War; William Seward, Lincoln's Secretary of State, who is perhaps enjoying a last laugh over his ''folly'' of purchasing Alaska, and the dapper, mutton-chopped Chester Arthur, the 21st President.

Becky Pate, one of the testers, says 15 percent are utter failures. * Like? ''Black-Bean Blinis.'' Sounded good, says Pate, but they came out as grayish-green hockey pucks with ''the texture of leather.'' * ''Campground Soup'' was made using dehydrated chicken and dried peaches. ''It smelled horrible and tasted the same,'' says Pate. * And then there was ''Snappy the Snapper,'' an attempt to home-cook an entire 15-pound red snapper.

It's the summer of 1963 and North's parents have taken off for Europe, dumping her with her cousin Dee's family at Glass Lake. Drag-racing, motorboats, boys at the yacht club -- this summer should be fun. But it isn't. Dee's father, Uncle Judd, a plastic surgeon who exhales a boozy odor of well-fed ruthlessness, sneaks into North's room at night. He also cajoles her into going for rides in his Stingray and, between kisses and threats, photographs her in compromising ways. North grasps wildly for a tactful means of escape. Jackie would know what to do. In OH, JACKIE (Story Line, $19.95), Maudy Benz, an editor, writer and performance artist, tells North's story with tenderness and impressive control. The dancing surfaces of sports cars and lake water, the clink of a highball glass in Uncle Judd's sweaty hand, make the novel buzz with tension. In a strangely emblematic moment, North is pushed off a high diving tower by Dee's boyfriend, Shrimp; when she plunges feet first through the airless void of the lake, the surface appears above her, as promising yet remote as her glittery idol.

He founded & directed the Martin Luther King Health Center in the Bronx, which was one of the first community health centers in the country and was a model for providing healthcare to the poor which is in use to the present day. Harold taught us that healthcare needs to be delivered in people friendly settings in communities; as opposed to in hospital settings. He developed the concepts of the community health worker and the healthcare team. Harold was an early pioneer of family centered healthcare. He founded the Valentine Lane Health Practice, one of the first health practices to use collaboration between medical and psychosocial providers.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Manet Under Steam,"First exhibited in 1874, Edouard Manet's painting ''The Gare Saint-Lazare'' depicts a young woman with a book in her hands and a puppy in her lap, and a child who gazes into the distance, her back to the viewer. Through a background of black railings, the viewer glimpses railway tracks, a cloud of smoke and steam and, in the distance, some roughly sketched house facades. ''What had remained unrecognized,'' Juliet Wilson-Bareau writes in MANET, MONET, AND THE GARE SAINT-LAZARE (National Gallery of Art/Yale University Press, $45), ''was that the sketchy architectural details in the upper left corner of the picture are in fact a precise depiction of the front door and one of the windows of the studio into which Manet moved in July 1872.'' Thus the exact site of the painting is identifiable, which in turn yields new interpretations. Wilson-Bareau, a freelance curator, notes that several other Impressionists painted the station at around the same time as Manet, most notably Claude Monet and Gustave Caillebotte. But Manet's aims ''were more complex than theirs,'' she writes. ''He both presents and obscures the 'reality' of his scenes, disdaining to clarify the storytelling elements that he despised in the history and genre painting so popular in his day.'' The book also explores Manet's long and troubled relationship with the Salon, a state-run annual exhibition from which he was often excluded. It is a fascinating and valuable work of scholarship.

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Looking Back Sideways,"Characters grapple with the complexities of loss and acculturation in THE STORE OF A MILLION ITEMS (Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12), a collection of 11 spare yet fervidly inventive short stories by the Jamaican-American writer Michelle Cliff. Several center on racial dynamics in unexpected ways. In a story called ''Transactions,'' a pale, pale-eyed salesman wants a child even though his ''brown-skinned'' wife emphatically does not. Acting on impulse at a squalid roadside shanty somewhere in the West Indies, the man buys a blond, blue-eyed toddler from her impoverished, German-speaking mother for $20 -- and discovers that his wish to ''never be lonely again'' is still a painfully long way from being fulfilled. For the characters in many of Cliff's stories, melancholy memories warp the present with a fun-house-mirror effect. (In one, a New York woman is gripped by concentric, near-hallucinatory remembrances of two dead friends.) Also spread throughout the stories are starkly drawn but vividly imagined passages that read like prose poems -- as in the title story, when the speaker recalls how the lushly stocked 1950's New York dime store of her youth brought shoppers ''as close to infinity as we dared,'' and in the story that catalogues the possessions of Julia Bulette, a real-life Virginia City prostitute, after her mysterious murder during the Gold Rush. Throughout ''The Store of a Million Items,'' Cliff displays a dazzling array of subjects, presented with the precision and finesse of one who knows her literary stock backward and forward.

The members, who included Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Duncan Grant and Clive Bell, met for an evening meal and then read aloud papers that were usually autobiographical. The only condition imposed was absolute honesty, which for Vanessa Bell meant that certain matters, among them her complicated love life, were never broached (she was married to Clive Bell, whom she never divorced, though she lived for most of her life with Grant, who was homosexual). Still, in spite of some obvious omissions, as well as a lifelong habit of expressing herself less through words than through her sensitive drawings and paintings (a selection of which have been reproduced), these writings come as a delightful surprise. Intimate and unpretentious, wry and often gaily mischievous, they tell of her progress from childhood to maturity, describing the birth of early Bloomsbury and the heady freedom of breaking with the Victorian past. There are memories of trips to Paris (and stiff luncheon parties with the art dealer Ambroise Vollard) and of her first impressions of meeting the art critic Roger Fry, whom she later took as her lover. Interestingly, as both the book's editor, the Italian art historian Lia Giachero, who has written a brief appraisal of Bell's art, and Bell's daughter, Angela Garnett, who has contributed a lively introduction, point out, what Bell does not speak of is the urgency of her own artistic search. One wonders if perhaps this was not out of deference to her brilliant, silver-tongued sister, Virginia Woolf, with whom, she says, she vowed, from the nursery on, never to compete.

They fear Mr. Curtis will satirize them all as louche 20-somethings, known for their trust funds, drug-taking and love of rasta music. In real life, Notting Hill is home not only to trustafarians, but also to fashionable figures like Jade Jagger, daughter of Mick Jagger; Helen Fielding, author of ''Bridget Jones's Diary,'' and Nicholas Coleridge, of Conde Nast U.K. The most recent hot spots of Notting Hill, once a small artisan community, include the American restaurant Dakota (Madonna has already had two parties there); the Tabernacle, which imported Allegra McEvedy from New York's TriBeCa Grill to be the head chef, and the Pharmacie, owned by Sir Terence Conran. ''The anxiety is that the popularity of the film will attract crowds, who will drive out all that is bohemian and eclectic and replace it with money and the banal,'' said Philip Delves Broughton, a Notting Hill homeowner.

us,PULSE: LONDON EDITION; The Bloke Look,"Suiting up in London used to be simple: bankers went to Savile Row, salesclerks to Marks & Spencer. But newly image-conscious young professionals want zippy suits with designer labels, like John Rocha's boldly colored, luxuriously lined, close-cut models (coming to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York in the fall). Owners are so attached to the new suits that they won't take them off for any occasion. After Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, eschewed white tie at a Mansion House dinner to deliver his annual speech about the economy, men started wearing suits instead of more formal attire to all kinds of upscale social functions. At London weddings, it is now more chic to exchange the traditional heavy black tailcoat for a tonic suit, in two-tone linen or silk, made by Jigsaw, due to open a branch in New York in the fall (prices start at $480).",1998-08-16T05:00:00+0000

More recently, news of the growing number of mixed-race Americans has inspired the political center with a vision of a true racial melting pot, one in which white and black alike will blend into a universal brown. But a closer look at demographic trends suggests that neither of these futures -- a nonwhite majority, a uniformly beige society -- will very likely come to pass.

us,CHILDREN'S BOOKS; Look What the Cats Brought Home,"Tomi Ungerer, the Peck's Bad Boy of children's book publishing, was once described as ''Jean de Brunhoff and Eugene Ionesco, together in one body.'' Indeed, with his mordant European wit, his sly textual puns and his penchant for animal characters drawn with a beguiling casualness, he has had his share of brilliant successes -- ''The Beast of Monsieur Racine,'' ''The Three Robbers,'' ''Moon Man'' and the perennial favorite ''Crictor.'' But in his more than 100 books, he has also had some spectacular flops, like the much-argued-about ''No Kiss for Mother.'' Ungerer's unsentimental -- indeed, antisentimental -- books have always fared well in Europe, perhaps even better than here in America. I fear that FLIX (Tomi Co/Roberts Rinehart, $16.95; ages 4 and up) is one of those Ungerer productions that will be better received abroad. In ''Flix'' a happily married cat couple are expecting a baby. Noticeably pregnant (or, as Ungerer says, ''profusely bulging''), the wife is ''seized by contractions'' and driven to the hospital. And there she gives birth to . . . a dog. The rest of the book is about how Flix -- the dog baby in a cat family -- grows up battling a predictable course of prejudice, and winning. In the end he marries another dog, and she, ''bulging with new life,'' is similarly seized by contractions and gives birth to . . . a cat. Alas, Ungerer, who has always fought against bias in his cartoons and adult work and championed the underdogs (no ''Flix'' pun intended) in his children's books, has been hoist by his own good intentions. He works so hard at his anti-racial-bias message that he ends up working in some of his own. For example, even growing up in an all-feline family, Flix speaks cat ''uttered with a dog accent.'' Why? Because dogs, no matter with whom they are raised, still sound like dogs? I'd hate to follow that argument into human society. Then the father cat explains the mystery of the birth: ''His grandmother was reputed to have been secretly married to a pug, and now, generations later . . . here was the result! 'It is a genetic mishap!' '' Ditto. Perhaps I am placing too much knee-jerk correctness on the shoulders of what is, after all, a simple picture book. However, it is clear that Ungerer is going for a Picture Book With Meaning. Which means that readers of whatever age need to look at it with as clear and unsentimental an eye as Ungerer himself has had in the past. JANE YOLEN",1998-08-16T05:00:00+0000

Now Ms. Khan (left) is introducing a line of Western clothes inspired by Pakistani dress: floor-length sequined cocktail dresses in heavy woven fabrics; dyed silk brocade coat dresses, chiffon cardigan wraps. Not all are as modest as Muslim law requires: some dresses come in shorter lengths and have halter necks. Ms. Khan said she wanted ''to design clothes that are sufficiently modest for me, but are still feminine and smart.'' The Cross and A la Mode, the boutiques that carry Jemima Khan, sold out in a week, and the racks remain empty.

Born March 25, 1917, in Nautreni, Latvia, the daughter of Joachims and Helena (Mugins) Mickans. Her life and work reflected the fate of her beloved country. As a young woman, she graduated from Rezeknes Teacher's College with highest honors. Her intellectual and emotional energies were directed to building a strong and democratic Latvia. During the horrors of the Soviet and Nazi occupations, she continued her work until forced to flee. As a displaced person she came to the realization that her contribution to the general welfare of humanity lay in the study of medicine. Again, under the most difficult of conditions, she completed her dental and medical degrees, graduating from the University of Munich with highest honors. In 1951, she arrived in New York and interned at Greenpoint Hospital, Brooklyn. She completed her residency in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital. For the next almost four decades, she worked as a staff psychiatrist for the Catholic Charities Guidance Institute; the Bureau of Child Guidance, NYC Board of Education, Psychiatrist, Family Court, NYC; and as a psychoanalyst for the American Institute of Psychoanalysis as well as the Karen Horney Clinic. She was a Fellow of the American Geriatrics Society and of the American Acadmy of Psychoanalysis. Her memberships included the AMA; American Psychiatric Association, Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis, the New York Council of Child Psychiatry and the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy. Her commitment to Latvia was reflected in her ever generous support of Latvian organizations and philanthropies in the diaspora. Since 1991, her great energies were directed to supporting educational endeavors in the newly free Latvian Republic. A deep religiosity informed her life and work. She is survived by cousins in Latvia, her beloved godson Mikelis Svilans (Ottawa, Canada) and many, many friends. She is lovingly remembered by Dr. Rita D'Angelo and Dr. Astrida I.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths  BYERS, DAVID","BYERS-David. 77. A nationallyknown architectural and decorative arts consultant and a muchadmired contributor to the social and cultural life of Atlanta-and wherever he landed in his travelsdied of heart failure August 19 at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital. A gentleman of wry, good humor, when asked what he did, Mr. Byers would answer, ''I help people with their problems. That is, their interior design needs''. His knowledge of the decorative arts was encyclopedic, spanning several centuries in England, the Continent and America. His energy was indefatigable as he journeyed around the country for his clients. His rooms were so admired that he assisted several generations of the same family in bringing elegance, beauty, comfort and magic to their homes. Based in Atlanta, Mr. Byers worked in decorative arts for more than 40 years, first at the W.E. Browne Decorating Company and then in private practice. During those years, he was a consultant to hundreds of private residences across the country and for numerous landmarks. They include The White House, Washington, D.C., (1970s); Diplomatic Reception Rooms, State Department, Washington, D.C. (1970s); Georgia Governor's Mansion, Atlanta; Mississippi Governor's Mansion, Jackson; The Boston Atheneum; Wright Stanley House, New Bern, N.C.; Edgewater, Barrytown, N.Y.; Roper House, Charleston, S.C.; Villa Albicini, Macon, Ga.; and the Baltimore Block Headquarters of the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation. Mr. Byers assisted the Metropolitan Museum of Art with a 19th century furniture exhibition in 1968. He also designed the installation of the Philip Shutze Collection in the Edward H. Inman House at the Atlanta History Center. His rooms have been featured in Classic Atlanta and on the cover of The Most Beautiful Rooms in America. In spite of his work on these noteworthy assignments, Mr. Byers was always modest about his projects. Born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland, Mr. Byers was the younger son of Dr. and Mrs. Horace Byers. He studied architecture at the University of Virginia. He became a resident of Atlanta in 1945 when he joined the W.E. Browne Decorating Company. Mr. Byers retired as a shareholder and vice president when the noted Peachtree Street decorating company began to close in the late 1980s. Throughout his life, he was an ardent supporter of the Decorative Arts Trust and served on its board. Mr. Byers is survived by his sister, Shirley Byers of Baltimore, Maryland, and his cousins, friends and clients throughout the South and the nation. Memorial donations can be made to the David R. Byers Fund, Decorative Arts Trust, 106 Bainbridge Street, Philadelphia, PA 19147. A memorial service will be held at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 26 at All Saints Episcopal Church, 634 West Peachtree Street, Atlanta. Historical H.M.

Hawk appeared to be memorizing the profile of a woman in a little black dress who was sipping a cosmopolitan at the near end of the bar and eating cashews and thinking, ''Thank God it's Friday.''

us,Books in Brief: Fiction; Keeper of the Findspot,"In 1863, during the heroic age of amateur archeology, a Frenchman named Champoiseau unearthed a Hellenistic statue of Nike on the island of Samothrace. Headless and armless, the Winged Victory was whisked away to the Louvre to take its place among the great icons of the Western classical tradition. But what of Samothrace, an Aegean outpost at the nervous northeastern edge of modern Greece? Photi Anthropotis, the hero of NIKE (Houghton Mifflin, $20), Nicholas Flokos's witty first novel, is the keeper of the ruined sanctuary at the ''findspot'' on Samothrace, and he is obsessed with the island's loss. ''Is our Nike a shoe for basketball,'' he demands, ''or our almost sacred heirloom?'' The local people take up a collection to send him to Paris: ''We await an Orpheus. For more than a century, we have awaited an Orpheus. A Jason even. What we have is Photi, courteous, sorrowful, unlucky. His name rhymes with Quixote.'' Returning to Samothrace without the Nike (they didn't expect him to steal it, just get over it), Photi finds the place recolonized by Susanna Regas, an American ''woman of learning, of PBS,'' who is famous for making documentary films about ''the heroic but pathetic stories behind the world's revered artworks.'' After she meets Photi, her project becomes more ambitious: how would he like to star in the actual repatriation of the Nike, which she will film live as it happens? Told in a wry, first-person plural reminiscent of a Greek chorus and filled with sly references to modern literature (''in dreams begins responsibility''), Photi's sad tale is spun out -- but more as farce than as tragedy.

us,Fall's Big Stories,"Like fashion itself, fashion photography is subject to trends, and one of the most recent has been an interest in narrative, in a series of pictures that tells a story. More often than not, the scenario is a sketchy, boy-meets-girl kind of thing, with an outcome that's fairly predictable. What would it be like, we wondered, to start with a real text by a well-known author -- to illustrate a plot instead of implying it, to read the dialogue between the characters?

What is less remembered is that after defeating the French, Henry grew fearful the enemy was resuming attack. ''Then every soldier kill his prisoners,'' Henry orders in the play.

us,Books in Brief: Nonfiction; Mysteries of Seeing,"Famously dissed by Picasso as a lightweight painter and long underappreciated, Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947) has made a comeback in the years since his death, a case made persuasively in BONNARD (Abrams, $60). Sarah Whitfield, the curator of this Bonnard exhibition, focuses on Bonnard's life, influences and stylistic development. She explains the cultural forces that shaped his work, carefully building a link, for example, between the literary figures of the day -- particularly the Symbolist poet Stephane Mallarme -- and Bonnard's elusive, often abstract, presentation of objects and his use of indistinct shapes to heighten the mystery of seeing. And she traces the deep and surprising role of Bonnard's longtime lover and model, Marthe de Meligny; among other things, we learn that the increasingly reclusive Marthe suffered from a mysterious, debilitating disease, probably asthma or tuberculosis, for which hydrotherapy was a popular treatment at the time. That may help explain why she is depicted so often washing herself or lying in a bathtub, and the sense of isolation and melancholy that infuse many of the later paintings. In his essay, John Elderfield, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, explores Bonnard's visual vocabulary and the viewer's sensory experience of perception. In meticulous, often scientific, detail he decodes Bonnard's use of color, perspective and other devices in his optical bag of tricks. In the end, of course, it's the paintings that make the most eloquent case for Bonnard's greatness, and they are luminously reproduced here -- 273 illustrations, 115 in color. The final pages are dominated by haunting self-portraits, alongside Bonnard's frank declaration that he wanted his paintings ''to show what one sees when one enters a room all of a sudden.''

Professor of Italian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley since 1981 died Monday, August 24, 1998 after two years of a courageous struggle with cancer. He is survived by his devoted wife and son, Rita and Giovanni of Berkeley, California, and in Italy by his loving mother, two brothers and a sister. He was a native of Italy (Sassuolo) where in 1956 he graduated from the University of Modena with a doctoral degree in Jurisprudence. He came to the USA in 1957 and here he continued his studies in Political Science and then in humane letters, earning the Ph.D. Degree in Romance Languages & Literature at The Johns Hopkins University (1964). Before joining the faculty at UC, Berkeley, he had taught at Cornell University and The University of Texas (Austin). A brilliant teacher and lecturer, much admired and beloved by his students, Professor Biasin was also a scholar and critic of international fame; during his academic career he received signal honors from several European and American centers of learning. In addition, he was passionately active in reaching out to the San Francisco and Bay Area ItalianAmerican community at large. In this respect, he was a frequent speaker, elegant, accessible and informative, at S.F.'s Institute of Italian Culture and at socio-cultural clubs such as ''The Cenacolo'' and ''The Leonardo da Vinci Society''. He was no less passionate about good food and the Italian cuisine, attested by the fact that he was the chief delegate of the San Francisco chapter of Italy's prestigious Accademia della Cucina. Indeed, the theme of food in literature was central to a number of his highly original and illuminating critical studies. But his range of thematic interests was wide, as can be seen by his perceptive use of interdisciplinary approaches and methods in his many writings, beginning with his very first book, ''The Smile of the Gods'' (1968).

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: Nonfiction; Life and After Life,"During his long and eventful career, John G. Morris operated at the heart of 20th-century photojournalism, working as a picture editor for Life, Magnum, The Washington Post, The New York Times and National Geographic. In the late 1940's, The Ladies' Home Journal, a less obvious member of that fraternity, gave him a base from which to hire photographers like Robert Capa, Martin Muncacsi and Lisette Model. In 1948 he ran a series, ''People Are People the World Over,'' photographed largely by Magnum photographers, which inspired Edward Steichen's renowned ''Family of Man'' exhibition. Morris begins his memoir, Get the Picture: A Personal History of Photojournalism (Random House, $30), not with his childhood but with his path to Life magazine. Before he ends his story in Paris, where he moved in 1983, he weaves several photographers, anecdotes, players, history and a credo or two into an engaging and informative tale. Not surprisingly, this veteran of photojournalism's glory days sees a decline in recent years, not in the committed, courageous and excellent photography still produced, but in editors and publishers who pander to focus groups and celebrity mania and do not provide outlets for photo reportage. Morris, an unapologetic humanist, believes in the persuasive power of images and discusses in some detail his efforts over the years to strengthen the role of photography in journalism. Despite his losses -- wives, friends, employment -- and the many frustrations of an often thankless and unheralded job, the 81-year-old Morris is an optimistic and amusing raconteur.

And rather than leave the artifacts on a shelf in his house, he wanted to create a place where others could see them. So he set about enlisting the support of other local collectors, and on Aug. 14, 1928, the Robert Abbe Museum of Stone Age Antiquities opened in a quiet glen near here at the edge of Acadia National Park -- an event Mr. Abbe himself did not live to see; he had died a few months before.",1998-08-30T05:00:00+0000

Dr. DeAnsin Parker, a psychotherapist and the founder of the Goodson Parker Wellness Center, a gym and health club at 30 East 76th Street visited by fit celebrities like Elle Macpherson, Kyra Sedgwick and Yasmeen Ghauri, is taking the craze for mind-and-body mergence a step further than power yoga. Using Myers-Briggs test questions (''Are you usually a good mixer or quiet and reserved?''), Dr. Parker offers hourlong sessions, for $200, to classify clients into one of four personality types -- and matches them to a workout that she says is ''spiritually appropriate.'' For an introverted-integrated personality type, who likes to function on multiple levels, she suggests sports with complex circular movements, like golf. For a concrete personality type, who needs to see results and statistics, a treadmill is what the doctor orders. But some Jungian experts believe it takes more than an hour to classify a personality type. ''Jung wouldn't like it,'' said Paul Wink, a psychology professor at Wellesley College.

What's most important about this scene, set in a Federal court in New York in 1986, however, is the fact that Zola Taylor is the widow of Frankie Lymon, the pop singer who wrote the 1950's doo-wop hit ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love?''

He was ready for something new, and it was precisely this sort of trip that had borne fruit in the past. Not only had he spent time in South Carolina to soak up the Gullah rhythms and dialect when he was writing ''Porgy and Bess,'' but in 1928 he had been stimulated by Parisian taxi horns to write ''An American in Paris,'' and in 1932 a sojourn in Havana had inspired the ''Cuban Overture.''",1998-08-30T05:00:00+0000

us,BOOKS IN BRIEF: Nonfiction; Daddy Was a Pontoon Bridge,"Current American fiction has not been lacking in its awareness of television's grim effect on families, but nowhere has this theme been exploited quite so well as in Curtis White's new novel, MEMORIES OF MY FATHER WATCHING TV (Dalkey Archive, paper, $12.50). Chapters are constructed around classic programs of the 1950's and 60's like ''Bonanza'' and ''Highway Patrol,'' and the son's narration is constantly interrupted by words spoken by characters on the screen, plausible-sounding stage directions from the programs' scripts and other such static interference. The father, a TV addict, has been reduced to a stream of hallucinations that do not quite add up to a mind; but the son and his two sisters are, if anything, even worse off. If the father imagines he's become a pontoon bridge that the characters in ''Combat'' must destroy before the Nazis use it, the son at one point complains that he can't find his left hand. (The father's response: ''Call the F.B.I.'') The sisters are desperate: one seems to be delivering an endless monologue to no one in particular, while the other keeps walking back and forth between the TV set and her father in an unsuccessful bid for his attention. The son makes frequent reference to his own ''intellectual performance'' (he uses words like ''proaeresis''), but his erudition is, so to speak, all in his head. In the ''Sea Hunt'' chapter, supposedly spending the summer of 1963 at the Nassau Trauma Center with his mother -- who is under the impression that her unhappy husband has been underwater for several months in scuba gear -- he tells a nurse that '' 'trauma' is German for dream.''
