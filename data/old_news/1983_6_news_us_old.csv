This is indeed an audience and it is capable of some enlargement as devotees pass the word along to friends of like mind. A prolific writer - and Sam Shepard is certainly that, turning out new work yearly - may find productions of his plays on the increase, especially in regional theaters. He may also find his playing-time being extended here and there, while one or another of his pieces may come up with a prize, sometimes a prestigious one.

Even at the height of his reputation, Wood had plenty of detractors. In 1935, his landscapes were assailed by the critic Lewis Mumford as ''unmitigatedly bad,'' and the regionalist, American Scene approach he represented - along with John Steuart Curry, Thomas Hart Benton and others - was described by the modernist painter Stuart Davis as ''reactionary'' and ''sentimental.''",1983-06-17T05:00:00+0000

After he came off the 18th green with a 2-under-par 69, a red number one, matching the color of his slacks, was next to his name.

LIKE the Hollywood Nathanael West pictured in ''The Day of the Locust,'' Toby Olson's ''Seaview,'' an imaginary Cape Cod golf course and beach area, is a place in which disparate American characters come together to live, play and die. Here the apocalyptic confrontation takes the form not of a riot of movie fans, but rather of a small-scale war engaged in by golfers, golf course workers, Indians who lay claim to the links, a motorcycle gang, armed handglider enthusiasts, troops from a nearby Air Force station and a group of nude sunbathers. Even a remarkable dreamer of nightmares like West might have been hard-pressed to top the book's finale - a scene in which two former friends meet in a Western-style showdown, one armed with a gun, the other with a golf club and balls. What makes these various absurdist encounters doubly odd is that the story they conclude begins and develops so quietly and meditatively that it seems, in retrospect, to belong to a different sort of book entirely.",1983-06-19T05:00:00+0000

us,DIOXIN IS ONLY NEW JERSEY'S LATEST ENVIRONMENTAL HEADACHE,"TO the litany of Newark's many urban ills was recently added an environmental one: dioxin contamination. The byproduct of the manufacture of herbicides, dioxin is one of the deadliest chemicals known to man. Readings of one part per billion are considered hazardous to health. On the three-acre grounds of a Newark factory that produced the defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, dioxin ranging up to 1,200 parts per billion was found earlier this month. A chemical waste treatment plant next door had levels between 3.7 parts per billion and 15 parts per billion. In a check of homes in the surrounding Ironbound neighborhood, however, a level of 0.2 parts per billion - considered too low to be alarming - was recorded in dust in a vacuum cleaner bag. Traces of dioxin were also discovered in a defunct Edison herbicide plant and yesterday, Governor Kean reported that more of the chemical had been found at a Clifton fragrance plant employing 300 people and located near a grammar school in a residential neighborhood. The Governor said the Diamond Shamrock Company, successor to the company which operated the Newark factory, would pay for tarpaulins to be spread across the site to prevent further exposure to the chemical. Still, seven people, including two former employees, and two food distributors forced to curtail operations in the area have filed what might be the first of many lawsuits over the chemical. And of course, dioxin is just one of a series of vexing environmental problems that have cropped up in the nation's most densely populated state in recent years.",1983-06-19T05:00:00+0000

By way of evidence, the Pratt Graphics Center, 160 Lexington Avenue, at 30th Street, is presenting ''Architecture in Contemporary Prints,'' a show of work done since 1970 by some 75 printmakers, including Christo, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Philip Pearlstein and Robert Rauschenberg .",1983-06-24T05:00:00+0000

us,"CITIES, BE STREET-SMART: LEAVE PEDDLERS BE","Mayor Koch's campaign to ban all street vending downtown reflects a historical hostility toward peddlers. Mr. Koch and mayors throughout the country have sought to justify harsh regulation of vending on grounds of health, safety and ease of circulation. However, the actual intent of such regulation is more often related to the protection of local businesses, the physical appearance of the vendors and racial or ethnic bias. In fact, the experience in several cities, including Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, indicates that vinding, innovatively controlled, can actually provide a wide range of benefits for merchants, shoppers and the city itself. A primary benefit of peddling is that it draws shoppers and tourists as well as downtown employees into the downtown shopping area. The personality of the vendor, the uniqueness of the cart and wares all help to create a distinctive character and vitality appealing to shoppers. Vendors also provide services not usually offered in stores. An office worker on a short break can pick up a quick lunch and still have time to do shopping. Others find fresh produce and flowers to take home in the evening or a low priced gift for a fellow employee. Equally important is the fact that peddlers are a security presence on the street. New Orleans merchants describe how vendors are ''eyes on the street.'' In New York City and Newark, N.J., there have been numerous instances in which vendors have apprehended pickpockets or purse-snatchers and held them until the police arrived.",1983-06-25T05:00:00+0000

us,FORMER OFFICIALS VENT ANGER AT LARGE,"''I thought, like Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, that I'd be coming to watch my own funeral,'' said one at-large member of the New York City Council last week. Reports of his political demise, and that of the at-large system, were not exaggerated. Under a Federal court ruling, the eight boroughwide members - two others have already resigned - lost their jobs when the Charter Revision Commission recommended that the seats be abolished. The commission was appointed by Mayor Koch after the election of two at-large members from each borough regardless of population differences was ruled a violatation of the Constitution's one man, one vote principle. The recommendation will be put before the voters in November. If they don't concur - an event considered improbable - the Mayor said the courts would be likely to eliminate the positions anyway. The seats were created in 1963 to provide minority parties with a greater Council role - no borough could elect two at-large members from the same party - and to give some representatives a broader constituency than a single district. But they came to be viewed by minority groups as a means of diluting their voting strength, a contention backed up by the panel, which noted that only one of the 50 at-large members elected during the past 20 years was a Hispanic politician and none were black. The panel considered various methods to preserve some sort of at-large system, but judged none satisfactory. ''Under the circumstances,'' said Michael I. Sovern, the commission chairman, ''to place a proposal for at-large representation on the ballot would be both unwise and provocative.''",1983-06-26T05:00:00+0000

Its principals are apt to be young and mainly artists themselves, the neighborhoods they're in are still hairy enough for the word ''dealer'' to have a double meaning, and the art they show - which includes some very prettied-up grafitti - tends to be flashier, more ''political'' and quicker in its appeal to a broader public than frequents Manhattan's more rarefied art zones.
