But most of the time, chants are familiar songs that have been adapted: You might take a melody from a song you like, and you might just mess around with the words. For example, fans of the Shamrock Rovers, a soccer club in the League of Ireland Premier Division, changed the chorus of Lykke Lis song I Follow Rivers to I, I, follow/I follow you, Shamrock Rovers. (The same club has also been known to chant the lyrics to Build Me Up Buttercup without changing the lyrics at all.

On a wide field, men are stooped over in agricultural labor. The field stretches a great distance back, ending in a line of trees that marks out the horizon. The men working the field are dressed all in white. They have long white sacks on their backs and white hats on their heads. Its hard to tell exactly how many of them there are, perhaps just under three dozen, but the four or five in front are distinct. These men in front, in addition to being dressed similarly, are stooped in unison. Their faces are very dark, devoid of detail.

Past a leather-trimmed bar called Jacques (as in the artist Jacques Majorelle, whose gardens are a treasure of Marrakesh, Morocco), the restaurant has 75 or so seats, about 20 of them in a compact, skylit garden, and a comfortable library/lounge with a fireplace is adjacent to the dining room. Charles Masson, one of the citys rare guardians of classic French cuisine and service, will run the restaurant. And, with Christian Delouvrier consulting and Mr. Massons input, the chef, Mario Fortuna, is creating a menu he described as marrying traditional French with the Mediterranean, even crossing the sea for an occasional taste of Morocco, with a tagine. Highlights include a rich onion tart, warm sausage with potatoes, risotto of wild mushrooms, bass with Champagne and caviar, and steak au poivre. There will be tableside service for carving a chicken for two and finishing a baba au rhum. The pastry chef, David Carmichael, will produce breads from grains milled in-house. You cant beat fresh flour for nutrition, he said. A bar menu has lighter fare like chicken liver mousse and ceviche, but its not above offering a hamburger.

The exhibition revisits the human ordeal of World War II through previously unknown images of life in one of the many ghettos the Nazis built to isolate Jews and streamline deportation to concentration camps. These images reflect the determination of Henryk Ross, a talented Polish Jewish photojournalist and a rare Lodz Ghetto survivor, to document what he called our martyrdom. Between 1940 and 1944, Ross took carefully staged fictions of ghetto life that served as Nazi propaganda, but he also secretly recorded the grim realities of what truly happened. As the war wound down, he buried 6,000 negatives in the ghetto, returning after Germanys surrender to find half intact. Ross eventually moved to Canada, where he died at 81 in 1991. In 2007, the Archive of Modern Conflict donated all of his negatives and contact prints to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, which organized this exhibition.

The Zeppo illustrates how different a show can be when a character that exists in the margins is brought to the center. Watching Sundays episode of The Good Fight, I couldnt help but wonder how different an episode would be if it took on the perspective of one of the black members of the firm.

A two-level restaurant serving Mexican food in a shiny new office building is hardly cookie-cutter Midtown, but Mr. Stupak is counting on his approach to the cuisine, filled unapologetically with American and other influences  he makes no claim to authenticity  appealing to the Midtown set. Everyone told me that I had to have a shrimp cocktail in Midtown, he said. I didnt think so. Instead, his freewheeling menu offers starters like crab nachos with sea urchin, chopped cabbage salad with toasted dried fava bean dressing, and nine different tacos, including a falafel one and another with spit-roasted beef that is a take on al pastor. Were using tacos as a gateway drug to get people to try other stuff, he said. Some larger plates, including roasted red prawns with chipotle, and fajitas with black pepper mole, round out the choices. The design for the 150-seat space, by Glen Coben in collaboration with Mr. Stupak, is airy and bright, with a big bar area and a more intimate dining room and open kitchen beyond. Upstairs, there are tables on the overhanging balcony and several private rooms. All are adorned with Mexican art pieces.

But it now comes highly recommended by locals for its growing food scene and small-town vibes despite steady gentrification. Its home to more than a few hipster and creative types, and on one quiet corner sits a charming restaurant to rival any Brooklyn eatery: Wm. Mulherins Sons, which gets its name from the 19th-century whisky bottling and blending company that once occupied the space. Nearly every ingredient on its menu is made in-house, right down to the flour blends for the homemade pizza crusts. (Bon Apptit named it one of the 50 best restaurants to open in 2016.) And now, you can sleep upstairs  in one of the four chic rooms Wm. Mulherins Sons just opened as a hotel. Theyre uniquely designed (and stocked with things like Kinfolk magazine and Aesop toiletries), and perfectly sized for longer stays (with full kitchens and even washing machines). The rooms are conveniently located above Wm. Mulherins Sons (for nightcaps) and around the corner from the La Colombe flagship (for morning coffee.) The most exciting part of your stay might just be checking in: Like at any old seaside pub, keys are simply doled out by anyone working the bar, so you can grab a pint before heading up to your room.

Most significant was the rule that changed the terms of victory. The winner was no longer the first team to score 21 runs, but the one that accrued the most runs after the end of nine innings. The reasoning behind the change was simple and logical: Fielding, which had been a stone-handed disaster during baseballs earliest days, had improved rapidly, making it hard for any one team to reach 21 before the sun went down.

Klinger, which features the testimony of several wrongfully convicted people. Scott Turow contributed an introduction, and the exonerees tales of false confessions, legal pitfalls and startling miscarriages of justice are told by prominent crime, mystery and thriller writers, including Lee Child and Sara Paretsky.

We pay chefs a fee to use their recipes, and they get royalties for sales, he said. Mr. De Baets was not forthcoming on the financial details because not all the chefs are paid the same amount, though each is guaranteed a minimum. The recipes will be featured for around three months, then other chefs dishes will rotate in. The first round will feature breakfast sandwiches from Alvin Cailan of Eggslut in Los Angeles; a ham-and-cheese on baguette from Eric Kayser; a burger from Jean-Georges Vongerichten; and duck rice from George Mendess Aldea menu. Linton Hopkins from Atlanta will offer a grain bowl, and there will also be Roman-style pizza by Magnus Hansson. At the spacious restaurant, done in creamy tile with glove-leather upholstery, customers order food at a counter and get a buzzer alert when its ready. Beer and wine are served. Mr. De Baets is considering expanding to other locations. (Opens Friday): 62 Spring Street (Lafayette Street), 646-438-9172, chefsclubcounter.com.",2017-03-28T21:26:06+0000

There was and is a creative opportunity in creating a new womens streetwear line not present in the mens market, says Jacob, who first moved from Stockholm to New York to intern for a creative agency before decamping to the West Coast. The brothers draw inspiration from the deep corners of the internet  as well as from people they find on Instagram, like the musical artist Tommy Genesis, an underground female rapper known for her rebellious attitude and lyrics. Though Brashy is geared toward female customers, some pieces in the collection  such as oversize hoodies, boxy jackets and roomy trousers  are intentionally gender-fluid. For us, streetwear should incorporate something of an anti-establishment ethos; establishment can of course be freely interpreted, Jacob says. The brands spring/summer 2017 collection  which is available now at Colette in Paris and on the Brashy Studios website  consists of a fluorescent-pink vinyl jacket and pants, a tearaway tracksuit and pieces emblazoned with the word GIRLS.

Derech means path in Hebrew, and off the derech, or O.T.D. for short, is how their ultra-Orthodox families and friends refer to them when they break away from these tight-knit, impermeable communities, as in: Did you hear that Shaindels daughter Rivkie is off the derech? I heard she has a smartphone and has been going to museums. So even though the term is burdened with the yoke of the very thing they are trying to flee, members remain huddled together under O.T.D. on their blogs and in their Facebook groups, where their favored hashtag is #itgetsbesser  besser meaning better in Yiddish. Sometimes someone will pop up on a message board or in an email group and say, Shouldnt we decide to call ourselves something else? But it never takes.
