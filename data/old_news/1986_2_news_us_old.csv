us,"NEWS SUMMARY SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1986","The Shuttle Tragedy The Challenger explosion theories focus on the space shuttle's right-hand booster rocket, according to a source close to the inquiry into the accident. The solid-fuel rocket suddenly lost power 10 seconds before the shuttle exploded, the source said, and officials are inclined to believe that this indicates flame burned through the rocket's side and then through the skin of the external fuel tank. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] President Reagan mourned the loss of ''our seven Challenger heroes'' at a memorial ceremony at Houston's Johnson Space Center. Paying tribute to their ''brave sacrifice,'' Mr. Reagan pledged to honor them with a renewed national commitment to the conquest of space. Thousands of people attended the ceremony, including relatives and friends of the space shuttle's crew. [ 1:3. ] Cameras on the ocean floor were photographing and videotaping a sunken object to determine whether it came from the space shuttle Challenger. The search was made 40 miles east of Daytona Beach, in the same area where the Coast Guard Thursday found five large floating pieces of the shuttle. One fragment was a clearly identifiable section of the right side of the fuselage, adjacent to the crew compartment. [ 10:1. ] International A state of siege in Haiti was declared by President Jean-Claude Duvalier, who went on national radio to refute widespread rumors - and an erroneous White House report - that his 15-year-old Government had fallen and that he had fled the country. The erroneous information that the 34-year-old President had fled followed a week of tumultuous anti-Government demonstrations.",1986-02-01T05:00:00+0000

us,"IF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN HARRISION RECREATION SURVEY It's not that Harrison is without recreational facilities - it has three neighborhood pools, a dozen tennis courts, two large picnic areas and two buildings with gymnasiums. Nevertheless, said Supervisor Pat V. Angorano , ''some homeowners have been pressing for at least two years for the development of a recreational complex.''   ''But the question is,'' he said, ''how many people would be interested in using it, and would user fees make it self-sustaining?''   He said a survey was planned ''to see how many residents would pay $100 to $300 a year or more'' to support what might be an expensive indoor complex, adding that the town could raise the construction costs of up to $3 million through the sale of bonds.   ''But I would have to see where the income would come from to pay the debt service for those bonds,'' he said. ''I don't feel the income should be coming from the general tax, but from those who would be enjoying the facility.''   There would be an outcry, he said, ''if we decided to spend a substantial amount of money for a relatively few people.'' Mr. Angorano said the proposal, which originated with a petition by 40 or 50 homeowners, might be feasible if 500 to 600 families indicated a willingness to participate.","THERE are several versions of Harrison's origin, all including John Harrison, a Quaker from Long Island.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"A ''privileged reflection of thirteenth-century Gothic art'' is the felicitous phrase this authoritative and fascinating book uses to describe the stained-glass windows produced in the century that was intellectually and artistically the most glorious of the Middle Ages. Louis Grodecki, the pre-eminent scholar of stained glass, mapped out GOTHIC STAINED GLASS: 1200-1300 (Cornell University Press, $75) with his assistant, Catherine Brisac, and the two wrote large sections of it before he died in 1982. She finished the project in the same quiet style that marked their work on Romanesque glass, ''Le Vitrail Roman'' (1977), to which this book is a sequel. That is a weak word for ''Gothic Stained Glass,'' translated by Barbara Drake Boehm. Stained glass of the 13th century is one of the greatest artistic achievements of Western culture and so much of it survives that many volumes many times the size of the one on Romanesque glass could be written about it. That the authors were able to give so much information and appraisal of more than 1,000 windows -mainly in France where the art flourished most, but also in Germany, Italy, Spain and England - in so brief and engaging a book is the best evidence of their mastery of the field. The systematic correlation of the windows with the architecture, painting and technology of the century, and with the dominant religious ideas as those are expressed in contemporary iconography gives order, directness and clarity to this history of an art that grew from hesitant beginnings to overwhelming grandeur in a few decades and came to be the dominant influence on all visual art by the end of the century.",1986-02-02T05:00:00+0000

The Honor Awards handed out each year by the American Institute of Architects, in some ways the nation's most prestigious architectural citations, tend to be a ''beauty contest'' as much as anything else: Any architect can nominate his own completed building, and the awards go to the ones that strike a jury of other architects as attractive. Since the makeup of the jury changes from year to year, if a building fails to win one year, it is often resubmitted to a jury of somewhat different tastes the following year, the upshot being that almost every major design by a celebrated architect makes it one year or another. It does not add up to very much except a long list of generally worthwhile buildings, a list almost any observer of the architectural scene could easily assemble by himself.",1986-02-02T05:00:00+0000

Defensively, the Indians' center fielder committed only one error for a league-leading .998 fielding average and he was second in the outfield in total chances (457), tied for second in assists (19) and third in putouts (437).

us,"NEW SUMMARY SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1986","The Shuttle Inquiry The computers and sensors guiding the space shuttle Challenger's flight appear not to have been programmed to detect flames burning through the side of a solid-fuel booster rocket, experts said. There were further indications that the booster was beginning to fail as long as 10 seconds before the shuttle exploded. Even if sensors had picked up the first signs of fire, safety measures built into the system to protect the astronauts would have prevented an automatic shedding of the giant fuel tanks that exploded. That command, the only step that investigators say might have saved the crew, could have come only from the pilot. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] Many children want to travel in space and seem resiliently enthusiastic about the space program, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll. Though they were pained by the space shuttle explosion that killed a teacher who reminded them of one of their own, two-thirds of the children said they would like to travel in space, as against only half their parents. Adult enthusiasm was also clear; four-fifths said the shuttle program should continue. [ 1:5. ] International Demonstrations in Haiti were reported continuing and medical workers declared that 14 people had been killed and more than 70 wounded in the last two days of anti-Government protests. Seven of the deaths and most of the injuries occurred in Port-au-Prince, the capital, in demonstrations after unfounded reports that President Jean-Claude Duvalier had fled the country.",1986-02-02T05:00:00+0000

And I would say, I'm going to get as far north as I can, away from cotton. Well, look where I am now.'' Mrs. Loftis is 97 years old. She lives with her granddaughter, Pauline Morgan Harrison and her husband Ronald, in a Tudor-style house in the Orchard Hill section of White Plains.

As far as I could make out, they were at-tracted only to boys who were tall or played for the school basketball team or at least shaved. Unable to qualify on all three counts, I resorted to subterfuge. I set out to call attention to myself by becoming a character. Retreating into high seriousness, I acquired a pipe, which I chewed on ostentatiously, and made it my business to be seen everywhere, even at school basketball games, absorbed by books of daunting significance. Say, H. G. Wells's ''Short History of the World'' or Paul de Kruif's ''Microbe Hunters'' or John Gunther inside one continent or another.

us,Bikes,"To the Editor: Having been a neighborhood bicycle retailer for 18 years, I find very true the comment ''you'll quickly win friends among cyclists and shop owners'' in the article ''Italy's Bikes Compete with the Best'' (Travel, Jan. 5). But when you buy a bike overseas, beware of the following: 1. Specifications in foreign countries are likely to vary from American standards, especially those required by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, such as for brake shoes. Threading standards are different, too, and replacement parts may be very rare. For instance, a relatively inexpensive part, the freewheel cluster, which is designed to be replaced when it wears out, may have an Italian thread, rare in the United States, instead of the ubiquitous British thread. They are nearly the same, hard to distinguish, and on an expensive bike a mistake to mix. 2. American marketing corporations may not honor the warranty for products bought from the parent company in Italy. And certainly it is unfair to ask your local bicycle shop to be your advocate in this event. 3. Even the average rider requires unique measurements and judgments in the preparation of a specialty bicycle, and the guidance of sellers in Europe will reflect their temperaments and options. This may differ from the American attitude. Some changes can be made when you get back to the United States at extra cost, such as to change handlebar stem length, but many decisions made in the excitement of the frame builder's showroom will be uncorrectable.",1986-02-02T05:00:00+0000

us,KEY PROGRAMS TO BE ELIMINATED AND THE REASONS FOR DOING SO,"In the budget submitted to Congress today, President Reagan proposed to abolish more than two dozen Government programs. The Administration's rationale for eliminating these programs, as well as the justification for some other budget proposals, is contained in a document distributed by the Office of Management and Budget. What follows is a description, drawn from that document, of some of the prominent programs the President would terminate and the Administration's rationale for doing so. The dates are fiscal years. UU Health Professions Training Program: Training grants to increase the number of doctors, dentists, nurses and other health professionals. Proposal: Eliminate all grants but continue students' access to private loans guaranteed by the Government. Rationale: A shortage in these professions no longer exists, and ''future supply will outstrip demand.'' The grants are ''an inappropriate upper-income subsidy.'' Saving: $147 million in 1987; $249 million in 1991. UU Work Incentive Program Program: Employment counseling, job-search assistance and other social services to welfare recipients. Proposal: Stop financing at the end of the current fiscal year. Rationale: ''Separate Federal programs provide identical services to the same population.'' Saving: $189 million in 1987; $249 million in 1991. UU Conservation Assistance Program: Financial assistance to farmers, ranchers and land owners who initiate soil and water conservation measures. Proposal: Stop immediately direct financial assistance but continue technical assistance. Rationale: The programs are ''outdated and ineffective components of our agricultural conservation program'' that are so ''fragmented and untargeted'' that they miss ''the most serious problems on a year to year basis.''",1986-02-06T05:00:00+0000

The James Dean Exhibition is part of the museum's Discovery Series, a continuing search for television programs thought to be lost, some of which eventually turn up in archives and private collections around the country. The exhibition begins with Dean's first major television role in the ''Kraft TV Theater'' show ''A Long Time Till Dawn,'' a 1953 NBC drama in which he played a rebellious youth just released from prison. Also on this weekend's program is a ''Schlitz Playhouse of the Stars'' show, ''The Unfinished Road,'' a 1955 CBS drama in which Dean played a young drifter who unwittingly becomes involved in racketeering and murder.

During the 1930's, the English press referred to him as the ''Red Menace'' and Winston Churchill's ''Red Nephew''; his upper-class family and friends spoke of him alternately with irritation and affection as a romantic, a troublemaker and ''an impertinent little boy.'' Certainly Esmond Romilly enjoyed playing a variety of roles - schoolboy martyr, adolescent propagandist and Spanish Civil War volunteer - but for all his flirtations with leftist politics, he seemed to harbor few illusions about the sources of his rebellion.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE STORIES OF DENTON WELCH. Edited by Robert Phillips. (Dutton, $24.95.) The typical Denton Welch story centers in a consciousness a little outside the accepted patterns of social order, usually that of an artist or writer (both of which Welch himself was) or a rucksack-carrying stranger seeking shelter in an unfamiliar countryside. Some contact, emotional or physical - as slight as the touching of a tongue to the brass fixtures of a Chinese houseboat or a lingering handclasp between two men - causes a shift of perception that subtly alters a relationship or simply brings a fresh vision. The best of these stories are autobiographical, with the narrator even named Denton in some, and the collection records (though not chronologically) Welch's pivotal moments of revelation. Born in 1915, as Robert Phillips states in his preface, Welch was ''knocked off his bicycle by a 'woman driver' (as he said) on June 7, 1935.'' Until his death in 1948 Welch had to deal with the consequences of this accident: a fractured spine that became tubercular, and crippling pain. Now that most of Welch's writing -which included novels, poems and journals - is appearing in American editions, Mr. Phillips suggests that these stories offer the easiest entry to Welch's work. This is true, but it would have been even more useful, considering the seemingly arbitrary shifts in locale, to add that Welch was born in Shanghai, the youngest of three sons, to an Anglo-American couple.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"YANKEE BLUES: Musical Culture and American Identity. By MacDonald Smith Moore. (Indiana University, $29.50.) Daniel Gregory Mason, descended from one of America's foremost musical families, attained only modest rank as a composer. As an author, professor and chairman of the music department at Columbia University during the 1930's however, he was an influential spokesman for what MacDonald Smith Moore terms ''redemptive culture'' - the spiritual uplifting of a nation or race through the mediation of the arts, particularly music. Mason is the protagonist in Mr. Moore's ''Yankee Blues,'' an intriguing, scholarly account of the ideological clash between Mason's generation of New England composers and the younger, more ethnically diverse proponents of modernism and jazz. Charles Ives, a far more estimable composer whose Yankee pedigree was nearly as impeccable, is cast as Mason's foil, sharing his colleague's transcendentalist vision but disdaining his racism and anti-Semitism. Mr. Moore, a jazz critic and president of a New York digital recording company, sets the stage in a lengthy philosophical analysis that describes both men's struggle to reconcile the paradoxical ideals of gentility and democracy. Ives ultimately resigned himself to public indifference, but Mason, inflamed by the popular rage for jazz, grew increasingly truculent, denouncing such Jewish composers as Aaron Copland and George Gershwin for bringing jazzy dissonance into the concert hall and for daring to express an American ethos without proper racial credentials. The drama culminates in the 1930's with the critical acclamation of Roy Harris - a flag-waving protege of one of Mason's contemporaries - as the ''white hope of American music,'' a man who ''would put the jazzers in their place.''",1986-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Military outlays would increase 6.2 percent, so, as usual in President Reagan's budgets, domestic and social programs would be cut. The budget is also likely to heighten tensions between the legislative and executive branches over spending: Legislators have been leaning toward a tax increase; the White House flatly rejects that possibility, although the President did say he might consider an oil imports tax.",1986-02-09T05:00:00+0000

Dining here differs according to where you sit: the Grill Room menu is lean and spirited; the lavish Pool Room with its lofty foliage and illuminated marble pool is romantic and extravagant. In the latter, the terrines are consistently superior, particularly one combining pheasant, quail and mallard duck; and the cold breast of pigeon with red currants is a winner. The roster of superior dishes is extensive -from duck au poivre with a brassy cracked-pepper sauce, to snapper baked in a crust of sea salt and pepper with two sauces, a rich tarragon and a lighter blend of lemon, olive oil and parsley, to scallops of veal with ginger. Grill Room dinner entrees, $25 to $30. Fridays, noon to 1:45 P.M. and 7:30 to 11:30; Saturdays, noon to 1:45. Pool Room dinner entrees $31 to $39.

Set in a Times Square hotel and populated by theatrical types who really knew from Lindy's and Billy Rose, this entertainment harks back to a romantic era when putting on a hit play could be regarded as a handy antidote to all of life's woes. Even for the original audiences at ''Room Service,'' who were suffering through the Depression, the authors' faith in the curative powers of overnight Broadway success was an invitation to escapist dreaming. Now the play's fantasy of show-biz glory comes wrapped in nostalgia. When was the last time that anyone produced a 22-character drama on Broadway, as the protagonist of ''Room Service'' does, with the hope of making a mint?",1986-02-14T05:00:00+0000

His wife, Kathy, had always helped out at the races, timing laps or flashing him his race position on the pit board. Why not, he thought, put together a whole crew of women whom he could train? It ought to be great for publicity, and perhaps help him attract sponsorship for his car. ''Everyone loved it,'' Venturini recalls. ''We were always being invited to make appearances at shopping malls and auto shows. It was great -except that I couldn't afford the expenses of taking the girls everywhere.'' So the crew disbanded for a couple of years but was re-formed last spring, when Venturini persuaded Permatex, a manufacturer of automotive sealants, to pick up the women's travel costs.",1986-02-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Q AND A,"SUBLETTING A CO-OP Question: In a rent-stabilized building that has been converted to cooperative ownership, can the owner of a co-op apartment sublet it at market rent?. . . G. G. G., Brooklyn Answer: In New York City, after the tenant moves out, the apartment is deregulated and the owner can charge a market rent, according to Thomas R. Viola, assistant commissioner of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal. In regulated apartments outside New York City, the apartment stays rent-stabilized. Sparing the Paintbrush Question: I reside in Washington Square Village owned by New York University, in a rent-stabilized, one-bedroom apartment. Though I have always had three year leases in the past, I was recently offered a two-year lease and informed that N.Y.U. had to paint only my bathroom and kitchen, not the living room or bedroom. Is this true?. . . S. T., Manhattan Answer: In 1983 the Omnibus Housing Act established that landlords had to offer only one or two-year leases. Painting, however, is required by the housing maintenance code every three years, so the state housing agency established regulations that said: If the apartment is painted the tenant signing a two-year lease must place one-third of the cost of the paint job with the landlord as security in case the tenant does not renew the lease; if the tenant renews, the deposit is refunded.",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

us,FROM THE LAND WHERE POLAR BEARS FLY,"ARCTIC DREAMS Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape. By Barry Lopez. Maps. 464 pp. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. $22.95. IF you lowered a microphone into Lancaster Sound off Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic on a summer day, you might hear all at once the tremolo moans of bearded seals, the baritone boom of a walrus, the high-pitched bark and yelp of ringed seals, the electric crackling of shrimp, the birdlike trills and clicks and other harmonics of white beluga whales and horned narwhals, and the elephantine trumpeting of huge bowhead whales. And it is this synchronous wealth of life - of all life - that Barry Lopez is celebrating in his jubilant new book. Among contemporary nature writers Mr. Lopez is especially a rhapsodist, and what he has done in this passionate paean to the Arctic and its cycles of light and darkness, its species of ice, its creatures and waters, is to present a whole series of raptures and riffs on the subject of musk oxen, ivory gulls, white foxes, polar bears, icebergs and sea cur-rents. Speaking of the effect of the Arctic upon an explorer, he describes how ''the land becomes large, alive like an animal; it humbles him. . . . It is not that the land is simply beautiful but that it is powerful. . . . Darkness and light are bound together within it, and the feeling that this is the floor of creation.''",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Aquino, planned a rally today at which her supporters were expected to endorse her as the winner. The assembly said Mr. Marcos's running mate, Arturo M. Tolentino, had been elected Vice President. [ Page 1, Column 6. ] President Reagan directly blamed the Marcos party for widespread fraud and violence in the election. A statement issued by the White House said the evidence ''was so extreme that the election's credibility has been called into question both within the Philippines and in the United States.'' The statement marked a shift in public posture from Mr. Reagan's remark at his news conference Tuesday that fraud ''could have been occurring on both sides.'' [ 1:4. ] Suicide terrorist bombings in Lebanon in the last year have increasingly been directly linked to pro-Syrian secular groups, according to evidence gathered by the Israeli Army, counterterrorism experts and residents of southern Lebanon. The officials and experts say they have concluded that there is no truth to previous assumptions the bombings were the work of pro-Iranian fanatics. [ 1:2. ] Anatoly B. Shcharansky is unchanged from the man he was in Moscow before his imprisonment nine years ago on treason charges.

I am reliably informed that when a copy of this book crossed the desk of Walter B. Wriston, then chairman and chief executive officer of Citicorp, he put in a call to Shearman & Sterling, which is Citicorp's lead counsel, to inquire whether Mr. Harfield had really said that.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"LAST RESORTS. By Clare Boylan. (Summit, $16.95.) Clare Boylan's gift for stunning prose and unorthodox images is wonderfully evident in her second novel (her first, ''Holy Pictures,'' was highly praised). But she overburdens her central character, Harriet Bell, with more problems than even the strongest character could resolve in this novel. An unenviable sad sack, Harriet is chronically at sea, without the faintest notion of how to fulfill herself. Fittingly, she is vacationing in the Aegean with her three children on the none-too-subtly named isle of Keptos, which has kept her returning every year for a decade with its promise of idyllic stasis. This character without drive knows herself only in terms of her many unsatisfying relationships. Yet her children, noisy slobbering teen-agers, are not the monsters Harriet likens them to, just typical adolescents bumbling through one postpubescent trauma after another. She obsessively schemes to lure Joe Fisher, an unexceptional businessman, away from his wife, but doesn't see that his dalliance with her is a pathetic attempt to absolve himself of guilt about his dead daughter, who resembled Harriet. Even her imaginary childhood companion, the toothy Hawna Maroyle, keeps cropping up to taunt her. Harriet's estrangement from Joe and her children is just the beginning; she no longer recognizes her own vision of paradise, as Greek entrepreneurs set about modernizing Keptos and the neighboring island into tourist resorts. ''Last Resorts,'' although a third-person narrative, is too often told from the murky recesses of Harriet's mind.",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

I've spent enough ink berating American dramatists for not quite managing to be capsule reincarnations of Shakespeare and Buchner, Ibsen and Brecht. Maybe it's time to acknowledge the difficulties they face at a time when the traditional center of their theater is so inhospitable to even their less serious efforts, let alone their more challenging ones. Nearly 15 years ago William Goldman complained in his book about Broadway, ''The Season'': ''We have not had a first-rate playwriting debut in almost a quarter of a century, and the wait is getting painful.'' Since he wrote that, the prospect of such a debut has become so slight, so slim that any sane person would give up the wait as hopeless. Indeed, the best may not be seen on Broadway at all. David Mamet's ''American Buffalo'' may have slipped past the sentries, but Sam Shepard, whom many would regard as the first among the first-rate, has yet to have a play produced there.",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

I was auditing her course, so her question was fair enough. The truth is, more and more lawyers these days recognize that law can be read the way one reads literature, and they are using works of literature and the techniques of modern literary theory to explain and analyze their subject. One of the more interesting currents is critical legal studies, whose proponents argue that law, like literature, is the product of - and a vehicle for creating - political and moral values. Drawing on critics of the feminist, structuralist and deconstructionist schools, lawyers engaged in critical legal studies argue for demystification of the law. They assert that the prevailing views of law, and the kind of society these views reflect and perpetuate, are grounded on inconsistent and contestable premises, and they seek to use their analysis of law to change the relationship between their profession and society as a whole.",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

A matched pair of trim, perky, helpful young people took my vital signs and administered simple tests for muscular strength, flexibility and cardiorespiratory endurance. Except for my flexibility, which was below average, everything was normal or fair or average or O.K. No red flags and no gold stars. I was told, in a friendly and positive way, that there was a lot of room for improvement and that more walking, running and swimming, plus aerobic exercises, stretching and racquetball would make me more fit, help me carve off 10 pounds of fat and probably contribute to my overall health. The young people counseled against lifting weights; it would add nothing to my fitness or health. They suggested moderate activity, especially at first, and a medical checkup. They were sensible, supportive and, according to everything I've been reading and hearing, absolutely right. So, now what? This current fitness craze, the biggest in a series that predates the Revolution, has produced more confusing information than can be lifted or leaped over by a well-conditioned young athlete. I am 48 years old and my own sports confessional is a typically sorry story. I make an effort to run or swim at least three times a week, but I travel too often and too irregularly to maintain a pattern.

Box 957, La Jolla, Calif. 92038, $24.50.) Milton S. Gould, a New York attorney, has turned his attention to the soap-operatic history of in re Neagle, a landmark case in constitutional law. The 1890 case first interested Mr. Gould when, as a law student in 1932, he discovered an illicit love affair at its heart. His half-century obsession with this episode in California history culminates in ''A Cast of Hawks,'' a peppy tale of greed, politics, lust and murder. In this handsome, illustrated volume, Mr. Gould vividly describes San Francisco after the gold rush, when unscrupulous judges, crooked senators and mercenary prostitutes fought private wars with public consequences. Mr. Gould's narrative is most valuable when it points out the scars personal indiscretions can leave on the national complexion. Sarah Hill, a prostitute, had claimed to be secretly married to William Sharon, a goatish United States Senator. Charging him with desertion, she sued for ''divorce.'' The case eventually reached Federal court. When the court found against Hill, her lawyer - a former California Supreme Court justice whom she had married during the proceedings - tried to stab the judge and was later killed by David Neagle, a Federal marshal who was acting as the judge's bodyguard. In re Neagle affirmed that the marshal was not answerable to the State of California because he was acting on the authority of the Government. Mr. Gould lays out the story with a lawyerly passion for facts.",1986-02-16T05:00:00+0000

Approval of an emergency plan is one of the final hurdles before Shoreham can win an operating license, but it is by no means the last act. Many important questions remain, and Clifford D. May, a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The New York Times, discussed some of them last week with John S.

Vita Sackville-West and Virginia Woolf met in 1922, became lovers a bit later and finally were devoted friends and correspondents until Woolf's death in 1941. This collection, which includes 175 extracts from Virginia Woolf's correspondence, includes letters of passion but also ''satisfying amounts of artifice, inconsequence, gossip and feeling,'' Thomas Mallon wrote here in 1984. And he said that the collection ''reads like a book, not just a gathering of marvelous scraps.'' THE OLD MAN, by Yuri Trifonov. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $8.95.) An aged widower sets out to learn the truth about the civil war that followed the Russian Revolution, a war in which he and his friends fought. The theme of Yuri Trifonov's novel, Harlow Robinson wrote here last year, is ''the dangerously insecure grasp the dying Soviet generation has of its own constantly rewritten history.'' While he found the translation by Jacqueline Edwards and Mitchell Schneider pedestrian, he said this is a ''provocative and wise'' novel. In a companion volume the same publisher has reissued ANOTHER LIFE and THE HOUSE ON THE EMBANKMENT ($8.95). In the first novella, a woman's sudden widowhood forces her to reinterpret her past; the second recounts a literary bureaucrat's climb to the top. Richard Lourie wrote here in 1984 that they ''are as formless and self-interrupting as conversation and make use of the telling detail a la Chekhov. . . .

What was the death of a rabbit compared to the perfection of a life-saving surgical procedure? In recent years, however, growing complaints about unnecessary cruelty have made animal research a national issue. Last year, Congress expanded enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, required training for workers who handle animals and gave the National Institutes of Health the right to revoke Government money if violations are found. This month Federal financing for some animal studies at Columbia University was suspended because they failed to meet new rules. Last week, panels of the National Academy of Sciences that are investigating animal research heard testimony from more than 50 scientists, animal-rights activists and other interested parties. Excerpts follow. FALSE PROMISES The mere fact that we are attending a scientific hearing concerning the use of animals in research indicates how, in the past decade, the legitimacy of the animal rights argument is being seriously considered. Many scientists are questioning not only accepted assumptions concerning the use of animals in research but also the merits of basic research itself.

Findlay takes this as a symbolic starting point for his study of gambling in American history. From the very outset, he maintains, the advancing frontier of American culture has been marked by an exceptional readiness to bet on the future - and to bet on lots of lesser things as well. So doggedly does he iterate this thesis (and, on the whole, so convincingly) that by the time you get very far into ''People of Chance,'' the spirit of the frontier and the spirit of gambling have come to seem virtually synonymous.",1986-02-18T05:00:00+0000

us,WEEKENDER GUIDE,"Friday OPERA AT RANDOM His fascination has always been with random noise, the kind of accidental sounds he could coax from what he once called ''noninstruments.'' At a cocktail party several years ago, John Cage was listening, bored, to a Brahms symphony on the record player. Suddenly, the telephone rang and a door slammed shut, strange notes clawing into the music. ''Now isn't that beautiful?'' he said to a guest. Tonight and Saturday, Mr. Cage, the avant-garde composer who has used everything from computers to cactus plants to create music, is himself a sound to listen for: He is the ''spoken orchestra'' for an opera titled ''The Bus to Stockport and Other Stories.'' The work, based on Mr. Cage's stories, had its premiere last night and is part of the Opera Uptown series, at the Minor Latham Playhouse of Barnard College, 119th Street and Broadway. This weekend the performances are at 8 P.M., with a Saturday matinee at 2 P.M. The score is by Eric Valinsky and Peter Schubert, with additional music by Richard Einhorn and J. S. Bach. The director is Rhonda Rubinson. Don't frown on the idea of going more than once: the point of this work, Mr. Cage characteristically proposes, is that each performance is different and random, a unique blend of music and words, movements and lighting. Tickets are $3; $2 for people over 65 and Columbia University students with identification. Information: 280-2079.",1986-02-21T05:00:00+0000

AURORA, #60 East 49th Street (692-9292) -(Jan. 31, 1986) Joseph Baum's new creation has just joined the ranks of New York's excellent French restaurants. The winsomely plush dining room combines a corporate ambiance with a playful bubble theme. The chef prepares food that stresses flavor over flair. Recommended appetizers are crisp-skinned duck confit in a nest of fresh greens with a lively hazelnut dressing and golden-sauteed sweetbreads paired with sliced potatoes, truffles and a caper-parsley vinaigrette. Entrees included roast pigeon with garlic sauce, veal chop with cabbage pockets filled with rice and wild mushrooms, or salmon steak baked in a mild horseradish crust. Desserts are rarely a disappointment. Entrees, $25 to $32.50. Fridays, noon to 2:30 and 5:30 to 11 P.M.; Saturdays, 5:30 to 11 P.M.; closed Sundays. LA COTE BASQUE, #5 East 55th Street (688-6525) - (Dec. 11, 1981) Gorgeous floral arrangements and pleasant lighting, along with fanciful murals of Basque scenes provide a festive atmosphere to this fine restaurant.

His first novel was published in 1949, and in 1972 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for a body of work that, in its emphasis on life and a positive vision, fulfilled the ideals the prize is meant to honor. Possibly his sense of noblesse oblige induced him to serve as the quasi-official conscience of postwar Germany - who else was anything like as eligible? - and this function, one may surmise, proved a burden to him.

The references are compulsive, and for 150 pages one wonders what Mr. King's attitude is toward his own thirst; then, abruptly, mid-paragraph, he finally mentions alcoholism and acknowledges the broader implications of his drinking.

Seeing the play again in John Tillinger's mirthful new production at the Manhattan Theater Club, one fully accepts the author's initial evaluation -as well as such alternate designations as a satire and a comedy of bad manners. If farce, as defined in the Oxford Companion to Theater, is ''an extreme form of comedy in which laughter is raised at the expense of probability, particularly by horseplay and bodily assault,'' then ''Loot'' is a priceless contemporary example of the genre. Horseplay rides high, and bodily assault refers not only to the body English of the actors but also to the attack on the audience's collective funnybone.",1986-02-23T05:00:00+0000

BEHIND the creation of great houses there are always strong personalities - clients and architects whose self-images and notions of art and sensibility either flourish and thrive or struggle for survival within the cultural, artistic, economic and political contexts of the time. Whether it is in Renaissance Italy, Enlightenment Britain or colonial America, the same very human drama unfolds as a patron decides to build himself a house. Is there enough money? How does its source determine the house's role in the owner's psychology? How and from where do the owner and architect obtain their ideas? Later we wonder, with what sorts of moods and motives was the house conceived and built? Who were the protagonists and antagonists? How does this human drama relate to the larger events and movements of the time or to the past and future? And what can it tell us about the development of values of a particular country - in the case of this book, America?",1986-02-23T05:00:00+0000

Here are key developments since then. Aug. 21, 1983 - Mr. Aquino, who has been in self-imposed exile in the United States for three years, returns to Manila and is shot dead upon arrival at Manila International Airport. Rolando C. Galman, who the Government says is the assassin, is shot dead by guards on the tarmac. Opposition leaders immediately blame the Government for the killing of Mr. Aquino, 50 years old, who was regarded as the strongest rival to President Ferdinand E. Marcos. The first person arrested when the Marcos Government declared martial law in 1972, Mr. Aquino spent eight years in jail before his exile. United States officials also condemn the slaying. In Newton, Mass., Corazon C. Aquino says she is ''fatalistic'' about her husband's death. She and her five children prepare to return to Manila for the funeral. Aug. 31, 1983 - More than a million Filipinos join a 10-hour procession in Manila at the funeral for Mr. Aquino, the largest ever held in Philippines.

But even then, with some detective work by the newspapermen of Denmark, this utterly obscure author was emerging into the spotlight as one of the most picturesque and flamboyant literary personalities of the century, a woman who had ''style'' as well as a remarkably grave and luminous prose style, and whose works as they followed her veiled debut seemed successive enlargements of her dramatic persona. She relished what she called ''the sweetness of fame'' and the company of the great and glamorous; she received in her native Denmark and while traveling elsewhere the attention due a celebrity. In her frail last years, on her one trip to the United States, she went out of her way to meet Marilyn Monroe, and recently has herself become a movie heroine, as played by Meryl Streep in the stately adaptation of ''Out of Africa.'' Since her death in 1962 - the cause of death was given as ''emaciation'' - the many-named woman known to the world as Isak Dinesen has been the subject of a number of biographies, including a truly excellent one by Judith Thurman, from which I have drawn most of the following clues.",1986-02-23T05:00:00+0000

From Thomas Jefferson through Whitman and Thoreau, down to Frederick Jackson Turner's famous essay of 1893, ''The Significance of the Frontier in American History,'' and even to the present day, the West has occupied a mythic niche in the American imagination. Jefferson conjured traveling westward as a journey backward in time to ''the infancy of creation.'' He expected that the acquisition of the enormous Louisiana Territory would create an empire of liberty where the American experiment in republicanism could be perpetually refreshened. Thoreau felt jacketed by convention in the settled East, but ''westward,'' he concluded, ''I go free.'' Expanding on Jefferson, Turner argued that the repeated experience of pushing the frontier line westward shaped the culture of American democracy by reinforcing republican virtues, especially ''that dominant individualism . . . that buoyancy and exuberance which come with freedom.''",1986-02-23T05:00:00+0000

DIFFERING SIGNALS OVER THE DOLLAR","The dollar has fallen enough, Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, told a Congressional panel, a comment that sent ripples through the markets and held broad implications for future monetary policy. It also indicated a split with Administration views, since a day earlier Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d had said the dollar should fall still further. Although the two men sought to play down their disagreements, it was clear that they are at odds over how to control the economy. Mr. Baker believes the lower the dollar, the more help to the trade deficit and thus the budget deficit. Mr. Volcker believes a dollar that is too low will rekindle inflation. Lower interest rates, within the Fed's realm of control, would tend to force the dollar lower, and Mr. Volcker is not partial to that course.",1986-02-23T05:00:00+0000

One example: tribe. Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi is chief minister of the KwaZulu homeland and chairman of the South African Black Alliance. He takes umbrage at anybody who calls the Zulus a ''tribe.'' In a letter to The Washington Post, Mr. Buthelezi writes: ''We Zulus regard it as a gross insult to be described . . . as 'a tribe.' The Zulu people were a sovereign nation with a king until July 4, 1879, when they were crushed in a defeat by the might of the British Army. . . .

The attack followed a tense night of threats and counter threats between the two sides. The fast-moving events left the ultimate outcome of three-day standoff unclear. [ Page A1, Column 6. ] A cutoff of Manila's U.S. military aid was threatened by President Reagan unless President Marcos avoided the use of force against those calling for his resignation. The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said Mr. Reagan had sent a message urging Mr. Marcos ''to avoid an attack against other elements of the Philippine armed forces.'' [ A1:4. ] Philippine leftists remain inactive during the military and political crisis, putting many of their followers in an uncomfortable position. Leaders of the left contend that their decision to boycott the election on Feb. 7 has been proved correct, since President Marcos has stayed in office despite widespread indicaitons of fraud and voter intimidation. But a number of political moderates and diplomats believe the boycott cost the Communists a chance to increase their power by linking up to the enormously popular Corazon C. Aquino.

''We want the right to be treated like everyone else,'' said Fleisher, who added that the union would press for a free-agent system in negotiations for a contract to replace the one that expires in June 1987. ''We feel there is no reason why we can't operate under a free-agent system, where a player can sign a contract and move wherever he wants to move, and a player can come out of school and sign with whomever he wants to sign,'' he said. Currently, the right of first refusal accorded to N.B.A. teams can limit the movement of free agents. Fleisher, who also serves as an agent for almost 30 N.B.A. players, dismissed the suggestion that without a draft to allocate incoming talent, the rich, big-city teams would have an advantage over smaller franchises. ''If you're going to be the third center on the Los Angeles Lakers, you're not going to get as much as the first one on the Detroit Pistons,'' he said. David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A., made no direct reply to the proposal but said he would defend Fleisher's ''right to have as long and as extensive a wish list as he cares to bring'' to the negotiating table.",1986-02-26T05:00:00+0000

According to Glenn Overk, the teacher of the first course, log homes have grown in popularity. ''I decided if someone was going to tackle a project that size themselves, they needed more than the information the companies were providing,'' he said. The course will include discussions of choosing the right building site, comparison of different log systems, log-building equipment, solar heating systems and construction. Trips to a log home under construction and to several finished homes are planned.",1986-02-27T05:00:00+0000
