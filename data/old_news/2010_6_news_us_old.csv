The group, Citizens Against Religious Bigotry, which includes leaders from the Media Research Center, the Catholic League and the Parents Television Council, said that the series represented a double standard in light of the networks decision to censor an episode of South Park that mocked the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam. In April, Comedy Central bleeped the audio of a South Park show that said a character was the Prophet Muhammad disguised in a bear costume. The move came after the shows creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, were named in ominous messages posted on revolutionmuslim.com, the Web site of the Islamic group Revolution Muslim. Comedy Central said last month that it was developing a show called JC, in which Jesus tries to lead a normal existence in New York. The series has not yet been added to the networks schedule or shown to the public. The coalition said it had written to some 250 advertisers urging them not to support the series. Tony Fox, a press representative for Comedy Central, said: JC is an idea and an idea only.

Mr. Danieley will replace Brian dArcy James (Shrek), who took over the role of Dan last month from J. Robert Spencer; Mr. dArcy James will rejoin the cast of the play Time Stands Still when it returns to Broadway in the fall. Ms. Ripley and Mr. dArcy James will give their final performances on July 18.",2010-06-03T22:22:16+0000

On Thursday, HBO said that it would broadcast a feature-length documentary based on Wishful Drinking, the one-woman show by Ms. Fisher, right, that was presented by Roundabout Theater Company at Studio 54 earlier this year. The show, in which Ms. Fisher shares stories of her childhood with her parents, Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and re-coils her hair in the coif she sported as Princess Leia in Star Wars, was called a brut-dry, deeply funny memoir of a show in a review by Ben Brantley in The New York Times, yet somehow escaped the attention of the Tony Award nominating committee. HBO said that its documentary will be directed by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey (Monica in Black and White, The Eyes of Tammy Faye), and will combine footage of the show, to be taped on June 25 at the South Orange Performing Arts Center in South Orange, N.J., with archival footage and other interviews.

He was released, and officials admitted that he had been tortured to confess to a crime that did not exist.

He uses it (and claims that his Bahamian/English friends use it) to mean 'to get back to someone.' That is, instead of saying, 'I will get back to you with that information or with respect to that issue,' they say, 'I will revert to you.' Can you shed some light on this?""  Revert, as the major American and British dictionaries have it, does indeed primarily refer to a return to a former condition, belief or practice. For instance, George Vecsey, a sports columnist for The New York Times, recently wrote of the woeful New Jersey Nets, ""Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin and Richard Jefferson reached the finals in 2002 and 2003, but the Nets have since reverted to their haunted roots.""  Secondary senses of the verb include the legal one, denoting the return of something to its previous owner, as in the contractual boilerplate, ""All rights revert to the author after publishing."" In evolutionary biology, it can signal an atavistic throwback to an ancestral type. To someone familiar with only these traditional meanings of the word, ""I will revert to you"" might sound like a bizarrely personal take on either property law or genetics.",2010-06-04T03:42:38+0000

Throughout this blur of travelogue and food criticism, he sprinkles references to religion, history, anthropology, biochemistry and philosophy.

Of course, this changed when Andy Warhol, who started his career as a fairly successful editorial and advertising illustrator-designer, turned the art world on its soup can. Since then, the list of crossover artists has increased to the point where, arguably, it is difficult to be a contemporary artist without having an applied or commercial art pedigree  or at least without once having designed a T-shirt. Yet one of todays most celebrated artists, Barbara Kruger, who began as a graphic designer for Cond Nast and helped pioneer (along with Lawrence Weiner, Ed Ruscha and Jenny Holzer, among others) a genre that liberally employs typography and advertising techniques, met with initial resistance not from myopic art pundits but from shortsighted fellow designers.",2010-06-04T14:41:56+0000

Beatties influence, and her rumored proximity, seemed pervasive, a part of the cultural landscape. Her stories were appearing regularly in The New Yorker. Beatties feckless middle-class postgraduates, still mourning the demise of the 60s, seemed like older versions of me and my friends, albeit with better taste. As clueless as her characters sometimes seemed, they were terribly clued-in, worldly and semiotically correct. Just as an earlier generation used to read Hemingway in part to learn what to drink and where to travel, we read Beattie in part to learn what to listen to and read and what to wear.

On the red carpet at the Academy Awards last year, the director, accosted by curious members of the press, called Gatsby a great, iconic story with remarkable contemporary resonance. If you reread it now, he declared, youll see how powerful and meaningful it is in this time. But last September Luhrmann retreated from the project, telling Newsweek, Ive not decided which thing I will commit to. Conceding, I own the rights to Gatsby,  he added, I own the rights to it and a whole lot of other books. Its dispiriting to think of one of the greatest of the Great American Novels jumbled among a pile of books, not top of the heap. But, as Nick Carraway reflects at the storys outset, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth. In this case, however, humility may hide behind the mask of hubris: it takes audacity to wrap the gilded name of Gatsby around your own shoulders and hope to wear it with grace.

So it is a joy to discover, every once in a while, a writer whose prose and plotting take something from both camps.

The standard governmental practice for over a quarter century has been to rely instead on labor-market studies that analyze data from thousands of workers. My labor-market estimates of the value of life have been used by government agencies since 1982. The article also indicates that E.P.A. regulations costing a bit more than E.P.A.'s value-of-statistical-life estimate ""would be scuttled."" There are many E.P.A. regulations that involve a cost per expected life saved in excess of $100 million - far above any value-of-statistical-life estimate used for benefit-cost tests. The real challenge continues to be that of striking a meaningful balance between cost and risk so that we target our life-saving resources most effectively.W.

But unlike them, Addison Schacht, the conflicted hero of The November Criminals, is less interested in committing a crime than solving one. And though no one in the admissions office at the University of Chicago has asked Addison to discuss the murder of his high school classmate Kevin Broadus, he uses the applications essay assignment (What is your best quality? What is your worst quality?) as a chance to get some things off his chest. The result is no tidy, eager-to-please essay but a book-length spiel  concerning, among other things, Virgils Aeneid, Holocaust jokes, dope dealing, friends with benefits, classic cinema, adolescent ennui, Latin grammar and syntax, Jewish numerology, anti-Semitism, struggles with guilt, the hypocrisy of liberal politics, race relations in the United States, the philosophical downside of living in D.C. and, oh yeah, who killed Kevin Broadus. The list of topics sometimes makes this novel, Sam Munsons first, feel a bit shaggy. But, more often, The November Criminals is both a thoughtful coming-of-age story and an engaging teenage noir.

Or as working for the good, no matter if his actions  looked at one by one  are transparently self-serving, murderous, etc. Kind of a strong argument against the value of terms like good or bad. People feel this way even now, in 1999, when we're all supposed to be repenting and wailing and gnashing our teeth. But you can't go through life without making any distinctions.

Was it whether having children would be good for you, your partner and others close to the possible child, such as children you may already have, or perhaps your parents? For most people contemplating reproduction, those are the dominant questions. Some may also think about the desirability of adding to the strain that the nearly seven billion people already here are putting on our planets environment. But very few ask whether coming into existence is a good thing for the child itself. Most of those who consider that question probably do so because they have some reason to fear that the childs life would be especially difficult  for example, if they have a family history of a devastating illness, physical or mental, that cannot yet be detected prenatally.All this suggests that we think it is wrong to bring into the world a child whose prospects for a happy, healthy life are poor, but we dont usually think the fact that a child is likely to have a happy, healthy life is a reason for bringing the child into existence. This has come to be known among philosophers as the asymmetry and it is not easy to justify. But rather than go into the explanations usually proffered  and why they fail  I want to raise a related problem. How good does life have to be, to make it reasonable to bring a child into the world? Is the standard of life experienced by most people in developed nations today good enough to make this decision unproblematic, in the absence of specific knowledge that the child will have a severe genetic disease or other problem?",2010-06-06T21:15:34+0000

The critically acclaimed production, which has received the most Tony Award nominations ever  10  for a play revival, began preview performances on April 14 and opened on April 26; the limited engagement is scheduled to end on July 11. Usually only one-quarter to one-third of Broadway shows recoup their original investment, and most require many months to do so; having popular stars in the cast has helped some recent plays, like God of Carnage and A Steady Rain, recoup more quickly. Like those productions Fences is one of the few hit plays in recent years that have grossed more than $1 million in a single week; the production has also twice set box office records at its home, the Cort Theater, most recently when it hit a figure of $1,024,316.50 last week. Among the plays nominations for Tony Awards, which will be presented on Sunday, are best revival of a play, leading actor (Mr. Washington), leading actress (Ms. Davis), featured actor in a play (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and direction of a play (Kenny Leon).",2010-06-07T05:44:03+0000

Ms. Peters said that Stephen Sondheim, who wrote the music and lyrics for the show, proposed the idea to her this spring and urged the producers to cast her. Ms. Stritch said that no one  including herself  was claiming credit for suggesting that she step into the role of Madame Armfeldt. No one is going to own up to it until they see how I do, said Ms. Stritch, who sang The Ladies Who Lunch in the original Broadway production of Mr. Sondheims Company. The change has led to a longer life for the revival, which had been set to close on June 20.

The musical Annie will be revived on Broadway in the fall of 2012 to mark the 35th anniversary of the original production, with Thomas Meehan, who wrote the shows book, on board to update the script for the first time, the producer Arielle Tepper Madover said on Monday. The 1977 Tony Award winner for best musical, Annie ran for almost six years and has spawned countless tours and regional productions, but it has been revived on Broadway only once, in 1997, a production that drew negative reviews from critics and ran only seven months. Ms. Madover declined to offer a theory about why that revival failed, but said that hers would be different because Mr. Meehan would be working with the script and a new creative team will look to modernize the show. The story (as if anyone didnt know) of a little orphan girl who warms the hearts of Daddy Warbucks, Franklin D. Roosevelt and just about everyone except the mean orphanage manager Miss Hannigan, Annie will not be updated out of the Great Depression, Ms. Madover said. Rather, Mr. Meehan plans to look at the dialogue and the structure of the plot for ways to sharpen the storytelling. (Mr. Meehan won the 1977 Tony for best book, one of seven Tonys that the production received.)",2010-06-07T21:21:31+0000

The 20-minute work consists of thumping beats, whistles and high-pitched electronic sounds that cannot be heard by human ears, The A.P. said, as well as whale sounds that worked some four-legged concertgoers into a frenzy. (Others, The A.P. said, simply stared at the stage with glazed eyes, which in our experience is not necessarily an indication of a bad show.) A Jack Russell terrier named Oliver made a break for the stage, The A.P. reported, dragging his owner along with him.

Wed like to extend our deepest apologies to the fans, but events beyond all our control have conspired against us, the group said in a statement. The bands Gorillaz and the Klaxons have also withdrawn from the festival after the raid by Israeli commandos on a Gaza-bound flotilla. Last month Elvis Costello canceled two concerts in Israel this summer, citing the complexities of the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After the announcement of the Pixies cancellation, Shuki Weiss, the promoter of the Pic.Nic festival, said in a statement, I am full of both sorrow and pain in light of the fact that our repeated attempts to present quality acts and festivals in Israel have increasingly been falling victim to what I can only describe as a form of cultural terrorism which is targeting Israel and the arts worldwide.",2010-06-07T21:23:46+0000

Last week Mr. del Toro said on TheOneRing.net that he was withdrawing as director of The Hobbit, which MGM is planning for release as two films in 2012 and 2013. In a message posted on Sunday on that same site, Mr. del Toro wrote that his commitment to the project demanded enormous sacrifices both in personal and professional terms, requiring him to relocate my entire life and family to New Zealand after he joined the project in 2008. Though he has made other films that required location shoots and took years to come together, Mr. del Toro wrote, rarely do you relocate for such massive amount of time specially when you have to do major ironclad agreements to put in deep freeze other contractual obligations with multiple studios. He added: So  while the cited delays, contractual complexities or obstacles, cannot be attributed to a single event or entity  you will simply have to believe that they were of sufficient complexity and severity to lead to the current situation.

us,Friday Night Lights Watch: Bad Parenting,"Once again Friday nights episode of Friday Night Lights, proved to be an evocative treatise on miserable parenting. Early on we see Vince scouring the empty fridge in his apartment right before the camera finds its way to the image of his mother sacked out on a bench outside. She didnt forget to pick up the milk because she is too harried; she is too strung out to remember to do it in the first place. The series checks off every category of bad mother or father: Vinces mom is an addict; Beckys mom is an obsessive too focused on the transgressions of Beckys dad to really be in the moment with her daughter. Did anybody else feel worse for Becky that her mom was screaming into the dads voice mail during the pageant than they did over the fact that he didnt bother to show up?And how about that pageant? (I loved Beckys correcting of the M.C.  Its just Wicked.') There is something so incongruous  in a good way  about Becky being on the beauty pageant circuit, since she is so not a Texas looker. The show hammered this home with its shots of her competitors. Her confidence  her aggressiveness with Riggins  is constantly at odds with her rebellious hair and unconventional prettiness, and Im finding myself really riveted by the tension. Becky is also the first central female character to be ordinary looking. (Tyra, Julie and Lyla  knockouts all.) And whats amazing is how self-assured she is in spite of her clearly bad family life. She knows how to perform: I like the way her confidence was contrasted with Vinces, when he is asked to deliver a speech at a pancake breakfast after a great turn in his football game. He is at a loss and further confused by J.D. McCoys Dale Carnegie-like ease in front of an audience.",2010-06-07T22:00:23+0000

us,The Life Aquatic,"Theres something about the onset of summer that prompts even the most diehard urbanites to dress like sailors. But theres a fine line between indulging in a little naval gazing and looking like an extra on shore leave from On the Town. AANDD, a new line of three unisex bags from the architect/industrial designer Adam Davidson, gets the seafaring tone just right, with waxed rope handles and a predominantly navy color scheme. I wanted to get past the usual garment center sources for hardware, Davidson says. So I looked at marine hardware and just fell in love with it. The roomy Sea Bag is Davidsons take on the weekender, with large exterior pockets and a detachable leather shoulder strap; the Sea Duffle is a cross between a shoulder bag and a sailors duffle; and the Courier is a leather messenger bag with a two-tone reversible flap that zips on and off. Womens bags tend to be bling-heavy, while mens bags shy away from any risk-taking when it comes to details, adds the designer. The idea is to find the middle ground. Aandd bags are available at Maryam Nassir Zaddeh, 123 Norfolk Street, (212) 673-6405. Prices range from $425-$625.",2010-06-08T16:36:21+0000

The sale was made at a farm supply store about an hours drive from the Toronto convention center that will host the Group of 20 summit meeting this month. The man did not provide identification, as required by Canadian law, after convincing clerks that he was a regular customer. The clerks then helped him load the 65 bags of fertilizer onto a flatbed trailer pulled by a minivan. The store later realized that the man was not who he claimed, and contacted the police. The police say they have no evidence linking the purchase either to the summit or to bomb-making and acknowledge that the purchaser, described as a middle-aged man with a heavy accent and missing two fingers, may simply be fertilizing fruit trees.

The teenager, Sergio Adrin Hernndez, 15, was shot beside a railroad bridge connecting Ciudad Jurez with El Paso.

A circular or ring narrative is one in which events come to a decisive point in the middle and then lead back, in parallel fashion, to the point of entry: ABCBA. Unlike a conventional (we might say ABCDE) narrative, which builds to a world-altering climax near the end, a ring narrative appears symmetrical and exhaustively coherent, like a snowflake.

It now stands five inches tall, up from three and a quarter inches, and weighs 3 1/2 pounds, a two-pound gain. (The new model is above left, next to the old.) Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theater Wing, which administers the Tonys in partnership with the Broadway League, said the previous one felt light in the hand, and the change was meant to make it feel more substantial. We know the physical scale of the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys, he said. While were not attempting to keep up with the Joneses, we felt this is a significant award, and it could feel and look a bit more significant. When the first Tonys were given in 1947, winners received scrolls and a money clip, for the men, or a compact, for the women. In 1949, the award was turned into a medallion inside a presentation case. In 1967, the year the awards were first televised, the medallion was mounted onto a base.",2010-06-11T22:17:41+0000

Thomas Meehan (Annie, The Producers), who is writing the shows book with Bob Martin (The Drowsy Chaperone), said in a telephone interview that Elf the Musical was in very good shape, very fun shape and was set to arrive at the Hirschfeld some time in November. The music is by Matthew Sklar and the lyrics by Chad Beguelin, who collaborated on the musical adaptation of the movie The Wedding Singer. Two theater executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the show ahead of its official announcement, said that the director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw (Drowsy Chaperone, All About Me) would direct Elf and that the run was expected at this point to be limited, similar to recent holiday-timed shows on Broadway like Irving Berlins White Christmas and Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas!

(Among other plot twists, the human Bella gives birth to the vampire Edwards baby, and the werewolf Jacob becomes romantically bonded to that baby.) So whats the best way to handle the cinematic adaptation of such a weird work? Break it into two movies, of course. Summit Entertainment, the movie studio behind the Twilight films, will release the film version of Breaking Dawn as two separate movies, The Hollywood Reporter said. Both will be directed by Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters, Dreamgirls), above, with the first part to be released on Nov. 18, 2011, and the second planned for the following year. The third, less strange movie in the cycle, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse will be released on June 30. The breaking up of Breaking Dawn follows other cinematic literary adaptations that have been divided into two films, including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (which will be released in two parts in 2010 and 2011) and The Hobbit (planned as two films for 2011 and 2012).",2010-06-11T22:20:17+0000

A week after the Bklyn Yard, the popular performance space on the banks of the Gowanus Canal, announced that it was closing, Justin Carter, a D. J. and promoter who has produced weekly events there, said his party, Sunday Best, would continue. Weve worked it out so were going to be able to have a shot at it, Mr. Carter said in an interview. The response that got poured out when people saw the space was shut down was really intense, and we think that people really want to see something happen here. Before the shutdown, Sunday Best had already booked D. J.s for this summer, starting with Dam-Funk this Sunday, who will appear as planned. (Above, the D. J. Michael Mayer at a Sunday Best engagement.) The space, now to be known simply by its address, 400 Carroll Street, has drawn thousands of people over the last four summers for a mix of outdoor dance parties, concerts, fashion and food events, serving as a destination in a developing neighborhood. Mr. Carter would not specify what deal he and his fellow party promoters  the D. J.s Eamon Harkin and Doug Singer  struck with the landlord, but some changes will be made. The space, already sparsely decorated, will be bare bones, Mr. Carter said, though a spinning disco ball will remain.

The lifeboat, above, was first used by the journalist Walter Wellman and his crew in their attempt at the first powered flight across the Atlantic in 1910. They flew for 38 hours before being forced down by engine problems near Bermuda and rescued by a steamer. The boats next mission ended less happily. In 1912 Wellmans chief engineer, Melvin Vaniman, tried to cross the Atlantic on the Akron, the first Goodyear airship. It had barely gotten over water when it exploded, sending the crew members to their deaths. The lifeboat, however, was saved and has been kept in storage by Goodyear since then.

Ms. Osipova had left her money at home and her computer at the Met, but the muggers got away with her point shoes and a small hammer used to shape them. The Met doctor was to examine her on Tuesday, Mr. Danilian said, and would determine whether she could dance full-out during an afternoon rehearsal or would just walk through it. She will absolutely, no doubt, perform on Saturday, he said. The police also interviewed her at the Met, he said.

us,When Titans Clash: Poets Edition,"The carnival that is the election for Oxford Universitys professor of poetry post added another ring this week when one of the 10 remaining candidates, the Beat poet Michael Horovitz, criticized another, the biographer Roger Lewis. The Guardian reported that the dispute was touched off by an essay in The Telegraph written by Mr. Lewis. The essay, titled Now heres what I call poetry, listed details like the color of Elizabeth Taylors eyes, the tilt of Garbos face in profile and the bend of Chaplins cane. In a letter to The Telegraph, Mr. Horovitz wrote that Mr. Lewiss list was at first sight quite intriguing, but contained few allusions to actual poetry. He added: Mr. Lewis could presumably spout the hind legs off a donkey about these subjects, but how does this qualify him to follow Masefield, Auden, Graves and Heaney as the next Professor of Poetry? Mr. Lewis did not immediately respond to Mr. Horovitz. Last week Paula Claire, the only woman in the running this year, withdrew from the race, saying it unfairly favored the poet Geoffrey Hill. Another candidate, Michael George Gibson, questioned Ms. Claires decision, saying last week that she has rather flown off the handle with this one and calling the election a circus.

I rummaged through my bureau looking for who knows what, when I came across a stack of faded-print cotton bandannas (the nostalgic cowboy kind). Perfect! If the Parisians can pull off their origami-like mastery of the scarf, why cant I give it a try? I first folded it in half to make a triangle, then rolled it up tightly,  la Fruit Roll-Up.

As an example of the first, Rob Cook of New York writes that this piece frames overpopulation and environmental destruction in the wrong terms. It assumes that developed countries cannot cut down on consumption. But Last Generation? isnt a piece about overpopulation or environmental destruction, and it makes no assumptions about whether developed countries can cut down on consumption. It just isnt about that question at all. It asks a deeper question, one not dependent on the environmental constraints on our planet, nor on the number of people now on Earth.

At an official announcement ceremony on Thursday, the 2012 Olympic Organizing Committee said that Mr. Daldry would serve as the overall creative director of ceremonies while Mr. Boyle would be the artistic director of the opening ceremony, which is scheduled for July 27. The Guardian said that the two directors would have a budget of 40 million (about $59 million) for a total of four ceremonies during the 2012 games, presumably a little more than Mr. Daldry had to play with as director of Billy Elliot: The Musical.

Some of their practices are outrageous ripoffs-like how they charge so much for text messages (both the sender and the receiver), even though text messages cost them nothing. Or how the purpose of two-year contract is to sell you an expensive phone cheaply, on the premise that you'll pay it off over the next 24 months -- but once you've paid off the phone, your monthly bill doesn't go down.

The design by Grimshaw Architects, published in The Wall Street Journal, calls for a 240-room hotel in the bottom 15 floors for visiting professors and university guests that would also be available to the public. The top floors would be for faculty housing. Opponents of the tower, show above in a rendering as seen from Houston and Greene Streets, have objected to adding a fourth building to the original three-tower modernist design by the architect I. M. Pei. The University Village site received landmark status in 2008. As a result, the universitys plans must be approved by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. On Monday the university is scheduled to make a preliminary presentation to the local community board.

Vallejo Gantner, the artistic director of the New York theater company Performance Space 122, which is producing the show, said in an interview on Thursday that the two artists agreed that Mr. Quinn would withdraw from the project because each of them had different visions. Sometimes collaborations dont work out, and this is one of those times, Mr. Gantner said. Mr. Quinns production of The Crumb Trail at P.S. 122 drew acclaim last year. Neither he nor Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins could immediately be reached for comment. Mr. Jacobs-Jenkinss most recent production was Neighbors, which drew attention for its use of blackface and minstrelsy when the work was presented this winter in the Public Theater Lab series. He will now direct The Octoroon, which is described by P.S. 122 as a bombastic, supertheatrical, full-scale investigation of the intersection of theater and identity politics involving The Octoroon, a 19th-century melodrama by the Irish playwright Dion Boucicault about the residents of a Louisiana plantation and a mixed-race romance. Performances are to begin on Saturday, three days later than originally planned, to give the cast more time to work on the production. The play is scheduled to run through July 3.",2010-06-17T21:52:12+0000

Perhaps sensing an opportunity for a bit of mischief  and to promote his own candidacy for the Oxford position  Michael George Gibson has insinuated himself into the debate with a letter to The Telegraph, a copy of which was also sent to The New York Times. With a poem of his own, Mr. Gibson writes of Mr. Lewis:That Ox.Prof.Po.Candidate, Roger,Is a diss-all-his-rivals old codgerWhose Telegraph prose-hymnProsodically shows himA My Favo rite-Things silly splodger.

Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that the American government should press the Somali military to halt any use of child soldiers and until we have that confirmation, I believe it is inappropriate to continue providing the T.F.G. with security assistance. American officials said they have urged the Somali military not to recruit children but that with few American personnel in Somalia, it is impossible to guarantee this does not happen.

On that day, the summer solstice, the Inquisition forced him to renounce his theories of a Sun-centered planetary system. What a difference a few centuries make. Galileo would no doubt be gratified that on June 20, 2010, in honor of the solstice, a major scientific institution is offering a festival that builds on his work. Thats the American Museum of Natural History, whose Summer Solstice Celebration (the actual solstice is Monday) promises to bring light to any benighted minds  particularly childrens  who might underestimate the Suns importance. Youd be surprised at how many people think the Sun is moving around the Earth, said Suzanne Morris, the museums associate manager of public programs. Theres no chance of making that mistake at the festival, which will include an inflatable planetarium in which museum educators will hold demonstrations illustrating the Earths motion and explaining the summer solstice, which occurs when the tilt of the Earths axis maximizes the hours of daylight. Families can look at the Sun safely through a solar telescope and examine it indirectly (above, right) with a device to observe sunspots. It reflects an image of the Sun onto a piece of paper, so you can see the contrast, Ms. Morris said. In a nod to the Suns cultural importance, the Rose Center for Earth and Space will host an ancient solstice ceremony by members of the Kichwa Nation, a group representing the Andean peoples. Activity stations will demonstrate the Suns power. In what might be called cool chemical reactions, children can make solar prints (images created with chemically treated paper and sunlight) and UV bead bracelets, which turn from white to colored in sunshine. To emphasize that energy is possible without batteries and electric cords, Ms. Morris said, the Arthur Ross Terrace will become a mini Indy 500 for racing solar-powered model cars. She acknowledged that the Sun can be a temperamental guest of honor. Indoor activities, like making Sun models from clay, will take place regardless of weather. And young visitors should come away knowing that whether or not it shows its face, the Sun is undeniably a star. (Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Rose Center, 81st Street and Central Park West, 212-769-5200, amnh.org. Free with suggested museum admission: $16; $12 for ages 62+ and students; $9 for 2 to 12; free for under 2 and members.) LAUREL GRAEBER ",2010-06-18T05:29:18+0000

us,Implacability,"In my recent column on cool, I wrote, ""From Old English to the ages of Chaucer and Shakespeare all the way to the present, cool has been able to mean 'dispassionate, calm, self-composed.' Some of our latter-day cool expressions  'stay cool,' 'play it cool,' 'cool as a cucumber,' 'cool customer'  play off this ancient connotation of implacability."" Catherine Harris e-mails: ""I believe you meant to use imperturbability rather than implacability, describing the calm sense of cool. Someone who is implacable is relentless and unappeasable, not necessarily perpetually unruffled.""   If there's one lesson I learned from many years of reading my illustrious predecessor William Safire, it's to show humility when called out by the Gotcha Gang. In a 1984 column, he introduced the Gotcha Gang as ""that shock troop of Lexicographic Irregulars who specialize in correcting other language mavens."" Safire later revealed the hidden benefit of publicizing Gotchas: ""By ostentatiously wolfing down one slim slice of humble pie, I buy the license to take pops at everybody else for months without appearing to be a wiseguy.""  Let this be my first On Language mea culpa: Harris (along with fellow Gotcha-ers Brian Hoffman, Peter Glasgow and Wade Richardson) rightly questions my use of implacability, which does not quite fit in the context of cool. Imperturbability would indeed have been a better choice, as would the more modern unflappability.  I cop to the malaprop, though my mix-up was not as blatant or farcical as the eponymous Mrs. Malaprop's constant misuse of language in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1775 play ""The Rivals"" (e.g., ""He is the very pineapple of politeness,"" with pineapple standing in for pinnacle). I might have been influenced in my word choice by such cool words as placid and placate, but of course, implacability tends to imply just the opposite, an inability to be made calm.  In my modest defense, the ""relentless, steadfast"" shade of implacability can intersect with the unruffled nature of imperturbability, and in fact the adjectives implacable and imperturbable often appear side by side - or as linguists would say, they can easily ""collocate"" with each other. For instance, the newly published translation of Simone de Beauvoir's ""Second Sex"" by Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier contains a line about ""precise, imperturbable, implacable logic.""  The overlap in usage between the two words doesn't absolve the linguistic error, however. In a vicious dissection of James Fenimore Cooper's many ""literary offenses,"" Mark Twain offered some simple rules for writing as an antidote.

But Larsson, who died in 2004, was recently given a run for his money by the free-market Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek (who died in 1992), thanks to a mighty fist-bump from Glenn Beck. Hayeks classic treatise The Road to Serfdom, first published in the United States in 1944, shot to the No. 1 spot at both Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com after Beck devoted the entire June 8 episode of his television show to the book. A perennial seller for the University of Chicago Press, Hayeks libertarian cri de coeur had already received a big boost from Barack Obama, who has been cited by conservative pundits as the embodiment of the kind of creeping government tyranny that Hayek warned of. After Obamas election, sales went from about 7,000 copies a year to almost 30,000, according to Garrett Kiely, director of the press. After Becks program, the book sold about 60,000 to 70,000 copies in one week. This surge came too late to push the book onto this weeks paperback nonfiction list, which records sales until June 12.

In an earlier description of the film, which is to be directed by Rakesh Ranjan Kumar and will focus on Hitlers final days, its producers said Dear Friend Hitler would reveal the German dictators insecurities, his charisma, his paranoia and his sheer genius.

And in the end, the front-runner won, anyway. On Friday Oxford said that Geoffrey Hill, author of King Log, Mercian Hymns and Without Title, had won the election to become the universitys 44th professor of poetry. Mr. Hill claimed the victory with a commanding lead, winning 1,156 of more than 2,500 votes; the next closest candidate was Michael Horovitz, the Beat poet, who picked up 353 votes. The voting was open to Oxford alumni and academics. Paula Claire, who was the only woman vying for the position this year, predicted the outcome when she pulled out of the election earlier this month, saying it was seriously flawed and too heavily tilted in favor of Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill, an Oxford graduate, is to assume the mantle of poetry professor in the fall, succeeding Christopher Ricks. The post was left open last year after Ruth Padel, the first woman in more than 300 years to win the seat, resigned after it was learned she had alerted reporters to a book describing a decades-old act of sexual harassment that Derek Walcott, a 2009 candidate, was accused of having committed.",2010-06-18T22:08:19+0000

That condition inhibits the duo from performing shows at the highest possible level, the statement says, and it is for that reason and out of respect for their fans that Paul and Art have decided to put the tour on hold. The tour was to have begun on July 3 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and included stops in Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., and Atlantic City. The two played the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in April, where Mr. Garfunkel complained from the stage that his voice was a little elusive.

The movers replaced the window with simple colored panes. It happened very quickly, said Karen Davis, a trustee of First Baptist. Its sad for the church for sure. The proceeds will pay for repairs to the Gothic brick building and to operate a homeless shelter.

Today we will explore a fundamental and almost unbelievable result of Quantum Mechanics (QM) through a set of simple puzzles. This famous result is Bells Interconnectedness Theorem which was discovered by the physicist John Stewart Bell in 1964. Bells theorem has been called by physicist Henry Stapp the most profound discovery of Science. It is profound because it shows that the universe has the property of non-locality: two particles can be light years apart, yet they are linked to each other instantaneously. How instantaneously? Recent measurements have shown that this phenomenon occurs more than 10,000 times the speed of light! In order to show that the universe in non-local, Bell showed that a certain simple and obvious inequality  Bells inequality  is violated. Amazingly, the only math that you need to understand this profound inequality is contained in the following simple problem.",2010-06-21T18:48:39+0000

Ariel Levys profile of Huckabee, in this weeks New Yorker, lines up plenty of reasons why this might be flat wrong, from Huckabees proven inability to raise money or organize a ground game, to his perpetually-simmering war with the conservative establishment, to his tendency to self-pigeonhole (his protests to the contrary notwithstanding) as the candidate of Southern evangelicals and only Southern evangelicals. (Theres also the fact that he might just be happier as a well-compensated entertainer than as a politician.) But Levy also captures many of the qualities that make Huckabee more formidable than many handicappers acknowledge: His immense charm and relentless niceness, his intense bond with one of the G.O.P.s largest constituencies, his high favorable numbers among Republican voters and his strength in early polls.

Mr. Parker was hired even though New York Public Radio is still a bit more than two-thirds of the way toward raising $15 million for the acquisition and start-up costs. Laura R.

The sternly chic British architect began wearing mannish suits as a fashion editor at glossies like Tatler and British Vogue. Then, in the late 1980s, she quit her editorial job and went to architecture school. Sure, high fashion frustrated her. (Madonna, at the very last moment, once bailed on a big photo shoot that Hicks had dreamed up with Azzedine Alaa.) But Hickss concerns about the industry went deeper. I was only 26, and I started seeing fashion go in circles, she says, noting that the legends she worked alongside  like Grace Coddington  must have seen the same things go around 12 dozen times. Hickss biography has fabulous footnotes: She appeared in a Fellini film (Intervista, in 1986), designed a Picasso exhibit for the Royal Academy of Arts, and made a perfume bottle for Paul Smith. Her most famous buildings are, perhaps predictably, fashion boutiques. She has designed shops for Yohji Yamamoto in Paris, Paul Smith in London and 100 or so Chlo stores, including flagships in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong. Today, shes at work on a small home in South Kensington. For that building, shes invented a geometric building block with the British brick maker Ibstock.

The novel, called Annexed, and written by Sharon Dogar, is told from the point of view of Peter van Pels, a teenage son of the Dutch family called the van Daans in Annes diaries. A report published Sunday in The Times of London said the novel included scenes of Peter yearning for and having a physically intimate relationship with Anne. But the books depiction of Anne and Peter was disputed by Buddy Elias, Annes only living relative. Anne was not the child she is in this book, Mr. Elias told The Times. I also do not think that their terrible destiny should be used to invent some fictitious story. In an interview with The Guardian, Ms. Dogar said she had corresponded with Mr. Elias about the project and said the novel did not overemphasize Annes sexuality. The sexual awakening of Anne plays more of a major part in her diary than this book, she said. The United States publication of Annexed is planned for Oct. 4 by Houghton Mifflin Books for Children.",2010-06-22T22:17:15+0000

But no general is indispensable. What is indispensable is that when taking America surging deeper into war in Afghanistan, President Obama has to be able to answer the most simple questions at a gut level: Do our interests merit such an escalation and do I have the allies to achieve victory? President Obama never had good answers for these questions, but he went ahead anyway. The ugly truth is that no one in the Obama White House wanted this Afghan surge. The only reason they proceeded was because no one knew how to get out of it  or had the courage to pull the plug. That is not a sufficient reason to take the country deeper into war in the most inhospitable terrain in the world. You know youre in trouble when youre in a war in which the only party whose objectives are clear, whose rhetoric is consistent and whose will to fight never seems to diminish is your enemy: the Taliban.

The carbohydrates in the drinks provide immediate fuel, which allows our bodies to avoid dipping into its own energy stores, meaning that, theoretically, you can exercise longer or more intensively before running out of fuel. But few people, in practice, can or will drink enough calories during a long workout to benefit significantly, the study authors suggest. The volume of fluid needed is, to say the least, daunting. Achieving the ideal carbohydrate-intake rates, the authors write, requires toting and stomaching about a half gallon of a typical sports drink every hour.

The book was a simple thing about four weeks in the city we grew up in and for the most part was an accurate portrayal. It was labeled fiction but only a few detailshad been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened. For example, there actually had been a screening of a snuff film in that bedroom in Malibu on a January afternoon, and yes, I had walked out onto the deck overlooking the Pacific where the author tried to console me, assuring me that the screams of the children being tortured were faked, but he was smiling as he said this and I had to turn away. Other examples: my girlfriend had in fact run over a coyote in the canyons below Mulholland, and a Christmas Eve dinner at Chasen's with my family that I had casually complained about to the author was faithfully rendered. And a twelve-year-old girl really had been gang-raped  I was in that room in West Hollywood with the writer, who in the book noted just a vague reluctance on my part and failed to accurately describe how I had actually felt that night  the desire, the shock, how afraid I was of the writer, a blond and isolated boy whom the girl I was dating had halfway fallen in love with. But the writer would never fully return her love because he was too lost in his own passivity to make the connection she needed from him, and so she had turned to me, but by then it was too late, and because the writer resented that she had turned to me I becamethe handsome and dazed narrator, incapable of love or kindness. That's how I became the damaged party boy who wandered through the wreckage, blood streaming from his nose, asking questions that never required answers. That's how I became the boy who never understoodhow anything worked. That's how I became the boy who wouldn't save a friend. That's how I became the boy who couldn't love the girl.",2010-06-23T22:32:08+0000

The lawsuit, filed by Nederlander Presentations last Thursday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, came two months after the Jackson estate announced a deal with Cirque du Soleil, the acrobatic-theater company, to create two shows based on Jacksons music. Whether the lawsuit is a direct response to the Cirque deal is unclear: James Nederlander Jr., who is pursuing the court action, declined to comment through a spokesman. A lawyer for the Jackson estate, Howard Weitzman, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the Cirque deal had no bearing on the Nederlander musical project because Cirque shows are not musicals but rather big arena, circuslike spectaculars. In 2008 Nederlander Presentations signed a contract with a production company of Jacksons, obtaining exclusive rights through October 2011 to develop a musical based on selected Jackson songs, with an option to extend through October 2013. Mr. Nederlander is also seeking songs that Jackson may have written for the musical; the civil suit does not indicate whether he wrote any such compositions.",2010-06-24T05:37:44+0000

us,Next Fall To Close On July 4,"The little-show-that-could couldnt make it on Broadway after all. The producers of the play Next Fall said the production would close at the Helen Hayes Theater on July 4, after 26 previews and 132 regular performances. Next Fall cost about $2 million to mount, and one of its lead producers, Richard Willis, said the show would close at a total loss to its producers and investors. A comedy-drama by Geoffrey Nauffts about a gay couple starring Patrick Heusinger, above left, and Patrick Breen, right, wrestling with religious differences and interfering family and friends, Next Fall was something of a test case for new plays without well-known cast members trying to make a go of it on Broadway. The play received strong reviews from several theater critics, and enjoyed publicity when Elton John and his partner David Furnish signed on as producer-presenters. (Their names were splashed all over advertising materials.) But in the end the audience did not build. The producers had hoped for recognition at the Tony Awards on June 13, but Next Fall lost out to another new play, Red, for best play and best director of the play, the two categories in which it drew nominations.",2010-06-24T05:43:38+0000

Since it was demonstrated that the escalating popularity of the scheduled artists can result in crowds that exceed even the safe capacity of the Pier 17 concert stage, both Paper magazine and the South Street Seaport have decided that the remaining events of the Sounds Like Paper concert series will be relocated, a seaport spokesman said in a statement, which was confirmed by Paper. In a letter to Community Board No. 1 of Manhattan last week, General Growth Properties, which owns the seaport, had said the two remaining shows, by the pop singer Kesha, above right, and the band Ratatat, would be canceled. The Seaports outdoor concert space has a capacity of about 10,000, but according to some reports, as many as 25,000 people turned out for the Drake concert on June 15. It was not clear whether a new stage had been found, or whether the seaport would be involved. Kesha, whose song Tik Tok is one of the years biggest hits, had been booked for a free Seaport concert in August, but a spokeswoman at her record label, RCA, said Thursday that she had not yet been informed about a new date or location.

Eight lawmakers from the oldest pro-democracy political group, the Democratic Party, joined pro-Beijing parties to support the measure. A ninth, Andrew Cheng, resigned from the party this week in protest and joined lawmakers from the Civic Party and minor pro-democracy parties to oppose the measure as too small a step toward greater voting rights for Hong Kongs seven million people.

Id done an event in New Zealand at a very large auditorium, hundreds of people, and I was kind of pleased with it; it had gone well. A woman came up to me afterwards, a medievalist at the university there, and she said, Have you heard of the humility topos? I said no. She explained that, in the medieval era, humility was seen as a great virtue. The humility topos was used for these abbots  you can think of a good one in Ecos Name of the Rose  who were actually monsters of arrogance, but were always banging on about how humble they were  Just like our lord Jesus Christ.

Ms. Winfreys forthcoming cable channel, OWN, has been holding online and in-person casting calls for Your OWN Show: Oprahs Search for the Next TV Star, a reality show that will have its premiere next year. Last week the search was tainted by allegations from fans of the top two online candidates, Zach Anner and Phyllis Wick-Turner, that the other side had stuffed the online ballot box. Some even suggested that Ms. Winfrey was behind it. The allegations, picked up by the news media, prompted a channel spokesperson to say in a statement that no contestant has been favored in this competition, but that an investigation would be undertaken and that all votes would be verified twice. The five most popular online contestants will go before a casting director, but only one is guaranteed a spot on the reality show, though OWN could choose to add more than one. A total of 10 in-person and online contestants will vie for a spot; eventually the shows winner will be hired by OWN.

Not to be omitted from the global Jackson remembrances, more than 900 prisoners at Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center assembled on Saturday to dance to Jacksons songs, including They Dont Really Care About Us, Billie Jean and, of course, Thriller, Agence France-Presse reported. Judge Geraldine Faith Econg, who led a delegation of jurists to the two-hour event, told Agence France-Presse: This will set an example to other rehabilitation centers in the country. It will also give people a different view of the inmates. Mils Bonnen, a teacher from Denmark who was among the 500 visitors who came to watch the performance by convicted murderers, rapists and drug dealers, told the news agency: It was a wonderful presentation.

Last summer Mr. Brown was sentenced to six months of community labor and five years of probation after pleading guilty to felonious assault on the pop star Rihanna, an incident that seemed to leave his career in tatters. But at the BET Awards, which were held in Los Angeles, Mr. Brown took center stage as part of a tribute to Michael Jackson. During his performance of Man in the Mirror Mr. Brown frequently became choked up and at one point fell to his knees. Though many viewers accused Mr. Brown of usurping what was supposed to be an honor for Mr. Jackson, Mr. Brown had the last word when he was announced as the surprise winner of BETs Fandemonium award, a prize determined by fan votes.

Specifically, he inspired one of his countrymen  Roberto Stern, the president and creative director of the jeweler H. Stern  to bring out a collection of jewelry that was inspired by the maestros sketches of buildings (including one of Brasilia, Niemeyers masterpiece), flowers and even the female form. The H. Stern Collection by Oscar Niemeyer, which was created in collaboration with the architect, captures the sketches light, flowing lines and their general joie de vivre. Niemeyers sketch for the exuberantly-curved roof of a church in Pampulha, Belo Horizonte, for example, was translated into a pair of white gold and diamond earrings. An almost childlike drawing of a flower became a graceful, delicate bracelet made of what seems like a single, slender ribbon of yellow gold. The jeweler is known for its creative collaborations, like those with Diane von Furstenberg, the Campana brothers and even Disney (on the surreal-luxe Alice in Wonderland collection). But was Niemeyer surprised by Roberto Sterns request to turn his architectural sketches into rings and necklaces? Not at all.

Never mind that the store stocks only the fall ready-to-wear collection; the tile floors and exotic flora in the garden lend plenty of beachy vibes.Chanel in St. Tropez, 25 rue Franois Sibilli; open from June 23 to Oct. 3, 2010.

The painting, below, called The Taking of Christ or The Kiss of Judas, was made by Caravaggio in the early 17th century, and depicts Jesus and his apostles John and Judas as they are being separated by soldiers.

I was quite frightened of doing this. Ive been asked several times, and its daunting to talk about yourself. It gets to the soft spots inside you. On Tuesday the Crown Archetype imprint of Random Houses Crown Publishing division said that it would release a memoir by Ms. Eden, called Jeannie Out of the Bottle, in the spring of 2011. As its title implies, the book will have its share to say about I Dream of Jeannie, in which Ms. Eden played the mystically empowered title character from 1965 to 1970. Shell have a big voice in this story, Ms. Eden said, but a lot went on before Jeannie. Ms. Eden, who is working with a collaborator, Wendy Leigh, on the memoir, said they had a few more soul-baring sessions planned before the manuscript is complete.

The railroad was the original information superhighway, bringing mail and newspapers, other cultures and foods to the remote West; railroad songs are the viral videos of the 19th century. Studying them I learned about attitudes and motivations particular to that time and place.

In an interview with The Telegraph, Mr. Nunn, who with John Caird directed the original Royal Shakespeare Company production of Les Misrables, which opened at the Barbican Theater in London in 1985, said he and his original collaborators felt betrayed by Mr. Mackintoshs hiring of new directors for a revival of the show planned at the Barbican for September. We were not asked, said Mr. Nunn, whose Broadway credits include the current revival of A Little Night Music. In fact, we knew nothing of it. Mr. Mackintosh, who brought in the directors James Powell and Laurence Conner to handle the anniversary revival of Les Misrables, said in a statement that he was saddened by Nunns inaccurate and ungracious remarks.
