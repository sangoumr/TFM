Asmussen, riding Riki Diamond, won the mile-and-a-half Golden Boots in 2:27.8, beating Ichino Amuse with the popular Japanese jockey Yutaka Take by a head. In the Golden Spur Trophy race, Osumi Night, ridden by Carson, burst from the middle of the pack into the lead in the homestretch to win by neck over Tsurumaru Shingeki, ridden by Hiroshi Kawachi of Japan. (AP) Dog Show Corgi Is Best: A 4-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Ch. Roughouse Pennington's Daryl, owned by Blandie and Maitland Ijams and Ed and Carol Blakely, was gaited by Mike Scott to top honors at the Kennel Club of Philadelphia's 96th show yesterday in the city's Civic Center. Derek Rayne was the judge who chose Daryl as the best of 2,719 dogs. The Philadelphia club, organized in 1879, five years before the American Kennel Club, is one of the oldest in the country. N.B.A. Bulls 120, Cavaliers 85: Michael Jordan, shooting better than 70 percent for the third consecutive game, scored 13 first-quarter points as Chicago jumped to a 17-point lead and won in Richfield, Ohio, last night. It was Cleveland's most lopsided home loss under Lenny Wilkens, in his fifth year as coach. The victory was the Bulls' fifth in a row, and their sixth in succession against the Cavaliers. Chicago was 5-0 against Cleveland last season. Jordan, who scored 32 points before resting for the final 10 minutes, was 13 of 18 from the field, 72 percent. In his last three games, he has shot 39 of 52, 75 percent. (AP) Warriors 137, Heat 111: Chris Mullin made all 11 of his shots and all 5 of his free throws, scoring 28 points for Golden State at Miami. Mullin, who attempted only one shot in the second half and sat out the fourth period, set a team record for most field goals in a game without a miss. The old mark was 8, set by Tom Abernethy against Denver on Oct. 16, 1979. (AP) Bullets 94, Pistons 83: Washington, playing at home in Landover, Md., ended Detroit's winning streak at 10 games, getting 8 points from Harvey Grant in a 19-4 third-quarter run before holding off a late Pistons rally. (AP) 76ers 116, Celtics 110: Charles Barkley scored a season-high 37 points and Hersey Hawkins added 24 as Philadelphia snapped Boston's winning streak at eight games. Rickey Green added 19 points, including 7 in the last 1:55, while Mike Gminski had 7 blocked shots. (AP) N.H.L. Oilers 4, Whalers 2: Joe Murphy had a goal and an assist and Craig Simpson scored a power-play goal as Edmonton won in Hartford. Simpson's goal at 1:52 of the second period gave the Oilers a 3-0 lead. The Whalers closed to 3-2 on goals by Pat Verbeek and Bobby Holik, but Murphy scored at 7:50 of the second period to end the Whalers' rally. (AP) Red Wings 4, Blackhawks 3: Bob Probert and Shawn Burr scored power-play goals to help Detroit build a 4-0 lead and the Red Wings withstood a three-goal third-period rally by the Blackhawks in Chicago. Detroit won its fifth consecutive game by scoring all its goals in the first 25:40. (AP)",1990-12-02T05:00:00+0000

us,BUSINESS DIARY/November 25-30,"THE ECONOMY Fed Sets the Record Straight on the Economy: It Is in Decline The nation's top inflation-fighter now has bigger worries. For the first time since he took office in 1987, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has said that the economy is in decline. Addressing a House committee on Wednesday, he stopped just short of calling the downturn that began in October a recession. ""It may get there,"" he said the next day, mindful that a recession technically requires two straight quarters of decline. He is not about to panic. ""The world out there when you look at the hard data is not in as bad shape as it feels,"" he told Congress. And asked whether he would cut interest rates, he was strenuously noncommittal. But economists have little doubt that more generous Fed policies are in store. As William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds, put it, ""When the man comes down from Mount Olympus and says we're in a meaningful downturn, that's significant. It clears up all doubt about where the Fed stands."" An Economic Oxymoron Maybe they should call them the lagging indicators. The index of leading indicators released on Friday signaled a recession, after everyone had already agreed that the economy has turned down. A 1.2 percent decline for October and a slight adjustment to yield a negative reading for July mean the index has dropped four months in a row; the accepted recession signal is three. Economists, with a glance at their charts, are quick to point out that the index forecasted a recession after the 1987 stock market crash. None occurred. This time, the indicators are merely late. The G.N.P. and the Gulf The third-quarter figure for the gross national product suggests that the economy only reversed course after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The G.N.P. grew at a 1.7 percent rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported last week, a tenth of a point lower than its earlier estimate. Mr. Greenspan said the decline began in October, mostly because of the crisis in the Middle East. Freeing the Banks Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady proposed allowing banks and securities firms to merge and letting banks expand across state lines. Mr. Brady, with the President's backing, is preparing legislation to overhaul the banking system and repeal many of the restrictions in effect since the Depression. The regulatory structure ""is outmoded, burdensome and inefficient,"" he said. ""And its flaws are an unseen contributor to our financial institutions' current difficulties."" He said he is worried about the financial industry's declining profits and its ability to counter rivals from abroad. Credit Squeeze Beware a December squeeze in short-term credit. When the bond market curiously weakened for a couple days after Mr. Greenspan said the economy was in decline, some economists said banks were choking off much of the credit they usually provide for trading securities. The banks want to look as sound as possible at year-end, Neal M. Soss, the First Boston chief economist, said. ""If bankers in normal times like to window-dress their balance sheets,"" he said, ""imagine what will happen after the turmoil of the last year."" In Brief President Bush said on Friday that he might waive trade restrictions and send food to help the Soviet Union through the winter. Germany has taken the lead in shipping supplies. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed allowing savings and loans to convert to state-chartered savings banks. For the Downwardly Mobile A publication for the 1990's: Pauper, with the initial quarterly issue this spring to feature ""articles about poor celebrities, bankrupt businesses, failed financial institutions, tips on frugal living, personal issues on the culture of poverty and, hopefully, lots of advertising aimed at the low end of the down-scale market."" Richard Grayson, an unemployed Fort Lauderdale, Fla., computer teacher and the magazine's publisher, editor and staff, swears his plans are no joke. But his press release sounds suspiciously parodistic, saying that a Pauper 400 list will answer the lists of the super-rich in ""wealth-oriented magazines."" Mr. Grayson has his own woes. He said he was laid off in the Dade County schools' budget cuts, his unemployment insurance has run out and he supports himself with a temporary job teaching English. He doubts the publication -- ""a kitchen-table job"" -- will make him rich. INTERNATIONAL",1990-12-02T05:00:00+0000

Bennett, who is to become Republican national chairman.

Magic Johnson, guarded by 7-foot-3-inch Randy Breuer, shot 6 for 22 from the field and scored 21 points to become the 40th player in league history to reach the 16,000-point plateau. He and Oscar Robertson are the only two players with 16,000 points and 9,000 assists in their careers. The Timberwolves, who shot 41 percent and scored a season-low point total, lost for the ninth time in the last 12 games.

Montreal's power play is the worst in the league, with 17 goals in 137 chances.

Ever since Methuselah exhibited his remarkable longevity, we have strained every scientific nerve to edge closer to his record. Yet our youth-smitten society frequently regards getting old as something rather gauche. Worse still, a growing number of graying citizens seem to concur. Fortunately, there are dissenting views, and seldom have they been expounded more persuasively -- and engagingly -- than in this sampler of Eda LeShan's syndicated ""Life Over Sixty"" columns. As hinted in the title, ""It's Better to Be Over the Hill Than Under It,"" Ms. LeShan, a sixtysomething wife, mother and child psychologist, sees our elongated life spans less as a problem than as a privilege, at least considering the alternative. The overall message is that even if after 60 some of the best may be behind us, what's left can be pretty good. She introduces us to a 92-year-old man who has trouble finding chess partners because he beats the pants off most of them. And there are the childhood sweethearts who went their different ways, only to rekindle their romance -- after the age of 90. This book is no starry-eyed paean to the ""golden years."" All Ms. LeShan offers is a guide to turning what Cicero called ""our play's last act"" into a thing that merits some applause.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE EFFIGY: Stories. By Joan Millman. (University of Missouri, $14.95.) Composed with wit and economy, ""The Effigy"" is a slim collection of eight sharply observed vignettes, many suffused with undertones of rue. In the title story, an illiterate widow gains enough of a sense of selfhood by learning to read that she is finally free to act out her long-suppressed resentment of the husband she dutifully mourns. In ""Custody,"" the narrator's wife, a compulsive dieter, ""scarcely dents the bed, leaves little ripples where I make large waves. . . . Her body has no hair, her hair no body."" At his daughter's wedding, his sense of loss is acute: ""Flick off fathering in a mere ceremony? Caring is not as hard as pretending not to."" Leo, the shoe salesman in ""Where Touching Is a Talent,"" lives for the Thursday nights he spends at Roseland. He married Sophie because she ""talked only when Leo wanted . . . and never while dancing, as reverent as in temple. A scented hanky soaked up the sweat of their palms and her breath was Wrigley's sweet."" But Sophie lost interest in the rest of life when she failed to conceive a child: ""her spirit ran out with her monthly flow."" In contrast, Renie Dugan in ""Equations"" has been engaged for 12 years to a vacillating lover. ""Her trousseau saw her through every vagary of fashion, from mini to midcalf to midknee. . . . the hems going up and down with her hopes."" But when her engagement ring drops through the drain in the sink, she lets herself ""slip from its noose."" The hallmark of this gifted writer's prose is the trenchant phrase that uses few words to suggest whole paragraphs. Not all of Joan Millman's stories are of equal quality, but their stylistic flair makes her first collection of stories a pleasure to read.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Until fairly recently, he'd been the reluctant prophet to some lost souls calling themselves the Er, who gathered around him in southwestern Utah's Escalante Desert. A need to mythologize his father's suicide made him ""slipshod with his theological adjectives."" His father's walk into ""absolute light,"" Vance's phrase for a nuclear test blast, wasn't the Lord's inspiration but the Government's joke -- the only way for this hapless soldier, dying of cancer, to secure a combat pension. It's taken Vance three years after leaving the cult, his wife and his baby, to scrape ""the film of sanctity from his bloodshot eyes."" Now he's returning to the town of Roadside Business to become ""a solid citizen, husband, and father."" The novel's flaw, ironically, is Vance's own. Mr. Doane, too, plays fast and loose with theological images, which suffuse the narrative. Despite the theological fallout, however, ""Roadside Business"" lives most strongly not in the realm of the absolute, but in the absolutely ordinary: in Vance's courtship, his clumsy re-entry into fatherhood, his often hilarious talks with the kind of neighbors who forgive him for those ""hippie scum, vandals, dog-eating voodoo trash"" he used to hang around with. Deftly interwoven into these vignettes is the story of Vance's naive father. Like Vance, the novel finally rises above its mythic inclinations to embrace that most humble of splendors, everyday reality. Michael Doane is surely writer and thinker enough to produce a Faulknerian novel of theological scope, but ""Six Miles to Roadside Business"" is as earthbound as its title suggests -- and doesn't need to be more.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BO KNOWS BO: The Autobiography of a Ballplayer. By Bo Jackson and Dick Schaap. (Doubleday, $18.95.) Since we have heard little else about him these last few years, there is a tendency to view Bo Jackson as living the athletically charmed American life: a versatile athlete, a standout at Auburn University, a Heisman Trophy winner, husband, father, hitter of tape-measure home runs, able to leap tall obstacles with a single bound. ""Bo Knows Bo,"" Mr. Jackson's autobiography (written with the sports journalist Dick Schaap), gives a personal view of this man with many helmets. Growing up black in the South presented challenges that athletics could not answer; not everything in Mr. Jackson's life has been sweetness, light and Nike endorsements. This affecting and brightly written memoir tells us that Vincent Edward Jackson, born in 1962 in Alabama, had an angry, tempestuous spirit. As a child he was called ""Bo'-hog,"" soon shortened to Bo; he was a bully who could steal anything from lunch money to bicycles but ""couldn't steal a father."" Mr. Jackson speaks with savvy eloquence and is refreshingly matter-of-fact. For example, he says that ""too many athletes allow colleges to mislead them. . . . It takes the dignity out of college athletics when you have a guy playing football who can't spell football."" Clearly and guilelessly, he gives a rueful, heartfelt message about children. ""I always want to be somebody they can look up to,"" Mr. Jackson says. ""I wish I'd had somebody to look up to when I was a kid."" Clearly, Bo knows writing, too.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE BEST AMERICAN ESSAYS 1990. Edited by Justin Kaplan and Robert Atwan. (Ticknor & Fields, $19.95.) It is hard to imagine any essay published last year more moving than Natalie Kusz's account of being mauled by a dog at the age of 7, or as grotesquely hilarious as Ann Hodgman's description in Spy magazine of taste-testing different brands of dog food, or as insightful as Stephen Jay Gould's examination of the origins of baseball -- which somehow comes to be a commentary on the abortion debate. The biographer Justin Kaplan and Robert Atwan, the editor of the ""Best American Essays"" series, have brought together 21 distinctive essays that make fair claim to being the year's best. Choosing, Mr. Atwan says, ""public, rather than personal, essays"" by writers who ""move between the topical requirements of an article and the literary demands of an essay"" -- or, as Mr. Kaplan puts it, ""between stunt flying and scheduled air traffic"" -- the editors have achieved an eclectic blend of the solemn and the laid-back, the incisive and the discursive. Here we have Joseph Epstein on the value of envy, Sue Hubbell on Elvis sightings in Kalamazoo, Leonard Michaels on the ""R"" word (relationships), Michael Pollan on lawn care -- or, rather, lawn neglect. Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Atwan have found writers with a gift for the memorable phrase (""My existence,"" says Anatole Broyard after learning he has cancer of the prostate, ""had taken on a kind of meter, as in poetry, or in taxis"") and for the memorable incident: Stanley Elkin describing his meeting with Hubert Humphrey, Randy Shilts describing a roomful of uneaten salads. Probably the hallmark entry in the book is the final one, Tom Wolfe's piece for Harper's on the American novel, which Mr. Kaplan describes as ""surely one of the noisier literary events of 1989."" Provocative, self-serving, eminently refutable (printed here, unfortunately, without the letters Harper's received in response), Mr. Wolfe's is a piece that can best be described as effective. As all these essays are, each in its own way.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"BOUNDARIES OF LOVE: And Other Stories. By Henry H. Roth. (British American, $17.95.) ""Life,"" warns one of Henry H. Roth's characters, ""never gives us enough time to rearrange ourselves with another person."" In ""Boundaries of Love,"" the New York playwright and novelist plucks at that theme through a series of 19 short stories. The collection covers a wide range of subjects, including psychotherapy, friends and families, academia, even stand-up comedy. With finely honed perception, Mr. Roth dissects ordinary aspects of experience to expose life in an intense moment: the stories record an inventory of missed opportunities and wild, everyday exhilarations. Mr. Roth's sharp sense of when to end a story and his instincts about the precise status of an event in a life make his narratives both judicious and well balanced. The most successful explore the tension of relationships built on how people square with the world (""Dealing"" and ""Colleagues""), the poignant communion between two cancer patients (""This Time"") and a life-changing experience on the Broadway local that takes place when a confident woman confesses to her friend, ""I have this ineffable sadness."" But occasionally the technique misses, as in ""Other People,"" which fails to set up a cohesive scene, or in the psychologically weak tinkering of ""Joe's Dead."" Mr. Roth's stories are haunted by Joyce, de Maupassant and O. Henry. In the final story, he pays tribute to Chekhov in a curious meditation on the great Russian writer's last days at Badenweiler, a story that frames another piece, ""The Samovar,"" which begins: ""Is the samovar absolutely necessary to a social gathering?""",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

The nation's fifth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday while assuring passengers and travel agents that it would continue to do business as usual. The last time the airline filed for bankruptcy was in 1983, in the grip of a strike, and it resumed operating at a fraction of its former size. Continental's current problems are the huge debts created by Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman, and the high oil prices that have accompanied the Mideast crisis. ""I think the creditors understand that this bankruptcy is substantially different,"" said Thomas Longman, an analyst at Bear Stearns. ""I don't see any reason to think they will be out of business."" It helps that under Hollis L. Harris, the current chairman, Continental has taught cabin attendants to treat passengers better than the baggage. Talley's Tally From corporate headquarters in Phoenix came word that Talley Industries Inc. would eliminate its quarterly 12 1/2-cent dividend. From the board meeting in Miami came word that the dividend would be paid. Turns out that the company's clever administrators had written press releases to suit every possible board decision. Fortunately for stockholders, the Miami announcement was right. Yes, There Will Be a Macy's R.H. Macy & Company took out a full-page advertisement last week to say it can survive the Christmas season without ""miracles on 34th Street."" ""We expect it to be slow and we are prepared for it,"" wrote Edward S. Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive. Macy's is bowed under $5 billion in debt and mounting losses. The ad, in Women's Wear Daily, might have worried the very suppliers and creditors it was supposed to reassure. In the movie, ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" after all, a headline-conscious Macy's executive says he believes in Santa Claus. Fed Helps Banks to a Hold You can't just tell bankers to make more loans. You have to offer them money. After months of urging the banks to stoke the economy by loosening credit, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday came up with an incentive. The Fed eliminated a requirement that banks hold in reserves 3 percent of their corporate certificates of deposit. The action frees about $13 billion for new lending, and is expected to increase bank profits by about $1 billion a year, mostly at the largest institutions. Bank stocks jumped from dismal levels to merely low, as some industry analysts upgraded their recommendations from sell to hold. Sandoz Cuts a Price, a Bit No blood, no drug. That had been the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation's profitable slogan. The company forced schizophrenia victims to buy a blood-monitoring rig that pushed the cost of treatment with the drug clozapine to $8,944 a year. Many Federal and state hospitals ruled the drug out instead of paying such a price. Under pressure from Congress and advocates for the mentally ill, the Swiss-owned company has agreed to sell the drug alone, cutting the price to about $5,000 in the United States. That's still much higher than the government-controlled prices of $2,500 in Germany and $1,000 in Britain. <",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,The City as Game Board,"CITY PLAY. By Amanda Dargan and Steven Zeitlin. (Rutgers University, $24.95.) Whether it's skelly or skateboards, New York City children have been exploding through doorways since there were doorways to explode through. Out on the street, in parks or on sidewalks, children have displayed immense resourcefulness in their determination to have fun. Amanda Dargan, director of folk arts at the Queens Council on the Arts, and Steven Zeitlin, director of City Lore, a New York cultural studies group, hurtle ""the triviality barrier"" as they detail various aspects of city play, from the historical -- kite flying below 14th Street was illegal by the mid-19th century -- to the ridiculous -- early 20th-century reformers once gave bowling a 77.1 percent ranking on a wholesomeness scale. The pictures, by Martha Cooper, Arthur Leipzig and dozens of other photographers, are the main attraction here. Their black-and-white brilliance shows more than a century of exuberant children riding homemade go-carts, raising pigeons, jumping rope and unleashing fire hydrants. A block at a time, a stoop at a time, a face at a time, several generations of artists and photographers have captured a startling diversity of children and amusements, documenting the street as both playground and ""test kitchen for new urban cultural forms."" New York is such a grown-up place that sometimes we forget children are just as goal-oriented as adults. The goal is fun. ""City Play"" is both reminder and suggestion.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"A WOMAN OF OUR TIMES. By Rosie Thomas. (Bantam, $19.95.) Harriet Trott is foundering in a dead-end retailing career and an equally moribund marriage when she goes in search of the father she never knew -- and is given not a new name but a new game. After a few false starts (including a hilarious turn at a trade show for toys), Harriet parlays that game into a successful company, setting the London business world on its ear. But now, having set the reader up to expect just another lucky-in-business-unlucky-in-love romantic saga, complete with syrupy title and obligatory introductory flashback, Rosie Thomas proceeds to deliver much more. First of all, there's Harriet's game -- a truly interesting combination of skill and luck with a built-in history. It was literally made from rubbish by a British Army officer desperate to keep his sanity during a four-year stint in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. To capitalize on that history, Harriet christens the game Meizu, the Japanese word for labyrinth. Then there's the novel's plot, which also refuses to follow conventional twists and turns (Harriet jets across the Atlantic, marshaling all her forces to fight a corporate takeover . . . and loses). Finally, the author allows her characters to voice mature views on such subjects as friendship and guilt. They even (gasp) take responsibility for their own actions, and with nary a therapist in sight. Rosie Thomas's previous novel, ""Bad Girls, Good Women,"" was the kind of fluffy nonsense that gives so-called women's books a bad name. Ms. Thomas's talent for picking titles hasn't improved any, but her ability to tell a story certainly has.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SIX MILES TO ROADSIDE BUSINESS. By Michael Doane. (Knopf, $19.95.) Vance Ravel, the protagonist of Michael Doane's third novel, is struggling to reclaim his life. Until fairly recently, he'd been the reluctant prophet to some lost souls calling themselves the Er, who gathered around him in southwestern Utah's Escalante Desert. A need to mythologize his father's suicide made him ""slipshod with his theological adjectives."" His father's walk into ""absolute light,"" Vance's phrase for a nuclear test blast, wasn't the Lord's inspiration but the Government's joke -- the only way for this hapless soldier, dying of cancer, to secure a combat pension. It's taken Vance three years after leaving the cult, his wife and his baby, to scrape ""the film of sanctity from his bloodshot eyes."" Now he's returning to the town of Roadside Business to become ""a solid citizen, husband, and father."" The novel's flaw, ironically, is Vance's own. Mr. Doane, too, plays fast and loose with theological images, which suffuse the narrative. Despite the theological fallout, however, ""Roadside Business"" lives most strongly not in the realm of the absolute, but in the absolutely ordinary: in Vance's courtship, his clumsy re-entry into fatherhood, his often hilarious talks with the kind of neighbors who forgive him for those ""hippie scum, vandals, dog-eating voodoo trash"" he used to hang around with. Deftly interwoven into these vignettes is the story of Vance's naive father. Like Vance, the novel finally rises above its mythic inclinations to embrace that most humble of splendors, everyday reality. Michael Doane is surely writer and thinker enough to produce a Faulknerian novel of theological scope, but ""Six Miles to Roadside Business"" is as earthbound as its title suggests -- and doesn't need to be more.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Cleveland Amory's first book about his cat, Polar Bear -- ""The Cat Who Came for Christmas"" -- was such a sensation that Polar Bear became something of an overnight celebrity. ""The Cat and the Curmudgeon"" is the latest installment in the continuing saga of how a mature curmudgeon copes with the tribulations of, as the author would say, being owned by a cat who, truth be told, is a curmudgeon himself: administering pills, trips to and visits from the vet, walks in the park and romance (human curmudgeon to woman, not cat to cat), to name a few. Especially trying for Mr. Amory is Polar Bear's method of dealing with his new celebrity -- more specifically, the fact that he doesn't deal with it at all, but instead ignores it entirely. Being ""a very Republican cat,"" Polar Bear dislikes change, especially in the form of meeting new people, doing press interviews or signing the occasional autograph -- things he's never done before and he doesn't intend to take up now. Mr. Amory even consults the stars, in the form of cat astrology books, to understand his companion better. In the end, however, all he really needs to understand is that Polar Bear is, like the author, a curmudgeon of the first order. Aside from Mr. Amory's naive (and curmudgeonly) anti-hunter diatribe in a sometimes annoying chapter on the well-meaning but somewhat misguided Fund for Animals (an anti-cruelty society that Mr. Amory founded in 1967), this is a witty, wonderful book with universal appeal for anyone who has been owned by a pet -- and even those who haven't.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

Elegies to Bad Times","DISTANT FRIENDS. By Greg Johnson. (Ontario Review Press, $17.95.) The short stories in this debut collection by Greg Johnson have a breathtaking cumulative power. Beginning with ""Crazy Ladies,"" in which an 11-year-old boy's encounter with a locally renowned eccentric illuminates the puzzling changes overtaking his seemingly conventional family, the author establishes an elegiac tone that carries throughout the entire volume. Many of the stories in ""Distant Friends"" are retrospective looks at unsettling, even brutal, childhood experiences. An outstanding example is ""The Burning,"" which opens with an adult narrator recalling himself as a 10-year-old boy -- in a hospital bed recovering from numerous broken bones, his face ""so swollen with bruises that it resembles an overripe plum."" The narrator traces the events leading up to his battering, citing his father's progressive detachment from the family as an early omen. ""There was no particular, unmistakable sign,"" he recalls, ""just a gradual change in the atmosphere -- the way the air will seem to thicken, and even become eerily visible, as a prelude to bad weather."" While such inchoate understanding of the dangers of the adult world is typical of all the young protagonists in these stories, not all the book's children appear as wounded innocents. In ""El Paso"" and ""Passion Play,"" for example, they assume the role of protector, yet in both stories they are doomed in their attempts to shield those who are more vulnerable than themselves. Compassionate adults also pay a price, as in ""Wildfires,"" the story of the wife of a Vietnam veteran who loses herself to her husband's suffering. In the final story, which tells of a man's aborted effort to comfort friends whose child has died, Greg Johnson crystallizes his grim but affecting vision with the ironic suggestion that the closest friends may in fact be those who manage to stay at arm's length.",1990-12-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Prescription for Insanity,"To the Editor: I have just made my fourth pass at Bret Easton Ellis's essay. As a 27-year-old member of his arbitrarily defined generation, I feel compelled to respond. Mr. Ellis's thesis seems to be that what ""they"" are providing ""us"" with is not sufficiently challenging or provocative. That he should lament the decline of popular culture, that he should even be looking to it for some kind of succor, is very odd indeed. Most of the ""twentysomethings"" I know have a healthy regard for popular culture as a sort of necessary and ubiquitous evil. To look upon it otherwise, in a nation culturally dominated by the likes of Robert Fulghum, Sylvester Stallone and the New Kids on the Block, might result in insanity. The tone of passivity that overwhelms the essay, the interpretation of ""culture"" as a kind of manna that is doled out from above, is profoundly disturbing to me, particularly as it comes from the author of three ""serious"" novels. This attitude seems to stem from an idea that what sells well is the best there is to be had. CHRISTOPHER SORRENTINO Brooklyn",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Rabbi Nachman's Mystery Tour","THE MAN WHO THOUGHT HE WAS MESSIAH. By Curt Leviant. (Jewish Publication Society, $18.95.) Hasidism appears profoundly conservative to modern eyes, but it was once a vibrant, radical, even revolutionary, movement. Breaking from the Judaism of the period, which they regarded as elitist, the Hasidic teachers of the 18th century sought to bring the gift of transcendence to the common man; through singing, dancing and fervent prayer, Hasidim aspired to mystical communion with God. Among the greatest of the Hasidic teachers was Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, famous for the wisdom of his storytelling. In his enchanting, magical third novel, Curt Leviant becomes a modern Nachman and summons up a world suffused with a tangible spirituality, a world where trees or dreams or numbers might speak prophecy, where God is ever immanent behind the thin veil of the printed word. Sensual and intriguing, ""The Man Who Thought He Was Messiah"" shows us Reb Nachman in 1800, his incredibly eventful final year. It begins with God's whisper, a hint of Messianic destiny: Nachman might bring salvation to the scattered nation of Israel. Despite the presumption of this notion, Nachman seeks to prove himself worthy, but fails: he falls in love with Lizabeta, a young peasant ""more beautiful than the alphabet."" In fitting punishment, Nachman loses his ability to read; to atone for their liaison, he must leave Bratslav. Thus he travels to Vienna and studies composition with a proud but likable Beethoven; returning home with his new language of music, he finds his literacy partly restored. Setting out again, this time for the Holy Land, Nachman stops in Constantinople and, in a storybook scenario, cures the sultan's daughter of a storybook ailment. In Palestine divine tests await, and Nachman must probe his deepest values. Exquisitely written, Mr. Leviant's engaging exploration of the spirit will seduce and delight readers of any faith -- or lack thereof.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Although Claude Roy has published many volumes of fiction, poetry, essays and art criticism in his native France, little of his work has appeared in English translation. ""The Distant Friend,"" then, will probably introduce Mr. Roy to most American readers. This slim novel, which was first published in France in 1987 and has now been ably translated by Hugh A. Harter, takes the form of a wandering, elegiac memoir. The narrator, Etienne, has lived a life of sacrifice and postponement. Confining himself to the family estate in the provinces, where he cares for his invalid mother and balances the accounts, Etienne doggedly accepts his solitude: ""I was born a bachelor and would remain a bachelor."" His greatest consolation lies in his friendship with Stefan Stein, a German Jewish refugee he first met when they were both teen-agers. Unlike Etienne, this doppelganger is rootless, polyglot and, by nature of his Jewish ancestry, positioned at the tragic center of 20th-century history. Their two destinies diverge rather quickly. While Etienne putters around the farm, Stefan flees France in 1939 for Argentina, becomes an eminent lawyer and writer and, 40 years later, finds his life threatened by Peronist thugs. According to Etienne, their friendship has taught him the ""luxury of existing in the eyes of someone else through and for myself."" Before long, however, this pairing of Etienne with his opposite number begins to feel like a literary contrivance, one the author has festooned with a string of cliches about politics, history and friendship. As an attempt, in Etienne's words, to preserve memories ""suspended at the edge of the abyss of time where oblivion will swallow [ them ] up,"" ""The Distant Friend"" falls sadly short.

Anyone who has ever read and drooled over a Judith Krantz novel -- or been forced to confess, ""No, but I saw the mini-series"" -- will not be disappointed in ""Dazzle."" Its scrumptious heroine, Jazz Kilkullen, is a brilliant photographer of celebrities, based in Venice, Calif. She is the daughter of a Swedish actress, Sylvie Norberg, and a rancher, Mike Kilkullen, to whom she has been completely devoted since her mother's death when Jazz was 8. Jazz works at Dazzle, the name of the studio she owns with her two partners, Mel and Pete, who specialize, respectively, in food and cars. Sharing the same space is the ever ambitious, avaricious Phoebe Milbank, their representative. An enviable number of men orbit around Jazz, who is a study in gold tones, with rich golden skin, golden brown hair and golden eyes. Jazz's admirers include Sam, an Australian actor whose unimaginable gorgeousness puts him at a painful social disadvantage, and a photojournalist named Gabriel, who first seduced Jazz when she was 18 -- by flicking his tongue over the tips of her eyelashes. Finally, there is the good guy, Casey Nelson, an investor turned cow boss, who works for Jazz's father at the family ranch, 100 square miles of coveted undeveloped coastal real estate between Los Angeles and San Diego. But the people who provide the true drama of ""Dazzle"" are those who plot to get the precious Kilkullen ranch sold off to developers: Mike's bitter, scheming first wife, Liddy, and Jazz's two half sisters, Valerie, a dry, sexless interior decorator, and the precocious Fernanda. The latter, having experienced her first orgasm at age 3, spends the next 36 years trying to find a lover as good as herself. I wouldn't dream of revealing how this search, or the struggle to save the ranch, ends. ""Dazzle,"" if not perfectly dazzling, is appropriately entertaining. Closet Krantz enthusiasts will find that it fits nicely into the jacket of ""Rabbit at Rest"" and can be read comfortably on the train.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

This oral history follows a familiar format: numerous personal accounts arranged by topic, with short introductory sections by the author. Marilyn P. Davis, an independent scholar, draws on the experiences of a wide variety of Mexican immigrants (both legal and illegal), from field hands to professors, from those who stay only briefly in the United States to third-generation American citizens. Inevitably, the stories of immigrants who have adapted to life in el norte and have attained successful middle-class careers in this country are the least interesting and do not seem appreciably different from similar stories involving other immigrant groups. The portrayal of the broader Mexican experience, on the other hand, is fascinating. The economic motives for Mexican immigration to the United States are well known, but ""Mexican Voices/American Dreams"" shows that there are also deep cultural ramifications. For many Mexican children, stories about ""over there"" take on the aura of myth and exert a pull independent of economic necessity, so that immigration has become a rite of passage for Mexican youth. The separation of parents from children and husbands from wives -- often for years -- can devastate families, as some of Ms. Davis's most poignant pages show. An excellent chapter covers what is in effect an underground railroad for crossing into the United States; illegal immigration has become a major service industry along parts of the border. The book's major disappointment is that it lacks the lyric quality that characterizes the best oral histories. Nevertheless, ""Mexican Voices/American Dreams"" provides a welcome contrast to the depersonalization characteristic of some treatments of Mexican immigration, which all too often is considered only from the viewpoint of the American border patrol.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000
us,Headliners; Gotti IV,"Law enforcement authorities have for years said that John Gotti rose to the pinnacle of gangsterdom in much the same way that Shakespeare's Richard III reached the English throne -- through the process of elimination. Now they think they can prove it. Mr. Gotti, a flashy dresser who is reputed to be the most powerful Mafia boss in the country, was indicted last week on charges of taking part in four murders in recent years. Among them were the deaths in 1985 of Paul Castellano, Mr. Gotti's predecessor as head of the Gambino family, and Mr. Castellano's bodyguard. Mr. Castellano was shot down as he got out of his car in front of a mid-Manhattan restaurant, and within months Mr. Gotti was recognized as his successor. Andrew J. Maloney, the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, insisted that this time he has a very strong case against the Mafia chief, who has been found not guilty in three previous Federal trials. But Mr. Gotti, responding to shouted questions about the new charges, said, ""No problem.""",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

The psychological processes that support a more restricted role for women are automatic and deeply embedded. So, in part, what the women's movement has done is to create anger and confusion.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ. By Middle East Watch. (Human Rights Watch/Yale University, $19.95.) This cogent study offers grim details of the systematic repression of its citizens by the Iraqi Government over the last two decades of rule by the Baath Socialist Party and since 1979 by the regime of Saddam Hussein. During this period, according to ""Human Rights in Iraq,"" the 16 million inhabitants of this oil-rich but troubled land have been subject to arbitrary arrest, imprisonment, torture, deportation, expulsion and execution. The often rebellious Kurdish minority (about 20 percent of the population) has suffered a crueler fate: thousands have been massacred, most recently by poison gas attacks, and some 500,000 have been resettled, no one is sure where, since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. These charges by Middle East Watch, a group that monitors human rights practices in the region, are based on witnesses' corroborated testimony and other research; all the charges have been denied by Baghdad. Although there appears to be no opposition to Saddam Hussein's regime outside the Kurdish areas -- those who conform are offered peace and prosperity -- the Government refuses to admit any human rights investigative body into the country. This study also examines how the United States has applied human rights criteria in its dealings with Iraq. Before Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the record was not exemplary. Despite widely circulated State Department reports on Iraq's dismal record, this country offered financial aid and allowed exports of technology, some of it military, to the regime that now threatens the entire Middle East with bloodshed. Once known as the cradle of civilization, the Tigris-Euphrates valley has become a caldron of violence and terror.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

The intense debate on the greenhouse effect and the prospect of global warming has conjured up doomsday visions of environmental upheaval in the next century. Taking exception to the ""crisis psychology"" of climate Cassandras, Louise B. Young has written a concerned but straightforward summary of the current state of scientific knowledge of such issues as greenhouse warming, acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. With a gift for rendering complex scientific issues in lucid language, she attempts in ""Sowing the Wind"" to put the climate controversy in perspective by describing what science has learned about the evolution of climate on the earth, as well as the effects of man's inadvertent meddling. Ms. Young, the author of ""Earth's Aura,"" is very good at explaining how climate is generated by the miraculously intricate and subtle interplay among land, oceans and atmosphere. It is not surprising, as she notes, that even the most advanced computers cannot handle the vast number of calculations needed to simulate the atmosphere's complexity faithfully, or that we have not been monitoring changes in this mercurial medium long enough to predict climate trends with any certainty. At the same time, Ms. Young does not discount the very real threat of changes brewing in the weather of the next century. In her final chapter she offers suggestions about what can be done right now. Unfortunately, this is the least satisfying part of the book, since she tends to rely on her considerable talent for lyrical prose and on brisk generalizations rather than dealing in more than a cursory way with some serious questions raised by the specter of global warming.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"SQUANDERING THE BLUE. By Kate Braverman. (Fawcett Columbine, $18.95.) If, as they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it stands to reason that horror, too, lurks deep within the optic nerve. How else to explain the lushly menacing imagery in the poet and novelist Kate Braverman's latest book? Never have the gaudy tropical flora of Los Angeles and Hawaii produced such gorgeously poisonous fruit. The stories in ""Squandering the Blue,"" Ms. Braverman's first collection of short fiction, take place ""on the border between death and the Mardi Gras,"" a sinister, forbidding and unpredictable region of the mind where even the leaves on the trees seem to wear camouflage and carry Uzis. Flowers are the color of ""bruises, violence and disaster."" A sunset metastasizes above the cliffs. The rain doesn't stop, it merely goes into remission. In the feverish imaginations of Ms. Braverman's characters -- many of them former or current substance abusers -- danger is everywhere, particularly in the mirror. If the book seems excessive at times, the characters' crazed outlooks and histrionic predicaments aren't the only cause. Ms. Braverman has a penchant for repetition: identical phrases recur in several stories, and in one 16-page stretch the word ""blue"" appears 85 times. While this is clearly designed to evoke the hysterical frame of mind of a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, it runs the risk of driving readers to distraction en route. Overall, though, the women in ""Squandering the Blue"" are fitting representatives of the walking wounded, tropical Cassandras with a taste for flashy destruction. Dancing hypnotically on the lip of the volcano, they pour florid language into the fire to create brief, spectacular moments of illumination.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"BEYOND THE BOOM: New Voices on American Life, Culture, and Politics. Edited by Terry Teachout. (Poseidon, $18.95.) ""What we think,"" writes Terry Teachout in his foreword to this collection of essays by and about baby boomers, ""is as diverse as who we are."" Wrong. These essays are a lot more diverse than their authors, and thank goodness, for it would be tough to find a less diverse bunch than the 15 contributors to ""Beyond the Boom."" Mr. Teachout, an editorial writer at The New York Daily News, says that he and his 14 conservative middle-class East Coast colleagues (nine of whom either work for or contribute to Commentary, National Review, The American Spectator or The Wall Street Journal) ""represent the vast majority of baby boomers"" -- an astonishingly arrogant leap from the undeniable fact that most baby boomers, like most members of pretty much every group, voted for Ronald Reagan. The essays themselves do vary, in both subject and quality, and the good ones are terrific, notably Maggie Gallagher's funny and touching analysis of what she calls ""house lust,"" Roger Kimball's funeral dirge for the craft of criticism and David Brooks's hilarious description of a Washington black-tie dinner. (""The whole point of being a moderate is that it doubles the field of possible dinner guests."") Also worthy of note, though only for its shock value, is Lisa Schiffren's regretful reflection that the baby-boom generation has not been through a war. ""In years to come,"" writes Ms. Schiffren, a special assistant at the Defense Department, ""nations like Afghanistan will have plenty of eager young men, refined and proven in the forge of war, fit to shoulder responsibility for leading their societies. What about us?"" Mr. Teachout's contribution is an explanation of why he has said farewell to politics, a statement that would be more convincing in a different context. Yes, this is a diverse collection, and indeed the premise of ""Beyond the Boom"" is that the cliches and preconceptions that lump baby boomers into a homogeneous mass aren't true. No doubt they aren't, but these essays and these authors don't prove it. All they prove is that conservative middle-class East Coast journalists in their 30's -- some, anyway -- can write entertainingly on a variety of subjects.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

us,More Than Just Fairytales,"Anyone who remembers Arthur Rackham's classic illustrations as just treacly pictures of fairies is probably repressing the scarier aspects of childhood. Rackham's supernatural landscapes and their inhabitants enchant us with equal measures of grace and terror. For each rosebud princess, he drew a fearful wolf, witch or mountain peak. In ARTHUR RACKHAM: A Biography (Arcade/Little, Brown, $40; after Dec. 31, $45), the art historian James Hamilton suggests that the Stamford House garden, across the street from Rackham's childhood home, might have been the source of his fantastic arborial people and anthropomorphic trees. Unfortunately the biography, though conscientious and affectionate, gives more insight into Rackham's finances than his imagination. Partly this is due to Mr. Hamilton's effort to correct the view of Rackham as ""some kind of busy little gnome, acquainted with the fairies."" Born in London in 1867, Rackham supported himself first as a clerk in an insurance office, then as a magazine illustrator. He married a portrait painter and had one daughter. From 1905, when his illustrated edition of ""Rip Van Winkle"" was gobbled up by the public and the critics, until his death in 1939, Christmas wasn't Christmas without a new Rackham book. Among the more familiar are ""Peter Pan in Kensington,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" and fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm brothers; perhaps the best loved is his last, ""The Wind in the Willows,"" published in 1940.

The Maya Nobody Knows","A FOREST OF KINGS: The Untold Story of the Ancient Maya. By Linda Schele and David Freidel. (Morrow, $29.95.) A frenzy to learn more about the ancient Maya, whose culture flourished in the Yucatan 3,000 years ago and whose ancestors still thrive by the millions in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and western Honduras, may soon supplant our habit of looking chiefly to other continents to study pre-Christian advanced civilizations. For the decoding of Mayan hieroglyphs has revealed the startlingly sophisticated and brutal history of this Mesoamerican culture, described in painstaking detail by Linda Schele, a professor of art at the University of Texas, Austin, and David Freidel, an archeologist who teaches at Southern Methodist University. They helped decipher the glyphs and cartouches that reverse previous notions concerning the Maya's peaceful nature and uncomplicated existence. According to the authors, the three-tiered Maya world, consisting of ""the starry arch of heaven, the stony Middleworld of earth made to flower and bear fruit by the blood of kings, and the dark waters of the Underworld below,"" was ""thought to be alive and imbued with sacred power, including the sky, which was represented by a great crocodilian monster. This Cosmic Monster made the rains when it shed its blood in supernatural counterpoint to the royal sacrifices on the earth below."" Ms. Schele and Mr. Freidel describe how oral tradition preserved many Mayan beliefs originally recorded on perishable paper; they claim that Central American festivals and such practices as shamanism derive from this ancient heritage. ""The genius of the Maya was expressed through the creation of new visions of power,"" they write. ""They invented political symbols that transformed and coordinated such age-old institutions as the extended family, the village, the shaman, and the patriarch into the stuff of civilized life."" Although ""A Forest of Kings"" is in places thick with dry verbiage, it is throughout rich in revelatory research.",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Szymanski should make anybody with a sense of history wince with pain (""A Mountain of Trouble,"" Nov. 18). What Szymanski has revealed was foreseen, in broad outlines, almost from the outset of the nuclear era. For example, James Bryant Conant, a professor of chemistry before he became president of Harvard University, said in 1951: ""A sober appraisal of the debits and credits of the exploitation of atomic fission"" had led him to conclude ""the game [ is ] not worth the candle. The disposal of the waste products [ will present ] giant problems -- problems to be lived with for generations."" He predicted that by the 1960's nations would adopt a ""self-denying ordinance"" on all nuclear energy, both military and civilian, as mere ""common sense.""",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

Russian citizens and American scholars wonder. President Bush last week approved $1 billion in Federal credits for the Soviet Union, lifting a 15-year ban on such aid with the goal of easing Soviet food shortages. The United States rejected European calls for full Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying the Soviets should receive only Special Association status pending further economic reforms. Many Soviets feel the kindest deed they can do for foreigners bringing money and supplies is to warn that their fellow Russians are cheats, profiteers and thieves. Using the K.G.B. to police food distribution is hardly reassuring. The K.G.B. officer trying to sell his high-crested hat to tourists one day is unlikely to to keep his hands off Western goodies the next. Dyed-in-the-Wood Gorbachev Under the skin, deep inside, is Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev really another Brezhnev? A Khrushchev? A Stalin, or Lenin, perhaps? Moscow souvenir-hunters can count up the implications of the nesting wooden dolls of Soviet leaders sold along the Arbat, the pedestrian mall. They are a 1990's version of the traditional matrushka dolls, which, in Brezhnev's and Stalin's times, invariably depicted maidens, soldiers and other politically safe subjects. The doll vendors are evidently taking advantage of Mr. Gorbachev's encouragement of free markets, hawking Gorby dolls for $20 (hundreds of rubles).",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

""The twentysomething audience,"" he writes, bragging of his putatively unshockable American generation, ""has seen everything ."" Oh, yeah? Has it seen its fathers machine-gunned and its mothers raped by soldiers of its own government? Has it seen its younger brothers sent toward clouds of poison gas as ""human waves"" in a mad dictator's military frenzy? Has it seen famine, political terror, forced ethnic or racial migration, totalitarian suppression of dissent -- in short, has it seen what most of its contemporaries around the globe see every day? The salient characteristic of Ellis and the narrow, privileged subset that he spuriously anoints as ""his"" generation is not experience but insularity. Let him build latrines in South America or volunteer for community service in the lower Mississippi Valley before he writes his next smug screed or novel about what he so authoritatively calls the popular culture.

us,Generation Gap,"To the Editor: Bret Easton Ellis's article represents another chapter of life in the shadow of the baby boomers. As a 23-year-old graduate student, I can attest to the virtual nonexistence of this alleged generation of cynical, apolitical, thoughtless youths. It is yet another ideological imposition by the thirtysomething crowd, who outnumber everybody, seem to have all the money and most of the political power, and who tend to see everything through the hazy, drug-induced perspective of the 60's. The thirtysomething crowd came of age in the 60's, and seem to be marked by a consciousness of themselves as a generation. But contrary to Mr. Ellis's conception, this generation-consciousness does not exist among younger people as far as I can see. And the fact that we do not act en masse or adhere to a grocery list of politically correct views continues to be interpreted as a lack of soul. Moreover, when some of us do act up it is interpreted as an imitation of the 60's. When thousands of young women and men marched on Washington to defend women's reproductive rights, the media compared it to a Vietnam protest; when college students protest the Persian Gulf buildup they are accused of mimicking the 60's. This nostalgic group of very powerful people seems to be under the delusion that no new ideas have been conceived since the advent of bell-bottom jeans. And now they have somehow convinced people in their 20's that we are a generation too -- a generation that pales in comparison with them. LAUREN McLAUGHLIN Brooklyn",1990-12-16T05:00:00+0000

The Hoosiers took control of the game by making 12 of their first 17 shots in the second half. Indiana shot 65.4 percent from the field in the second half and 58.6 percent for the game.

""When you had expression, you were safe at any speed,"" observes a young piano student in Heidi Jon Schmidt's first collection of stories. ""You could turn pain to understanding like straw into gold."" And in this book Ms. Schmidt effects just such alchemy. ""The Rose Thieves"" is a collection of pieces that reveal an intimate portrait of the storms and intermittent calms of a somewhat eccentric family living in rural Connecticut. If forced to name a central character, it would certainly be Kate, the eldest daughter of the Vanderwald family. For it is through Kate that readers meet her mother (volatile, passionate, dissatisfied with her life) and her father (a relentless optimist with a spent trust fund and an erratic income in futures trading), as well as her two sisters, Audie and Grace, the family peace-keepers. When a grown-up Kate reassures a friend that ""love without difficulty could hardly be called love at all,"" she speaks from experience. But while the personal pain of Ms. Schmidt's characters is palpable, it is never burdensome. Using language that is precise and descriptive, she maintains a sense of the absurd throughout. However, what is perhaps most striking is the uncompromisingly honest yet forgiving nature of Ms. Schmidt's approach. Although Kate wishes she could stay at a distance from the histrionics of her parents, she finally accepts, and is even comforted by, the knowledge that one never outgrows one's family. ""For a moment I had stepped inside their circle and felt its narcotic comfort,"" says Kate in the final story, in which her grandmother faces death. ""I was glad, suddenly, to be home, to be sharing the glory of disaster."" ""The Rose Thieves"" is a graceful journey into the individual life of a young woman and the collective life of a family -- and a fine debut.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,"IN SHORT: FICTION;
Touching Up the Past","THE TALES OF ARTURO VIVANTE. Edited by Mary Kinzie. (Sheep Meadow Press, Cloth, $24.95; Paper, $15.95.) These 35 short narratives by Arturo Vivante are aptly presented as tales, experiences told, with the double force of memory and invention. The variously named protagonists, like the first-person narrators, appear to be avatars of the author, remembering and touching up significant places in his life. Most frequently these are the landscapes of Italy, chiefly the Siena countryside, the scene of Mr. Vivante's childhood and early youth. The book's most vivid figure is the philosopher-father, perceived in the story called ""The Orchard"" almost as a fertility god, an extravagant planter of fruit trees, sustained by peaches and perhaps even more by the sight of the young women who gather them. The other side of his nature -- the aloof, crotchety parent -- emerges in ""The Soft Core,"" in which, nevertheless, the son finally moves him to an affectionate response. The wrench of these father-son encounters is not the only tender spot in the collection, which also pays tribute to the gallantry and creative spirit of Mr. Vivante's mother and sister. There is recurrent homage to the English poets as well, and to Keats in particular, shown most clearly in ""The Nightingale,"" a small parable of the writer's longing to express the inexpressible. Although some of the selections in ""The Tales of Arturo Vivante"" draw upon the many years the author has spent in the United States as a writer and teacher, it is the older, Italian memories that hold the imagination. Versions of all but one of these narratives, a selection from more than 30 years' work, have been printed separately before. It is a pleasure to find them here together.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

The reports may or may not be prefaced with the fact of new snow fallen, but specific amounts, or even general amounts over broad geographic areas, are not generally mentioned. We are not told where rain-snow lines lay, base depths or whether the skiing is really any good.

Furuseth was clocked in 1 minute 46.80 seconds. Fogdoe finished 15 hundredths of a second behind. Furuseth trailed Fogdoe by 53 hundredths of a second in the first run, but had a time of 54.01 seconds in the second heat. Alberto Tomba of Italy, who missed a gate yesterday, still leads the overall World Cup standing with 97 points. Furuseth is second, 9 points back. Thomas Stangassinger of Austria finished third, 1.11 seconds behind Furuseth. The only American who qualified for the second run, Tiger Shaw, finished 16th. (AP) Spaniard Captures Women's Slalom: Blanca Fernandez-Ochoa of Spain returned from injury to win the World Cup women's slalom yesterday after Petra Kronberger of Austria faltered in the first run at Morzine, France. Fernandez-Ochoa had a combined time of 1 minute 27.66 seconds after leading the first run with a clocking of 44.08 seconds. Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden finished second in 1:28.61. Vreni Schneider of Switzerland was third in 1:28.72 after clocking the fastest time in the second leg. It was Fernandez-Ochoa's third victory on the circuit, but her first since a slalom at Sestriere, Italy, in 1987. She missed almost 20 months because of a shoulder injury. Kronberger, who had won four of the first six races this season, nearly fell at the start of the first run and missed a gate. (AP) N.H.L. Bruins 6, North Stars 2: Dave Christian capitalized on a giveaway by the Minnesota goaltender, Brian Hayward, 29 seconds into the second period to lift Boston. The Bruins added two more goals in the period before Hayward was replaced by Jon Casey. The victory gave the Bruins a 37-6-7 record against the North Stars at Boston Garden. Over all, the North Stars are 17-65-17 against the Bruins since joining the league in 1967. The Boston goaltender, Andy Moog, appearing in his seventh straight game, made 31 saves and extended his unbeaten streak to six games. (AP) Whalers 1, Flyers 0: Daryl Reaugh, a rookie, made 26 saves and Rob Brown scored a third-period power play goal for Hartford. The shutout was Reaugh's first and the Whalers' second home victory in their last nine games (2-6-1). Philadelphia is 2-7-2 in its last 11 games. Brown, acquired from Pittsburgh on Friday, picked up the loose puck to the left of the crease and flipped it past Ken Wregget at 5 minutes 26 seconds. The goal was the seventh of the season for Brown, who hadn't played for Pittsburgh the past two weeks. (AP) Maple Leafs 5, Capitals 2: Rob Ramage's power-play goal with 8 minutes 6 seconds remaining broke a tie as Toronto improved its road record to 4-0-1 in the last five games. The Maple Leafs, last in the league on the power play, scored three times with the man advantage. Ramage's tie breaker came on a straightaway slap shot from just inside the blue line. (AP) Horse Racing Mr. Nasty Cruises: Mr. Nasty never trailed and won the Gravesend Handicap at rain-soaked Aqueduct yesterday. Mr. Nasty, ridden by Jerry Bailey and carrying 113 pounds, finished 1 3/4 lengths ahead of Senor Speedy, who edged Dargai by a neck. The victory, Mr. Nasty's sixth in 13 starts this year, was worth $41,420 to his owner, Jack Mondel. The race drew a field of six. Mr. Nasty covered six furlongs on a muddy track in 1:09.4 and returned $9.40, $4.60 and $3.

Like many a modern Rip Van Winkle, Jack Sugrue, a fortyish public relations man -- and the protagonist of Thomas E. Kennedy's occasionally lyrical first novel -- wakes up with a start in midlife. Panicking about how time has slipped away, he decides that he hates his demanding wife and his rotten, expensive wreck of a house. He hates his fatuous job and his fatuous boss. And most of all, he hates himself, because he's become a dumpy lower-middle-management cipher though he was once ""almost a poet."" Desperate to prove that he hasn't lost a poet's power to dream, Sugrue plunges into a bourbon-drenched debauch. He seduces a secretary from his office, casting himself as a kind of sad-eyed existentialist, a sensitive wild man who wants to drown his injured intelligence in pure passion: "" 'Your body is the only truth,' he whispered. It seemed as good a lie as any."" Soon, however, Jack's whole life is a mess. His lover calls it quits, burned and confused by his posturing. After his wife leaves too, he hunches in his chair (sans bourbon), waiting for her and his beloved children to come home. The often sodden protagonist of ""Crossing Borders"" is sometimes quaveringly portentous, but luckily Mr. Kennedy, a former New Yorker who now lives in Copenhagen, also imbues his story with moments of shimmering emotional honesty and a poignant sense of religious yearning. Looking at his two children, Sugrue feels ""like a flea raising little fleas"" and wonders if his father, a poor and naive man, now seems so much bigger than himself because his father believed in God.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Born Useless","FLAWLESS JADE. By Barbara Hanrahan. (University of Queensland Press/International Specialized Book Service, 5602 Hassolo Street N.E., Portland, Ore. 97213, Paper, $12.95.) In her latest novel, the Australian writer Barbara Hanrahan reveals her concerns with life's contradictions and the nature of memory, particularly memories of childhood. But while her previous books have featured women in Australian and English settings, in ""Flawless Jade"" she turns to the Far East of the 1940's and 50's, as seen through the eyes of a young Chinese girl, Wing-yee. Born during ""the Japanese War,"" Wing-yee lives through Mao Zedong's overthrow of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist occupation of Canton. After fleeing with some of her family to an ostensibly better life in Hong Kong, she works as a servant, an embroiderer and, at 13, an usherette at the Golden Dragon Cinema. As time passes, Wing-yee's fantasies of returning to Canton gradually dissolve. She also experiences her first love -- and her first heartbreak. When she is 15, her mother crushes her aspirations to become an actress (she has sent a photograph to a movie company, using the name Flawless Jade), insisting that ""unless you sold your body you couldn't become famous."" Wing-yee's story is a modest ",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Lacking Coherence,"To the Editor: Bret Easton Ellis must have an effective agent to have placed such a vapid, rambling and ultimately incoherent piece of self-justification beneath the banner of the Arts and Leisure section, and attempt to pass it off as the kind of literate cultural criticism one customarily finds in its stead. Mr. Ellis's rare cogent statement is when he cops the plea, under the guise of self-proclaimed spokesman for his cohort, that he ""lacks coherence: [ is ] clueless yet wizened, too unopinionated to voice concern, purposefully enigmatic and indecisive."" Hush, hush, say no more. The disconnected bits of confused and meandering scrawls that follow only serve to underscore his singular point. The essential poseur, in this case wannabe essayist, is revealed in the narcissistic disturbance of his cultural nihilism. The writer supposes a popular ""need to be terrorized,"" claiming that the ""audience isn't horrified by the endless slaughter [ in ] fantasy . . . and the realm of the everyday."" On the contrary, clinical experience suggests that it is precisely the experience of overwhelming terror that can result in continued attempts to relive fragments of a trauma in an effort to gain mastery over the events. This operates on one level as the aftermath for those who have suffered and survived such events as war, natural disaster, or brutal abuse at the hands of another (depicted in Mr. Ellis's latest book), who go on to have a lifelong predilection for certain very frightening movies, or who suffer from recurrent nightmares. On another level, the experience of overwhelming terror in response to a film may be so extreme as to generate its own post-traumatic consequences. When the horror on the screen becomes as viciously grisly as it is today, it may reach a level of intensity that denies for many viewers the experience of mastery, hence containment, of their fear. Thus they go back to the theater again and again to see the same film. This compulsive re-attendance makes for great box office, and is a planned component of many of today's megabuck blockbusters. Box-office grosses in the range of $70 million to $100-plus million are predicated on customers who pay to see the same film 6 to 10 times. Can Mr. Ellis be so naive as not to know this, or is he merely one of the crassest embodiments yet of the most cynical commercialism? At best Mr. Ellis might look like just another Gordon Gekko, the amoral sociopath in red suspenders in the film ""Wall Street."" Though certainly not needed or desired, our society can absorb one more of his sort with less detriment than it can handle another homicidally misogynist psychopath. One must presume that, even masquerading as art, ""American Psycho"" is not as self-referential in its content as the title might suggest. RICHARD H.

us,"IN SHORT: FICTION;
Pantyhose Dolls and Aerosol Cheese","Thank heavens for people with vision, people like Gonzalo Chavez. With nothing to wear to a Tom Jones concert in 1970, Mr. Chavez improvised: he made a vest out of the pop-tops he pulled off soda and beer cans. The crowd cheered. Mr. Chavez was reborn as the creator of the short-lived fad of pop-topping, turning trash into clothing that resembled medieval chain mail. His story is told by Jane and Michael Stern in their exhaustive but exhausting new book, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BAD TASTE (HarperCollins, $29.99). It's all here -- chihuahuas, Liberace, Polynesian cuisine -- made for a place on the coffee table next to the Lava Lite. Like their earlier ""Elvis World,"" this book is well researched and full of gee-whiz details. Some sections are priceless, like the painful tale of the artists Walter and Margaret Keane, who went to court over whose idea it was to paint waiflike children with enormous eyes. However, too many entries are as spicy as Jell-O. Kitsch and camp have become mainstream in American life. Apparently the Sterns have not caught on. They are either wink-wink, nudge-nudge smarmy or downright preachy. Their cleverness is strained; Tupperware, they write, ""brings order and calm to a home, vocalizing its airtight perfection with a gaseous burp every time you seal it closed."" ""The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste"" describes the dubious art of making something from nothing, whether it be pop-top vests, pantyhose dolls or aerosol cheese. It is a lesson in taste the Sterns themselves might heed: their book includes more than 25 references to Elvis, from bouffants (Priscilla's) to smile-face rings (Lisa Marie's) to velvet painting (if you need to ask, this is not the book for you).

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"LOOSE BALLS: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association. By Terry Pluto. (Simon & Schuster, $22.95.) Surely the American Basketball Association deserves better. This was a league, after all, that gave the professional game Julius Erving, Moses Malone and Connie Hawkins; the three-point shot; faster, wide-open above-the-rim action; the slam-dunk contest, and the All-Star weekend. Although the league's coverage from its inception on a Friday the 13th in 1967 to its demise in 1976 was minuscule, tales of prowess on the court and mishaps off (and on) it have become legendary. Like Julius Erving's revolutionary dunks and the Indiana Pacers' Boston Celtics-like championship esprit de corps. Or the San Diego Conquistadors' coach, Wilt Chamberlain, who described one of his players as a ""fat pig"" and once showed up for a game at halftime. Or the night a New York Nets player sat on the bench in Long Island's frigid Commack Arena wearing an overcoat. (He refused to take it off until the team owner ordered him into the game.) In another game, the ace jump shooter and notorious flake Johnny Neumann was summoned from the bench and pulled off his sweat pants, only to reveal he was wearing nothing but a jockstrap. Great stuff for a book, right? Except that Terry Pluto throws up a brick by not even bothering to write a book. Instead, Mr. Pluto, a sportswriter for The Akron (Ohio) Beacon-Journal, has collected interviews with dozens of A.B.A. survivors (though he did not talk to several key figures who are talked about by the others), chopped them into paragraphs and strung them out in ""Loose Balls.""

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE GATES OF PARADISE. By Gwyneth Cravens. (Ticknor & Fields, $18.95.) Melpomene is a thrice-wed minister with a roving eye and a hysterical streak. Her husband, James, an art historian, suffers from writer's block and his own extramarital yearnings. ""The Gates of Paradise"" -- Gwyneth Cravens's fifth novel -- records a day in their life. Melpomene dispenses glib counsel to parishioners and conspires to see Kuno, a former lover who hopes to renew the affair; James tables his dissertation to write to an old flame. Before the day is up, each discovers with a jolt the other's other. Ms. Cravens aims to treat candidly the unspoken desires that can estrange even high-minded spouses, to write a sort of highbrow soap opera. Too often, though, her prose dissolves candor on contact: James ""had told [Melpomene] his dreams; she had penetrated his deepest crevices. But she must never know about Alice, the erotic fusion."" The dialogue, although spunky in places, is sometimes equally artificial. ""So this is goodbye forever,"" says Melpomene to Kuno; ""I now see I'm nothing without you,"" Kuno writes to Melpomene. Verisimilitude rallies as the supporting characters (the rock star Gabriel, for instance) enter, but ebbs each time Ms. Cravens -- seeking, one can only imagine, to flatter the sort of reader who displays busts of Beethoven and Mozart in the living room -- has her characters refer offhandedly to Plato, Bergson, Mallarme and Wittgenstein. The novel's other excesses include a much-foreshadowed suicide and a tirade by Melpomene against James that runs, in part: ""You're old. You're fat. You're lazy. You're stupid. You're pathetic in bed. . . . You make me sick. . . . I hope you die!"" The measure of the book's incredibility is that, after absorbing these rabbit punches, James -- the Neville Chamberlain of domestic disputes -- tries to redeem himself in Melpomene's eyes by whipping her up a bowl of homemade soup.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Ronald Jager, a former professor of philosophy at Yale University, grew up in a farming community that felt it stood square with the world. Eighty acres is a small farm. The universe Mr. Jager's memoir discovers in this tiny parcel of land is multifarious and immense. ""Eighty Acres"" is rich with descriptive details. It tells us what it is like to follow a horse-drawn plow turning the earth, what it is to harvest wild berries, pitch freshly mown hay into the wagon, hunt hares in the fields, dry apples over the stove -- all of the day-to-day charms as well as the heavy labors of what is now an incredibly remote way of life. Set largely in the 1930's and 40's in lower Michigan, the life Mr. Jager describes so vividly might have continued but for the shocks of Depression and war. The three proverbial challenges of farming -- cash flow, overhead and capital investment -- so finely balanced on the diversified small farm of that era, were rendered all but insurmountable by the postwar economies of scale enforced on even its smallest cultivations. ""Eighty Acres"" is nostalgic in the best sense, elegiac in the way it honors the author's close-knit family, tied in its every aspect to the earth. A moving evocation of its time and place, this book is also a valuable description of the fundamentals of sensible, sustainable agriculture once widely practiced on American farms. Mr. Jager's memoir is full of life, an act of preservation tendered to us from an irresistible perspective of love.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Although guides cluck with disapproval, a handful of farmers, whose forebears have worked this land since the Iron Age, continue to tend fields bordered by ancient walls and to inhabit houses that incorporate ancient stones, at times even older than Roman.

Dunnigan, whose books on armed conflict include ""How to Make War,"" and Albert A. Nofi, the associate editor of Strategy and Tactics magazine, have compiled a first-rate collection of facts about weapons systems -- their lethality and cost, who has them and how many, and the socioeconomic factors involved in maintaining an armed camp. Although loaded with technical information, ""Dirty Little Secrets"" does not neglect the anecdote, either for amusement or as food for thought. A big chunk of any military budget is spent on communications, yet Gen. John Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, once commented that ""in the next war we will still have to use runners"" when the radios and telephones fail. The Swiss Army keeps 20,000 carrier pigeons for the same reason. Speaking of things that fly, the United States Air Force estimates that collisions between aircraft and birds, about 2,000 a year, cost $100 million annually -- and about 20 dead or injured airmen. With the apparent end of the cold war, taxpayers may be relieved that the United States Navy will probably not spend, as it did from 1983 through 1985, ""$57.5 billion on antisubmarine warfare, roughly $152.5 million for each Russian submarine."" But will the end of the superpower standoff, which has given Europe the longest period of peace between major powers since the fall of Rome, mean peace for the rest of the world? The authors say no: ""The pattern has shifted from a large war every generation or so to numerous small wars all the time."" And events today in the Middle East, where $145 billion was spent on arms in the last decade, bear out the warning that ""a hardware-happy minor power embarking on a little war"" could drag in the superpowers.

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THE SNAKE GAME. By Wayne Johnson. (Knopf, $18.95.) Wayne Johnson's first novel illuminates the lives of a group of Ojibwa and Chippewa Indians in the lake country of northern Minnesota from the 1950's to the 1980's, revealing a world of guns and taverns and too much liquor, of grown men's anger turned on sons, wives and friends. Each of the 19 chapters takes place in a different year, and each focuses on different incidents in the lives of the novel's characters. Mr. Johnson uses both first- and third-person voices to tell their many stories. Among the most successful are his account of young Red Deer, who uses his skills as a baseball pitcher to vent his rage, and of Eli, whose pride in his welding skill enables him to transcend personal tragedies. But don't expect to find any levity in ""The Snake Game,"" or to meet any women of substance. Dominated -- sometimes beaten -- by their men, the women wait meekly for drunken lovers, conjure spells to seduce objects of sexual desire or arrive in boatloads to service carousing fishermen from the city. Because Mr. Johnson writes so well, I wish he'd had a crankier editor -- to take care of puzzling lines like ""The horn jabbed him like electricity"" and to question bits of unfinished plot. Any author would be challenged by the prospect of inhabiting the lives of so many characters, and sometimes Mr. Johnson fails to bring all of them equally to life. He is most at ease when writing about a young outsider named Marty Sorenson, who seems to be something of an alter ego. Yet even when Marty and the others falter as characters, it is clear that Mr. Johnson cares for them and feels deeply the pain of their lives.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

Hoping that five cuddly baby dolls can enjoy some similar measure of success, Tyco Toys this year introduced a set of tiny, reasonably priced, not-at-all-mutant quintuplet dolls called the Quints. Apparently, the theory is that there is safety in numbers, and so far the numbers -- a projected $20 million in wholesale revenues this year alone -- are very encouraging. Tyco claims it has a hit, and is now making every effort to turn that hit into an institution.",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary/December 16-21,"THE ECONOMY The Federal Reserve, at Long Last, Steps Forward First the economists worried about a recession. Then the retailers and industry executives. Then the President. Finally, the only one besides Saddam Hussein who can actually do something to stimulate the economy acted. For the first time since he became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1987, Alan Greenspan agreed on Tuesday to cut the discount rate, by half a point to 6.5 percent. The Government has few other anti-recessionary medicines in its cabinet. President Bush and Congress are trying to reduce the yawning deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes, a Hooveresque combination. Economists doubt the Fed's new course will immediately cause businesses and consumers to spend, borrow and rejoice. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover, called last week's action ""the first in a series of steps the Fed has to take to curb a recession."" The next cut, he said, could come as soon as next month. Consumer Prices Rise Modestly The Fed's rate cut followed the comforting news that consumer prices rose only three-tenths of 1 percent in November. The core rate, without food and energy, rose by the same percentage. Economists pointed to stabilizing energy prices and an economy too weak to allow producers to pass along their own higher costs, up five-tenths of 1 percent the same month. Lower corporate profits are likely to result. Trade Deficit Widens Foreign trade, one of the few recent sources of economic strength, is turning against the United States. The nation's trade deficit widened to $11.6 billion in October, the worst monthly showing in two and a half years. A weak dollar raised exports to a record. But higher car imports and expensive oil raised total imports a great deal more. Should Weak Banks Pay More? L. William Seidman's hospital for sick banks may turn out to be more like a hospice. Mr. Seidman has proposed that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which he heads, charge higher premiums to weaker banks. The new scale would discourage risk-taking and speculation, analysts say, but also force many banks to combine. He also suggested to Congress last week that his agency's dwindling insurance fund -- likely to lose $5 billion and approach insolvency next year, he said -- could be bolstered by increasing premiums across the board and charging a one-time assessment of $25 billion, or $1 for every $100 in deposits. Some analysts said that such a heavy charge -- about equal to the entire industry's peak annual profits, in 1988 -- would be easier to impose over about five years. K.K.R.'s Patient Money Nothing like an economic downturn and a sour ""junk-bond"" market to turn Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company into a patient investor. The firm said last week that it plans to ask holders of $752 million in RJR Nabisco Inc. junk bonds to accept cash and stock, valued at $5 a share, in return. In effect, Kohlberg, Kravis is letting the public invest in its RJR leveraged buyout, the largest ever, at the same price the firm paid for stock in 1988, and $1.25 less than it paid for shares earlier this year. One Kohlberg, Kravis partner said his firm might need five to seven years to take its profits from the deal, more than twice the time it took a few years ago. America's Edge on Digital TV American companies have taken the lead in developing digital, high-definition television systems that can broadcast over ordinary, local channels.

Shot in black and white, they looked like mysterious, dramatic frames from movies that were never made. She went on to generate color images of women -- always with herself in the starring role -- captured at a pivotal moment in a narrative that the viewer must imagine. Most recently, she has rummaged through the attic of art history, casting herself as a figure from old-master paintings. For the cover photograph, Sherman conceived Mrs. Santa Claus as equal parts folkloric figure and generic grandmother, worn out by Christmas baking and harried by elves underfoot. The props came naturally. Sherman says she has always responded to the visual paraphernalia of Christmas: holiday plates, cookies, ornaments and, above all, ""the mystery of the wrapped package.""",1990-12-23T05:00:00+0000

They also do not need to leave the phone on to get calls, saving their batteries.

After half a century or more, however, these much-studied products of Schoenberg's analytical genius still leave the concertgoing public cold.

The Sabres, one of the National Hockey League's biggest disappointments this season, had their biggest scoring outburst of the season as they snapped a four-game home losing streak and beat Quebec for the first time in four meetings this season. Buffalo is 12-16-7 for 31 points after finishing with 98 points last season. Ruuttu opened the scoring 5 minutes 8 seconds into the game, breaking in alone from center ice and firing the puck past Ron Tugnutt's stick. He scored again early in the third period, lofting Dave Snuggerud's rebound over Tugnutt to make it 7-1. Rick Vaive and Dale Hawerchuk scored power-play goals to put the game away in the second period as Quebec played short-handed for the last four and a half minutes. There were three fights in the game, two of them involving Buffalo's Dean Kennedy, who spent 10 minutes in the penalty box. (AP) College Basketball Arizona 99, Providence 87: Chris Mills scored 28 points yesterday as No. 4 Arizona beat Providence, 99-87, in Tucson. The victory was the 52d straight at home for Arizona (8-1). Oklahoma's home winning streak was stopped at 51 games by Duke on Saturday. Eric Murdock, a 6-foot-2-inch senior guard for Providence, scored 45 points, a McKale Center record. He pulled the smaller Friars within 88-81 with 2 minutes 19 seconds left on a jumper that gave him 44 points. It came during a 10-0 Providence run that cut Arizona's lead to 88-85. With 1:06 left, Murdock made a free throw to cut the deficit to 89-86, but with 36 seconds left and Providence trailing by 93-87, Murdock dribbled the ball off his foot. Arizona iced the victory on two free throws from Matt Othick and Chris Mills and a dunk by Wayne Womack. Providence dropped to 7-2. Murdock broke the McKale Center record of 41 points set by Arizona's Al Fleming in 1976 against Detroit. Murdock had four 3-pointers among his 14 baskets. It was his fourth straight career-high scoring game, surpassing the 37 he scored Friday night against Manhattan. Murdock was averaging 25 points and 5 rebounds a game. (AP) Connecticut 94, Fairfield 70: Scott Burrell scored a career-high 23 points -- 18 in the first half -- and grabbed 9 rebounds yesterday as Connecticut easily defeated Fairfield in Hartford. Jim Calhoun, the Huskies' coach, didn't see his team get the victory because he was hospitalized with the flu. Connecticut (6-1) put the game out of reach in the second half with a 13-3 run capped by Chris Smith's 3-pointer that made the score 62-42. Fairfield (4-4) fell behind by 20-8 and was forced to switch from a zone defense to man-to-man because of the Huskies' outside shooting. The Stags never got closer than 6 points after that. The Huskies shot 55 percent and held the Stags to 42 percent. Kevin George led Fairfield with 15 points; Harold Brantley added 14. (AP) Horse Racing Well Well Well Wins Wins Wins: Well Well Well led throughout and held on in the final yards to win the $87,450 Bertram F. Bongard Stakes by a head yesterday at Aqueduct. Well Well Well was ridden by Diane Nelson and carried 117 pounds in the race for 2-year-olds and up. All Smarts, under Craig Perret, fought it out through the final furlong but finished second in the eight-horse field, a neck ahead of Ambassador in Love, who carried top weight of 122 and was ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. Perret has 57 stakes victories, tied with Jorge Velasquez's North American record for stakes victories in one year, set in 1985. Perret will ride at Calder today in another attempt to break the record. Well Well Well won for the third time in six starts this year, earning $52,470 for Anthony Malatino. The horse, coupled in the wagering with Scotch Game, covered the mile and a sixteenth on the muddy track in 1:46 3/5 and paid $12.20 for $2 to win. (AP)",1990-12-24T05:00:00+0000

Although many of the country's prominent banks are losing money and some are threatened with failure, the chances of sweeping changes in banking regulations are considered to have only a 50-50 chance of success. [ Page A1. ] Profits at many big oil companies will surge this quarter with the price of crude oil and natural gas rising sharply while fewer companies are expected to report big write-offs to cover a variety of items for costs like environmental expenses. [ D1. ] Many older Americans will be able to use simpler tax forms since the I.R.S. decided that income from pensions, annuities and individual retirement accounts, as well as Social Security benefits, may be declared on the short 1040A form. [ D1. ] California wine makers are increasingly interested in exports. The domestic market is growing weaker, but countries that historically consume wine but make little of their own, like Britain, Canada and Switzerland, are attractive markets. [ D1. ] Many manufacturers are having difficulties passing along higher costs to their customers. Unable to raise prices, manufacturers in the steel, tire, chemical and machine tool industries, are finding their profits are being squeezed and they are cutting back on plans to modernize and hire additional employees. Economists say the situation is a hallmark of recession. [ D1. ] Bank certificates of deposit and money market account yields have fallen for the 10th consecutive week amid expectations that large banks will soon cut their prime lending rates. [ D10. ] International China is expected to have the second-largest trade surplus with the United States next year. The growing surplus is emerging as an important irritant in relations between the countries, since the Bush Administration and some in Congress say China's trade gains are a result of unfair practices.

The Buffalo goalie, Clint Malarchuk, allowed two goals by Vladimir Ruzicka and one by Don Sweeney. He preserved the tie with 7 minutes 40 seconds left when he got a toe on Dave Poulin's breakaway shot. The shot hit both posts before the net was dislodged, stopping play. Hogue's goal with 1:20 left in the second period came 25 seconds after John Carter of Boston was penalized for hooking. After three sharp passes moved the puck up ice, Pierre Turgeon fed Hogue in the slot and Hogue's 10-footer bounced in off Andy Moog's pads.(AP) Penguins 7, Capitals 3: Paul Coffey scored twice in 39 seconds during a five-goal first-period that carried Pittsburgh to a victory in in Landover, Md., that extended Washington's streak without a victory to a season-high six games. Coffey's 15th and 16th goals of the season ignited a spree in which Pittsburgh scored four times in 2:16. Bryan Trottier got the third goal to move into a sixth-place tie with John Bucyk on the league's career scoring list. The Penguins, who scored on four of their first five shots against Mike Liut, improved to 7-1 in their last eight games. Washington is 0-5-1 in its last six. Trottier got his fifth goal of the season at 7:48 when he took a cross-ice pass from Scott Young at the right post and beat Liut. It was the 1,369th point of Trottier's 16-year career. He joined the Penguins during the summer after 15 seasons with the Islanders. Barry Pederson's second goal of the season made it 4-0 and chased Liut.(AP) Whalers 4, Nordiques 1: The line of Ron Francis, Rob Brown and Pat Verbeek combined for 9 points, a goal and two assists each, to lead Hartford in the game at Quebec. The Hartford goalie, Peter Sidorkiewicz, stopped 32 shots and had a shutout until Tony McKegney scored at 6:12 of the third period. Sidorkiewicz was especially sharp in the first period, when Quebec had three straight power-play opportunities and the Whalers had still not gained full control. The Nordiques failed to score in seven power-play chances. (AP) Blackhawks 6, Blues 6: St. Louis blew a three-goal lead but salvaged a tie on Jeff Brown's goal with 4:43 left in regulation in Chicago. The Blackhawks, who trailed, 3-0, after one period and 5-3 after two, went ahead, 6-5, with 8:06 remaining when Adam Creighton and Wayne Presley scored seven seconds apart. Steve Larmer had cut the deficit to 5-4 by beating Vincent Riendeau with a short wrist shot at 6:08 for his 25th goal of the season. Brown tied it when he picked up a loose puck and beat Ed Belfour with a 30-foot slap shot. The Blues are 6-0-3 in their last nine games.(AP) Jets 6, North Stars 4: Ed Olczyk had two goals and an assist before leaving with an injury as Winnipeg snapped a four-game losing streak. Olczyk, who had both his goals in the second period, did all his damage before being forced to leave early in the third period after sustaining a bruised left elbow on a slash by Minnesota's Brian Propp. Bob Essensa made 36 saves as the Jets broke a seven-game road drought (0-4-3).

us,Sounds Around Town: On New Year's Eve,"Soul Asylum Soul Asylum and the Pussywillows, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J. (201) 798-4064. Soul Asylum, from Minneapolis, is a primary proponent of flannel-shirt rock -- low-key, roughly fashioned rock-and-roll that is as basic and workmanlike as its namesake. The signature quality of flannel-shirt rock bands, besides members who dress down, is sincerity, and Soul Asylum has it by the truckload. The group's songs sound as though they were hammered out in a basement workshop on a Saturday afternoon with a six-pack of beer: blueprint Rolling Stones-style riffs, nuts-and-bolts drumming, no-frills vocals. Instead of using high-tech effects or embellishments to clean up the sound, Soul Asylum simply bashes away, leaving flaws and loose threads intact. Lean but never mean, songs like ""Nice Guys (Don't Get Paid)"" and ""Easy Street"" mix cheerfulness and depression in a quotient that avoids commitment to either state of mind. The Pussywillows, a New York City band that will open the show, offers an upbeat and giddy take-off on 1960's girl-groups with just the slightest admission of camp. The New Year's Eve show starts at 11 P.M. Tickets are $25 in advance and $30 at the door, including buffet and a champagne toast. Sweet and Lloyd Matthew Sweet and Richard Lloyd, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street in Manhattan, (212) 982-4052. Matthew Sweet is just one of a current legion of earnest pop singers and songwriters, but with the addition of Richard Lloyd on guitar his show comes to life. Mr. Lloyd, who played with the late-70's New York City band Television, propels Mr. Sweet's dreamy pop dalliances into tough, swift action. After the breakup of Television, Mr. Lloyd released two solo albums; he lacks some of the confidence necessary for a singer and frontman, though, and for the last couple of years he has worked mostly as a side musician. In any lineup, Mr. Lloyd remains one of the most intelligent and melodic lead guitarists of his generation. His guitar solos are a language unto themselves, vibrant and fluent and poetic. The New Year's Eve show starts at 11 P.M.; admission is $15, which includes a glass of champagne and noisemakers.",1990-12-28T05:00:00+0000

us,For Children,"Children's Comedy Children's Museum of Manhattan Tisch Building 212 West 83d Street Manhattan (212) 721-1223 Recommended ages: 4 and up Tomorrow and Sunday At the very modern, very hip Children's Museum of Manhattan, the Kids Comedy Club from Sarasota, Fla., will give young New Yorkers a chance to test their own wit without having to go near a stage. The club, made up of children from ages 7 to 13 who are based with the Florida Studio Theater but come from all over the United States, will perform in the museum's theater, where the audience sits on bleachers. How will the troupe make everyone laugh? With its own live version of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live."" With a script written by the cast, the show will consist of skits that feature music, monologues and some audience participation. The Bad Moldavian Dancers, for example, will show how they live up to their name, and the Rhinos, a clumsy duo, have been shaped in the Blues Brothers's mold. Even parents will snicker during ""Silly Questions,"" a parody of ""Late Night With David Letterman."" After the 45-minute performance, a workshop on ""Comedy Is Serious Business"" will give audience members a chance to show off their own talents. Admission to the performance and workshop is free with museum admission of $4 for children and adults. The show starts at 11:30 A.M. and 2 P.M.; workshops begin at 1 and 3 P.M. No refreshments are available except for a water fountain. 'Babes in Toyland' Light Opera of Manhattan Symphony Space 2537 Broadway (at 95th Street) (212) 864-5400 Recommended ages: 3 and up Through Monday This company's rather lighthearted approach toward the gentle Toymaker, his devoted toys, the scheming detective Peter Pinkerton and the Cassidys, a family in crisis, is treated with a slightly ironic hand, thereby reducing the potential gushiness. The musical is indeed a show for parents and children, if only for its moving melodies, lovingly performed, and its range of costumes and characters, the latter including the charming and the not-so-charming (yes, you, Mr. Cassidy). Raymond Allen is particularly suited to his role as the Toymaker: he makes Captain Kangaroo seem churlish. A 15-minute intermission allows enough time for the children to have their pictures taken with Billy Bear, at $5 a shot. They can also visit the toy shop, which is stuffed with bears, and the water fountain. Though Symphony Space has no place to check strollers, it is a comfortable, roomy place to take children. Tickets are and $13.50 and $17.50 for adults, $10 for children. Performance times are tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and 8 P.M., Sunday at 3 P.M. and Monday at 7 P.M. 3-D 'Kiss Me Kate' Film Forum 209 West Houston Street Manhattan (212) 727-8110 Recommended ages: 9 and up Through Thursday This may not be the first film you'll think of when taking the family to the movies this weekend to relax. But its 3-D format may be something your children have yet to experience. The theater provides the glasses, which will make you feel as if you're sitting in the same room as the actors on the screen. In fact, the characters in the film seem to have an unnerving tendency to throw objects (scarfs, plates, you name it) into the audience, or so it seems. If you don't wear the glasses, the screen looks blurred. The story is about a romance, of sorts, between two actors, Lilli Vanessi (Kathryn Grayson) and Fred Graham (Howard Keel), who, while starring in a live musical production of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" fight their personal battles on and off the stage. Although the plot borders on the corny and disagreements are resolved instantly with song-and-dance routines, the Cole Porter score and the energetic choreography take the movie into the realm of classics. Besides, the dirtiest word you'll hear is ""louse."" Admission, $7; $4.50 for Film Forum members. The 109-minute movie is broken up with a 10-minute intermission, so you can buy a huge $2.50 bag of popcorn or something sweet from L'Ecluse Foods at the theater's highbrow refreshment counter. Call for daily schedule. 'Lightmobile' Sculpture Shearson Lehman Plaza Shearson Lehman Brothers 388 Greenwich Street (near Hubert Street) Manhattan Through Thursday In the marble-lined lobby of this financial institution in Manhattan sits a 1966 metallic-blue Volkswagen Beetle with a spit-and-polish shine not many people have time to create nowadays. This may be the time to introduce your children to the olden days, when you might very well have driven just this type of car, before the words station wagon and car seat ventured into your vocabulary. This sculpture, by the artist Eric Staller, who lives in lower Manhattan, is not a sight for sensitive eyes: with 1,659 light bulbs flashing sequentially, you may wonder why all obsolete automobiles, lighted up or not, shouldn't end up in office lobbies so that people can appreciate these cars' virtues long after they've been driven off the road.

us,IN SHORT: NONFICTION,"THE AMERICAN SOUTH: A History. By William J. Cooper Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill. (Knopf, $50.) This academic survey of the history of the American South runs from 1607 to the present. Extensive use of maps, charts and illustrations helps move and shape the immense amount of material. Short, manageable sections linked with neat transitions keep the reader oriented. However, William J. Cooper Jr., a professor of history at Louisiana State University, and Thomas E. Terrill, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina, creep so cautiously through events that they render their history rather bland. The authors rarely enhance their bare-bones accounts with intimate or quirky details. The competent prose is slowed occasionally by a bumpy phrase or sentence, and, strangely enough, by a number of unattributed quotations from scholars. Overall, ""The American South"" is very strong on the intricacies of political parties and economic developments. After a peculiarly placating section on slavery, the authors move into a more balanced presentation of postbellum race relations, including a fine overview of Jim Crow. Native Americans again are shortchanged; there is no space given, for example, to the remarkable late 18th-century and early 19th-century evolution of the Cherokees. The Reconstruction era, including the short but confusing periods of Military Reconstruction and Radical Reconstruction, is handled refreshingly well. A few ideas that are mentioned, such as the inescapable link in Southerners' minds between white liberty and black slavery, are valid but hammered a little hard. The volume ends with as many predictions as reflections, and this may date it unnecessarily. The long bibliographical essay included at the back of the book is wonderfully varied, although nearly silent on sources for the Colonial to antebellum periods.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Stanley, best remembered for saying ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume?,"" was such an eccentric character -- brave, paranoid, oversensitive and articulate -- that he is worth knowing better. The biographer Frank McLynn, in his highly readable ""Stanley: The Making of an African Explorer,"" presents a driven, determined man who was secretly tortured by insecurities, guilt and conflicting desires. A latent homosexual given to beating his delicate acolytes, Stanley was terrified of women, regarding them either as high-born ladies to be worshiped or as whores. Stanley always seemed to prefer adventure in the company of men to pursuing his ill-fated relationships with women. His childhood may explain his later problems: he was illegitimate (he changed his name from John Rowlands as a teen-ager) and passed from relative to relative until, as a 7-year old, he was consigned to a workhouse in Wales. But in his brief friendship with David Livingstone, who had rejected Europeand society -- and women -- to find the source of the Nile, Stanley found a kindred spirit. It is typical of Stanley's convoluted hypocrisy that he could not confess to his friend the real reason for having tracked him down in Africa: The New York Herald paid for Stanley's entire expedition in exchange for the exclusive story. Instead, he told Livingstone that the newspaper had paid for the trip as a charitable act, in order to get supplies to the stranded missionary. He set off for Africa a second time, after Livingstone's death; this trip took him across the entire African continent. Only by submerging himself in a life of constant danger was he able to escape his inner turmoil. But with this psychic relief came cruelty. Many men died on behalf of Stanley's determination to keep moving; some he simply abandoned when they were too sick to move. Stanley was a remarkably bold liar and bluffer; he even lied in his own diary. Mr. McLynn, however, has taken care not to fall into any traps, and the entertaining text is well documented with footnotes.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

(Schirmer, $35.) There are few who would deny that Broadway's greatest gift to the world has been the musical comedy, and perhaps fewer still who would dispute that this decidedly American concoction reached its peak in the middle of this century. Among its many other virtues as a comprehensive research tool, or just as a delight for theater aficionados, ""Opening Night on Broadway"" by Steven Suskin, a theatrical producer and manager, confirms that the critics were definitely aware something special was happening on the Great White Way at the time. As Brooks Atkinson wrote about ""Finian's Rainbow,"" which opened in 1947, four years after the pivotal ""Oklahoma!"": ""If the American musical stage continues to improve, it will no longer be necessary for anyone to speak dialogue on the stage. Everything essential can be said in song and dancing."" From ""Alive and Kicking"" to ""Ziegfeld Follies of 1957,"" this collection of excerpts from the daily reviews constitutes a galvanizing parade of the peacocks as well as the turkeys. Though the era encompassed practically every great musical our generation knows by name (including ""Guys and Dolls,"" ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"" ""The Music Man,"" ""My Fair Lady,"" ""The Pajama Game,"" ""West Side Story"" and ""Hello, Dolly!""), typically it was the less successful shows that inspired the wittiest comments. Consider the cavalcade of puns on titles, including Walter Kerr's ""Anyone can whistle, but nobody can sing""; Robert Coleman's ""Lerner, Loewe, and Hart spent so much to mount Camelot that the wisecrackers have been calling it 'Costallot' ""; Howard Barnes's response to ""Let's Make an Opera"": ""Let's not!""; and Louis Kronenberger's revised name for ""The Girl From Nantucket"": ""The Girl From Death Valley."" In response to this last woebegone offering, Wilella Waldorf of The New York Post was even more vicious: ""If the producers wish to lift something from this review for advertising purposes, they may quote us as saying, 'It lacks everything.'

us,Business Diary/December 23-28,"THE ECONOMY Singing the Ever-Deepening Recession Blues Economists and Government officials who earlier said they expected light showers stepped outside last week and got drenched. Many said that the most recent figures pointed to a recession deeper and more prolonged than they had expected. New factory orders for durable goods in November fell 10.5 percent, matching January's record decline. These include the orders for aircraft, automobiles, machinery, metals and computers that nourish the economy for months, or sometimes years. A broader forward-looking index, the leading economic indicators, dropped for the fifth straight month in November, falling 1.2 percent; three straight declines are usually enough to signal a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, confirmed that a recession probably began between June and September. Economists are watching the Middle East, the banks and consumers to see how severe the slump will be. High consumer debt and low confidence are likely to aggravate the slowdown, many say. ""If Sam Kahan doesn't know whether he's going to have a job in 1991, he's going to tell the kids 'No more Nintendo games,' "" Mr. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities, said. Middle East peace would give consumers heart, he said, adding that his children remain optimistic that at least one economist will do all right. ""They figure dad is always good for another buck,"" he said. More Taxes on the Toast The party's over on Dec. 31 as far as the Government and the liquor stores are concerned. A one-time tax, expected to generate $300 million, is being imposed on wholesale and retail liquor inventories held on that date. Higher excise taxes take effect with the New Year. The excise taxes should add only pennies to the price of a bottle or can of beer, wine or spirits; the tax on a bottle of 80-proof whiskey goes from $1.98 to $2.14. But just as every tremor in the Middle East seems to produce an earthquake at the local filling station, the liquor tax hikes might be amplified and redoubled. Many big American brewers and French and Italian winemakers are seizing the chance to raise prices. Wholesalers and retailers will then add their own markups. Some merchants say a $2 tax increase per case could mean $10 more in the store. Less Action At the Stores For the nation's retailers, it was almost as if the doldrums and discounts of July had arrived in December. A chronically optimistic bunch, they were nevertheless frankly downcast about this year's Christmas results -- the worst season in years, they said. Some retailers reported last week that sales had dropped from the year before; factoring in inflation, most appeared to have suffered real declines. Shoppers neglected to swarm into the stores at the last minute, as they had done in previous years. The stores usually earn about half their annual profits between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Analysts say that price-cutting, continuing slack sales and weak balance sheets might force more chains into bankruptcy court. A few privileged retailers did report higher sales from customers who were rushing to beat the new 10 percent Federal luxury tax. That levy takes effect on New Year's Day, making very expensive cars, boats, jewelry, furs and private planes that much more difficult to afford. Trouble in the California Freeze When the parade floats for the Tournament of Roses can't get enough flowers, California must really be in trouble. The state's worst winter freeze in more than half a century has wilted the flower crop and also promised to raise fruit and vegetable prices around the nation. A box of California navel oranges at local produce markets shot up to $22 last week from $12 the week before. Considerably higher prices are likely to spread toward the East over the coming days and weeks. COMPANIES",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

King had 30 points by halftime to help Washington take an 81-61 lead, then added 10 in the third quarter as the Bullets stretched their advantage to 117-88. Denver lost for the seventh time in eight games. King, the N.B.A.'s third-leading scorer, made 20 of 35 shots and was 12 for 14 at the free-throw line. His 52 points was the most by a Bullet since the franchise moved from Baltimore after the 1972-73 season, surpassing a 50-point effort by Moses Malone in April 1987. King also had eight rebounds, six assists and a steal. He was removed with 3 minutes 54 seconds left after coming up 4 points short of the franchise record of 56 points, set by Earl Monroe in 1968. (AP) Jazz 131, Clippers 102: Karl Malone scored 31 points yesterday afternoon in Salt Lake City and Jeff Malone added 29, including 16 in the third quarter, as the Utah Jazz won for the 11th time in 14 games. John Stockton scored 16 points and had 13 assists for the Jazz, who went two games behind the idle San Antonio Spurs in the Midwest Division. (AP) Trail Blazers 120, Cavaliers 114: Clyde Drexler scored 20 of his 28 points in the second half and banked in a 3-pointer with 19.7 seconds left to help Portland reach 27-3, at Richfield, Ohio, last night. The victory was Portland's fifth in a row and eighth in nine games, and it also was the 100th victory for Coach Rick Adelman. Cleveland has lost 4 in a row and 10 of 11. (AP) Pistons 99, Rockets 84: Joe Dumars scored 20 of his season-high 30 points in the first half for the Pistons at Auburn Hills, Mich., last night. Detroit won its third in a row, holding the Rockets to 36 percent shooting and limiting Akeem Olajuwon to 17 points and 11 rebounds. Otis Thorpe had 17 points and 12 rebounds for Houston. Isiah Thomas had 14 assists and 13 points for the Pistons. (AP) Hornets 109, Magic 100: The Hornets ended a losing streak at 11 games. The two teams had come in with a combined 19 losses in 20 games. Charlotte, which was one short of the franchise record for consecutive losses, is 3-1 all-time against Orlando and 2-0 this season. (AP) Mavericks 90, Kings 79: The Mavericks sent Sacramento its sixth consecutive loss after limiting the Kings to 30 first-half points last night. Derek Harper scored 26 points to lead Dallas. Antoine Carr scored 17 points for Sacramento, which is 1-13 on the road. (AP) N.H.L. Maple Leafs 6, Penguins 3: Mike Krushelnyski scored two goals to help the Maple Leafs cool off the league's hottest team last night in Toronto. The Penguins, who had won eight of their nine previous games and led the league with an average of 4.2 goals a game, got two from Jaromir Jagr and one from Kevin Stevens. The victory was the fourth in five games for the Leafs.

Jet Stream finished a length and three-quarters back in second place and Reputed Testamony was another three-quarters of a length behind in third. Chas'Whim earned $60,000 for his owners-breeders, Elmer and Harriet Heubeck of Ocala, Fla. The 3-year-old gelding returned $9.20 for $2 to win. (AP) Tennis Seles Leads Yugoslavia: Monica Seles overcame jet lag yesterday to spark Yugoslavia to a 3-0 victory over Italy and a place in the quarterfinals of the Hopman Cup team championship at the Burswood Superdome in Perth, Australia. Seles, who had arrived less than 24 hours earlier, defeated Raffaella Reggi, 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, in the opening singles match to give fifth-seeded Yugoslavia a 1-0 lead. Goran Prpic of Yugoslavia beat Paolo Cane, 6-4, 6-3, in the second singles match, and Seles and Prpic then combined to beat Cane and Reggi, 8-3, in mixed doubles, which was reduced to one set because Yugoslavia had clinched the victory. The Yugoslavs will meet the Soviet Union, with Andrei Chesnokov and Natalya Zvereva, in the quarterfinals today. In other quarterfinal action, the top-seeded United States will play Germany.

Mr. Rushdie, who has been in hiding since 1989, when his novel ""The Satanic Verses"" was deemed a mortal offense to Islam, sought to assuage the Muslim world last week by publicly embracing the faith and declaring that he did not share the offending views expressed by characters in his book. He also said he would now oppose the issuing of a paperback edition of ""Verses."" Some Muslim leaders in the United States and in Britain, where the Indian-born Mr. Rushdie is a naturalized citizen, urged religious leaders in Iran to lift the death sentence and million-dollar bounty that were declared by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in February 1989. Said one of them, ""He has paid for his poor taste."" At that, Mr. Rushdie said, ""I feel a lot safer."" But the next day, Ayatollah Khomeini's successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said the author was not forgiven. Quoting his predecessor, the Ayatollah said, ""Even if he repents and becomes the most pious Muslim on earth, there will be no change in this divine decree.""",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"THROUGH AND THROUGH: Toledo Stories. By Joseph Geha. (Graywolf, Paper, $7.95.) A new town is a blue town to begin with, but if that town is Toledo, Ohio, and you are a new arrival in the Glass Capital's Arab community, the transition can be especially melancholy. Such is Joseph Geha's message in his first book of short stories. Mr. Geha's characters are butchers and debkee dancers, mustachioed relatives (of both genders) and married strangers -- even a murderer who seeks redemption from an apparition of Christ that appears on a storage tank. With the exception of the title piece, in which that vision-seeking killer reflects upon a treacherous career, the stories have a similar structure, emerging as slice-of-life tales viewed from a street corner or through a window. Often, we come upon scenes we fear we've seen somewhere before, then are saved by the author's neat sense of detail. ""Everything, Everything,"" for example, explores a young woman's loneliness through an encounter with a handsome stranger she meets in a laundromat. When one of her brassieres ends up in his basket, our attention is focused on her hand, which moves side to side as if ""erasing a blackboard,"" trying to undo the mistake. In ""Monkey Business,"" a widowed father hesitantly succumbs to Uhdrah, the woman brought by a matchmaker from the old country to be his second wife. Meanwhile his son, Jameel, spends his days mimicking the movements of Asfoori, a local derelict. An overt irony, the father bending to Uhdrah's wishes at the same time that Asfoori -- like Uhdrah a representative of Old World values -- falls over dead, is transformed into black comedy with Jameel's mindless aping of the derelict's death thrall as another bum, a war veteran, cries ""Sniper!"" and bystanders drop to the ground. When a foreign people inhabits a new place, both people and place risk losing their identity. Joseph Geha fights hard to keep his characters exotic, to make Toledo a land of mystery.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,1990: The Agony and the Ecstasy,"Anything goes, but nothing lasts. Or so the events of 1990 would suggest. This was, after all, the year of passing fancies: ""Twin Peaks"" peaked, Milli Vanilli melted, and the lambada proved to be an NC-17 version of the Hula-Hoop. Jesse Helms took on Robert Mapplethorpe, Florida went after the 2 Live Crew, and Broadway wondered whether ""Miss Saigon"" would be bygone. What follows is a highly selective calendar of the year's most memorable moments -- and a few best forgotten. JANUARY Jan. 8 All About Deb: Jane Pauley is replaced by the younger, blonder, bubblier Deborah Norville on NBC's ""Today"" show, and America begins to tune out in droves. There Is No Net: California Superior Court orders Paramount to pay Art Buchwald for an idea that became the Eddie Murphy film ""Coming to America."" Showing more originality in bookkeeping than in screenwriting, Paramount claimed a net loss of $18 million for a film that grossed over $275 million, and concluded that it owed Buchwald nothing. Jan. 9 Un Bel Helicopter: Cameron Mackintosh says he can't find a theater in New York big enough for his new musical ""Miss Saigon,"" a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in Vietnam, in which a chopper lands on the stage. Jan. 10 The Bloom Is Off: Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur who had bought van Gogh's ""Irises"" for a record $53.9 million in 1987, puts the painting back on the market. The Getty got it. Jan. 14 Pas de Misha: American Ballet Theater celebrates its 50th year with a gala at the Metropolitan Opera House; notably absent is the former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had resigned in a dispute with the company's board. Jan. 15 No Tomorrow: The $7 million production of ""Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge"" flops on the road. Producers plan instead to revive the original ""Annie"" on Broadway, but Miss Hannigan's had it: Dorothy Loudon, who created the role, pulls out. Jan. 21 You Say Lambada, I Say Lumbago: Kaoma, the group that has sold four million copies of its single, ""The Lambada,"" tours the country, setting off the most hyped -- and least danceable -- disco craze since Da Butt. FEBRUARY Feb. 2 Not Even a Contender: The Philadelphia Museum of Art insists that an 800-pound, 8 1/2-foot bronze sculpture of Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa be removed from its plaza after the filming of ""Rocky V"" winds up. Feb. 8 A Few Minutes Without . . . : Andy Rooney is suspended from CBS's ""60 Minutes"" for three months after suggesting that blacks were less intelligent because they ""watered down their genes."" Previously he had offended homosexuals by commenting that gay sex led to premature deaths. But ratings slid, and he returned after only one month. Feb. 10 He Learned It in Kindergarten : The best-selling pop homilist Robert (""Everything He Needs to Know"") Fulghum leads the Minneapolis Chamber Symphony in Beethoven's Ninth, even though he can't read music. Feb. 16 Less Is More: The Guggenheim Museum acquires a collection of more than 300 mostly Minimalist works from the 60's and 70's, some of them no more than plans on paper, for a price believed to be around $30 million. To foot the bill, it sold major paintings by Modigliani, Kandinsky and Chagall. Feb. 25 Die, Yuppie Scum: A new bad guy emerges in such films as ""Blue Steel,"" ""Bad Influence"" and what would be the year's biggest hit, ""Ghost"": Yuppa, the young, urban professional assassin. MARCH March 2 Maestro Dearest: The conductor Zubin Mehta upbraids the audience at a New York Philharmonic concert for coughing and generally making too much noise. March 4 Get Thee Behind Me, Ozzy Osbourne: John Cardinal O'Connor, preaching the Gospel about Satan's tempting Jesus in the desert, cites reports of growing Satanic cult activity among youth and the impact of satanic imagery in rock. March 5 He Knew It When He Saw It: Congressional hearings begin on whether to keep the National Endowment for the Arts in business. Senator Jesse Helms, reacting to an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, seeks tough controls on Federally financed art. March 16 Meanwhile, Back at the Lambada: Two movies about the exotic dance are released: ""Lambada!"" (math teacher by day, dancer by night) and ""The Forbidden Dance"" (an Amazon Indian princess goes to Los Angeles to save the rain forest and becomes a lambadan). March 18 The Bad News: Twelve works assessed at more than $200 million are stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston by thieves dressed as police officers. March 19 The Worse News: They weren't insured. March 21 Purple Haze: Kathleen Turner takes on Maggie in the Broadway production of ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,"" performing the first act in a lavender slip (lined) instead of the de rigueur white. March 25 But There May Be a Part in the Movie 'Cats': New York's party set, including Nan Kempner, Glenn Bernbaum and Jerry Zipkin, show up for Brian De Palma's auditions to play social X-tras in the film ""The Bonfire of the Vanities.""

A Much Smaller Piece of the Pie: ""Twin Peaks"" producers say Laura Palmer's killer won't be revealed this season. By now the series has lost 30 percent of its original audience. April 28 The Zing Cycle: A few moments before the end of ""Gotterdammerung"" at the Metropolitan Opera House, a beam from the scenery strikes Hildegard Behrens on the head and knocks her flat, and out of the remaining performances. April 30 The Video Thing: Barbara Bush says ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" is the First Couple's favorite TV show. MAY May 7 No Dice: Nora Dunn of ""Saturday Night Live"" refuses to participate in this week's show, claiming that the comedy act of the guest host, Andrew Dice Clay, is degrading and repulsive.

May 30 Watch It, Dude: Fox reveals plans to pit Bart (""Underachiever and Proud of It, Man"") Simpson, America's favorite animated antihero, against NBC's mighty Bill Cosby on Thursday nights. JUNE June 7 Mourning Glory: The Metropolitan Museum drapes paintings in black in response to Congressional efforts to restrict National Endowment-sponsored artists.

AUGUST Aug. 8 The Pryce Is Wrong: Actors' Equity forbids the English actor Jonathan Pryce from appearing on Broadway in the role of the Eurasian he created in London in ""Miss Saigon"" and urges that an Asian be cast.

Play was to resume over the weekend, but even if Mr. Karpov were to win the last two games -- experts considered that unlikely -- the 27-year-old Armenian champion would keep the title. (If Mr. Karpov should win both games, he would get half of the $3 million in prize money; otherwise he will get $1.3 million.) The two players have had a well-known dislike of each other since Mr. Kasaparov took the title from Mr. Karpov in 1984. All told, they have played more championship games -- 142 in five matches -- than any other two players in history. But some experts speculated last week that with Mr. Kasparov's game continuing to improve and some younger Soviet grandmasters gaining ground on Mr. Karpov, the two might never play again. Said an American grandmaster, ""This match proves that Kasparov is No. 1 in the world.""",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Victor Ripp, an American academic of Russian descent, employs the travelogue genre to track down the misconceptions that, glasnost notwithstanding, continue to cloud the Soviet view of America. In his travels, Mr. Ripp meets a schoolboy who asks about the cowboys and Indians in today's Texas. He meets a Moscow woman who at first seems well informed about America, but then assumes that Mr. Ripp's home in Hopewell, N.J., is a summer dacha. And he finds himself in a great number of awkward situations caused by cultural misunderstandings between him and his Russian friends. All of this is amusing, albeit for the most part predictable. Unfortunately, the two elements in Mr. Ripp's scheme -- the misconceptions and the historical roots of these misconceptions -- do not fall together into a uniform narrative, and the sarcastic tone of ""Pizza in Pushkin Square,"" while initially amusing, quickly becomes an annoyance. The author's tendency to jump to unjustified, sweeping conclusions is even more irritating. A decade or two ago, casual observers seemed to have little trouble noting undiscovered traits of Russian character and style. Today, with everybody Moscow-bound, even informed travelers like Mr. Ripp seem to be hard pressed to bring back anything of value.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

In this adaptation of the final chapter of ""Patrimony,"" to be published in February by Simon & Schuster, Philip Roth describes the last months of his 88-year-old father's fight to survive.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000
us,Fangs for the Memory,"Undying fans of ""Dracula"" will relish this account of how the hairy-palmed, stench-ridden, cadaverous shade who flowed in 1897 from Bram Stoker's pen became an elegantly dressed stiff who slips into dark bedrooms by the flickering light of television sets. In HOLLYWOOD GOTHIC: The Tangled Web of ""Dracula"" From Novel to Stage to Screen (Norton, $39.95), the novelist David J. Skal tracks Transylvania's most popular vampire with dry wit and the skills of a fine detective. He follows the efforts of Stoker's widow, Florence, to consign to flames every existing print of ""Nosferatu,"" F. W. Murnau's unauthorized 1922 silent film version of the story (at least one of which, mercifully, escaped her clutches). He stalks ""Dracula"" from London to the Broadway stage, where the bloodthirsty Count claimed the body of a Hungarian actor named Bela Lugosi, making him forever captive to the role. Mr. Skal reveals the heretofore hidden intrigues that landed Stoker's novel in Hollywood, where Lugosi's heirs would eventually lose their 16-year struggle with Universal Pictures to possess their father's image beyond the grave. But the author is most satisfying when he reveals his discovery, in a Cuban film vault, of the missing reel of a Spanish-language ""Dracula"" that was filmed in tandem with Tod Browning's 1931 American release. Filled with charming and unusual illustrations, the volume includes a handy chronology (""Dracula at a Glance"") and many incisive observations about the terror and appeal of mixing sex with immortality. Yet Mr. Skal wisely treads lightly over the meaning of ""Dracula,"" leaving its essential mystery undisturbed. Indeed, those who cannot find their own reflection in Bram Stoker's still-living creation are surely the undead.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

But if you are one of the fashion avant-garde, you are already eyeing the 40's. Such is the way the style pendulum swings these days. Each thrust forward brings a swoop backward. For their spring collections, designers have obviously dug deep into the lore of the 60's. They've brought back the structured dress -- shaped like an ""A,"" short of skirt and often sleeveless. The color palette is on the bright side -- plenty of white and sunny shades like grass green, orange, peony pink and peach. Sixties-style accessories are back as well, especially the pointed-toe shoe, head kerchiefs, headbands and ladylike wrist-handle bags. All these ideas have caught on like wildfire, and stores will soon have versions of them at every price level. Then there is the hint of 1950's fashion reappearing, mostly in the form of prim and proper suits. One signal is that Karl Lagerfeld, the designer for Chanel, is suggesting them. So can the 1940's be far behind? Of course not. In Isaac Mizrahi's new collection, there are just a few breezy outfits with pronounced waistlines and fuller, longer skirts. For those with long memories, they recall American fashion of the late 40's. For everybody, they look fresh -- and forward.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

Told by Jerry Keenan, an aging writer recalling his youth, it flashes back to the America of 1946, peppered with references to Jerry's stint as a Navy pilot during World War II. The story opens as Jerry meets a woman who calls herself Andrea King during a postwar pilgrimage to Old West tourist attractions. They travel together, bonded by corny repartee and near-perfect sex, until a desert storm overwhelms them. The woman disappears and Jerry wonders whether she might be a ghost, an angel or, worse, ""a succubus,"" as an old Irish priest suggests, ""sent straight from hell."" The love-struck Jerry searches for her, digging into her personal history. What he discovers (in addition to her real name, Maggie Ward) gives her more substance for him but, unfortunately for readers, as the novel progresses she becomes less interesting as a character. Maggie is supposed to be bright, but her alleged intelligence is limited to tiresome bantering. And, of course, she fulfills Jerry's fantasies. (""You're the most perfect woman I've ever met,"" he exclaims as they embrace in the front seat of his car.) Apparently, Maggie needs a virtuous man like Jerry to rescue her from her dark past -- or at least that's what he sets out to convince her of. But the story loses credibility when the actions of other characters become obvious plot devices and Maggie makes a fairy-tale transformation. Father Greeley's attempt to establish parallels between Jerry and Don Quixote fails to give the novel a literary flavor. He does a fine job with the 1940's settings, but Irish ethnocentrism, annoying remarks about women and a self-indulgent tone hinder reading pleasure for an audience seeking more than nostalgia.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,IN SHORT: FICTION,"ZULUS. By Percival Everett. (Permanent Press, $19.95.) In his fourth novel, Percival Everett places us in a postnuclear world, regimented into discomfort and numb with an official pessimism that has mandated the sterilization of women. Alice Achitophel, 260 pounds of self-hating civil servant, has ignored the order. Now, following a rape, she thinks she's pregnant. Alice flees to a rebel camp, surrealistically gives birth to a slenderer version of herself, returns to the city in this new incarnation with an enigmatic loner named Kevin, once more believes herself pregnant, smuggles drugs from a hospital and surrealistically loses her child to rebel thieves. This fable is by courtesy -- or discourtesy -- science fiction, although it deals roughly with the logic of its situation. The only food people eat is uncontaminated cheese and fruit; abandoned libraries are crowded with the homeless, yet humble workers own houses with guest rooms. Stark and sometimes powerful prose serves primarily to set forth a pattern of symbols -- repeated washings indicating guilt, repeated ineffectual births indicating the End of the Line. Mr. Everett, caught up in a personal but by no means unusual disaffection, sends readers to the reference library with his quotation-heavy chapter heads (check your Dryden for Achitophel) without giving us any particular reason to hope for enlightenment, passion or pleasure.

us,Beauty; WHAT'S COMING UP:,"""Pull the pin, you'll know it's real!"" reads the advertising copy for a new men's shampoo dubbed Grenade, a product only a Patton could love. And only in the 1990's could such a bellicose item have marketing value. This is not to say that a hawk sensibility has corrupted the new decade, but that 1960's revisionism may be the buzzword for next year. In this brave new world, there's room for both hawks and doves. Today's hawk wanna-be's dream of buzz cuts and grenades, while doves buy green (whatever's environmentally sound). Although these new doves may not be old enough to remember the original counterculture, they've got the visuals down pat: the piled-up hair, the Mary Quant eyes, the pink-and-white face (as seen on that new dove mascot, Madonna). Their conspicuous consumption is likewise politically correct for this new-old decade. Beauty Without Cruelty, found in the health-food stores, is the new dove's favorite makeup line, with no animal testing or weird additives. Listen and Aspen, both fragrances, allow consumers to buy a perfume and plant a tree. (A group called Global Releaf will plant one in your name.) Remember Stark Naked, the Ken Kesey character emblematic of a bad trip? She's resurfaced -- in the revisionist tome from Kesey himself and as the name of Ultima II's new makeup line. (Not that Revlon had any intention of evoking images of hippie chaos.) And speaking of naked, the, er, frontal assault of the late 80's has gained momentum. Sure, the models are still busting out on the runways, but now the male sector of the population has discovered the joys of the knife. Forget the personal trainer; it's a pectoral implant that offers the surest route to a Schwarzenegger-like form. Who says beauty is only skin deep?",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Outwitting the Worrywarts,"TO DANCE WITH THE WHITE DOG. By Terry Kay. (Peachtree, $15.95.) Availing himself of his rich family history, Terry Kay uses his fourth novel to tell an admittedly autobiographical story in which he celebrates his parents' marriage. ""There was a grand romance of life between them,"" Mr. Kay states in an author's note at the end of the book, ""and my father's loneliness following the death of my mother was a terrible experience for him."" The novel explores how 81-year-old Sam Peek, hobbled by a bad leg and dependent on a walker, manages to carry on after the death of Cora, his wife of 57 years. Feisty and determined, Sam continues to drive his rattletrap truck to his pecan grove to tend the trees. He makes plans to travel to a nearby town in Georgia for his 60th college reunion. He keeps a journal. And he tries to outwit his two daughters, worrywarts whose mollycoddling grows irritating even to the reader. What ultimately saves Sam, though, is a magnificent and mysterious white dog -- perhaps the manifestation of Cora's gallant spirit -- whose companionship eases his loneliness and thus encourages him to maintain his independence. Despite a few monotonous characterizations and some banal journal entries, ""To Dance With the White Dog"" is a deftly shaped and vivid book. In this memorable novel, Terry Kay has created a tender and bracing tale of an octogenarian fighting to live a connected and purposeful life.",1990-12-30T05:00:00+0000

us,A Long Day's Wait for No. 1,"Eight bowl games, a record for a New Year's Day, will be played tomorrow in a 13-hour span. Here's a look at the games (all times are Eastern) compiled by Michael Sisak of The New York Times: Mazda Gator Bowl Kickoff At Jacksonville, Fla., 11:30 A.M., ESPN. Teams Michigan (8-3) vs. Mississippi (9-2). Rank Michigan: 12 (A.P.), 12 (U.P.I.), 11 (Times); Mississippi: 15 (A.P.), 14 (U.P.I.), 20 (Times). Season Review Nine more points and Michigan would have been 11-0. After Stanford upset Notre Dame, the Wolverines were No. 1 for a week until their tainted 28-27 loss to Michigan State. Tripping in the end zone on Michigan's potential winning 2-point conversion pass was not called. Mississippi played with inspiration for its paralyzed defensive back Chucky Mullins and surprisingly challenged Tennessee for the Southeastern Conference title. But Tennessee ended the 7-victory Ole Miss streak, 22-13. Matchups ""You're in for a rough afternoon,"" Bo Schembechler warned the free safety Todd Sandroni, and that was from a retired Michigan coach. To Mississippi, Michigan's monster line looks like Tennessee's. It has blocked for the 11th-best rushing offense in the nation, 253.1 yards a game, led by the 11th-best back, Jon Vaughn, 6.1 yards a carry and 112.36 yards a game. Challenging the Mississippi all-America strong safety Chris Mitchell will be the wide receiver Desmond Howard, who had 57 receptions this season. Mississippi's Randy Baldwin had 970 yards rushing. Hall of Fame Bowl Kickoff At Tampa, Fla., 1 P.M., NBC. Teams Illinois (8-3) vs. Clemson (9-2). Rank Clemson: 14 (A.P.), 11 (U.P.I.), 10 (Times); Illinois: 16 (A.P.), 17 (U.P.I.), 27 (Times). Season Review Adjusting slowly to its new coach, Ken Hatfield, Clemson recovered from losses to Virginia (20-7) and Georgia Tech (21-19) to lead the nation in total defense, allowing only 3.5 yards a play and 216.9 yards a game. The Tigers were second in scoring defense, 9.9 points a game and second in rushing defense, 71.7 yards a game. Illinois beat Colorado, 23-22, to begin a six-game winning streak but collapsed against Iowa, 54-28, and Michigan, 22-17. Matchups The biggest surprise for Illinois was the sophomore quarterback Jason Verduzco, who made the offense more effective than Jeff George. Verduzco completed 64.5 percent of his passes, second-best in the nation, for 2,446 yards and 16 touchdowns. The tailback Howard Griffith broke Red Grange's school record of 5 touchdowns in a game when he set an N.C.A.A. record with 8 against Southern Illinois. Florida Citrus Bowl Kickoff At Orlando, Fla., 1:30 P.M., ABC. Teams Georgia Tech (10-0-1) vs. Nebraska (9-2). Rank Georgia Tech: 2 (A.P.), 2 (U.P.I.), 2 (Times); Nebraska: 19 (A.P.), 13 (U.P.I.), 15 (Times). Season Review Georgia Tech, the season's biggest surprise, can't find respect even though it dislodged Virginia from No. 1 and beat Clemson. The Yellow Jackets are underdogs although they were the only undefeated Division I-A team. Their 17-1-1 surge includes 15 straight unbeaten games. Nebraska was 8-0 and No. 3 before falling to Colorado by 27-12 and to Oklahoma by an embarrassing 45-10. Matchups Georgia Tech's Shawn Jones, a sophomore who chose Coach Bobby Ross because he coached Boomer Esiason, was the second-best quarterback in the Atlantic Coast Conference, completing 57.9 percent of his passes for 2,008 yards. The all-America safety Ken Swilling leads a defense that allowed only 110.9 rushing yards a game. Nebraska's I-backs averaged 340 yards, second-best in the nation. Over all, Nebraska averaged 444.4 yards, 13th-best, and 37.5 points, sixth-best. But Nebraska is without its quarterback, Mickey Joseph, whose calf injury against Oklahoma required 125 stitches. Mobil Cotton Bowl Kickoff At Dallas, 1:30 P.M., CBS. Teams Texas (10-1) vs. Miami (9-2). Rank Texas: 3 (A.P.), 3 (U.P.I.), 1 (Times); Miami: 4 (A.P.), 4 (U.P.I.), 4 (Times). Season Review Texas won nine consecutive games since being overtaken by Colorado, 29-22, on Sept. 22. The Longhorns came from behind for seven victories. Miami, the preseason No. 1, lost at B.Y.U., 28-21, and at Notre Dame, 29-20, and escaped at San Diego State, 30-28, signs of a shaky road team. Matchups Miami averaged 483 yards, fifth-best nationally, and 36.5 points a game, eighth-best. The rushing defense is led by the Outland Trophy winner Russell Maryland and it allowed only 79.7 yards, third-best. But the passing defense was porous for Ty Detmer's 406 yards and for Dan McGwire's 323. Its pursuit may be exploited deeply by the quarterback Peter Gardere and his veteran receivers, Keith and Kerry Cash, and Johnny Walker (Burnt Orange). The Texas defense scrambled the heralded Houston quarterback David Klinger and will pressure Craig Erickson, who was fifth-best in total offense with 338 yards a game. The Texas defense will try to keep Miami offbalance with disguised blitzes. Sunkist Fiesta Bowl Kickoff At Tempe, Ariz., 4:30 P.M., NBC. Teams Alabama (7-4) vs. Louisville (9-1-1). Rank Louisville: 18 (A.P.), 16 (U.P.I.), 19 (Times); Alabama: 25 (A.P.), 22 (U.P.I.), 17 (Times). Season Review Louisville won its last six games and accepted its first bowl bid in 13 years when many colleges turned down the Fiesta Bowl after Arizona voters rejected a paid holiday for state workers to honor Martin Luther King Jr. Louisville has not played since Nov. 10, but Coach Howard Schellenberger said he prepared the Cardinals the way he did Miami for its 1983 national title victory. ""I feel we can compete with anybody in the United States,"" he said. Alabama began 0-3 and won seven of its last eight games, including the 6-3 upset that knocked Tennessee out of No. 1 contention. Matchups About Alabama's defense, Schellenberger said: ""We're going to have to play with reckless abandon. We're going to attack them from sideline to sideline."" Alabama was No. 1 against the pass and No. 6 against the rush (91.5 yards) and No. 3 against both (229.4 yards). The quarterback Browning Nagle is the 13th-best nationally. The Louisville linebacker Mark Sander, two tackles shy of Doug Buffone's school record, was stabbed in the abdomen on Nov. 23 but expects to start. Rose Bowl Kickoff At Pasadena, Calif., 5 P.M., ABC. Teams Washington (9-2) vs. Iowa (8-3). Rank Washington: 8 (A.P.), 7 (U.P.I.), 5 (Times); Iowa: 17 (A.P.), 15 (U.P.I.), 22 (Times). Season Review Washington exceeded expectations and is in the Rose Bowl for the first time in nine years. The Huskies were No. 2 before a 25-22 upset by 21-point underdog U.C.L.A. in Seattle on Nov. 10. Iowa won the Big Ten berth by beating Michigan, 24-23; Illinois, 54-28, and Michigan State, 12-7, after being embarrassed at Miami, 48-21. But the Hawkeyes have lost two of their last three games. Matchups: Washington is led by the senior tailback Greg Lewis, who was fourth in the nation in rushing with 127.9 yards a game and seventh in all-purpose running with 162.4 yards a game, better than the Rocket, Raghib Ismail. Iowa will counter with Nick Bell, a 225-pounder whom Coach John Mackovic called a ""tailback in a fullback's body."" The Washington defense is led by the gambling and relentless sophomore Steve Emtman, a 6-4, 280-pound tackle. It allowed only 66.8 yards a game rushing, best in the nation. Federal Express Orange Bowl Kickoff At Miami, 8 P.M., NBC. Teams Notre Dame (9-2) vs. Colorado (10-1-1). Rank Colorado: 1 (A.P.), 1 (U.P.I.), 3 (Times); Notre Dame: 5 (A.P.), 6 (U.P.I.), 6 (Times). Season Review Notre Dame twice was No. 1 for a total of six weeks, longer than any other team. The first reign came after Miami's loss on Sept. 8 at Brigham Young until 5-6 Stanford upset the Irish, 36-31, on Oct. 6, as the potential winning pass was dropped by Derek Brown in the end zone. When Georgia Tech dislodged Virginia from No. 1 on Nov. 3, the Irish regained the top ranking for two weeks until Penn State upset them, 24-21. Colorado was 1-1-1 and ranked No. 20 before making its climb to No. 1. The Buffaloes were tied by Tennessee, then escaped Stanford and lost to Illinois, 23-22. Then they dealt Texas its lone loss, 29-22, and beat Washington, 20-14. A controversial victory came at Missouri when they scored on a fifth-down plunge after the officials had lost count for the 33-31 victory on Oct. 6. The 27-12 rout of Nebraska put them ahead of Notre Dame. Matchups In the last Orange Bowl, Notre Dame won, 21-6. But Colorado is more mature and productive, and Notre Dame, defensively, is poorer, allowing 440 yards and 23 points a game. In each game the Irish have allowed 96 more yards than they did last season. Colorado's all-purpose wide receiver, Mike Pritchard, will wear a cast on a broken left hand suffered in practice on Dec. 24. Pritchard, a 5-11 senior, was the team's most valuable player with 1,515 all-purpose yards in 75 plays (20.5 a play and 26.2 a catch). The game features three Heisman finalists: The Notre Dame flanker Raghib Ismail, second, and the Colorado tailback Eric Bieniemy, third, and the Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan, fifth last year. Bieniemy was second in the nation in rushing with 1,628 yards (148 a game and 5.7 a carry), and he had 17 touchdowns. He was fourth as an all-purpose runner with 2,038 yards (165.27 a game) and Ismail was ninth with 1,726 yards (156.91). Colorado's Alfred Williams won the Dick Butkus Award as the nation's best linebacker, and Notre Dame's Chris Zorich won the Lombardi Award as the best defensive lineman. U.S.F.&G. Sugar Bowl Kickoff At New Orleans, 8:30 P.M. Teams Tennessee (8-2-2) vs. Virginia (8-3). Rank Tennessee: 10 (A.P.), 10 (U.P.I.), 16 (Times); Virginia: 27 (A.P.), 23 (U.P.I.), 21 (Times). Season Review Tennessee tied Colorado, 31-31, and lost its tailback, Chuck Webb, in the second game of the season. The Vols were tied by Auburn, 26-26, after trailing by 26-9. Then they were upset by Alabama, 9-6, before losing to Notre Dame, 34-29. Virginia was 7-0 and had been No. 1 for three weeks before being upset by Georgia Tech, 41-38. That began a series of three losses in the last four games. Prophetically, Coach George Welsh had said: ""Maybe it's like Andy Warhol said. Maybe this is our 15 minutes of fame."" Matchups How well Virginia does will depend on the quarterback Shawn Moore, who suffered a dislocated thumb on his passing hand in the loss to Maryland on Nov. 10. Moore led the nation in passing efficiency with a 160.7 rating, throwing for 2,262 yards and 29 touchdowns, and also ran for 306 yards and 8 touchdowns. Virginia's Herman Moore was the third-best receiver in the nation, averaging 108.18 yards a game with 13 touchdowns, and Tennessee's Carl Pickens was 17th at 83.36 with 16 touchdowns. Virginia had the fourth-best scoring offense at 40.2 points a game. Tennessee was seventh at 36.8.",1990-12-31T05:00:00+0000
