The things include a lovely wife (Lea Massari, whom most will remember as the girl who disappears in ""L'Avventura""), a charming mistress (Romy Schneider), an intelligent and sympathetic son (Gerard Lartigau), an excellent apartment, a country house, a delightful little cruising sloop, and a speedy sports carwhich does not last.Of course, nothing lasts. The architect has left his wife, sort of, and she now has a lover of her own. He is not really committed to his mistress, and she has a serious suitor. The son is in business for himself (a curious cottage industry, which he runs from his own room, manufacturing complex but useless electronic gadgets). The country place needs new shutters. The boat may not be launched this year. And all this filters through the mind of the architect, who himself lies dying in the midst of a life that is rich in associations and heavy with the music (piano and orchestramostly strings) of bitter-sweet memories.The memories and the associations are the real reason for ""The Things of Life."" Although the accident generates some excitement and, in various slow-motion cuts and snippets, provides a lot of footage (making the film look in places like a sentimental ""Weekend""), nevertheless its tensions and its ironies both give way before the pressures of profession, wife, mistress, boat, etc., in which we can only feel it would be a privilege to share.For in its own moderately sophisticated way, ""The Things of Life,"" like the type of women's magazine fiction to which it essentially belongs, depends upon a kind of envious recognition value for audience approval.Thus, in spite of his employer's the architect insists on ""gardens, not garages"" to surround his apartment development  and we know he's a right kind of guy at the same time that we wish, we had such a simple and courageous decision to make. And how nice it would be if we were burdened with the question of the shutters on the country place, or whether to make bed with Romy Schneider (plus distinguished parties, excellent lunches, etc.) a really permanent affair.I should mind this syrup less if Sautet showed more of a conscience in serving itif the relationships seemed to have been felt rather than merely displayed; if the sailboat (a most important image) were not always under power with sails flapping: if you couldn't see the crash helmet on the stuntman in the automobile accident; if Poccoli actually took a mansized bite of those superior restaurant meals.However, Piccoli is the only reasonable point of interest in ""The Things of Life."" Like everyone else in the cast, he is distinguished and a bit moody, and like everyone else in the cast, he makes a major stage business of perpetually smoking cigaretes as if there were no lung cancer. But although he is not especially well directed here, he brings to many individual scenes a sufficiently detailed sense of himself and of his situation almost to cover the succession of clichs out of which he must construct a characterization. He is better than his movie, and he remains one of the real lights of current French cimema.",1970-09-01T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Stranger With a Fast Draw:Van Cleef Heads Cast in 'Sabata' at De Mille Italian Western Also at Other Theaters,"""Sabata,"" which opened yesterday at the DeMille and neighborhood theaters, is a very long, hugely eventful, moderately bloody, immoderately inventive, generally good-humored Italian Western that succeeds in a lot of the areas that better, or at least more serious, movies tend to ignore. As heroic fiction, it is stronger on colorful success than on noble character, but it is so energetic and at the same time so tactful about its achievements that I find it impossible not to credit most of its ideas at face valueand sometimes a little more.Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) is a black-cloaked mysterious stranger, with looks of Judex and the manner of Fearless Fosdick, who foils a clever $100,000 bank robbery by the simple expedient of single-handedly shooting to death all seven robbers, and then blackmails their employers into paying him a like amount in hush money.The employers ultimately pay the blackmailboth because they are ostensibly respectable men who in the first place only wanted the money so they could buy Texas with it, which they would then sell to the railroad; and because Sabata, against the usual overwhelming odds, eventually does them all in, and where they're going they won't need it.Sabata is one of those rarities (even among mysterious strangers) who absolutely never make mistakes, never is surprised, and always win, usually by superior fire power, even when their enemies number an army. He is as-sisted (not that he needs it) by a Mexican ne'er-do-well (Pedro Sanchez) and an acrobatic Indian (Nick Jordan) whose leaps and somersaults wonderfully extend the meticulous agility that is central to Sabata's enterprise and to the film's style.Style is really the substance of Sabata's chief adversary, Stengel (Franco Ressel, who has the appearance, but, alas, not the technique, of William Buckley.) Stengel lives, with countless henchmen, in an incredible ranch featuring a decor that ranges from late medieval to early rococo  all in one room. Since Stengel indulges in various effete cruelties and ornamental assassinations, experiencing him is rather as if you had scratched the dust of the desert and discovered, of the sins of the Borgias.And style must be very nearly an article of faith with Frank Kramer (his real name is Gianfranco Parolini) whose graceful camera performs elegant arabesques above the simplicities of a plot for which he is also partially responsible. ""Sabata"" keeps throwing out almost gratuitous pleasures in movement and designlike the lovely Mario Bava adventure filmsand for this enterprising prodigality Kramer deserves praise.So do the cast members I have mentioned, and also one Gianni Rizzo, as the villainous Judge O'Hara, and William Berger, as a treacherous pal of Sabata who shoots with his banjo. Finally, credit is due to the plucky populace of the film's Daugherty City, Tex. No sooner are they all shot dead (at least once a reel), than they spring back to life for more action in the best traditions of show biz and the spirit of the Old West.",1970-09-03T05:00:00+0000

Add to it now a Colorado-made Western at the Victoria Theater, starringyou guessed it.The newer picture, titled ""Barquero,"" has carefully held to the format of those popular horse operas from abroad: stark color, clanging music, perpetual gunfire, stacks of corpses and a plot heavily punctuated with murderous glares, growls and squints.Rather surprisingly, the second half of the film gets an interesting foothold on reality. There are, so help us, a few quiet stretches, along with a spate of good acting. And one or two characterizations take on persuasion and bite.The picture opens in utter confusion as a band of mercenaries swoops down on a little river-landing outpost. When the smoke clears, the village survivors are crouched on one side of the river, led by a tough barge operator, Mr. Van Cleef. Across the water the bad guys bide their time. For some reason they want the boat for a getaway instead of legging it back over the hills.The very modesty of the setting comes across picturesquely during the tense cat-and-mouse wait, under Gordon Douglas's direction. Four of the players are quite good, with the star leading in a burly, convincing role. Mariette Hartley has two interesting scenes as an earthbound wife. Good, too, are Warren Oates as the chief culprit who becomes unhinged and Kerwin Mathews as his level-eyed partner. And Forrest Tucker, as the Edgar Buchanan of the piece, does well by the few amusing lines.Considering the format, it could have been much, much worse.",1970-09-04T05:00:00+0000

us,Film: Jerry Lewis at War:'Which Way to Front?' on Local Screens,"Even the weakest and flabbiest Jerry Lewis comedies usually shine momentarily with some truly fine, funny mimicry. Such is the case in ""Which Way to the Front? The Warner color release opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters.The picture has a rather original idea. The trouble is that each gag is painstakingly repeated, flattening the pace and squelching the sparkle. Could be, as before, that Lewis's triple undertaking as star, director and producer simply weighs the project down.The new comedy opens brightly and tarty, with Lewis as a millionaire tycoon classified 4-F during World War II. He airily bands together a group of fellow rejects into a small private ""army,"" floats the boys overseas on his yacht and sneaks them into the Italian mountain lair of some key Nazi officers. The idea is for Lewis to impersonate a German bigwig and somehow turn the tide of the war.All this takes about an hour, a fairly amusing hour adhering to the old Lewis format, with the star front and center and his bewildered ""recruits"" alongside, among them Jan Murray, John Wood and Steve Franken. Injections of documentary footage suggest a war actually going on.Disguised as a goateed Nazi officer and spewing a gutteral falsetto, Lewis is quite funny for a while. But it wears thin. Fortunately, it takes two to tango, even in Jerry Lewis's Third Reich. And this cues in a really hilarious scene toward the enda warm reunion and strategy session between Lewis and Sidney Miller, who does a devastatingly clever take-off on Hitler, no less. Here, finally, the picture, and the dialogue of the two screen writers really shines.This sequence almost makes the rest of the picture worth sitting through, with Lewis even stepping aside a bit for Miller's sputtering Hitlerian lunacy, which includes yelps about '""Eva"" and the cooking at Berchtesgaden.""Who is that?"" abruptly asks the Fuhrer, pointing to a human speck in a wall photo of a huge Nazi rally. ""That's Max,"" he adds slyly.""Max who?"" says Lewis. ""Max no difference!"" screams Miller and they both howl. It plays much funnier than it might sound.There are no curvy cuties this go-round. But credit Lewis for also recruiting that durable doll, Kaye Ballard, as a volcanic Italian in one rib-tickling bit. The picture also happens to be clean. And on that happy note, let's leave itat least to the children.",1970-09-05T05:00:00+0000

us,The Screen: 2 Rated 'R':'Swappers' Shares Bill With 'Venus in Furs',"""The Swappers"" and ""Venus in Furs"" are R-rated exploitation films in a double bill that opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters in New York City, on Long Island, in nearby New Jersey and in Westchester. Considering the bland nature of the sexual infusion in these movies, it seems to me that there is less harm in what sin may do to the suburbs than in what the suburbs are doing to sin.Jess Franco's ""Venus in Furs,"" title by Sacher-Masoch, story, alas, by Mr. Franco, concerns Jimmy, a young trumpeter (James Darren), and a beautiful blonde named Wanda (Maria Rohm) who, some years after she has been murdered at an orgy in Istanbul, begins turning up in odd places wearing a fur coat and not much else to seek revenge on the evil three (Margaret Lee, Dennis Price and Klaus Kinski) who did her in.A sexually active ghost, Wanda manages to drive Jimmy wildand away from Rita (Barbara McNair), the black nightclub singer who loves him. Since Jimmy first sees Wanda as a corpse washed up on a beach, his later involvement seems irrational until at the end he discovers another body, notes with some dismay that it is himself, and cries, ""Oh my God! It's me! I'm dead! I've been dead all the time."" The conclusion does not really clarify the plot, but it will at least reassure the members of the audience as to their own responses.Venus in Furs"" features much inept fancy moviemaking (including echoes of ""La Dolce Vita"" and even ""Vertigo""), some semi-nudity, and virtually endless confusion. ""The Swappers,"" on the other hand, features some semi-nudity, no fancy moviemaking, and much literalistic simplicity. It is study (he! he!), illustrated with dramatized vignettes (thus the cast of characters), of the world's No. 1 urban ill: wife swapping.Actually, wife-swapping hasn't always been so poorly thought of in the movies. Only a few months ago, Drs. Eberhard and Phyllis Kronhausen in their epic ""Freedom to Love"" intimated that it might be a pretty healthy idea. But the eminent psychiatrist, who is master of ceremonies of ""The Swappers,"" doesn't like it. And indeed, prolonged exposure to it seems to lead most of the jaded couples in the film down the primrose path to marital fidelity.Although the eminent psychiatrist is American (there is room, I feel, for a piece on styles in eminent psychiatrists in sex-lecture movies), everybody else in ""The Swappers"" is British, with a gratifying concern for high-class syntactical regularity typical of much recent film pornography.At a time when serious British cinema seems committed wholly to people who at best will not graduate from public school, or who at worst sound as if they have never gone to school at all, it is comforting to know that in skin flicks there is a last refuge for the accents of Oxford and Cambridge, and for the diction of the B.B.C.",1970-09-10T05:00:00+0000

us,Godard Film in Festival:'Wind From the East' at Alice Tully Hall,"At one point towards the middle of Jean-Luc Godard's ""Wind From the East"" (Vent D'Est), which was shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall yesterday evening, an actor dressed like a Civil War soldier in the film-within-the-film, more or less flops on the ground, after which, an off-screen prop man throws red paint on him. Whether or not you find the scene funny, stupid, alienating, beautiful, boring or provocative, it sums up quite perfectly the methodology of the man who now calls himself ""the ex-great (bourgeois) filmmaker.""Consequences precede actions and effects give birth to their causes, and all in the name of the sort of Marxist-Leninist truth that is defined pretty much in terms of what is needed as truth to carry the class struggle onwards and upwards.""Wind From the East"" begins with fleeting bits of business from the movie-within-the-movie, a Western, being shot by a group of would-be Third World moviemakers. ""My uncle managed the exploitation of aluminum for the Alcoa Company near Dodge City. . . ."" says the woman narrator.""Almost immediately it turns into a soundtrack debate of Godardian dialectics, set against images that could be from some kind of crazy Western. This evolves into auto-critique (""What does it mean to ask the question: 'Where are we now?' for a militant moviemaker?"") that is followed by a coda, which is nothing less than some pretty pictures of a school girl planting bombs in an open-air market.""To dare to rebel, for us, here, now,"" says the woman narrator, ""is to fight on two fronts  against the bourgeoisie and against its ally, revisionism.""""Wind From the East"" was written by Godard with Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who is seen briefly, during the auto-critique session, wearing a red sweater and a vaguely worried expression. Godard calls it his Marxist Western, which it actually is, but it's an example of a genre to which Godard (at least, so far) is the only contributor.It is full of outrageous statements (I was particularly intrigued by one to the effect that napalm was being dropped on Palestinian peasants) and the sort of lofty moralizing that would condemn Eisenstein for making ""Potemkin"" instead of concentrating on the struggles of his own times.However foolish, arrogant and paranoid Godard may now be, he is not quite yet the ex-great filmmaker he so humbly proclaims. There is a rhythm and a logic to the film itself that has nothing to do with truth and that recalls the rhythm and logic of such great, conventional Godardian films as ""Vivre Sa Vie,"" ""La Chinoise"" and ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her.""Godard's narrators spend an awful lot of time in ""Wind From the East"" talking about revisionism, about the primary and secondary duties of the revolutionist, about the class struggle (what to do about workers who themselves have become capitalists), but the real drama of the movie is provided by Godard's search for some kind of perfect wedding of sound to image. He doesn't find it, and he may still be looking for it. Indeed, he has considerably altered the sequence of events in the film from the version I saw at Cannes last May.Godard says his search is prompted by the need to create a new cinema, free from bourgeois repression, which will depict the class struggle, not simply the class misery that is so favored by liberal and revisionist filmmakers. (To Godard, cinema vrit is beneath contempt.) Whatever his motives, Godard is the ony man today making such manic attempts to create a didactic film form, and the form is often fascinating. The content, however, is almost pure junk.",1970-09-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Rafelson's 'Five Easy Pieces' Bows,"""Five Easy Pieces,"" which played last night at Philharmonic Hall (the one American fiction movie in the regular events of this year's Film Festival) and opens today at the Coronet Theater, is the second feature of Bob Rafelson, a young director whose name will probably not be remembered in connection with his first film, ""Head.""""Head"" suffered from its cast, the Monkees, and from an ad campaign that perhaps did more for the publicist than for the client (you may recall a month when New York was inundated with mysterious poster - photographs of John Brockman's head), but it was a better movie than most critics allowed  largely because it had at least as many ideas as it had technical resources and because it kept turning its excesses into playful but responsible style. ""Head"" was a movie that had nowhere to go except down, but in retrospect, doesn't seem all that bad.I'm not sure how ""Five Easy Pieces"" will seem in retrospectperhaps not all that good. It has its own red-herring equivalent to John Brockman's headin the form of a title that everybody seems to find terribly provocative but that refers more logically to piano pieces for the beginner. And it has a tripnorth to Alaskawhich is part of a fairly elaborate central metaphor. And it is full of ideas, and a stylein this case, a rigorously deliberate and plain stylethat is not less insistent than the canny exuberance of ""Head.""""Five Easy Pieces"" is an open-ended story, like much recent American fiction, satiric in thrust (notice the names in the cast of characters) and elegiac in mood, about a young California oil worker (Jack Nicholson) who travels up to his family's island home on Puget Sound where he sees his dying father, makes a sexual conquest, and visits his pastbefore heading further north.By inclination the young man is very rootless-contemporary-American, with a country-and-Western loving mistress (Karen Black), beer in the refrigerator, and nights out at the bowling alley. But his family is well-off, musical and eccentric; his brother and sister (Ralph Waite and Lois Smith) concertize; and he himself has given up a careermore or less in the name of aimless integrity. Before he seduces his brother's fiance (Susan Anspach), he plays for heran easy piecebut scorns her reaction: ""I faked a little Chopin. You faked a little response.""Something of this exchange carries into my feeling about ""Five Easy Pieces,"" which at first appears to be rich with a quantity of felt life, but on reflection seems both more carefully studied and more coldly casual than profoundly understood. In all non-essentials it is movie-making of a very high order. But scene by scene I find myself moving from sympathy, to admiration, to respectfor a performance, for Laslo Kovacs's evocative photography, or merely for the superior quality of the color film used in capturing the soft, wet lovely ambience of the Pacific Northwest.The acting is generally good, but except for Karen Black's pathetically appealing vulgarian, it lives in bits and pieces, rather than in a quality of sustained characterization. Almost everybody in ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a caricature but plays for all-round sentiment, and in context the one pointedly funny single-dimension role (Helena Kallianiotes as a tough Lesbian hitchhiker on her way to Alaska to escape America's accumulated filth) looks like a tour de force.""Five Easy Pieces"" is built around a series of good-bys. As the central character divests himself of responsibilities, of people and possessions, finally of the coat off his back (rather too pointedlyjust before hitching his own symbolic ride North) the film grows heavy with a kind of poignancy that for all its understatement leans heavily on a stock of quite unearned response.Rafelson is expert at supporting this movement, and the film proceeds from scene to scene with a quiet competent modernism that bespeaks quality, but that more often begs than provides expression. Greater things seem always to be in the offing. But I think they are an illusion. ""Five Easy Pieces"" is a film that takes small risks and provides small rewards.",1970-09-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: G.I.'s vs. Civilians,"A brashly freewheeling new comedy at the Astor and neighborhood theaters called ""Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came"" has the same trouble as that titletoo arch, too unwieldly and too long. And too bad. For until the fun is awkwardly squashed out of the picture in the final reel, this is a bright, brisk and scathingly funny satireon a number of things. And that is the real trouble.The ""battlefield"" is a large, peacetime Army post and a nearby town, apparently near the Southwest border. The undeclared war is the natural hostility between the soldiers and the wary, suspicious civilians.Everything gets a sharp, amusing going-over at first, from the country-club atmosphere of the post to the squarehead domination of the town, both uneasily linked in a new program of ""community relations."" This shaky operation is the peg of the script, whose wry, often lancing dialogue is catnip for a good cast that tackles its roles with relish, under the nimble direction of Hy Averback.The ribald humor and the characterizations hold fast for a while. Tony Curtis is fine as the slightly paunchy post wolf in pursuit of Suzanne Pleshette, a svelte canteen employe. Brian Keith as a professional soldier and Ivan Dixon as a leathery sergeant are both excellent, as is Don Ameche, the post commandant. And Bradford Dillman is surprisingly dexterous in the most interesting role, that of a wry, Army egghead.Trouble is, toward the end the story flounders for a way out and drags in an awkward, overdone device of a tank roaring toward the terrified town. And the townspeopleamong them Ernest Borgnine, Tom Ewell and Arthur O'Connellemerge as either outright or fringe caricatures of bigotry, meanness or timidity. The final flavor is that of smart-alecky cynicism and scattered buckshot.But the first half of the picture is genuinely knowing, sassy and thoroughly enjoyable although nobody wins the war in the final showdown.",1970-09-12T05:00:00+0000

We refer to the fact that the Arab revolutionaries [at first] al towed nonJewish women and Children to leave the captive planes and go to a hotel in Amman, while forcing all Jew ish women and childrenThe Geneva Conference re jected Washington's terms and Washington was compelled to pledge not to disturb the ac cords, acknowledging its U.N. obligation to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity and inde pendence. But it had already initiated unilaterally its policy of partition and of imposing Diem upon the south. Disregarding the Conference accords, the will of the Viet namese, its own pledge and the U.N. Charter, it has persisted right up to the present in trying to disrupt Vietnam's territorial integrity and to yoke the south with unsavory, unpopular regimes. The absence of enforcement powers does not exempt na tions from the obligations of international law, nor does it modify the criminal character of our war in Vietnam as juridi cally defined at Nuremberg. Moreover, the lawlessness of U.S. behavior in Indochina does not place Mr. Nixon in a posi tion to exhort Americans to respect law at home. His only course now consistent with law is to get out of Vietnam, and to leave political resolution tothe Vietnamese and the inter national community.Max GORDON New York, Aug. 1970CeaseFire Opposed To the Editor: Your Aug. 30 editorial Talk or TalkFight in Vietnamurged that the Unite& States propose a standstill ceasefire. A standstill ceasefire pro posal could signal weakness. The people of South Vietnam may feel that the initiator isno longer able to carry on the struggle. Popular support could move toward the other side. Enforcement of a standstill ceasefire would be extremely difficult, especially in the rural areas. The activities of the allied forces are relatively openand easy to see. Communist activities are well camouflaged and difficult to see. Even if military activity could be controlled, Vietcong and North Vietnamese political terror would continue as it has in ceasefires. Themoves into allied territories by night and returns to his sanctuaries before dawn. Negotiations following the ceasefire would be long and drawn out.

us,Straub's 'Othon' Plumbs Love and Drive for Power,"Jean-Marie Straub's ""Othon,"" which played in Alice Tully Hall on Saturday evening, is an adaptation of a late drama by Corneille, derived from the career of Marcus Salvius Otho, who, in the year A.D. 69, murdered his leader, Servius Sulpicius Galba, and had himself proclaimed Emperor of Rome. Corneille's play is very largely concerned with the affections of two young women, Camille, Galba's niece, and Plautine, daughter of the senator Vinius, who are both in love with Othon; and it is at pains to juxtapose the irreconcilable requirements of a drive for power with the urgencies of tragic love.By placing his film in ancient settings (the Palatine Hill, and later, the Villa Doria Pamphili) that are however surrounded by the sights and sounds of contemporary Rome (traffic is the background noise for the earlier parts of ""Othon""; an unnaturally loud fountain for the later parts) Straub, co-directing with his wife, Daniele Huillet, has included himself in an historical time scheme of considerable, multi-layered complexityincluding, of course, 17th-century France (and the Rome of 17th-century France) as well as the ancient and the modern worlds.Such complexity is perfectly typical of Straub, as is his ease with history, with literature and art. He has already filmed literary and dramatic works by Heinrich Bll and Ferdinand Bruckner and has made a movie, a great one, consisting almost wholly of concertized excerpts from Johann Sebastian Bach. Although he has the best kind of serious reputation he has little commercial appeal, and each of his previous features, ""Unreconciled"" and ""Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach,"" owes its introduction here to the New York Film Festival.This year, as in the past, the festival paid Straub its greatest tribute (the only valuable, though not infallible, objective test of a film's importance I know of) when at the press screening of ""Othon"" half the audience got up and walked out.Although in color, and quite handsomely costumed, ""Othon"" makes very few concessions to ordinary sensuous response. Characters speak Corneille's verses rapidly and with minimal expression (actually, expression varies: The older men, Galba and Vinius, are allowed both gesture and inflection; the young are allowed scarcely so much as a turn of the head). The camera pans, often so as to avoid the face of the character speaking, and moves in and outand except for one glorious tracking shot, that is almost all the camera does.And yet this Puritan cinema offers rewards for the sustained contemplation it demandsnot the rewards of special insight, or of mystical vision, but rather of a perfectly controlled probity, assurance and understanding of a movie subject's rhythms and spacial potential. A love for Straub's work will comebut only with time and to the astute and the properly disposed.""Othon"" is magnificently performed by its almost expressionless cast. I admired especially the film critic Adriano Apr as Othon and Straub himself (a significant casting) as the murderous prefect Lacus. But, within the range allowed by the direction, beautiful Olimpia Carlisi, as Camille, gave me a fuller appreciation of what ancient royalty should have been like than has any other actress I have seen in the movies.",1970-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: 3 Visit Pig Butchery in Fontaine's 'Double Pisces Scorpio Rising',"Toward the end of ""Double Pisces, Scorpio Rising,"" three people whimsically look in on a pig slaughterhouse, as the color camera bobs around, cinma-vrit, catching their casual reactions to the commotion around them  the piteous squealing of the terrified animals who are dangled, butchered and quartered. Some of the close-ups of these poor critters are pips.One of the human trio is Dick Fontaine, the director, a thin, long-haired youth who has put together this highly personal exercise on something or other that runs, mercifully, for 58 minues and comes from an English group of movie folk called the Tattooists. The second visitor to the animal abattoir is a pretty girl. The third is a porky, middle-aged man addicted to the expression, ""Ya know?""The two men carry on a running argument about whether they should make a picture about pigs. ""Are we making a movie, ya know?"" says Fatso. ""Where is it, ya know?"" Then a bit later: ""I'm making a movie about pigs, ya know?""The pigs, the ones we see, don't stand a chance, ya know? Nor does anyone else who doesn't happen to know Mr. Fontaine personally and wonders what he's getting at. The first part shows smiling glimpses of Norman Mailer, in a neat suit and tie, amiably campaigning for Mayor. We see him riding the Coney Island roller coaster.Then we're off on Mr. Fontaine's own visual roller coaster, watching and hearing him inside a television studio as he chats and clicks his camera. At home he dials the phone repeatedly. He visits his childhood home and reminisces with a pensive woman portraying his mother.The chapter also includes close-ups of the pretty model, Jean Shrimpton, reading a fable that implies soul-searching. And we see Mr. Fontaine again, this time crouched on the roof of what appears to be a school, assembling a machine gun. ""The audience,"" he tells us, ""waits for me to begin."" Amen.Paired with this film at Philharmonic Hall on Saturday afternoo was another exercise called ""Zorns Lemma,"" made by Hollis Frampton, an American. For five minutes, with the screen blank, a woman's voice recites from ""The Bay State Primer,"" whatever that is. The real goody follows.For 45 minutes the screen clicksone, two, three, etc.the course of the alphabet, as pinpointed to the first letter of various photographed signs, labels and images implying the letter. Over and over and over it goes. And never, at least so far during the Film Festival, have so many Philharmonic Hall viewers slithered outside for a cigarette.For his brief coda, Mr. Frampon shows us two human figures and a dog distantly tramping around in the snow, then disappearing as the screen turns white.

us,Screen: Mizoguchi Borrows From an Ancient Kabuki Drama:A Scrollmaker Flees With Master's Wife Other Festival Entry Limns a Revolutionary,"""Chikamatzu Monogatari,"" which played yesterday afternoon at the New York Film Festival, is a story from the work of the Kabuki dramatist Chikamatzu Monzaemon (1653-1724), who, according to one text, is considered the Japanese Shakespeare. Compared with the films of Kenji Mizoguchi with which we are already familiar (for example, ""Ugetzu""1953, ""The Bailiff""1954, or the sublime ""Life of O'Haru""  1952), ""Chikamatzu Monogatari,"" made in 1954, seems less lyrically poetic, less picturesquely strange, less immediately beautiful. But on the basis of just one viewing, I should guess that it is no less great.It is, however, enough different in feeling to deserve some description. It is the story of how the scrollmaker Mohei, in attempting to help his master's wife out of a financial embarrassment, is virtually forced into running away with her so that he becomes indeed the adulterous lover of a woman he has long worshipped in secret.The couple have no peace, partly because the husband's position will not allow the dishonor, and in time they are returned (with the help of Mohei's father), and, as is the custom with adulterers of a certain rank, they are taken off in ritual procession to be crucified. The husband is ruined anyway, and as the film ends, his scroll factory, the most prosperous in the imperial city of Kyoto, is confiscated.For much of its length, ""Chikamatzu Monogatari"" takes place within a single household, and it is given to a massive exploration of the master scrollmaker's office, workrooms, kitchen, and living quarters. The interiors at times resemble a constructivist stage set, with its allocation of levels, spaces, and connecting stairways; and the action, at least up until the actual flight, borders on the edge of bedroom comedy.It is only after the flightand especially during one breathtaking scene at night in a small boat, when the couple decided against suicide and suddenly learn that they are loversthat the film opens out, just for a few moments at a time, into that gorgeous misty countryside that we have come to expect as the metaphysical universe of the Mizoguchi dramas.I think the reason is that ""Chikamatzu Monogatari"" is in profound ways really about the rigorous complexity of its interiors and courtyards; that it is about relationships (man-woman, brother-sister, child-parent, servant-master) and responsibilities, and about the absolutely fantastic interdependency of everything upon everything else. Therefore, the film's appearance is moment-by-moment an extension of its theme, and the stultifying closeness of every life with every other above it, below it, and next to it is in fact the metaphysical universe of this particular Mizoguchi drama.That universe is somehow incomplete without its adulterous lovers (we see one pair at the beginning of the film, and then, of course, the hero and heroine at the end) and their sacrificial murders. They stand as if for all the potential of a responsive personal life that is rigorously excluded from the social structure of the public and familial worlds. They are outlaws and yet they are representative (everybody's life in ""Chikamatzu Monogatari,"" just below the surface is, or could be, a mess); they are dangerous and beautiful; they are necessaryand they are genuinely intolerable. The master scrollmaker Ishun, an unpleasant character is brought to ruin because he has been cuckolded  and his punishishment is not less real, or less unjust, than his wife's.I don't want to give the impression that ""Chickamatzu Monogatari"" is all scheme (though it is highly schematic) and without more sensuous pleasures. The performances are graceful, gentle, individualized and lovely. The music, which is mostly Japanese, ranks with the most expressive I have ever heard in a film. And the look of the film, indoors or out, is like a tribute to the traditions of Japanese genre painting and the pictorial logic of the old almost square-shaped movie screen.During the main title credits to Lasse Forsberg's ""Mistreatment,"" which played last night at the New York Film Festival, a sign flashes on the screen to announce that ""the actors are responsible for their lines."" In so far as this is true, and at the press-screening news conference Forsberg assured the audience that it is quite true, ""Mistreatment"" is blessed with a remarkably articulate group of actors. And the most remarkable is Knut Pettersen, a nonprofessional (though he has had some training) with a fine aggressive manner and a notable ability to talk his head off.Pettersen plays a 31-year-old Stockholm radical who one day assaults the owner of a Jaguar (class exploitation; Pettersen figures the car is rightly his) and six months later, after several polite interrogations and much psychological testing, finds himself strapped and drugged in a progressive and well-managed state insane asylum.The central question of who's really insane (a question suggested by the film's title) is complicated by the fact that Pettersen picks his fights, mercilessly abuses the official machinery intended to help him, turns social awareness into paranoia, and generally acts as crazy as the well-adjusted types around him seem to think he is. He writes dreadful tracts full of revolutionary insight, in his personal accusations he is unjust, and he makes difficulties where none seem to exist. But he has the wisdom of his maladjustment, and each time he feels himself trapped, it turns out that there is indeed a cage to hold him. He is in some degree a function of the society he protests, and it is proper to ask of him not the blueprint for a brave new world, but a few truculent insights into this one.I greatly like the Pettersen character (and I greatly like Pettersen), but I am not so impressed with his revolutionary peer (Bjorn Granath) or the pleasant shop girl (Berit Persson) whom Bjorn seduces and abandons as a chapter in his own more cerebral protest diary.Most of Forsberg's dullest filmmaking centers on this pair, who live together in an apartment decorated like a handbook in revolutionary rhetoric, and who, even in bed, do uninteresting things with one another. In its subplot, if you will, ""Mistreatment"" too often settles for elaborate but inexpressive gestures and for the kind of empty irony that sometimes gives young filmmakers a bad name.Forsberg isn't all that young (37), but this is his first featureand it is important not for its failures but for moments of success, which are unusual, difficult, and most moving when apparently most annoying. Much of ""Mistreatment"" looks like a lot of other recent movies (the new freedom in subject matter has led, of course, to the most boring insistence on relevance) but where it becomes individual, and almost always where it is informed by the mind and style of Knut Pettersen, it is funny, strong and healthfully uncomfortable.",1970-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,Screen: Chabrol Examines a Very Delicate Balance:'Le Boucher' Stars His Wife as Schoolteacher,"Claude Chabrol's ""Le Boucher"" is a love story about a gentle, self-possessed butcher, Popaul (Jean Yanne), who may or may not spend his off-hours carving up young women in the woods, and a lovely school mistress, Mile. Hlne (Stphane Audran). The setting is the tiny village of Tremolat, not far from the Lascaux caves, but Mile. Hlne is no ordinary small-town school mistress. She is a woman who obviously buys her clothes in Paris, who can smoke in the street  a Gauloise hanging from her mouth apache-style  without ever losing her chic, and who responds with genuine pleasure when a student writes in a theme that ""it was so hot the air hurt you . . .""Popaul and Mile. Hlne meet at one of those exuberant, traditional wedding feasts at which they are the apparent but not unhappy outsiders. He is just out of the regular Army (where, as he says, he did a lot of butchering in Algeria and Indo-china), and she has been living in a very feminine kind of sexual isolation ever since a love affair ended disastrously 10 years earlier.They make an odd but immensely appealing pair as he courts her with specially cut legs of lamb and as she draws him into her life by having him join her on mushroom hunts and as a participant in a school fete, for which she teaches the butcher an 18th-century court dance (one of the movie's most touching moments). On one excursion to the country, he asks her how she can do without a lover. ""There are other ways,"" she answers. ""Disgusting,"" says the butcher, and she laughs. Later he wonders what she would do if he tried to kiss her. ""Nothing,"" she answers, adding, in a way that is both vulnerable and absolutely chilling, ""but I wish you wouldn't.""Like all of Chabrol's recent films, ""Le Boucher"" has to do with decisions made moments too late, of love just missed like a train. It is also second only to the practically perfect ""La Femme Infidle"" as the most elegant, most sorrowful of Chabrol's recent films, better than both the very stylish but geometric ""Les Biches"" and ""Que La Bte Meure"" (which will be released here as ""This Man Must Die"").I'm not sure that ""Le Boucher"" works for me on the level of psychological realism. I find it impossible to accept the suggestion that Chabrol ultimately makes, that is, that Mile. Hlne could have saved the psychotic killer from himself had she not been afraid to love, and that, by withholding her love, she is in some way as much of a beast as he is, fit to be condemned to eternal loneliness.Ironically, however, it is completely credible as romantic realism of the kind that has its models in Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" and Lang's ""Scarlet Street."" Although Chabrol will probably never attain the seeming spontaneity of his masters (he is simply too intellectual a filmmaker), he can excel both when it comes to creating deeply felt characters and their relationships with each other as well as with their environment.The tempo and the temper and even the weather of the little town of Tremolat are very much a part of ""Le Boucher"" and of the lives of Popaul and Mile. Hlne, who emotionally, anyway, pass in the course of the storm from late summer into irrevocable autumn. This is not to say the movie is without some conscious Hitchcockian details. Chabrol builds his suspense obliquely and although he uses blood sparingly, it is done with a sense of spectacle.There is one particularly outrageous moment when a little girl, who has been on a group outing to the caves, sits beneath a cliff and unwraps her sandwich, only to have a large dollop of red fall on the bread. It's the first indication that the killer's been at work again and that his victim, dead but still warm as pie, is hidden above.""Le Boucher,"" however, is not primarily interesting as conventional mystery, which the film makes little effort to maintain after a certain point. Rather it's as a moving love story that it makes sense, and this because Chabrol has respect and admiration for his stars as performers and as characters. Yanne's Popaul, for example, who does such terrible things off-screen, is never seen on screen as anything but completely sympathetic.It's no casual coincidence that each of Chabrol's best movies recently has starred Miss Audran, who, in private life, is Mrs. Chabrol and, in public, is the most beautiful and enigmatic screen personality to emerge in France since the early appearances of Jeanne Moreau in the 1950's. In ""Le Boucher"" there is something about Miss Audran's intelligence, her wit, her style and her wardrobe that makes her seem a very unlikely provincial schoolmarm, but (as it used to be with actresses like Garbo and Dietrich) it's this very unlikelihood that makes the character of Mile. Helne appear to be unique, thus special and worth caring about.""Le Boucher,"" which was shown Saturday night at the New York Film Festival, has not yet been acquired for commercial release.Billy Casper (David Bradley, a 15-year-old Yorkshire lad, who is small for his age, is always the last to be taken when sides are chosen for a soccer match. It's not only because his gym shorts are so big that he can hitch them over his shoulders; it is also because he is awkward and clumsy and likely to be daydreaming at crucial moments in the game. In real life, he'd probably be as difficult to live with as everyone says he is.On the screen, however, he's the tough-minded, blithe-spirited totally enchanting hero of ""Kes,"" an honorable, decent sort of movie that is, however, never quite as interesting as the people within it. The film was shown last night at Philharmonic Hall at the New York Film Festival.Kenneth Loach (""Poor Cow"") shot ""Kes"" entirely on location in the north of England, mostly with nonprofessional and semiprofessional actors who are, without exception, superb, as are individual scenes, seemingly improvised, that erupt with enormous vrit. Nevertheless, vrit alone does not necessarily make great cinma. It has, in fact, a way of reducing the tragic to the merely sad, almost commonplace.In its implications, if not in its execution, ""Kes"" is a tragedy, as classic and inevitable as Franois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"" seemed (at least until we learned, from subsequent films, that Truffaut's Antoine Doinel was to turn out rather well). Billy is the younger son in a household that consists of a tired mother, abandoned by her husband, and a bully of an older brother, with whom he has to share a very narrow bed. Billy, who has been abandoned too, makes one triumphant gesture toward maturityhe finds and trains (as opposed to tames) a young kestrel, only to have his brother, in a moment of rage, kill the hawk.For some explicable reasons, ""Kes"" left me, at the end, not terribly moved, partially because Loach never indicates whether this defeat for Billy simply marks the end of his childhood, or whether it will be permanent (in which case, of course, Billy might grow up to be the hero of something like ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,"" which isn't too terrifying).Loach, instead of imposing the kind of discipline that would have given Billy's story greater point, opts to let the film simply run on, and it runs on most entertainingly, but always in ways that somehow cheat Billy.There are lovely scenes depicting Billy's training of the hawk, and the hawk is the star. There's a hilarious chaotic soccer game refereed by the coach, who is also the captain of one of the teams and thus inclined to favor himself with a magnificent lack of embarrassment.Billy is also a supporting player in the most moving scene in the film, in which he and a group of friends, smokers all, are ushered into the office of the headmaster, who promptly puts the switch to a tiny, innocent boy who has come to deliver a message. ""A regular tobacco factory,"" the headmaster calls him, as the boy, tears in the corners of his eyes, mutely accepts the injustice.Loach is not a director of notable style, nor can he often refuse the obvious shot, but he seems to have a remarkable talent for handling actors and obtaining performances that are truly memorable. I was not especially bothered by one bit of authenticity, the Yorkshire accents that sometimes make key lines of dialogue unintelligible. But then I originally saw the film at Cannes, where the French subtitles were an enormous help.",1970-09-14T05:00:00+0000

us,"Film Festival: Resnai's 'Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime':Experiment in Science Surrounds Story Wall St. Clashes Seen in Other Feature","Like most of the previous films of Alain Resnais, ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime,"" made in 1968 but first seen here last night at the New York Film Festival, is science fiction of a sort. And like virtually all of Resnais's previous films, including the 35-mm. shorts of the 1950's, its concern is for the past recaptured. To support this concern it proposes a story, the most fragmented of all Resnais's stories, deal- (as do the rest of the collected work of Alain Resnais) with a perhaps intense but nevertheless transitory love affair.Claude (Claude Rich), having recovered from an unsuccessful suicide attempt, is picked for an experiment by a secret research center that studies nothing less than time. After much preparation Claude, along with a laboratory mouse, is placed inside a large soft brain-shaped structure, from which he is to be transported back to relive one minute at 4 in the afternoon exactly one year ago. He does relive that minute (he is snorkeling on vacation in southern France, and ""underwater"" becomes a recurring image and idea for the film), but he begins reliving it several times overand then in bits and pieces he begins to relive other moments scattered through the seven years he lived with Catrine (Olga Georges-Picot), whom he thinks he killed and for whose death he had tried to kill himself.Assuming that they have lost him forever, and sadly admitting that their experiment has been a most incomplete success, the research scientists wander out of the laboratoryonly to discover Claude, a bullet in his gut (he has most recently relived his botched suicide) lying on the grass. They carry him to help, but in their despondency and concern they forget the little mouse, who did come back, and who now sniffs forlornly inside his container within the giant brain.I am disturbed by that mouse, not only for the bathos of the image but also because his situation so ludicrously (and, I think, so intentionally) recalls that of the wife Simone looking for her husband, already light-years away, inside another woman's deserted apartment at the end of Resnais's one masterpiece ""Muriel."" For ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"" resembles ""Muriel"" in so many close ways that the success of the older film (1963) stands in almost total reproach to the general banality of the newer one.Although obsessed with time, memory, the past, the physical material of ""Je T'Aime, Je T'Aime"" is its love story and the daily lives of the couple involved in it. But in that story and in those lives it finds so little of interest or urgency that with all its perceptual complexity it comes to seem an enormous and ingenious structure with almost nothing inside it.Unlike ""Last Year at Marienbad"" its people and its events are resolutely ordinary.

us,Film Festival: 'Musica',"Marguerite Duras's ""La Musica,"" which she adapted from her own short two-character play, is about a husband and wife who meet three years after their formal separation, when they return to the provincial town where they once lived to pick up their divorce decree.In the film's longest sequence, which I suspect is pretty much the total of the play, He (Robert Hossein) and She (Delphine Seyrig) come together in the lobby of their hotel, at first acting like anxious, rueful ghosts. They circle each other in carefully choreographed movements; alternately each literally frames the other by his own person and by his mirror image. (Miss Duras loves to see things in and through glassmirrors, windshields, windows). The revelations, though obliquely made, are quite specific. She was unfaithful. He once planned to murder her, She, unknown to him, once tried to commit suicide.With the revelations comes the ironic realization that, although each is committed to someone else, they've just fallen in love. The most that they can hope for themselves is that they'll possibly meet again, sometime in the future, by accident. In some peculiar, cockeyed way, this seems to be a bridge beyond death, a lot more austere but no less romantic, in the context, than the faith that was to reunite Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne in the clouds over Hollywood in ""A Guy Named Joe.""Because Miss Duras writes so elliptically, there is no special sense that she has padded her original play until the confrontation in the hotel lobby. At that point, however, one realizes that all that has gone before has been rather superior but ultimately superfluous vamping, including the introduction of a character not in the play, a young American girl (Julie Dassin), who appears to be simply the reflection of one of the husband's long-ago infidelities talked about in the play.""La Musica"" is intellectually chic moviemaking of the sort that is quite entertaining while it is going on but practically ceases to exist, even as a memory, when it's over. Hossein and Miss Seyrig read their lines with style and look marvelously unhappy, she, especially, in blond bob that evokes the 1930's and the image of Lilyan Tashman.The New York Film Festival, which showed ""La Musica"" last night at Philharmonic Hall, is presenting Miss Duras, in her role as a film director, in a reversed-time sequence. Having shown ""Destroy, She Said,"" the French novelist-playwright's second directorial effort last year, the festival this year selected her first film ""La Musica,"" made in 1966 and co-directed with Paul Seban, who had earlier collaborated with her on a series of television productions.",1970-09-16T05:00:00+0000

us,'Dwarfs Started Small',"The world of ""Even Dwarfs Started Small,"" which was shown at the New York Film Festival last night, is a barren, white-washed correctional institution, set on a subtropical, lava island, all of whose inmates (and even its passers-by) are out of scale with their environment and with one another. Some midgets and dwarfs are bigger than other midgets and dwarfs, but none of them  in this film anywaycan easily get in or out of a standard-sized automobile or negotiate a door knob set at a conventional height. They live in a system that ignores them.""Whether we're good or bad, the treatment is all the same,"" says one of the inmates, whose voice has the high, hollow, brain-bending, midget timbre of a Winston Churchill LP played at 78 r.p.m.The inmates take over the asylum and the entire film, which is without system of any kind as sustained metaphor (except for the initial Man-and-God thing), is devoted to exuberantly recording the details of the minidebauch, 24 hours of destruction and cruelty defining midget's inhumanity to midget, animal and vegetable.The cast, in addition to 28 dwarfs and midgets, includes a dying sow, a one-legged chicken, which is tormented by the other chickens, and a droopy camel that, in one of the film's last frames, defecates as he tries to make up his mind to stand or sit, assuming finally a frustrated, stalemated kneel.""Even Dwarfs Started Small"" is the second feature by Werner Herzog, a 28-year-old German director whose highly regarded ""The Signs of Life"" was shown at the 1968 New York festival. At a press conference following the screening of his film earlier in the week, Herzog, quite correctly, declined to explain the film and turned aside suggestions of any relationship to the more calculated, surreal work of Buuel. His film, he said, came on him ""like a nightmare.""Herzog is a highly skilled director, but his images, because of their essential meaninglessness, become their own reason for being. ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"" eventually is indistinguishable from its Germanic, side-show spectacle, as if it were a movie that had been conceived by the same kind of perverse, uninvolved intelligence that had created the world of the film.",1970-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,Peppard Plays Agent in 'Executioner',"If you like espionage thrillers with pounding drive, a cunning plot tangle that yields two astonishing surprises and truly colorful backgrounds splashing the screen from London to Corfu, then catch ""The Executioner."" This Columbia release, which has an uncommonly sensible performance by George Peppard as a thunderball sleuth, flanked by some crisply expert Britons, opened yesterday on the circuits.Let the prologue slide past. The opening is the aftermath of a country estate massacre, with Peppard extracting Joan Collins from the gore, cueing in some boing-boing music and angular flashback snippetsthe only persistent clutter in an extremely complicatedbut fascinating plot.Then listen hard to every word, as Peppard, playing an American-reared British agent, accuses his superiors of harboring a traitor and butts his hard head into dangerous areas, sprinting from London to Athens (a nifty sequence making use of a floodlit Acropolis) and a pile-driving showdown on the exotic island of Corfu.Sam Wanamaker (welcome back), the director, and his ace photographer cram in vivid details accelerating the action. The others are fine, too, especially Nigel Patrick, Charles Gray and Keith Michell. Miss Collins and Judy Geeson are neatly ornamental. The only ruband it lingersis that final flip reference to eight human sacrifices. Otherwise Jack Pulman's screenplay is a sizzling winner, served and played accordingly.",1970-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,'Une Simple Histoire',"Marcel Hanoun belongs to that diminishing company of French directors (including Jacques Rozier, Roger Leenhardt, Alexandre Astruc, and until very recently, Eric Rohmer) whose work is known to American movie lovers by reputation, but whose films are rarely, or even never, seen here. Hanoun, who is 40 years old, has been making feature movies for 13 years, and of these, ""Une Simple Histoire,"" which played last night at the New York Film Festival, is the earliest.Hanoun made ""Une Simple Histoire"" in 1958, but it looks more like 1938, with its dark, low-contrast photography (it was shot in 16-mm.), its unglamorous realism, and its heroine with her penciled eyebrows and her unstylishly bobbed hair. The heroine (Micheline Bezanon, the only player given credit in the program, although there are several other important roles) is a poor youngish woman who, with her little daughter, comes to Paris looking for a job. She doesn't get a job, and when, eventually, she can't afford a place to sleep she spends a night out of doors. She is discovered by a kindly older woman who takes her in (this is where the movie actually begins), and in whose apartment, in one extended flashback, she tells her story.The telling of the story, the young woman's narrative, is imposed on the action in such a way as to deny each scene any ordinary dramatic interest and instead to substitute a counterpointing between the description (which is very flat) and the actual realization (also very flatand with dialogue subdued beneath the narrative voice). At first this method seems pregnant with understated tension, but in time you come to realize that nothing more is happening than appears to be happening, and the method begins to seem silly. And at a certain not exceptional moment, when the young woman, very disconsolate, stands by a tunnel and says: ""I found a tunnela place where cars went in. They came out a bit further on.""at that moment I began to find the simple story rather silly, too.There is an overwhelming temptation to compare Hanoun with Robert Bresson, whose work ""Une Simple Histoire"" greatly resembles. But Bresson, for all the spare severity of his style, has never professed to tell a simple story, and (for example, in ""Mouchette"" and ""Une Femme Douce"") has often tended to make more complex the fictions upon which he bases his films.Hanoun's simplicitylike his almost stationary camera (which is just stationary enough to make for some very fancy corner-of-the-frame interior shots that might have been centered), like his depressed view of Paris, like his leading lady's eyebrowsseems finally less a matter artistic asceticism than of artful calculation. And in the midst of the many deprivations that constitute his style there is a kind of pretentiousness  ostentationsness, really  as if he were taking pride in poverty.",1970-09-17T05:00:00+0000

us,STARSTRUCK ENVIRONMENTS,"A growing number of architects and designers are approaching the design of their living spaces with an impetuosity that verges on virtu osity. Charles Moore, dean of the School of Architecture at Yale, (seated crosslegged on his terrace, left, with its Vasarelystyle fence and trompe l'oeil intruder peeking in) was living in a startling environ ment of his own design. But one day he decided to refurbish. Beneath his paint brush the bed (opposite) traded in stripes for bright stars and out of the top popped a Renaissance dome (a photostat of an archi tectural drawing). An enormous fluorescent 42 soon appeared amid the cutaway walls of his kitchen (top, left) to commemorate his 42d birthday and 42d Street. Architect Hugh Hardy's environment (above) grew in the same way. In the altogether respectable living room, Alice Lyndon,, wife of the dean of architecture at MIT, and Hugh improvised a sculpture of stove pipes (designed by Alice with Hugh adding the lights). A billboard promoting VISTA was cut up to become a ceiling of onlooking graduates; the billboard's lettering (hung upside down) marches around the room. Frivolous as it may appear, such spontaneous design stems from a serious premise: There are new ways of approach ing, exposing and solving any problem., It is an exercise that we give to students, says Charles Moore. Take a set thing; by the applica tion of paint and graphics, make something different out of it. The result is an entirely new idea.
