Eventually, her work proved to be ""of very great benefit to humanity"" said the Swedish Academy last week, in citing Miss Gordimer for the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature. Her several masterpieces, including ""Burger's Daughter"" and ""July's People,"" have each been banned at one time in South Africa, but lately her works have all been available. Also available last week were the rather faint congratulations of President F.W. de Klerk, who managed to stretch Miss Gordimer's achievement into ""an honor for South Africa.""

us,Q and A,"Interest on Advance Rent Question: After taking early retirement I sold a home and moved to Manhattan. I rented an apartment in a co-op building before I had a new job. Because I was not employed when I signed the lease, the only way I could get the apartment was to pay the entire year's rent of $21,000, in advance. Does the management owe me interest earned on the lump-sum payment? . . . Shirley Granahan, Manhattan Answer: Yes. Theodore L. Marks, a lawyer specializing in real estate, said Sec. 7103 of the New York State General Obligations law requires that money given as security or advance rent, if it is in excess of one month, be kept for the benefit of the tenant. It also requires that in rental properties of six or more units, security or advance rent must be put in interest-bearing accounts. The tenant has the right to the interest, less 1 percent for administrative costs. Replacing Appliances Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in a building converted to a co-op. I had an old, leaking refrigerator, an oven with a split door and an unrepairable dishwasher. The landlord was indifferent to my requests for replacement. I arranged with the superintendent to install replacements at my expense. Do I have a right to recover my expenses in exchange for a rental increase? . . .Patricia Goodman, Manhatttan Answer: No. Your landlord is under no obligation to reimburse you. The laws that cover rent-regulated tenants give them the right to working kitchen appliances. But landlords can repair appliances or replace them with used ones. If landlords supply new appliances, however, they may add 1/40th of the cost to the rent and the rent increase becomes permanent.",1991-10-06T05:00:00+0000

The layering of past with present -- captured in a photograph of the old Jewish cemetery in Prague, where headstones are crowded eight centuries deep -- drives the book.

Who's the man -- it's probably not a woman -- behind the wheel? What's the story with those yellow-bumpered cabs? And why are they yellow anyway?

The top-ranked Edberg, who won the United States Open last month, celebrated his 32d career title by spraying champagne into the air and then taking a drink from the bottle. Gilbert, seeded ninth, is 0 for 3 in finals this year. (AP) Seles Defeats Navratilova: Monica Seles, ranked No. 1 in the world, won the Milan Indoor in Italy by defeating Martina Navratilova, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, in the rematch of the United States Open final won by the 17-year-old. In the ninth game of the third set, Seles broke serve with a series of powerful, precise returns and held service in the 10th game to win the match. (AP) GOLF Colbert Comes Back for Senior Victory Jim Colbert came from three strokes back with a 67 and held on for a one-stroke victory yesterday in the Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C. Four others -- Dale Douglass, George Archer, Simon Hobday and Gibby Gilbert -- led or shared the lead over the final 18 holes before Colbert won his second title of the season with a 205 total, 11 under par on the Tanglewood course. Jim Dent, Gilbert and Archer tied for second at 206. (AP) McCallister Wins in a Playoff: Blaine McCallister birdied the second playoff hole with a 25-foot putt to win the Texas Open in San Antonio and leave Gary Hallberg a runner-up for the second consecutive year. McCallister shot a final-round 70 while Hallberg had a 69 over the Oak Hills Country Club course. Both ended regulation with 11-under 269 totals. Hallberg missed a 20-foot birdie putt that would have kept the playoff alive. (AP) AUTO RACING Others Stop While Luyendyk Races Ahead Arie Luyendyk foiled bids by Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti and won the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix yesterday in Nazareth, Pa. Rahal appeared to have a victory wrapped up when he darted into the pits for a splash of fuel 10 laps from the end of the 200-lap race. That stop seemed to give the lead and the overall championship title to Andretti, but he, too, had to pit for fuel on Lap 195 on the one-mile Pennsylvania International Raceway tri-oval. Suddenly, Luyendyk was taking the checkered flag for his second victory this season. He drove his Lola-Chevrolet across the finish line .71 of a second ahead of Rahal. Andretti was third. (AP) Bodine Gets Nascar Victory: Geoff Bodine reached the finish line on fumes to take his first Nascar victory of 1991, the Mello Yello 500 in Concord, N.C. Bodine took over first place when Allison came in for gas on Lap 317. Although Allison's stop barely reached 4 seconds, it helped Bodine open up a 21-second edge that Allison couldn't close. Alan Kulwicki was third, followed by Harry Gant. (AP) HOCKEY Penguins and Flyers Skate to a Tie The Philadelphia Flyers got first-period goals from Rick Tocchet and Steve Duchesne yesterday, then survived a two-man Pittsburgh advantage in the final four minutes of regulation to tie the Penguins, 2-2. In their first home game since winning the Stanley Cup, the Penguins tied the game on Joe Mullen's goal midway through the second period, but they went 0 for 8 on the power play, including the two-man advantage that lasted 1:23. (AP) Jets 5, Flames 3: Ed Olczyk scored a pair of power-play goals to lead Winnipeg over the visiting Calgary Flames. Olczyk, a natural center playing on the wing this season, notched both his first and second goals of the season. (AP) Kings 2, Oilers 2: Los Angeles goalie Kelly Hrudey made back-to-preserve a tie with the Oilers in Edmonton. The Kings held a 2-1 lead until early in the third period when Murphy tied it at 2:15. The Kings took the lead at 12:57 of the first while on the power play when Thomas Sandstrom scored. Edmonton tied the game at 2:37 of the second period when Josef Beranek sent a blistering 25-foot drive past Hrudey. Los Angeles took a 2-1 lead late in the second period on Luc Robitaille's goal.",1991-10-07T05:00:00+0000

Swamp Thing","Handbag or monster, main course or sewer dweller, the alligator has kept its spiny dignity even when put to the chintziest of uses. It should even survive Vaughn L. Glasgow's book, A SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR: The Earth Trembles With His Thunder (St. Martin's, $29.95). Mr. Glasgow, the director for special projects at the Louisiana State Museum, is an enthusiastic collector of Southern lore and scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, his book is sloppily organized and contains more than everything you ever wanted to know about Alligator mississipiensis. The author is on sure footing when taking the reader along on a bayou hunt or discussing the scientific advances in alligator breeding that have relieved worries about extinction. But matters are swampier when he turns cultural critic. Political cartoonists have had a fine old time using alligators to represent greedy politicians, but, Mr. Glasgow lectures us, ""Probably without realizing it, the artists who have depicted alligators have had a deep influence on the conceptual archetype that we all carry around in our heads."" ""Alligator disinformation,"" like that seen on trick-photography postcards, helps ""contribute to an error-riddled image of the alligator in the minds of the United States public.""

Last week the Government decided not to appeal his $3.8 million medical malpractice award. Mr. Gaffney's family's troubles started in 1981 when Navy medical staff failed to detect that his wife, Mutsuko, was in labor and sent her home. The baby was stillborn, and Mrs. Gaffney required a Caesarean section, during which she had the transfusion that infected her with the AIDS virus. Mrs. Gaffney died in 1987. Mr. Gaffney, who learned in 1987 that he was also infected, has been in court for five years. The Government decided not to appeal the award because of Mr. Gaffney's rapidly deteriorating health and because the award was, in the words of one official, not huge. The money is to be used for a trust fund for Mr. Gaffney's 8-year-old daughter, Maureene, who appears to be free of the virus.",1991-10-13T05:00:00+0000

He refused to give an undialectical ""no"" to any thinker, just as he refused to give anyone an undialectical ""yes"" (although he once, in an aside, stated that he thought Pascal came closest to the truth).

Cassell maintains that physicians depend too heavily on recipes for diagnosing and treating disease and that they ignore what he calls the ""art of medicine"" -- understanding patients, how they live, what they think and how they should be treated. In THE NATURE OF SUFFERING: And the Goals of Medicine (Oxford University, $24.95) Dr. Cassell, a professor of public health at Cornell University Medical College and the author of ""The Healer's Art,"" insists that physicians need to recognize that disease and suffering are not the same thing. Two women treated for breast cancer, for example, may suffer quite differently. One may resume life with gusto and optimism; the other may become seriously depressed, tortured by an altered image of herself, worried about the way her husband feels about her and fearful of early death. Dr. Cassell says the way a doctor treats these two distinct women involves more than technical competence and medical knowledge. The physician must provide empathetic support and be sensitive to their unspoken needs. This, he writes, is what ""distinguishes the practice of medicine -- clinical medicine -- from medical science."" Dr. Cassell's book is not easy to read. It is dense and ponderous, and the fine lines he draws between disease and illness, bodies and persons, signs and symptoms are sometimes blurry. But the essence of his message is clear: If physicians want to restore their good name, if they want to create ""the magical bond that permits a sick person to be healed by a stranger,"" they had better start focusing on people, not just diseases.",1991-10-13T05:00:00+0000

The Red Wings were the last of the 22 National Hockey League teams to record a victory, as they had only managed a tie in their first four games. The first period was scoreless, and fairly slow-paced, but the action picked up after a penalty to Craig Muni of Edmonton six minutes into the second. Detroit had missed on its power play in the last 15 attempts, and looked even worse when Oiler captain Esa Tikkanen intercepted Steve Chiasson's pass and broke in for a shorthanded goal at 6 minutes 31 seconds. Less than a minute later, though, the Red Wings ended their power-play drought on an odd goal. Steve Yzerman had the puck in front of Oiler goalie Bill Ranford, when Bob Probert swiped at it. Probert hit Yzerman's stick, sending the puck shooting across the goal mouth, off the leg of Edmonton defenseman Jeff Beukeboom and into the net. Yzerman was given credit for the goal.

us,"Guidepost; A Stamp Helps, Too","Every day about 30 million letters go astray. The Postal Service says the causes include incorrect addressing, and handwriting so illegible that neither human nor machine can decipher it. Here are some ways to avoid problems, especially with the approach of the holiday mailing period, when more mail than ever is likely to go astray. Clarity Use a typewriter, a computer printer or handwritten block letters. Limit the address to four or five lines. ZIP Code To be read by the Postal Service's high-speed optical character machines the ZIP code should be on the last line of the address, after the state. An incorrect ZIP code, or the omission of one, will cause a delay. Apartment Numbers The apartment number should immediately follow the street address on the same line. Absence of numbers is a big reason for nondelivery. 'Courtesy' Envelopes Don't try to reroute a reply envelope that has a bar code at the bottom by placing a new address label over the printed address. The postal machine will read the bar code and send the mail to the destination the code represents. Film Paste a label with your address on film cartridges so that if they fall out of the envelope, as many do, the post office can return them.",1991-10-19T05:00:00+0000

O'Meara, who spent the week at his home less than a half hour from the tournament site, had led after the first two rounds but was one stroke off the lead entering the final round. Peoples, another local favorite, carded a 65 in the final round, but ran out of birdies in the final four holes. O'Meara regained a share of the lead on the par-4 ninth hole with an eagle and snapped a tie with Peoples with a birdie on the 400-yard 16th hole. O'Meara picked up a new car and $180,000 for his 21-under-par 267 effort -- pushing his season's earnings to almost $530,000. Peoples, who won the Southern Open three weeks ago, won $108,000. Paul Azinger, who came into the final round with a one-stroke lead, finished third, the fourth consecutive year he has finished in the top five here without a victory. Azinger shot a 67 yesterday on top of successive 65's, but in the end couldn't overcome his par 72 in the opening round.

us,HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL REPORT,"PATCHOGUE 23, WILLIAM FLOYD 21 -- Patchogue (4-1) scored all its points in the first half and held on as William Floyd scored 21 points in the second half before the comeback fell short. Time ran out for Floyd while it was on Patchogue's 18-yard line and before it was able to get its field-goal unit onto the field. The victory allowed the Raiders to clinch a tie for the league title. Bobby Nitsch opened the scoring for Patchogue when he caught a 9-yard pass from Matt Krawczwk (17 of 31 for 236 yards) in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Frank Alvarado intercepted a pass and dashed 80 yards for the Raiders' second score. Krawczwk later hit Mike Hansen with a 45-yard scoring strike. John Fechter closed out the half when he kicked a 27-yard field goal. The second half began, much like the first. Patchogue on its opening possession, drove the length of the field but was intercepted at the goal line. Floyd then put together its own 80-yard drive that was capped by a Keith Toomey 2-yard run. Rich Triollo scooted 50 yards for Floyd's last score of the day. POPE JOHN 29, LENAPE VALLEY 0 -- Matt Petronzio, who entered the contest tied for the New Jersey state scoring lead, padded his statistics by rushing for three touchdowns and a two-point conversion to lead Pope John (5-0) over Lenape Valley (4-1). The Lions didn't score until the midway point of the second quarter when Petronzio (22 carries for 145 yards) capped a 11-play, 35-yard drive with a 1-yard run. Petronzio scored again from 10 yards out with 1:17 left in the first half. Petronzio's third touchdown completed a 11-play, 90-yard drive. The touchdown came on a 34-yard scamper to start the fourth quarter. Mike Johnston (15 carries for 160 yards) closed out the scoring with a 56-yard run. BRIARCLIFF 22, EDGEMONT 0 -- Quarterback Joel Ackerman (seven of 13 for 97 yards) threw for two touchdowns and Bob Lacasta (12 carries for 60 yards) scored the other as Briarcliff (5-0) defeated Edgemont (4-1). Briarcliff only led 3-0 at the half. Tim Spino returned the opening kickoff 85 yards, which led to George Cancro's 20-yard field goal.

Thurber At Large","The concept of THURBER ON CRIME (Mysterious Press, $18.95) might strike readers who remember James Thurber for his comic essays and cartoons as something of a stretch by an anthologist with an intriguing idea. However, as the novelist Donald E. Westlake notes in his brief and perceptive foreword, there is indeed in the Thurber canon a surprising amount of material with at least a vague focus on crime. For example, a quick flip through these pages reveals that an impressive number of those familiar and artless Thurber cartoons deal with violence -- either actual or imminent. And there are several selections in which criminal investigations and trials are detailed with economy and arch wit. Couple these with a raft of short stories and parodies centering on everything from murder to kidnapping, and the editor, Robert Lopresti, a writer of crime fiction, has made his point. If the longest selection in the book tells us perhaps more about Thurber's beloved bloodhounds than we might wish to know, it does so with typical charm and skill. And among the five previously uncollected pieces is ""The Man Who Knew Too Little,"" a classic and delightful Thurberesque encounter with a stranger in a Paris cafe. Any book that brings the hilarious ""Macbeth Murder Mystery"" to a new audience is, for that reason alone, a valuable addition to mystery lore.",1991-10-20T05:00:00+0000

This clearly was not the case with Selzer and the patient R., who called Selzer in to assist in his suicide.

There are big differences in logs for the hearth. Softwoods, mostly from evergreens, should never be used. They usually have unsafe levels of creosote, which can cause chimney fires. Logs should have been aged for six months or more; they will ignite faster and burn more brightly than fresh wood, which sizzles and creates heavy smoke.

us,"IN SHORT: NONFICTION;
No Stone Unturned","A familiar sight in the long tradition of landscape art is the depiction of the artist, wandering alone down a road. The Englishman Richard Long has given a remarkable twist to that image: enacting it, he becomes the wanderer, making the journey an integral part of his art. Mr. Long walks -- sometimes on a local hill, sometimes on a site as remote as a Bolivian mountain path -- and on the way stops to create sculptures from whatever is at hand: bark, snow, branches, but most often stones arranged in the elemental shapes of a circle, line or cross. He records the results with a camera and notebook. Although outdoor sculptures like ""Hoggar Circle"" (1988), a dusty, round clearing in the rocky Sahara, predominate in the artist's work, he also creates gallery installations, making a circle of handprints in river mud on a wall or arranging large stones into a strip like a jagged carpet. Loose rocks and debris suggest the preoccupations in Mr. Long's art; his grave, sensuous works are meditations on human fragility and our relationship to nature. As Anne Seymour, a director of the Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London, points out in her excellent introduction to RICHARD LONG: Walking in Circles (George Braziller, $80), the artist is concerned with presenting ""the moving, changing body of nature."" Along with an essay by the artist Hamish Fulton and an interview with Mr. Long by the art critic Richard Cork, the book unites the many facets of Mr. Long's art -- photographs, maps, sculptures, mud paintings and poetic texts -- and captures the spirit of his austere, elegant creations.",1991-10-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Business Diary/October 20-25,"ECONOMY How the U.S. Economy Is Handicapping Detroit This is Detroit's worst year -- ever. The General Motors Corporation lost $1.1 billion and the Ford Motor Company lost $574.4 million in the third quarter. The Chrysler Corporation reports earnings this week and big losses are expected. Sales are down for Japanese auto makers, but most are still showing profits. ""Don't blame this on Bob Stempel,"" said James Womack, co-author of ""The Machine That Changed the World."" Mr. Stempel is G.M.'s chairman. The problem, Mr. Womack says, is that as companies move to newer production techniques they are more vulnerable to the economy's ups and downs. The Japanese manage their economy better, he said, so their companies do better. ""Lean production can't function in the extreme cyclicality that is normal in this country,"" he said. What will turn things around? ""I can't see a way out without the Government stepping in. It's starting to happen with mini-vans."" Bad Timing for F.D.I.C. Chief William Taylor took over as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last week. He may wish he hadn't. Just after his confirmation, the F.D.I.C. told Congress it was tripling its estimate of how much money it will need next year to protect the nation's bank deposits. Instead of a ""mere"" $3 billion, the F.D.I.C. said it will require $9.6 billion. In 1993, it will need $8.7 billion more. The F.D.I.C. estimates that more than 200 banks will fail next year with assets of about $86 billion. But the estimates assume the economy will grow at about 3.5 percent, which is unlikely. If it continues to limp along the fund could require as much as $28.9 billion over the next two years, the F.D.I.C. said. That casts a pall over the Administration's proposal to raise the F.D.I.C.'s credit line to $30 billion for two years. In a slow-growth economy -- with $28.9 billion needed -- there would be just $1.1 billion left to insure about $2.3 trillion of deposits -- not much of a safety net. It is now up to Mr. Taylor to mend that net. A Big-Ticket Surprise Durable goods are big-ticket items like refrigerators and railroad cars. They are supposed to last at least three years (some actually do). These big items are an important engine for the economy. But according to the Commerce Department, sales of these goods took a 3.2 percent slide in September after falling 4.1 percent in August. Economists were surprised; the consensus was that orders for durables would increase by 1 percent. The Economy's Political Clout After the coalition forces defeated Iraq in March, President Bush's popularity soared. But since then confidence in Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy took the mother of all tumbles. According to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll released last week, 57 percent of Americans disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy. Sixty percent feel ""things"" have gotten ""pretty seriously off on the wrong track."" In January -- even as the gulf war loomed -- only 31 percent of all Americans thought so. The recent poll said 44 percent of Americans feel the country is in worse shape now than it was five years ago. With just 13 months left to the election, Mr. Bush had better hope the slow-growth economy has a quick rebound. The 'Beige Book' Looks Bleak The Federal Reserve's ""beige book,"" released last week, was hardly a confidence builder. The book is a compilation of reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks. The book said the recovery had lost much of its oomph in September and early October. Retail sales were flat; factory output -- while improving -- was doing so at a laggardly pace. How will the Fed react to its own book? ""It will cut the discount rate by Thanksgiving to about 4.5 percent,"" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Such a cut, he said, will drive money out of money-market accounts and into stocks. A Whole New Telephone Game The Federal Communications Commission proposed last week that local telephone companies be allowed to package and transmit video programs on their wires. With next-generation fiber-optics lines phone companies could offer a myriad of interactive services from entertainment libraries, recipe banks and educational programs, each tailored to a customer's needs. The $18 billion cable industry is likely to fight (unsuccessfully) against the ruling. ""Among the top two or three concerns of every cable operator has always been head-to-head competition against local telephone companies,"" said John Mansell, of Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm.

Instead the focus is on the daily life of the inhabitants of a crumbling city-state called Charn, once the seat of an empire ruled by the multitudinous Starbridge clan (whose blood is more amber than red and who may or may not have descended, quite literally, from Paradise).
