The marshals seized the paintings in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Thomas Arvid, an American painter of wine and wine bottles, against the Gold Coast gallery in Lake Geneva, Wis. David C. Williams, a lawyer for the gallery, said the paintings were made in China but did not violate copyrights. Handmade paintings are not necessarily covered by copyright law, because they are not exact duplicates of original works, he said. Peter J.

In its place NBC is moving up its 9 p.m. show, ""E-Ring,"" a drama set in the Pentagon, which has also been disappointing in its first two outings. NBC executives said they hoped that ""E-Ring"" might add viewers by being the only drama at 8 p.m. Wednesday and that ""Martha"" might gain a few reality TV fans because at 9 it would not face another in that genre, as it has at 8 against ""America's Next Top Model"" on UPN.

They will present the cycle twice there in July 2007 in the latest export of the all-Russian Ring, which has played in Baden-Baden, Seoul and Moscow, and will appear at the Orange County Performing Arts Center next October. The New York performances are a joint venture of the Lincoln Center Festival and the Metropolitan Opera. The festival director, Nigel Redden, said the cost was in the multimillions, but declined, along with the Met, to be more specific or to discuss how the two presenters would share the burden. In a telephone interview, Mr. Gergiev said that Wagner has had a resurgence in Russia in recent years, after decades of being ignored because of historical enmity with Germany. The performances of the Kirov ""Ring"" at the Maryinsky Theater in 2003 were among the first in Russia since the revolution, Mr. Gergiev said.

Odder still that his campaign style invited comparisons with Oscar Wilde, Evelyn Waugh, Noel Coward and Mort Sahl. But oddest of all was that he was taken seriously - seriously enough to confound opponents, observers and analysts and throw the election up for grabs. Although it wasn't clear at the time, Buckley's bid for office was an important chapter in one of the crucial events in modern political history, the transformation of the consensus politics of the peak cold-war years of the 1950's and early 60's, its agenda set by liberals, into the more polarized politics of our era, ruled by conservatives.",2005-10-02T04:00:00+0000

But Heinlein holds a unique place in this world; many scientists and engineers who built the first United States spacecraft (as well as today's space-tourism entrepreneurs) cite his novels as their inspiration. Larry Niven, a sci-fi writer, spoofs this in ""The Return of William Proxmire,"" a time-travel yarn written in 1988.

On Wednesday, September 28, 2005, David Dibner, accomplished businessman, philanthropist and civic leader, died unexpectedly at his home in Wilton, CT. Mr. Dibner, who was Chairman of the Dibner Fund, a family foundation, and former Chairman of the Burndy Corporation, was 78 years old. Mr. Dibner had a long and distinguished career. After serving in the navy in WWII, he trained as an engineer at Columbia University and continued with post-graduate studies at the London School of Economics. In 1968 he attended the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University. In his more than 30-year career at the Burndy Corporation, a leading multinational manufacturer of electrical and electronic connectors and tools, he rose from engineer to chairman of the board. Mr. Dibner was also an exceptional and committed civic leader. In Wilton, the community where he and his wife, Frances Kessler Dibner, resided for 53 years, he spearheaded and chaired the building of the Wilton High School, as well being chair and an active board member of the Norwalk Hospital. His involvement extended to business, academic and philanthropic sectors: he was a founding member of the American Business Conference and an active trustee of Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. He also served on the boards of Columbia University School of Engineering, the American Technion Society and was a member of the Committee for the Humanities at MIT. In addition, he was a fellow of the Aspen Institute and a member of the Council on Foundations. In 1989, following the death of his father, Bern Dibner, Mr. Dibner assumed responsibility for the Dibner Fund, a family philanthropy, and the Burndy Library, one of the world's outstanding collections of rare books, manuscripts, incunabula and objects in the field of the history of science and technology. Together with his wife Frances and with support of the Dibner Fund, Mr. Dibner established the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology, a center for advanced study located along with the Burndy Library on the campus of MIT.

Trembling, I forced myself to practice the chakra breathing I'd learned during an involuntary week at an ashram with my parents. My heart rate slowed slightly after a few concentrated breaths of re on the inhale and lax on the exhale, and within a few minutes I was functional enough to take some necessary precautions. First I rescued Millington (who was also cowering in terror) from her hiding place under the couch. Then, in quick succession, I zipped on a pair of knee-high leather boots to cover my exposed legs, opened the door to the hallway to encourage the bug's departure, and began spraying the extra-strong black-market vermin poison on every available surface in my minuscule one-bedroom. I gripped the trigger as though it were an assault weapon and was still spraying when the phone rang nearly ten minutes later. ",2005-10-02T05:00:00+0000

Dean David Schizer and the students, faculty and staff of Columbia Law School mourn the death of Constance Baker Motley, graduate of the Columbia Law School Class of 1946. While studying law at Columbia, she met Thurgood Marshall and began her illustrious career in the civil rights movement. Judge Motley won nine of the 10 cases she argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as the landmark desegregation case that gained James Meredith admission to the University of Mississippi (the danger of such work was made clear when her colleague in the case, Medgar Evers, was murdered). Her intellect and legal acumen were fundamental to many civil rights victories won by more visible leaders like Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr., whom she once counseled in a four-by-six jail cell in rural Georgia. In the early 1960s, she served as a New York state senator and as Manhattan borough president, the first African-American woman to hold either office. She subsequently became the first black woman appointed to a federal judgeship, and served with distinction on the bench of the Southern District of New York. In this time of sadness, we are reminded of the announcement accompanying her Presidential Citizens Medal in 2000: ""As a dedicated public servant and distinguished judge, she has broken down political, social and professional barriers, and her pursuit of equal justice under law widened the circle of opportunity in America.""",2005-10-02T05:00:00+0000

Born on Campobello Island, New Brunswick, she was the daughter of Frederick Baldwin Adams and Ellen Walters Delano and grew up in the family home at 8 East 69th Street in Manhattan. She married Jack Eastman, Director of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, from whom she was amicably divorced and who predeceased her. Her late brother, Frederick B. Adams, Jr., was the former Director of the Morgan Library and a consummate bibliophile. She is survived by her dear companion Mary (""Bunny"") Diehl, her nieces, Gillian Adams, Anne Adams Chambers, Judith Adams and Lauren Fortmiller, and, of course, her horse ""Walker"". Laura graduated from the Chapin School and Barnard College, and initially followed in her brother's footsteps becoming a knowledgeable and accomplished curator of private libraries and collections. She was a superb horsewoman specializing in showing fivegaited saddle horses, and was a supporter of many US Olympic Equestrian teams. While visiting her mother's cousins, Franklin and Eleanor, in the White House on December 7, 1941, she spent the afternoon teaching the President's dog, Fala, to roll over. She went on to raise and train dogs to assist deaf persons, helping to found the agency which coordinates such efforts, Assistance Dogs International. Her life-long devotion to the Metropolitan Opera led naturally to her involvement in the theater, and for many years she organized and directed the summer theater program at the Community House in Fire Island Pines, and was a supporter of the John Drew Playhouse in East Hampton. She took delight in telling how her friend Jerry Herman wrote ""Hello Dolly"" on the back deck of her bay cottage in the Pines, where she also served for many years on the board of FIPPOA. With her husband Jack and friend Henry Grady, she developed ""Sandy Ground"" in Jost Van Dyke, B.V.I., where she could pursue her interest in snorkeling. After surviving a serious encounter with cancer of the oropharynx, Laura dedicated herself as a patient-to-patient peer counselor for in-coming cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, volunteering as many as five or six days a week for nearly twenty years. On Sundays, she could be found ushering at St. James's Church, Manhattan, or in attendance at St. Luke's in East Hampton or St. Ann's in Bridgehampton. She attended the Institute of Theology at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, was a Governor of The Laymen's Club of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, and was the former librarian of The Church Club of New York. She was a supporter of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, founded by her granduncle, Henry Walters. Her greatest charitable effort was with St. John Eye Hospital in East Jerusalem, for which, under a commission from Queen Elizabeth II, she was made a Dame of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem last September at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Everyone who loved Laura is invited to a memorial service on October 20 at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, Madison Avenue at 71st Street. Instead of flowers, gifts in Laura's memory may be made to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center. A committal service at a date to be announced will follow at St. Luke's in East Hampton.

The RCHC, located on the Roseland Elementary School in the poorest part of town, is celebrating its 10th anniversary.

The RCHC has been recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as state and local government. The RCHC (and other school based health centers) also addresses the obstacles you described in todays column: 90 percent of the families are non- (or limited-) English speakers; many do not have cars; many parents can not get away from work easily.

Until we explore alternative means of financing these so called rights and cost-effective, alternative ways to deliver these services, the only way to contain their costs will be rationing. Those that will suffer will be the ones you (and most of us) want to help the most. The answer in health care, as in retirement and education, is not in socializing the costs.

According to Nielsen's estimates, CBS's math-loving criminal procedural ""Numbers"" was the night's most-watched program, with 11.23 million viewers. Earlier that night, Week 2 of ""Ghost Whisperer"" drew 10.7 million, which was down from its premiere, but outpaced what ""Joan of Arcadia"" delivered in the same time period in 2004. Sandwiched between ""Numbers"" and ""Ghost Whisperer,"" in the 9 p.m. hour, ""Threshold"" lagged behind its fellow CBS shows. It brought in an audience of 8.33 million, and beat two episodes of ABC's ""Hope & Faith"" in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic by only a tenth of a ratings point. NBC's two new Friday night shows, ""Three Wishes"" and ""Inconceivable,"" sank from their already low premiere numbers from the previous Friday, attracting 6.44 million and 4.64 million, respectively.

""Flightplan"" (Buena Vista), an airplane thriller starring Jodie Foster, left, took in $15 million in estimated ticket sales, bringing its cumulative gross to $46 million. The film received some vociferous criticism last week when three unions representing flight attendants called for its boycott because they believed their members were depicted as rude and unsympathetic. ""Serenity"" (Universal), opened at No. 2 with sales of $10.1 million, according to studio estimates. The film was directed by Joss Whedon, known for the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" television series. ""Corpse Bride"" (Warner Brothers), featuring the voices of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, dropped to No. 3 with $9.7 million in estimated receipts, bringing its cumulative sales to $32.9 million. The critically acclaimed ""History of Violence"" (New Line) expanded from 14 theaters to 1,340 and landed at No. 4 with $8.2 million. ""Into the Blue"" (Sony), a diving thriller starring Paul Walker and Jessica Alba, opened at No. 5 with $7 million.

Corzine, who is running for governor, a Superior Court judge ruled yesterday that several sealed ballots from a special nominating convention to fill a vacant State Senate seat should be counted. The ruling by Judge Peter E. Doyne came after a two-day trial and more than two weeks of legal wrangling in an intraparty dispute between Mr. Corzine and some of the state's top Democratic leaders. At issue was the candidacy of Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg to succeed State Senator Byron M. Baer, who, citing ill health, announced his resignation on Sept. 8. During a vote by Bergen County committee members on Sept. 15, Ms. Weinberg lost by a single vote to former Assemblyman Ken Zisa for the right to run for Mr. Baer's seat in a special election on Nov. 8. But seven ballots were not counted because of questions about the eligibility of the voters. Ms. Weinberg believes that the ballots may help her win the nomination. Judge Doyne decided yesterday that the sealed ballots were cast properly and that they should be counted at noon today. Lawyers for Mr. Zisa were expected to appeal.

Forbes Smiley III, below, returned to New Haven yesterday for a pretrial conference at New Haven Superior Court. His lawyer, Richard A. Reeve, told a reporter that neither he nor his client would have any statement. The conference, lasting less than 30 minutes, was continued till Nov. 15, Mr. Reeve said. The state has charged Mr. Smiley, a prominent map dealer who lives in the Chilmark section of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., with three counts of larceny stemming from a June 8 visit to the Beinecke. Surveillance cameras captured him removing a map from a Beinecke book, and a Yale detective found valuable maps that appear to be from Yale's collection in Mr. Smiley's briefcase and jacket, according to an incident report. In August, Mr. Smiley pleaded not guilty to the state charges. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the case amid signs that maps are missing at other libraries that Mr. Smiley has visited over the years.

She had become central to our lives, awakening us to wonders which by ourselves we would neither have envisioned nor sought. A graduate of Radcliffe College in the early sixties, her image was soon on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine. She became an Avedon model and appeared briefly in films, one of Woody Allen's with the Peters: Sellers and O'Toole: ""What's New Pussycat"". In her hilarious sketch of her own life up to that point: ""Made In Heaven"", Little Brown, '71, she described her emergence from New England schooling into the drift lanes of the young and bright from Paris to Marrakesh. Brilliant beyond her time, with her quick ironic wit and natural sense of style, she epitomized that era's exploding pace. She lived for many years in Cambridge, MA, wrote and taught English and charmed flocks of friends there and also in London, Prague, Madrid, and Rockland, ME. In her last year, beset with debilitating cancer, and without complaint, her magical friendships and vital pace unchanged, she exhibited extraordinary courage, leaving life without fear. We remain awed, and ever thankful for the life she chose to share with us.",2005-10-06T05:00:00+0000

But it's a different story for Mr. Bruckheimer's new productions: WB's ""Just Legal"" and NBC's ""E-Ring"" have not met their ratings expectations. On Tuesday, a third Bruckheimer series, CBS's ""Close to Home,"" made its debut and drew 10.38 million viewers in the 10 p.m. slot. That was on par with what ""Judging Amy"" delivered last year during that hour, and that show got the ax. Even so, CBS won in Nielsen's estimates in households and total viewers because the surging ""NCIS"" (16.34 million) bolstered its average. NBC was No.1 in the 18-to-49 demographic for the night, though, as both ""My Name Is Earl"" (12.94 million) and ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (15.74 million) won their slots in that category with considerable strength.

us,"Arts, Briefly; PBS Hires an Ombudsman","PBS announced yesterday that it had appointed Michael Getler, left, a veteran journalist at The Washington Post, to be its first ombudsman. The appointment follows criticism by television and radio executives of the decision by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting earlier this year to create its own office of ombudsman to monitor programs financed by the Public Broadcasting System. Members on the board of the corporation, which directs federal money for public television and radio, have complained that public television had a liberal bias and that some Middle East coverage of National Public Radio has been slanted against Israel. Broadcasting executives deny those charges, and critics of the board have said the effort at ensuring balance in programming is actually an attempt to make public broadcasting more conservative and friendlier to the Bush administration. But the concerns of the critics have not been fully realized. Since their appointment last April, the two new ombudsmen for the corporation -- Ken A. Bode and William Schulz -- have not been critical of a single radio or television program. National Public Radio also has an ombudsman. Mr. Getler, who was a foreign editor at The Washington Post and the executive editor of The International Herald Tribune, will step down as The Post's ombudsman at the end of this month.

President Olusegun Obasanjo called leaders of both forces to the capital, Abuja, to meet and work out their differences. Relations between the army and the police have long been tense. The army ruled Nigeria for decades and kept the police force poorly paid and unable to pose a threat to its dominance.

(The exhibition was organized by Sarah Greenough at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, where it appeared last spring.) Born in Budapest, Kertesz started making photographs as a teenager. He moved to Paris in 1925 and quickly achieved considerable success, but a 1936 move to New York City was followed by dashed hopes and years of obscurity. Then, in the 1960's, his career was resurrected by the photography curator John Szarkowski and a new generation of photographers who appreciated his snap-shot aesthetic, which had already influenced photographers from Henri Cartier-Bresson to Robert Frank. Kertesz had a chameleonlike ability to adapt photographically to different kinds of worldly realities. Compare, for example, two of his best-known works: the austerely formal picture of the door and vestibule of Piet Mondrian's studio and the zany ""Satiric Dancer,"" the dreamlike image of a hyperkinetic young woman in a little dress posed on an oval love seat. The secret of Kertesz's work is that it was driven as much by feeling as by visual experience. Made three years after his wife of 44 years had died, the sparkling picture of an empty wire chair and a laughing little girl taken at the Tuileries Garden in Paris in 1980 (see above) is an exquisitely touching image of grief and regeneration.

us,The Listings: Oct. 7 -- Oct. 13; ANTONY AND THE JOHNSONS,"There's a chilling line in Antony Hegarty's signature tune, ""Hope There's Someone,"" that sums up the appeal of this former downtown performance artist turned angelic crooner. Over raindrop piano clusters, he quaveringly confesses, ""Oh, I'm scared of the middle place/between light -- and nowhere."" With the imprecision of his vocal flutter underscoring that childlike sentiment, Mr. Hegarty clings to the word ""light,"" even as the notes tumble downward. With the light fading, the alternative notion of ""nowhere"" sounds vaguely promising. It's the limbo, the middle place, that inspires trepidation. Artistically, the androgynous Mr. Hegarty (at the piano, above) came of age in the late-80's, early-90's New York theater scene, a ""middle place"" of sorts, where money for the arts was scarce, and many of his mentors lost their struggle with AIDS. His songs carry some of that pain, as well as further his quest for beauty beyond the trappings of gender. Ethereal yet unsettling, his music has more spiritually in common with the glamorous sadness of the Warhol factory milieu -- the cover of his band's Mercury Prize-winning album ""I Am a Bird Now"" (Secretly Canadian) features a Peter Hujar photograph of the ill-fated transvestite Candy Darling -- than the esoteric antifolk of indie musicians to whom he's often compared. But hipster fans like Devendra Banhart and Rufus Wainwright lend their voices to ""Bird,"" as does Lou Reed and, perhaps Hegarty's biggest influence, Boy George. Joining Antony and the Johnsons onstage will be the gospel choir and brass band combo McCollough Sons of Thunder, as well as the 80-year-old jazz singer and kindred soul Jimmy Scott, whose gender-bending, anguished falsetto makes him another of Mr. Hegarty's forebears.

She became an Avedon model and appeared briefly in films, one of Woody Allen's with the Peters: Sellers and O'Toole: ""What's New Pussycat"". In her hilarious sketch of her own life up to that point: ""Made In Heaven"", Little Brown, '71, she described her emergence from New England schooling into the drift lanes of the young and bright from Paris to Marrakesh. Brilliant beyond her time, with her quick ironic wit and natural sense of style, she epitomized that era's exploding pace. She lived for many years in Cambridge, MA, wrote and taught English and charmed flocks of friends there and also in London, Prague, Madrid, and Rockland, ME. In her last year, beset with debilitating cancer, and without complaint, her magical friendships and vital pace unchanged, she exhibited extraordinary courage, leaving life without fear.

Would you believe Montclair, N.J.? Ever since Jed Wheeler took over as the executive director of the Office of Arts and Cultural programming at Montclair State University last year, he has generated buzz by scheduling artists like the Builders Association, Rinde Eckert and Robert LePage. But his most impressive coup may be luring perhaps the most famous living European theater director who has never played in New York, Romeo Castellucci. This Italian auteur, who also designs sets, costumes and lighting, takes his ""Tragedia Endogonidia,"" above, an investigation of tragedy that has already been performed in slightly different versions in 10 European cities, to the Montclair campus for three performances that end tomorrow. Mr. Castellucci's nightmarish shows, which can look like an avant-garde version of ""The Ring"" staged by Damien Hirst, have already become the stuff of legend. And his absence from the New York scene has been offered as evidence of a conservative theater culture. Those who have seen his hypnotic plays, which feature mostly wordless images in front of saturated colors and shrieking feedback, usually speak of his mysterious stagings as unforgettable, if also disturbing, events. Among his famous tableaus is one of a pale writer who cuts off his tongue with scissors and feeds it to a group of kittens, and the three cars that were dropped from the ceiling of a theater in Paris. When asked about his interest in tragedy, he said, through an interpreter: ""The tragic is everywhere, and contrary to what people think, it does not reflect the problem of death. It is the disappointment of birth and being born."" (Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, (973)655-5112; $35.)",2005-10-07T05:00:00+0000

(AIG) are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and longtime colleague, ""Jimmy"" Manton, one of AIG's founding fathers and a giant of the international insurance industry. A man of uncommon modesty, generosity and kindness, Sir Edwin was born and raised in England and always retained his British citizenship. He passed away in New York City on October 1st. Sir Edwin joined what was then the C.V. Starr insurance group in 1933, the predecessor of AIG, and remained with the organization throughout his career, rising to be a Director of AIG, Executive Vice President and finally, Senior Advisor. He built AIG's international propertycasualty insurance business over many decades into the leading such organization in the world today. His passion for the company he served never diminished and he continued to come into the office regularly until recent days. He was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 for ""charitable services to the Tate Gallery"" with the title of Knight Bachelor. British art and literature were a passion of Sir Edwin, and he was exceedingly generous to the Tate over the years. As a tribute to his adopted country, Sir Edwin created in 1987 The American Fund for the Tate Gallery. His charitable and philanthropic interests also included the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he served as Treasurer, Vestryman and Warden. Sir Edwin was married for 67 years to the former Florence V. Brewer who passed away in 2003. He is survived by his daughter Diana H. Morton of Wayland, MA; two granddaughters, Julia Grenville Morton Krapf and Toby Morton Niles; and five great-grandchildren.

A devoted husband, loving father, and doting grandfather, he is survived by his wife, Joy; his children, William Ruane, Elizabeth Ruane, Paige Ruane, and Thomas Ruane; his sister, Patricia Lowry; and four granddaughters, Julie, Lucy, Kelsey, and Sophie. Although he was better known as a highly successful money manager, his greatest accomplishments came in the last years of his life when he was able to devote himself full-time to his entrepreneurial philanthropic efforts, bringing the same unflagging optimism and analytical rigor to philanthropy that made him so successful as an investor. He was especially passionate, right up to the end, about the Accelerated Reader program, which helps children learn to read and cultivates a love for books. So far, the program has helped foster a love of reading in over 20,000 at-risk children in Washington Heights and Harlem in New York City;, the Monroe City School District of Louisiana; Denver, Colorado; and various rural schools in conjunction with Save the Children. His interest in the reading program sprang from his work on ""The Carmel Hill Project,"" a neighborhood restoration initiative that he founded in 1992. The project focused on 118th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. In addition to renovating buildings and bringing in community service programs, the project also provides scholarships for 90 children from the neighborhood to attend St. Paul's Catholic elementary school. Bill also founded TeenScreen, an organization that tests teenagers for symptoms of depression and other suicide risk factors. This program operates through 434 sites in 43 states and has tested nearly 100,000 teenagers since its inception. In addition, Bill gave generously to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Hospital, Save the Children, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NARSAD, and the New School. Virtually all of his contributions were anonymous. He always found it easy to help other people, the softest touch when the luck was hard. Born in Chicago in 1925 and raised in suburban Oak Park, Bill was selected for a U.S. Navy V-12 program while still in high school. The program was designed to provide college-trained officers for future invasion fleets. Bill studied electrical engineering and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1945. He was sent to Japan soon after graduation, but the war ended while his ship was en route. After his military service, he briefly worked for General Electric, where he realized he didn't want to be an engineer. He made his way to the Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1949. Bill became a disciple of Ben Graham, author of the landmark book on value investing, ""Security Analysis,"" after he took a class with Graham at Columbia University in 1950. Bill worked for nearly 20 years at Kidder Peabody before launching his own investment firm with former Kidder colleague Richard T. Cunniff in 1969. The partners raised $20 million from clients, but struggled in their early years. The firm's flagship, the Sequoia Fund, badly underperformed the market averages in its first four years. But over time, Sequoia compiled one of the best track records of any mutual fund in America. At the time of his death, Bill was co-manager of the Sequoia Fund and chairman of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb. Bill also served on the Boards of the Washington Post Company and the GEICO Corporation, Data Documents Inc. and Munsingwear. In addition he was on the boards of the New York Theatre Workshop, the YWCA of the City of New York, The Girls Club of New York, and the Business Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bill was a man always at ease in his own skin. As gracious, generous, cheerful, funny, and fun in private as he was in public, he would have been a hero to his valet if he had one. And he carried the holiday in his eye. We already miss that sparkle, his sunny disposition, his way of telling a funny story, and the magical way he had of making you feel better just by being in the same room with him. We loved him as we know he loved us. And no man was more loved and adored than he. ""Earth receive an honored guest./Bill Ruane is laid to rest."" A memorial service will be held some time in the future.

Though ""ER"" built tremendously from its sinking lead-in, ""The Apprentice"" (9.94 million), it is likely that it will continue its downward trend unless bolstered by a change in NBC's Thursday schedule. On CBS, ""Survivor"" (17.88 million), ""CSI"" (27.95 million) and ""Without a Trace"" (21.54 million) won every half-hour in the night's ratings competition in total viewers and among adults 18 to 49. WB's ""Smallville"" continued to do well in its second week in its new time slot, with 5.72 million viewers and a third-place finish for the hour among 18- to 49-year-olds.

""For a first, stupid moment of confusion I thought I was seeing a feature story: an innocuous piece announcing a book I had been describing to friends and family from the moment I began reading it in bound galleys. Then I realized I was reading a news story, about a new death. The death itself struck me in something like a personal way. In a moment of my own magical thinking I thought it wasn't possible -- I had read the book and this young woman survives. If I experienced a vicarious, removed form of grief, that is a tribute to Didion's skill in telling her story. Within an hour or two the Book Review asked me to add some paragraphs, to acknowledge what had happened. By then, I could read the news story more alertly, and could admire Didion's characteristic, terse response to the idea that she might make last-minute changes to the book. Her two words were the basis of my new closing sentences.""

""The administrators want community,"" explained William Rawn, whose firm just finished the airy Alice Paul Hall at Swarthmore. ""And the students want privacy.""

The idea is to lure students out from behind their closed doors, where they're ever busier with their gadgets and the Internet. Who knows whether they're Halo-ing, I.M.-ing, preprofessionally networking or studying, but it's easy to fear the worst, and foresee lives of frittering and constant distraction. The new schemes for conviviality -- wide corridors, gathering areas and loftlike rooms, to say nothing of fitness centers -- promise the social comfort that research says helps students stay focused and finish college in four years.

Not only is Victorian an excellent mixer, it's also a willing candidate for extreme makeovers, as exemplified by this chair that Diamond and his partner, Anthony Baratta, recreated.

Born June 5, 1943, Hugh grew up on the Upper West Side and as a child appeared in the television shows ""I Remember Mama"" and ""Watch Mr. Wizard"" among others. Hugh loved the city and was particularly passionate about the New York Subway system. He was hired as a consultant for the Subway's 1979 Diamond Jubilee and went on to become Special Assistant for TA Operations under John Simpson. He personally walked more than half of the system's six hundred miles of track, and his encyclopedic knowledge of the subway along with his presence at virtually every subway crisis earned him the nickname of ""Mr. Subways"" from the Daily News in 1983. After leaving the TA in 1984, Hugh joined New York biotech company ImClone Systems as Director of Security, a position he held until his death. Hugh is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, Charles and Judy Dunne of New York City; his daughter and son-in-law, Susanna and Jeffrey Berg of New Milford, CT; his three grandchildren, Sarah, Alexander and Benjamin Berg and his dear former wife, Annamarie M. Dunne. A Funeral Mass will be held at The Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel on Monday, October 10 at 5:00 PM. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations to be made to the Hugh A.

""Safe: Design Takes On Risk,"" a meditation on contemporary design's response to a dangerous world, opens at the Museum of Modern Art on Oct. 16. It features more than 300 products and prototypes that address ""everything from fear of a paper cut to fear of genocide,"" says the curator Paola Antonelli. In addition to obvious items like land-mine-removal equipment, there are also more disquieting objects. For example, oak ""hideaway furniture"" blends into a room's dcor and can conceal its owner inside. The Shmartaf Toddlers Protection System is an air-filtration hood to be used in case of chemical and biological attack. The show highlights the conflict between innovation and comfort.

She was in Chris Terrio's little ensemble drama, ""Heights,"" this summer as a major actress in the midst of a marital crisis. She is the barely-keeping-it-together mother of a teenager who committed suicide in Ari Posin's satire, ""Chumscrubber,"" which is playing around the country but has yet to open in New York. And on Friday she'll be seen in Rodrigo Garca's ""Nine Lives,"" a series of vignettes that examine defining moments for each of nine women in real time -- no cuts. Ms. Close's character, Maggie, is visiting a cemetery with her young daughter, played by Dakota Fanning; in other scenes, a woman runs into an old love (Robin Wright Penn), arranges a tryst (Sissy Spacek), confronts her stepfather (Lisa Gay Hamilton). Mr. Garca, who in 2000 directed Ms. Close in ""Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her,"" said he wrote ""Nine Lives"" to explore ""the joined-at-the-hip quality"" of certain relationships. Ms. Close, 58, knows something about that. In recent years, she has tailored her career to fit the needs of her daughter, Annie, 17. ""Kids want you there,"" she says. ""There"" for the two of them is either an apartment in New York or a place in the country. Late last month, wearing low-slung jeans, a black blazer and a white top that allowed an occasional flash of skin, Ms. Close met with Sylviane Gold to discuss life in the indies.",2005-10-09T05:00:00+0000

us,Fiction Chronicle,"A WEDDING IN DECEMBER. By Anita Shreve. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) You might think that a clique of privileged, navel-gazing 40-somethings who reunite for a wedding and spend the weekend at an inn drinking cabernet sauvignon and rehashing prep school days would come off as a tad self-involved. And hey, you'd be right. Happily, Shreve's knack for engrossing storytelling mostly makes up for the bourgeois malaise. This post-9/11 novel (the characters think and talk repeatedly about the World Trade Center) explores missed opportunities and second chances. Six of the seven main characters are in, or have been in, relationships that range from deeply dysfunctional to just plain depressing; the only character who seems at all happy is gay. Prep school will traumatize anybody, but this group was especially scarred by the death of a golden-boy classmate just before graduation. The incident is referred to obliquely -- ""the scene at the cottage,"" ""that night,"" ""the night of the party"" -- and Shreve wrings a pleasurable amount of suspense from the setup before the inevitable reveal. There's also a story within the story, a risky narrative maneuver, right up there with the long expository letter (Shreve includes a couple of those too, the daredevil), but she pulls it off, and the tale of historical disaster one of her characters is writing is a page turner. Regrettably, back at the inn, it's only when the characters stop thinking and start interacting that the main narrative finds a similar urgency.",2005-10-09T05:00:00+0000

One of his first projects was the construction, with several other up-and-coming architects, of 22 model homes on Napraforg Utca (Sunflower Street), a utopian vision of how lower-middle-class Hungarian families might one day live. Completed in 1931, the neighborhood, with its quiet park, futuristic street lamps and cantilevered balconies, wasn't a success at first. The houses were actually far beyond the means of an average family and remained difficult to sell for decades. Today, however, the buildings -- a mix of functionalist white cubes and nouveau-peasant villas -- are getting the tenants and the attention they deserve. ""I visited this street very often, even as a child,"" says Ilona Rv, author of the forthcoming ""From the Bauhaus to the Glass Pyramid."" ""There were no trees there yet, just saplings, and most of the houses were empty. Nowadays, the street is full of majestic trees and foliage, and the homes are also full of families.""

(AIG) are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and longtime colleague, ""Jimmy"" Manton, one of AIG's founding fathers and a giant of the international insurance industry. A man of uncommon modesty, generosity and kindness, Sir Edwin was born and raised in England and always retained his British citizenship. He passed away in New York City on October 1st. Sir Edwin joined what was then the C.V. Starr insurance group in 1933, the predecessor of AIG, and remained with the organization throughout his career, rising to be a Director of AIG, Executive Vice President and finally, Senior Advisor. He built AIG's international propertycasualty insurance business over many decades into the leading such organization in the world today. His passion for the company he served never diminished and he continued to come into the office regularly until recent days. He was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 for ""charitable services to the Tate Gallery"" with the title of Knight Bachelor. British art and literature were a passion of Sir Edwin, and he was exceedingly generous to the Tate over the years. As a tribute to his adopted country, Sir Edwin created in 1987 The American Fund for the Tate Gallery. His charitable and philanthropic interests also included the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he served as Treasurer, Vestryman and Warden. Sir Edwin was married for 67 years to the former Florence V. Brewer who passed away in 2003. He is survived by his daughter Diana H.

A devoted husband, loving father, and doting grandfather, he is survived by his wife, Joy; his children, William Ruane, Elizabeth Ruane, Paige Ruane, and Thomas Ruane; his sister, Patricia Lowry; and four granddaughters, Julie, Lucy, Kelsey, and Sophie. Although he was better known as a highly successful money manager, his greatest accomplishments came in the last years of his life when he was able to devote himself full-time to his entrepreneurial philanthropic efforts, bringing the same unflagging optimism and analytical rigor to philanthropy that made him so successful as an investor. He was especially passionate, right up to the end, about the Accelerated Reader program, which helps children learn to read and cultivates a love for books. So far, the program has helped foster a love of reading in over 20,000 at-risk children in Washington Heights and Harlem in New York City;, the Monroe City School District of Louisiana; Denver, Colorado; and various rural schools in conjunction with Save the Children. His interest in the reading program sprang from his work on ""The Carmel Hill Project,"" a neighborhood restoration initiative that he founded in 1992. The project focused on 118th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. In addition to renovating buildings and bringing in community service programs, the project also provides scholarships for 90 children from the neighborhood to attend St. Paul's Catholic elementary school. Bill also founded TeenScreen, an organization that tests teenagers for symptoms of depression and other suicide risk factors. This program operates through 434 sites in 43 states and has tested nearly 100,000 teenagers since its inception. In addition, Bill gave generously to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Hospital, Save the Children, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NARSAD, and the New School. Virtually all of his contributions were anonymous. He always found it easy to help other people, the softest touch when the luck was hard. Born in Chicago in 1925 and raised in suburban Oak Park, Bill was selected for a U.S. Navy V-12 program while still in high school. The program was designed to provide college-trained officers for future invasion fleets. Bill studied electrical engineering and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1945. He was sent to Japan soon after graduation, but the war ended while his ship was en route. After his military service, he briefly worked for General Electric, where he realized he didn't want to be an engineer. He made his way to the Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1949. Bill became a disciple of Ben Graham, author of the landmark book on value investing, ""Security Analysis,"" after he took a class with Graham at Columbia University in 1950. Bill worked for nearly 20 years at Kidder Peabody before launching his own investment firm with former Kidder colleague Richard T. Cunniff in 1969. The partners raised $20 million from clients, but struggled in their early years. The firm's flagship, the Sequoia Fund, badly underperformed the market averages in its first four years. But over time, Sequoia compiled one of the best track records of any mutual fund in America. At the time of his death, Bill was co-manager of the Sequoia Fund and chairman of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb. Bill also served on the Boards of the Washington Post Company and the GEICO Corporation, Data Documents Inc. and Munsingwear. In addition he was on the boards of the New York Theatre Workshop, the YWCA of the City of New York, The Girls Club of New York, and the Business Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bill was a man always at ease in his own skin. As gracious, generous, cheerful, funny, and fun in private as he was in public, he would have been a hero to his valet if he had one. And he carried the holiday in his eye. We already miss that sparkle, his sunny disposition, his way of telling a funny story, and the magical way he had of making you feel better just by being in the same room with him. We loved him as we know he loved us. And no man was more loved and adored than he. ""Earth receive an honored guest./Bill Ruane is laid to rest."" A memorial service will be held some time in the future. Contributions in Bill Ruane's memory may be made to: St. Paul's School, 114 E. 118th St., NY, NY 10035 (212-534-0619) or TeenScreen, 1775 Broadway, Suite 715, NY, NY 10019 (646-328-4415).",2005-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Even when they contain majestic spaces, such buildings are primarily objects, describable as sculpture. The Tokyo firm Sanaa, which is run by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, aspires to a greater purity. The best way to capture the essence of a Sanaa project is to convey its floor plan.

It's striking enough that a woman would appear so boldly in such a poster in a city where women still do not appear in public without a burka -- more striking still that she was wrapped in a shawl made from the green, black and red of the Afghan flag. These colorful, patriotic images of Siddiqi also loomed over the streets of Jalalabad itself, offering a lush kind of hope for its residents. But Jalalabad is still a place dominated by Pashtunwali, the customary law that regulates life throughout the Pashtun belt (the eastern and southern half of Afghanistan). The Pashtun code is based on the values of honor, sanctuary, solidarity, shame and revenge, and it treats women as property. In such a place, how much difference can a few female politicians really make? Many Afghans question all the fuss over elections, and the $150 million expense, when, after three and a half years of American and international efforts, they still have few roads, unclean water and crumbling schools.

Oddly enough, it doesn't even feature in the dealer Julien Levy's own memoirs, except for a note, without further explanation, that it happened. Levy was, so to speak, the American point man for Surrealism in New York. He didn't depend on sales for a living; he had an inheritance -- a small one -- from his mother. He put on the city's first Surrealist show in 1932. Various artists and writers in the Surrealist group had fled to New York from the Nazis, but only one dealer was regularly giving gallery space to Surrealist art, and that was Levy, who represented neo-Romantics like Eugene Berman as well as tougher and more radical artists like Salvador Dali and Max Ernst. Thirty-two artists -- the number was no accident: there are 16 pieces to a side on a chessboard -- had been corralled to exchange takes on one of the world's oldest and most durable games.The opening featured a game organized by Marcel Duchamp, in which an acknowledged master, George Koltanowski, played blindfolded against seven artists concurrently, beating all of them except the visionary architect Frederick Kiesler, who fought the maestro to a draw.",2005-10-09T05:00:00+0000

Yesterday after trying to salvage some clothing from our ruined house, we returned to the empty daycare center where were staying, took startlingly invigorating cold showers (because the building currently has no hot water), and drove to Uptown New Orleans for a dinner party that began at five oclock. Thanks to its oppressive heat so much of the year, the city has always taken advantage of the cooler hours after dark for its social life; in fact, its a very late-night town. But the 8:00 p.m. curfew, strictly enforced by police and soldiers armed with automatic weapons, demanded that we eat dinner by daylight. Happily, our hosts informed us after we had arrived, they had just heard an announcement that the curfew had been postponed until midnight for the weekend and beyond, so we all relaxed for a leisurely evening together.The drive over to their house had alternated familiar scenes we remembered from before the storm with nearly incomprehensible visions of devastation and transformation. Across from Notre Dame Seminary on Carrollton Avenue, for example, an entire block of stately homes had gone up in flames; a few steel staircases and charred brick chimneys rose out of what had become simply a field of ashes. Then, at the entrance to the street where we were to have dinner, an Israeli security team in black flak vests with Uzis slung over their shoulders, politely asked us for our identification; one of the young men told us how much he had fallen in love with New Orleans, then lifted the barricade and waved us on.",2005-10-09T12:09:58+0000

He helped draft the shipping laws of several foreign countries, and received an honorary knighthood from the Republic of Liberia for his contributions to world shipping and African economic development.

Mr. Ohrstrom was born on June 9, 1927 in Bronxville, NY, the second of three children of George L. Ohrstrom, Sr. and Emma Riggs Ohrstrom. He grew up in Greenwich, CT. Mr. Ohrstrom was graduated from St. Paul's School, in New Hampshire, in 1945 and from Princeton University in 1950, following two years in the Marine Corps. In the early 1950s he worked at the State Department and in the intelligence services. He began his business career with Lehman Brothers in 1955. He joined G. L. Ohrstrom & Co. in 1960 and became the firm's lifelong Chairman in 1966. The company, founded by his father, is one of the original private equity firms which started and grew three New York Stock Exchange companies, Dover Corporation, Carlisle Companies and Roper Industries. Ohrstrom was an active sportsman. He rowed bow on the Princeton crew which finished third in the 1948 Olympic Trials. In 1949 Mr. Ohrstrom organized a team from the Princeton Cottage Club to compete in the Grand Challenge Cup at the Royal Henley Regatta in England. He was a trustee of the Princeton University Rowing Association. An avid fox hunter, he was a president of the Orange County Hunt and founder of the Bath County Hounds. As a breeder and owner of thoroughbred and steeplechase horses, Mr. Ohrstrom raced multiple stakes winners in the United States and Europe, including France's champion 3 Year Old Filly, Comtesse De Loir, and Grade 1 Stakes winner Mossflower. He had a particular passion for Timber Racing and bred and raced Appolinax among many notable winners. A highly respected philanthropist and conservationist, Mr. Ohrstrom was president of The Ohrstrom Foundation, Inc., which was established by his father in 1955, and the founder of the George L. Ohrstrom, Jr. Foundation. He led the effort for the construction of a library at St. Paul's School, in Concord, New Hampshire, which was dedicated in his honor in 1991. As a founding benefactor of the Piedmont Environmental Council, he was an early supporter of the use of conservation easements to preserve open space. In his later years, his passion was the National Sporting Library, the country's only scholarly repository dedicated exclusively to equine and field sports. As Chairman, Ohrstrom provided the leadership and vision for its growth from a bookshelf into the premier institution it is today. He is survived by his fifth wife, Jacqueline, his sister Magalen O. Bryant, his four surviving children, George F. Ohrstrom, Clarke Ohrstrom, Winifred O. Nichols, Wright R. S. Ohrstrom and five grandchildren. His previous marriages ended in divorce. He was preceded in death by his eldest son, Peter F. S. Ohrstrom. He will be buried at a private funeral service at Silver Tip Ranch in Montana. A memorial service is planned for October 21, at 11 am, at The Grace Episcopal Church in The Plains, Virginia. Contributions in Mr. Ohrstrom's memory can be made to The National Sporting Library, in Middleburg, Virginia or to the Piedmont Environmental Council in Warrenton, Virginia.",2005-10-10T05:00:00+0000

A devoted husband, loving father, and doting grandfather, he is survived by his wife, Joy; his children, William Ruane, Elizabeth Ruane, Paige Ruane, and Thomas Ruane; his sister, Patricia Lowry; and four granddaughters, Julie, Lucy, Kelsey, and Sophie. Although he was better known as a highly successful money manager, his greatest accomplishments came in the last years of his life when he was able to devote himself full-time to his entrepreneurial philanthropic efforts, bringing the same unflagging optimism and analytical rigor to philanthropy that made him so successful as an investor. He was especially passionate, right up to the end, about the Accelerated Reader program, which helps children learn to read and cultivates a love for books. So far, the program has helped foster a love of reading in over 20,000 at-risk children in Washington Heights and Harlem in New York City;, the Monroe City School District of Louisiana; Denver, Colorado; and various rural schools in conjunction with Save the Children. His interest in the reading program sprang from his work on ""The Carmel Hill Project,"" a neighborhood restoration initiative that he founded in 1992. The project focused on 118th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. In addition to renovating buildings and bringing in community service programs, the project also provides scholarships for 90 children from the neighborhood to attend St. Paul's Catholic elementary school. Bill also founded TeenScreen, an organization that tests teenagers for symptoms of depression and other suicide risk factors. This program operates through 434 sites in 43 states and has tested nearly 100,000 teenagers since its inception. In addition, Bill gave generously to Memorial Sloan - Kettering Hospital, Save the Children, Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NARSAD, and the New School. Virtually all of his contributions were anonymous. He always found it easy to help other people, the softest touch when the luck was hard. Born in Chicago in 1925 and raised in suburban Oak Park, Bill was selected for a U.S. Navy V-12 program while still in high school. The program was designed to provide college-trained officers for future invasion fleets. Bill studied electrical engineering and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1945. He was sent to Japan soon after graduation, but the war ended while his ship was en route. After his military service, he briefly worked for General Electric, where he realized he didn't want to be an engineer. He made his way to the Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1949. Bill became a disciple of Ben Graham, author of the landmark book on value investing, ""Security Analysis,"" after he took a class with Graham at Columbia University in 1950. Bill worked for nearly 20 years at Kidder Peabody before launching his own investment firm with former Kidder colleague Richard T. Cunniff in 1969. The partners raised $20 million from clients, but struggled in their early years. The firm's flagship, the Sequoia Fund, badly underperformed the market averages in its first four years. But over time, Sequoia compiled one of the best track records of any mutual fund in America. At the time of his death, Bill was co-manager of the Sequoia Fund and chairman of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb. Bill also served on the Boards of the Washington Post Company and the GEICO Corporation, Data Documents Inc. and Munsingwear. In addition he was on the boards of the New York Theatre Workshop, the YWCA of the City of New York, The Girls Club of New York, and the Business Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bill was a man always at ease in his own skin. As gracious, generous, cheerful, funny, and fun in private as he was in public, he would have been a hero to his valet if he had one. And he carried the holiday in his eye. We already miss that sparkle, his sunny disposition, his way of telling a funny story, and the magical way he had of making you feel better just by being in the same room with him. We loved him as we know he loved us. And no man was more loved and adored than he. ""Earth receive an honored guest./Bill Ruane is laid to rest."" A memorial service will be held some time in the future. Contributions in Bill Ruane's memory may be made to: St. Paul's School, 114 E. 118th St., NY, NY 10035 (212-534-0619) or TeenScreen, 1775 Broadway, Suite 715, NY, NY 10019 (646-328-4415).",2005-10-10T05:00:00+0000

(AIG) are deeply saddened by the death of our friend and longtime colleague, ""Jimmy"" Manton, one of AIG's founding fathers and a giant of the international insurance industry. A man of uncommon modesty, generosity and kindness, Sir Edwin was born and raised in England and always retained his British citizenship. He passed away in New York City on October 1st. Sir Edwin joined what was then the C.V. Starr insurance group in 1933, the predecessor of AIG, and remained with the organization throughout his career, rising to be a Director of AIG, Executive Vice President and finally, Senior Advisor. He built AIG's international propertycasualty insurance business over many decades into the leading such organization in the world today. His passion for the company he served never diminished and he continued to come into the office regularly until recent days. He was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 for ""charitable services to the Tate Gallery"" with the title of Knight Bachelor. British art and literature were a passion of Sir Edwin, and he was exceedingly generous to the Tate over the years. As a tribute to his adopted country, Sir Edwin created in 1987 The American Fund for the Tate Gallery. His charitable and philanthropic interests also included the New YorkPresbyterian Hospital and the Church of the Ascension in New York City, where he served as Treasurer, Vestryman and Warden. Sir Edwin was married for 67 years to the former Florence V. Brewer who passed away in 2003. He is survived by his daughter Diana H. Morton of Wayland, MA; two granddaughters, Julia Grenville Morton Krapf and Toby Morton Niles; and five great-grandchildren.

The partners, associates and staff of Hill, Betts & Nash LLP mourn with great sadness the passing on October 5, 2005, in Maine, of our esteemed retired partner and extend condolences to his wife, Eleanor, and daughters, Anita and Elaine, and their families. Associated with our firm as partner, counsel, and advisor for more than 50 years, John specialized in corporate, ship finance and international law, mentoring generations of lawyers in these fields. He maintained homes in Manhattan; Peconic, NY; and Friendship, ME. A graduate of Georgetown and Harvard Law School (Class of 1940), he led a most adventurous life in his youth. Scion of a prominent family in Democratic politics and government, and at the New York Stock Exchange, John sailed as a merchant mariner on US passenger ships during his college summers; toured the Franco/German border by motorcycle on the eve of World War II, vexing the German army; and then served four years as an officer in the US Navy, engaged in antisubmarine warfare and escort duties. He commanded a corvette in the Atlantic and Caribbean. John was an expert in US, Liberian, Marshall Islands and Panamanian corporate and shipping law, and handled the sales, purchasing and financing of thousands of ships and hundreds of aircraft during his career. A speaker at various legal and finance conferences in the US and abroad, he and his wife were world travelers. He acted as a US correspondent and advisor for many of the leading foreign law firms and banks; and edited various maritime publications. He helped draft the shipping laws of several foreign countries, and received an honorary knighthood from the Republic of Liberia for his contributions to world shipping and African economic development.

The new donation, as well as other pledges and maturing investments, should bring the institute's endowment to more than $16 million by 2010, said a company spokesman, Robert Daniels. The money will allow the institute to expand its program, which twice yearly allows four choreographers to work with City Ballet dancers or School of American Ballet seniors. A new fellowship program will provide grants of as much as $15,000 to ballet companies in the United States and abroad that are interested in creating the same opportunities. ""This should be seen as an encouragement for other organizations to do what we are doing, to do it in their own environment and under their own auspices,"" said Peter Martins, the director of the New York City Ballet, who conceived of the institute.

us,"Paid Notice: Deaths   ROGERS, JOHN STRATFORD","ROGERS -- John Stratford. Chairman and CEO of World City America Inc., and World City Foundation, died on Friday, October 7, at New York Presbyterian Hospital, of complications related to multiple myeloma. Mr. Rogers attended Trinity School in New York (class of '52), and received his Bachelor of Arts from Yale University ('55) and his LLB from New York University Law School ('59). He was a Reporter for the N.Y. Journal of Commerce while attending law school. He joined the firm of Burlingham Underwood and Lord in 1959 where he became a senior partner, practicing admiralty and international law. Mr. Rogers opened branch offices (the first Western law firm) in Saudi Arabia; also in Kuwait and Egypt. He formed the American-Saudi Business Roundtable in the 70's to promote U.S.-Saudi business partnerships. In 1990, Mr. Rogers launched the Build America initiative to seize for the American economy a share of the booming foreign-flag cruise ship industry. The prototype ship, America World City, will be the world's largest passenger ship, accommodating 6,200 guests. Mr. Rogers is survived by three sons, John S. Rogers, Jr., Roland K. Rogers, and Andrew Lewis Rogers; a brother, Dr. Hartley Rogers; a sister, Joanna Macy; and three grandchildren. A Memorial Service will be held on Thursday, October 13, 2005, in the Chapel of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church at 1:00 P.M. In lieu of flowers, contributions in John Rogers' memory may be made to: the International Myeloma Foundation, 12650 Riverside Drive, Suite 206, North Hollywood, CA. 91607-3421; www.myeloma.org. $(6$)ROGERS--John Stratford. World City America Inc. celebrates the life and work of its Chairman and Chief Executive, John S. Rogers. A visionary, an optimist, a highly intelligent and methodical man, he undertook, starting in 1989, to develop an American-flag cruise ship industry. His vision was an American-built and U.S-flag operated fleet of next - generation cruise ships -- city - ships -- which would seize for the American economy a share of the booming foreign-dominated cruise ship industry. The prototype city-ship, to be named America World City--The Westin Flagship, will accommodate 6,200 guests and will be the world's largest passenger ship by a significant margin. The construction of the city-ship will be a major stimulus for the rebuilding of the hurricane - devastated southern tier of the country, creating thousands of jobs and benefiting local economies through community participation programs. For over sixteen years, and with an investment of over $50million, World City America Inc., under Mr. Rogers' leadership, and with the support of hundreds of American corporations who stand to benefit from an American-flag presence in this $16-billion-ayear, foreign-dominated industry, has positioned the United States to enter the market with a superior product, capable of being built in the U.S. at an internationally competitive price, creating thousands of long-term selfsupporting jobs on the ship and ashore, and promising renewed economic prosperity for the coastal communities across the southern tier. For those of us who have worked side-by-side with this wonderful man for so many years, our loss is indescribable; but our purpose is noble and it will be all the more rewarding to accomplish it in his honor. $(6$)ROGERS -- John Stratford. World City Foundation mourns the loss of its beloved Chairman and Chief Executive. Mr. Rogers' concept, to harness a major capital asset (world's largest passenger ship) as a source of perpetual funding for the attainment of the Foundation's goals, reflects a growing trend among world business organizations toward assuming a more active role in creating a healthier society and a more habitable planet. World City Foundation will carry out its educational, cultural, recreational and public policy programs and activities on board the 255,000-ton vessel, America World City-The Westin Flagship, and the profits of the ship's operations will be channeled into worthwhile programs and activities throughout the country and the world, including education, environmental protection, sustainable development, corporate responsibility, international understanding, and medical research.

Remedial math and writing courses are to be found on virtually all college campuses, but by age 19 or 20, it is usually too late for the young people to really catch up. The drop out rate in higher education is on the order of 50 percent as result. In addition, many of those who do actually receive diplomas are so poorly educated that they end up waiting tables or spending several years in corporate training programs so that they can become productive employees.

For the third week in a row, CBS was No. 1 among total viewers and ABC won the 18-to-49 demographic because of the appeal of ""Monday Night Football."" But despite CBS's victory, its ratings foretold trouble for Mondays yet to come. At 8:30 p.m., ""How I Met Your Mother,"" a new comedy, drew 9.7 million viewers, its lowest total to date. And from 9 to 11 p.m., every half-hour was down in double-digit percentages compared with last year, when the now retired ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" was in the mix. For the night, Fox was a solid third place among both total viewers and adults 18 to 49: it broadcast the New York Yankees' ouster from the playoffs at the hands of the Los Angeles Angels. Fox's average viewership for the baseball postseason has increased compared with last year's division series games, but with the collapse of both the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox that number may deflate.

According to Bookscan, which tracks sales at outlets that usually account for about 70 percent of a book's sales, ""The City of Falling Angels"" sold 35,000 copies in its first week. The book is the first No. 1 best-seller from the Penguin Press, the imprint started by Ann Godoff in 2004, a year after she was forced out as the top editor at Random House. Also flying off the shelves is Joan Didion's new memoir, ""The Year of Magical Thinking,"" which went on sale on Oct. 4. Alfred A. Knopf, the publisher, initially shipped about 50,000 copies, said Paul Bogaards, executive director of publicity for Knopf.

A study to be released today by the Los Angeles-based labor union shows that members of minorities currently make up less than 10 percent of employed writers in the movie and television industry, even though nonwhites constitute more than 30 percent of the American population. A 3 percent rise in the number of minority writers employed from 1998 to 2004 is mainly due to the success of African-American themed television shows on networks like Viacom's UPN, the study shows. In the film industry, the number of minority screenwriters has been stuck at about 6 percent since 1999. Women have made slight advances in their share of writing jobs, increasing from 23 percent in 1998 to 25 percent in 2004, mostly in television. Both women and members of minorities continue to earn less than their white, male counterparts for similar work, the study says, and the gap has grown in recent years, from an average of $8,500 in 1998 to $18,000 in 2004 in median income.

The Department of Psychiatry of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and the staff of the New York State Psychiatric Institute are profoundly saddened by the passing of the long-time Director of our Depression Evaluation Service. We lost a unique friend and colleague of complete integrity and enormous energy, dedicated to the development of scientific treatment for those suffering from psychiatric disorders. After graduating from Princeton University and the State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn, better known as Downstate Medical Center, Fred Quitkin began his career in psychiatric research at Hillside Hospital. Mentored in psychiatric research by Donald F. Klein MD, with whom he formed a life long collaboration, he focused on discovering and evaluating rational treatments for depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and schizophrenia. This partnership produced the innovative text, Diagnosis and Drug Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders, with Rachel Klein PhD and Arthur Rifkin MD. After receiving his Doctor of Medical Science Degree at Downstate, he continued pioneering work in psychopharmacology by describing the social and cognitive deficits of patients with schizophrenia. Dr. Quitkin's pioneering report of subtle neurologic impairments in people with schizophrenia was dramatically ahead of its time, showing that what was then thought to be a disorder psychologically induced by defective parenting, was actually the result of disordered structure and function in the central nervous system. He documented the destructive effects of long-term hospitalization for non-psychotic psychiatric disorders and the often dramatic therapeutic benefits of the revolutionary new medications for psychiatric illness. Moving to the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University in 1977, he continued his dynamic research efforts by forming the Depression Evaluation Service, dedicated to research in depressive disorders. In collaboration with colleagues, his clinical research delineated the specific syndrome of atypical depression, now accepted by the official diagnostic nomenclature. These studies showed for the first time that rational selection of an antidepressant medication was possible based on clinical features. Further work showed the effects of antidepressant treatment on depressive disorders seen in the course of alcohol and drug dependence, the characteristics of placebo and the specific true pharmacologic responses to medication (a technical tour de force), and innovative studies combining antidepressants to more rapidly relieve suffering from these devastating disorders. Dr. Quitkin mentored many psychiatric researchers who pursued and extended his pioneering, imaginative ideas. He was a tireless clinical psychopharmacologist, never daunted by the most complex and difficult psychiatric disorders, and always freely available to his many grateful patients for psychologic support and vigorous pharmacologic treatment. Recovery of full emotional health for his patients was ever his goal. His dedication and perseverance set an inspiring example for the pursuit of excellence in clinical research and therapeutic care. We extend our heartfelt condolencesto Dr. Quitkin's family and grieve with them for loss of this remarkable man.",2005-10-12T05:00:00+0000

At a news conference, he outlined a smaller proposal that includes one hotel with golf course instead of two, fewer housing units, and biking trails to replace other proposed buildings. Mr. Hinchey also called for the developer, Dean Gitter, to sell 1,240 acres of his land on the east side of Belleayre Mountain Ski Center to the state for use as a forest preserve. Such changes would lead environmentalists to end their opposition and make it more likely that the state would issue construction permits, Mr. Hinchey said. Mr. Gitter, a local businessman, said that he was willing to consider alternatives, but that he did not think Mr. Hinchey's plan was economically feasible.

The tireless Young Soon Kim, artistic director of the White Wave arts center in Brooklyn, is doubling the festival pleasure this year. Starting this evening with the fifth annual Dumbo Dance Festival and continuing through Oct. 23 at the first International Dumbo Dance Festival, Ms. Kim is overseeing dozens of performances, including one by her own White Wave Young Soon Kim Dance Company. Dumbo is an acronym for the torturously named neighborhood Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. The first event is a smorgasbord of dance, and it's all free. Situated within the multidisciplinary Dumbo Art Under the Bridge Festival, it features indoor and outdoor showings of more than 90 choreographers and companies and over 350 performers. (Lisa K. Lock, above, will perform as part of a program tomorrow.) The second festival goes for the other extreme, showcasing the work of emerging contemporary choreographers of a single ethnic or cultural heritage. Ms. Kim, working with the Korea Society, has chosen seven Korean choreographers for the inaugural event. A $25 ticket gets you admission to one of two programs. ( The Dumbo Dance Festival runs through Sunday in the John Ryan Theater at White Wave, 25 Jay Street, along with outdoor performances at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park on the waterfront between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. The International Dumbo Dance Festival runs from Wednesday to Oct. 23 at the John Ryan Theater. More information is at www.whitewavedance.com.)

us,'IF YOU SEE SOMETHING ',"This video installation, above, the main event in Krzysztof Wodiczko's exhibition at Galerie Lelong, uses a stunning bit of trompe l'oeil to administer a grim dose of reality concerning the erosion of civil liberties in post-9/11 America. The artist's first indoor video projection, the piece seamlessly creates the illusion that you are in an office-building lobby, albeit a very dark one, watching the blurry forms of people just outside its big frosted-glass windows. (It doesn't hurt that the windows are replicas of the ones on the front of the gallery.) The people seem to be mostly smokers on breaks, and you can overhear their conversations, each of which centers on a workaday abuse of power and loss of freedom involving someone of Middle Eastern descent. One woman tells another that her Arab husband is going to leave the country because of continual harassment. A man on a cellphone defends his son's behavior to a school official. Another man unrolls his prayer rug, removes his shoes and prays before climbing a ladder to wash the window, at which point a co-worker appears and starts asking insensitive questions. Listening in from this fly-on-the-wall vantage point, you may realize that you are, indeed, seeing something -- specific losses of individual liberty that have become ordinary and pervasive -- and should say something. Paradoxically, the illusion of unfiltered reality, of life unfolding before your eyes, makes the individuals' predicaments more immediate and heart-rending than they often are using less dazzling, more conventional means, including documentary film, theater or newspaper articles. These are workers in the city just like ourselves, only on the other side of the glass. (528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)315-0470, through Oct. 22.)

us,GEOFFREY KEEZER TRIO,"The pianist Geoffrey Keezer has been pegged as a dexterous hard-bopper since the late-1980's, when he held a prestigious post with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers while still underage. Mr. Keezer, above, hasn't disavowed those first impressions, but his career has recently expanded to match the breadth of his interests. As a member of the Christian McBride Band, Mr. Keezer plays electric keyboards in a setting perhaps best described as postfusion; he has lately been doing a smoother version of the same thing with David Sanborn. In 2003 he released an ambitious solo album that notably featured the Hawaiian slack-key-guitar master Keola Beamer; this summer he teamed up with another guitar legend, Jim Hall, for a forthcoming album of duets. Mr. Keezer's latest effort as a leader, ""Wildcrafted"" (MaxJazz), documents his trio at the Dakota Jazz Club in Minneapolis last year. The album's originals range from somber classicism (""Ghost in the Photograph"") to kinetic soul (""Mirrim""); each setting effectively showcases Mr. Keezer's piano playing, which weds prodigious technique to a disarmingly earnest lyricism. The choice of covers is just as telling: Mr. Keezer recasts signature standards by Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington; ""Venus as a Boy"" by Bjork and ""Koikugari Bushi"" by the Okinawan folksinger Sadao China. It would all sound like a hodgepodge if not for Mr. Keezer's easy but focused rapport with his rhythm-mates, and especially with the drummer Terreon Gully. (Matt Clohesy plays bass on the album; Mike Pope will appear here.) This week's Village Vanguard run should help earn the group its due as one of the sharper contemporary piano trios on the scene. (Tuesday through Oct. 23 at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tomorrow, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212)255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum.)

Until Oct. 23 she'll be occupied by the title role of the Classical Theater of Harlem's ""Medea,"" and the physical and emotional toll it takes leaves room for little else. ""It really is a monster,"" said Ms. Thompson (above, front, with Caran L. Harris) . ""I've done a lot of Shakespeare, and the process is pretty much the same: a large preparation before the show, and stay really healthy. There's no going out drinking."" The jolting production of the Euripides classic about a spurned woman who turns murderous is barely an hour long, but it is an hour full of anguish and anger and pounding on the floor. This is Ms. Thompson's second go-round in the part; she played it three years ago when the theater first mounted Alfred Preisser's gripping adaptation. ""The first time I did it, my approach was really technical,"" Ms. Thompson said. ""I sort of dissected the language."" This time, though, she said, that language has been tweaked, especially for her part: references that were relevant to ancient Greece but are confusing today were removed. ""It's little things, but as the actor, in my approach, those were things you had to take time and make clear, because they weren't contemporary,"" she said. Mr. Preisser's intent, she said, was to make the tale resonate more strongly in the present, especially with what has emerged since the original staging in 2002 about the treatment of women in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. ""There's a whole world of women who live in societies where men can burn them or stone them,"" Ms. Thompson said. ""He wanted that idea of a woman living in a society where she had no rights of her own to pop more in this production."" (Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, (212)868-4444.)

As soon as the Fox network announced the cancellation of the Paris Hilton-Nicole Richie (below, from left) reality show, 20th Century Fox Television, the studio that produces it, said other networks were interested. An article in Daily Variety named NBC and WB as the interested parties. While Chris Alexander, a spokesman for the studio, would not confirm that report, he said, ""The interest from the other networks was swift and intense."" He said that preproduction had begun for the series and that before Fox canceled the show, filming was scheduled to begin in November. ""It would be our hope and desire to have a network partner locked in very shortly,"" he said, ""so that the plans could continue uninterrupted."" Over its three seasons, ""The Simple Life"" has followed the continuing social educations of Ms. Hilton and Ms. Richie as they have interacted with nonmillionaire nonsocialites; they have lived with families and had temporary jobs. The fourth season, if there is one, will follow their attempts to learn how to be good wives (though Ms. Hilton has called off her engagement with Paris Latsis, Ms. Richie's planned marriage is still on). A mysterious rift between the former best friends, announced by Ms. Hilton in a statement in April (""Nicole knows what she did,"" it read in part), means that the show might have to follow its two leads separately.

In the summer, Random House agreed to insert two pages of the Jung family's version of descriptions and facts in the book that its imprint, Knaus Verlag, intended to publish this fall. The publishing house feared it could be sued by the heirs in Germany, where rulings regarding privacy are stricter than in the United States.

In Nielsen's estimates, the network won every half-hour among total viewers and 18-to-49-year-olds with ""Survivor"" (17.57 million), ""CSI"" (27.38 million) and ""Without a Trace"" (20.55 million). Its average audience for the night, 21.83 million, more than doubled that of NBC, which was second place with 10.49 million. As the other networks are fighting for scraps in individual time slots, it is notable which shows are sinking and which solidifying. UPN's ""Everybody Hates Chris"" (6.13 million) drew its best ratings since its premiere, and managed to boost ""Love Inc."" (3.94 million), which follows ""Everybody,"" the Chris Rock-inspired comedy. WB's ""Smallville"" (5.66 million) and ""Everwood"" (4.35 million) continued to carve out a good demographic niche for that channel's younger-skewing programming. On NBC, however, ""Joey"" (7.29 million) and ""ER"" (13.54 million) continued to play how low can you go. Both shows drew their lowest ratings ever among viewers 18 to 49 for original broadcasts. ABC's ""Alias"" (7.03 million) also continued to tank. ""Alias,"" the pregnancy spy show, led off a terrible night for the network, as ""Night Stalker"" (5.15 million) and ""Primetime Live"" (4.71 million) delivered minuscule ratings that placed ABC barely ahead of the smaller broadcasters WB and UPN.

us,Watsu Me,"Do hot-stone massages leave you cold? Is Lomi-Lomi over-over? Jaded spagoers may want to consider Watsu, the aquatic body work making a splash at the Cornelia Day Resort on Fifth Avenue. But be warned: the shiatsu technique is not for the self-conscious or the uptight. The floating massage lasts an hour and takes place in a small, heated, salinated pool, a womblike environment you share with your instructor (mine was a serene man who calls himself Fuad). The session begins with the two of you eyeballing each other until you're comfortable enough for him to cuddle you with your eyes closed. Then he gently spins you around the water like laundry in a spin cycle. Watsu does away with the pull of gravity, and proponents claim it reduces tension and pain. It's also meant to be a healing process in which you bond with your instructor, who can sometimes unlock childhood memories. I found the flowing movements and mild manipulation calming (even resting my head on Fuad's shoulder while he worked on a knot in my neck wasn't too creepy), but I didn't come close to rebirthing or reflecting on my youth. Unless my earliest recollections include really wanting a glass of Champagne at the bar. HORACIO SILVA",2005-10-16T05:00:00+0000
us,'Invisible Listeners'," The chapters of this book investigate the odd practice by which certain poets address their poems, in whole or in part, to someone they do not know and cannot set eyes on, their invisible listener. George Herbert speaks to God; Walt Whitman to the reader in futurity; John Ashbery to a painter of the past. What are we to make of this choice of addressee? With many visible listeners presumably available-the beloved, the patron, the child, the friend-why does the poet feel he or she must hold a colloquy with an invisible other? And what is the ethical import of speaking to such a nonexistent being? To think about such a choice, we must look first at the more common sorts of address within the lyric.

But their husbands adored it, even wore it themselves; then their wives came around, and Jicky became the world's first truly androgynous scent. The photographer Craig McDean liked to wear it, he told the model Jicky Schnee, when they shot the Calvin Klein jeans campaign in 1997. Schnee thinks she got the job, one of her first big campaigns, partly because of her name: a bit of romantic whimsy by Schnee's parents. Jicky was the name of the long-lost love of Aim Guerlain, the perfume's creator, and the diminutive of Jacques, his nephew. When Schnee was a child, her parents steeped her in Jicky lore and every year gave her one of its distinctive bottles, including the one with a frosted glass dropper and old-fashioned lettering. Though she wears Jicky only occasionally, Schnee is keenly aware of how being tethered to an icon can affect one's life. ""Everyone else in my family is a doctor, so it's kind of weird that I ended up working in fashion,"" she says. She's also now part of a fashion clan: her husband is the photographer Matt Jones, and her father-in-law is Terry Jones, the founding editor of i-D magazine, just the type of men who would have blazed a trail in 1889.",2005-10-16T05:00:00+0000

Now he sat alone at the Exeter College high table, after the other diners left, listening to the crackle in the fireplace and staring at nothing in front of his eyes. He had taken off his scholar's gown, which lay in the chair next to him. He wore good worsted trousers that emphasized his long, lanky, athletic legs, and a dark gray jacket of a softer material that fit well and hung fine from his shoulders. It was the understated elegance of Oxford tailoring that proclaimed him a young man of some importance while discreetly draping the fire in his belly. He was tall, almost six feet, quite good-looking, with a long, pale face, strong nose, and cleft chin. His black hair was rather long and parted on the left side and his eyebrows emphasized his large dark eyes, which glowed with intellect and vivacity. Missing was the signature smile on his lips, commented upon by those who knew him through his life. Mysterious, that smile. The fact that it was missing while he sat there alone was proof, perhaps, that it was a smile used to reflect the smiles he met or to defend himself when people around him were far from smiling.

Another new book here is Wynonna Judd's memoir, ""Coming Home to Myself,"" at No. 10. Judd is a big woman with a big, beautiful voice that can plow you under like a John Deere. But even for a country singer she's got a big set of problems: overeating, depression, near-bankruptcy, attention deficit disorder, estrangements from her mother and sister, divorce, a D.U.I. arrest and so on. Judd has packed up her problems, and her book, and her new CD and DVD set, for appearances on ""Good Morning America,"" ""The Larry King Show"" (where she sang, with King, a not-so-winsome duet of ""I Walk the Line"") and ""Oprah.""

That operation will end on Nov. 11, but Seastreak's service to Lower Manhattan from Atlantic Highlands and Highlands will not be affected. On Nov. 1, ticket prices on those routes will rise to cover the higher cost of fuel, Mr. Burrows said. The fare for 20 round-trips will rise by $40 to $623.

McGraw-Hill, Pearson Education, Penguin Group, Simon & Schuster and John Wiley & Sons filed a joint lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeking a declaration that the Google Print for Libraries program violates copyright and requesting an injunction against the scanning of printed works without the permission of the copyright holder. The lawsuit is similar to one filed last month by three authors whose works are included in the University of Michigan library, one of the libraries whose collections Google plans to digitize. By filing a similar suit, the publishers put considerably more muscle behind the action against Google. Google has maintained that its program is covered by the fair use provision of copyright law and that it therefore does not need permission of the copyright holders for the library project. The program makes only small portions of a copyrighted text available to users online; Google likens the result to an electronic card catalog. EDWARD WYATT",2005-10-20T05:00:00+0000

us,'Wanda',"All hail Isabelle Huppert. There are already a multitude of reasons to celebrate this great French actress, and here is another: thanks to her, one of the classics of 1970's American cinema has begun to resurface after decades of neglect. In 1969, the actress Barbara Loden, then married to Elia Kazan, directed a modestly scaled drama called ""Wanda"" from her own original screenplay. Shot in 16 millimeter and blown up to 35, the film pivots on the title character, an unmoored loner from Pennsylvania coal country, beautifully played by Loden (above) herself, who drifts through life and men like flotsam. Working under the sign of Cassavetes, Loden counted Godard and Warhol among her influences, though in one interview stated she did not belong to any new wave: ""It's the old wave. That's what they used to do. They took a camera and they went out and shot. Around that act this whole fantastic apparatus grew up -- the Hollywood albatross. They made a ship out of lead. It won't float any more."" Invited to the Venice Film Festival, ""Wanda"" was justly lauded on its very limited release here. But the brilliant career that should have been was cut short in 1980, when Loden died of cancer at 48. After, ""Wanda"" seemed to disappear as Loden was written out of the histories of the era: don't bother to look for the film or its maker in the index of ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,"" Peter Biskind's seminal book about 1970's American cinema; they aren't there. Happily, Ms. Huppert's company bought the rights to ""Wanda,"" leading to its release on DVD in France, and on Sunday she will introduce this treasure to a very fortunate audience.

But Cedar Lake has several things going for it, including the financial support of Nancy Laurie, a Wal-Mart heir. Its participants are known and engagingly individualistic dance figures. The company founder is Benoit-Swan Pouffer, the former Alvin Ailey dancer, and his fellow choreographers in this inaugural program are Edwaard Liang of the New York City Ballet and Jodie Gates, who has danced with the Joffrey Ballet and William Forsythe. The theater is the former Chelsea studio of the photographer Annie Leibovitz, a 16,000-square-foot building with a gabled roof, exposed trusses and presumably some positive artistic karma in the air. Mr. Liang's piece, set to music by Vivaldi, Tan Dun and This Mortal Coil, explores the duality of the past and future. Ms. Gates is contributing a structured improvisation that contemplates the present. And Mr. Pouffer's new ""Seed"" addresses the cycle of life. He describes the company as a narrative contemporary ballet troupe (the dancer Jessica Coleman-Scott, above), which sounds as if the three choreographers might provide a story or two to grab hold of in their multimedia dances, which are set to live and recorded music. The intermission will be enlivened by music mixed by an onstage D.J. The evening's theme, and the company's mission, Mr. Pouffer says, is replanting and the desire to grow.

The visuals are a loving tribute to the great graphic designer Saul Bass, while the jazzy sounds of John Ottman's score summon up the easy heat of Henry Mancini in his prime. The movie itself, however, evokes a rather different era. I could say that its syncopated editing, its switchback chronology, its fourth-wall-breaking voice-over narration and its hectic mixture of humor and violence represent a fresh and exciting twist on sturdy noir conventions. In fact, I would say just that -- if it were 1995 and I were the kind of person whose mind had just been blown by the cinematic possibilities revealed in ""Pulp Fiction.""",2005-10-21T05:00:00+0000

us,The Listings: Oct. 21 -- Oct. 27; 'VII',"Photojournalism throws everything that's philosophically complicated about photography into relief. The medium can be used in what are intended as interpretively neutral ways to document life as it is. It can also be a vehicle for political, social and personal statements. In many cases, the lines between objectivity and subjectivity, fact and attitude, are impossible to disentangle. Those lines crisscross like crazy in a group show of work by nine professional photojournalists at the new Hasted-Hunt Gallery in Chelsea. The participants are all part of the collective photographic agency called ""VII,"" formed early in 2001 on the model of the member-run Magnum. As always, it is hard to overlook the paradox that while the purpose of such agencies is to give photographers control over their work, at least some of that work is devoted to recording the lives of people who have lost control of their destinies. Such is the case in John Stanmeyer's picture of drug addicts chained to a post in Indonesia, in images by Ron Haviv and Joachim Ladefoged (above) of uprooted lives in Bosnia and Albania, in Gary Knight's multiple views of a tsunami-ravaged Sumatra, in Antonin Kratochvil's shot of a corpse on a street in Haiti, and in James Nachtwey's close-up of the machete-scarred face of young man in Rwanda. By contrast, Christopher Morris's picture of ardent cellphone conversationalists in Pennsylvania and Lauren Greenfield's images of California teenagers in prom dresses seem to be from an entirely different universe. Yet two pictures by Alexandra Boulat suggest connections: one is of a turbaned man standing outside a ruined house; the other of a young woman in a Western-style formal gown posing in what looks like a hotel. Both were taken in Afghanistan in the last five years. Are the links between the turbaned man, the woman in the gown and the California teenagers confusing? You bet. That's why photojournalism is the art it is. (Hasted Hunt Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)627-0006, through Dec. 23.)",2005-10-21T05:00:00+0000

Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said strong global demand and price increases helped push its earnings up to $667 million, or 94 cents a share, from $498 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 17 percent, to $8.98 billion from $7.66 billion, a year earlier. The income fell short of the $1.06 a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. The company also cut its full-year forecast, saying it expects 2005 earnings of $3.85 to $4 a share, down from its previous estimate of $4 to $4.20 a share. Caterpillar said it lowered earnings expectations because of a higher tax rate and about $100 million in expected pretax expenses for changes in its dealer distribution software and a product realignment under consideration.

Many of the stories in ""A Thousand Years of Good Prayers"" are set in the 1990's, and Li is a valuable firsthand guide to this decade of mind-bending change. These narratives are about shifts and adjustments: parents make allowances for their children (and vice versa), and all her characters have to decide how to cope with the past - both personal and political - in order to stand a chance in an uncertain future. Li's ability to write about both her native and adoptive countries - her characters include Chinese immigrants in America and migrs on return visits to China - makes her a skillful double agent.

Stem cells can also take the place of bone marrow in transplants for people suffering from leukemia, lymphoma and sickle cell anemia. Use of these cells is less controversial than use of embryonic stem cells, which entail the destruction of an embryo.

""The Lincoln Lawyer"" is his first legal thriller, and its sales have been pushed by some of the strongest reviews of his career. (Writing in the Book Review two weeks ago, Marilyn Stasio called the novel ""a powerhouse drama fueled by cynicism and driven by a criminal defense lawyer . . . who works for the scum of the earth and makes no apologies."") On the nonfiction side, the highest ranking new entry is Joan Didion's memoir ""The Year of Magical Thinking."" It's Didion's eighth book to make The Times's fiction or nonfiction list in hardcover. Her first two books, the novel ""Run River"" (1963) and the essay collection ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem"" (1968) did not appear here, and neither did her two most recent books, the essay collection ""Political Fictions"" and the family history ""Where I Was From."" But in between, almost everything she has published -- with the exception of ""Miami"" (1987) -- has made the hardcover lists. Didion's most popular books, in terms of this page, appeared in the late 1970's and early 80's. Her novel ""A Book of Common Prayer"" had a 15-week run in the spring and summer of 1977; her essay collection ""The White Album"" hung on for 13 weeks in the summer and fall of 1979; and ""Salvador"" spent 8 weeks on the nonfiction list in the spring of 1983.",2005-10-23T05:00:00+0000

The actress, who will turn 60 in January, returns to the screen in December in ""The Family Stone,"" an ensemble drama in which she plays the dying but buoyant matriarch of a large and strenuously colorful brood. Keaton is deeply attractive in a way that you don't see much in Hollywood anymore (or on the Upper East Side or in any upscale area, for that matter): she looks, that is, the way a woman her age might look if pre-emptive cosmetic surgery for actresses over the age of 30 hadn't somehow become the law of the land.

Oil profits that flow to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries finance both terrorist acts and the spread of dangerously fanatical forms of Islam. The burning of fossil fuels creates greenhouse emissions that provoke climate change. All the while, oil dependency increases the likelihood of further military entanglements, and threatens the economy with inflation, high interest rates and risky foreign indebtedness. Until now, the government has failed to connect our crises and our consumption in a coherent way. That dereliction of duty has led to policies that are counterproductive, such as tax incentives to buy gas guzzlers and an overemphasis on increasing domestic oil supply, although even all-out drilling would not be enough to slake our oil thirst and would require a reversal of longstanding environmental protections.",2005-10-24T05:00:00+0000

In my view, hes a worthy recipient  a writer whose vision changed the way we look at the world. (I do not feel this way about Fo, who seemed more a pure political choice on the part of the committee.) But rather than debate Pinters merits, Id like to raise a larger question: In general, theater has been poorly represented throughout the 100-year-plus history of this prize compared to fiction and poetry. Does this say something about the status of theater in international culture since the Nobel began being awarded, at the turn of the 20th century? And if so, is this because of the advent of film and, later, television? Or are there other reasons? Should the great artists in new media  film directors, for instance  be considered for the Nobel in addition to playwrights? (After all, Pinter himself did significant work in film.) Id be curious to hear readers views on these issues, and would like to post the more provocative arguments.",2005-10-25T14:05:13+0000

Its ""NCIS"" continued to do well, drawing an audience of 17.22 million.

So the fact that his beautifully performed drama at Urban Stages is called ""Marion Bridge"" should tip you off that it is a departure. Mr. MacIvor, a vastly underrated and prolific writer whose intimate plays often seem like Brechtian spins on Alfred Hitchcock, has written something more old-fashioned this time, a mostly naturalistic play about quiet lives in a small town in Nova Scotia. There's no murder, no shocks and no dark secrets waiting to be revealed. But in some ways, this moving drama, which tiptoes toward sentimentality without ever reaching it, is the most surprising play that he's ever written. When was the last time you saw a drama about three distinct, complex women that had nothing to do with their relationships with men? The MacKeigan sisters, whose affection for one another shows despite their constant bickering, are troubled, each in her own way. Agnes (Henny Russell) has a faltering acting career and an estranged daughter; Theresa (Christa Scott-Reed) is a rigid nun questioning her faith (a portrait on par with Cherry Jones's in ""Doubt""); and childlike Louise (Susan Louise O'Connor, above right, with Ms. Scott-Reed) is married to her soap operas. They have all come home to see their dying mother, but while Mr. MacIvor often writes about death, this resolutely hopeful play is as much about making the most of life (despite all its flaws and disappointments).

The Board, staff, and friends of The New York Botanical Garden are deeply saddened by the loss of our fellow board member, friend, and esteemed benefactor, Enid A. Haupt, the greatest patron American horticulture has ever known. Her visionary and generous stewardship over many decades, as well as her impassioned enthusiasm for plants, particularly orchids, and fine horticulture have been instrumental in our modern history. In 1975, Mrs. Haupt came to the rescue of the Garden's historic Conservatory, the largest Victorian glasshouse in the nation. Her creative act saved this New York City Landmark from destruction. Upon completion of its rehabilitation in 1978, the Conservatory was named in her honor. In the mid-1990s, she was the leading private donor to the Conservatory's four-year, comprehensive restoration. She has been an enthusiastic proponent of the Conservatory's popular seasonal exhibitions and flower shows and a champion of the horticulture staff's fine work. A distinguished magazine publisher and editor, ardent and knowledgeable horticulturist, and award-winning gardener in her own right, Mrs. Haupt was honored by the Garden in 1973 for her contributions that reflected ""her belief in the power of Nature to refresh and restore."" She joined the Garden's Board of Managers in 1975, serving as Honorary Chairman of both the annual Conservatory Ball and the Conservatory Committee, and as a member of the Horticulture Committee. A generous philanthropist in many spheres, she was well known and respected for her support of many other gardens, green spaces, and horticultural organizations. Although Mrs. Haupt has left a legacy of beauty for millions to enjoy, we will miss her trusted advice, keen aesthetic judgment, elegance, enthusiasm, and true love for the Garden, the plants that live here, and the people who care for them.

us,'Naruse: The Unknown Japanese Master',"MIKIO NARUSE (1905-1969) has been lauded as one of the neglected masters of Japanese cinema for so long and by so many estimable champions that his status as one of the medium's martyrs seems assured. Even so, the admiration of the likes of Susan Sontag has not done much for his profile in this country, and his work remains all but out of reach, which makes the Naruse retrospective at Film Forum all the more valuable. Naruse began working in the Japanese film industry at age 15 after his father died: ""I had to immediately become an adult,"" he said. ""It was the darkest period of my life."" In time, he became celebrated for his melodramas and, in particular, for his sympathetic portrayal of geishas, widows and other hard-luck women. Set principally in postwar Tokyo, his bruising 1955 melodrama ""Floating Clouds"" concerns the relationship between a single woman (played by Hideko Takamine) and a married man (Masayuki Mori, above with Takamine), who became involved years before while working in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The elegance and indisputable hard punch of Naruse's storytelling become immediately clear the moment the lovers kiss and the director cuts, midclinch, to an almost identical shot of them kissing in the past, an edit that suggests this is a passion that transcends even time and space. Like many films in the series, ""Floating Clouds"" will be shown in a new 35-millimeter print. (""Naruse: The Japanese Unknown Master"" continues through Nov. 17 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Sixth Avenue, South Village, (212) 727-8110.)",2005-10-28T05:00:00+0000

William Nachbar grew up in New York City and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1940. He graduated from Cornell University in 1944 and then served in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946. He received a Master's degree in mathematics from the Courant Institute of New York University in 1948 and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from Brown University in 1951. He met his wife Pauline at Brown. He worked at Boeing in Seattle from 1951 to 1955, where he participated in the design of the Boeing 707, the first commercially successful jet airliner. From 1955 to 1961, he was section head of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics at the Research Laboratory of the Lockheed Missile and Space Division in Palo Alto.

More than 130 people died when rebels linked to Chechen separatists attacked law enforcement buildings in the city of Nalchik two weeks ago.

us,The Listings: Oct. 28 -- Nov. 3; 'SHOSTAKOVICH CENTENNIAL',"If Shostakovich, above, is getting a lot of attention in recent years, it's because he is a perpetually fascinating subject of debate. Beyond the hoary question of whether he was a secret rebel against Stalin or a sellout who tried to ingratiate himself with the government, there is the music: now thorny, now shallow; now strikingly original, now rife with quotations from other composers; now spiky, now expressively melodramatic. It offers the ear and the mind a lot to chew on and repays repeated visits: a reason for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center to feature the composer in a celebration that is billed as a centennial, though technically it falls closer to his 99th birthday. Featuring familiar faces from the Chamber Music Society -- Anne-Marie McDermott, Ida and Ani Kavafian, Fred Sherry -- the three concerts deliberately show three aspects of Shostakovich. Tonight's concert focuses on less-known works, like his early Op. 8 piano trio, or late ones like the violin sonata that received its first performance in 1969 by David Oistrakh and Sviatoslav Richter. Sunday's concert offers Shostakovich's prettier and more popular side with pieces like the D minor cello sonata and the E minor piano trio. And the final concert, on Tuesday, traces an unconventional arc from early works (the Op. 6 ""Suite for Two Pianos"") to the last piece he wrote, the viola sonata. As for debates, the organization is demonstrating which side of at least one debate it favors by presenting Solomon Volkov, the author of Shostakovich's as-told-to memoirs, ""Testimony."" The book is challenged by some who say Mr. Volkov put words into Shostakovich's mouth but embraced by others as a powerful and moving book that captures something essential about his life. (Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; Mr. Volkov's lecture on Sunday is at 3 p.m. in the Rose Rehearsal Studio, 165 West 65th Street.

His current exhibition is based on a surprisingly elegant idea for a major work of public art in the nation's capital. He proposes to uproot 30 monuments commemorating 19th-century battles or massacres involving whites and American Indians that are out West and transplant them the National Mall. There they would be lined up along opposite sides of the Reflecting Pool or grouped on the lawn in front of the Washington Monument. In the Paula Cooper Gallery, Mr. Durant has installed one-third-scale reproductions of all the monuments(above), all nonfigurative variations on the obelisk and painted gray. Arrayed in a grid, they create the feeling of an old graveyard; they also can be read as spoofing Minimalist sculpture, which often has a funereal dimension. In addition to the reproductions, a wooden model of the Mall with tiny versions of the monuments in place is on display. Mr. Durant's proposal is, of course, unlikely ever to be realized -- imagine the uproar if it gained any traction! It remains a fancy academic conceit for a relatively limited audience. As such, however, it serves as a good starting point for a discussion about the possibilities and purposes of public art today.

After all, newspapers, magazines, television and now blogs have made this conflict the most described, discussed, investigated and analyzed in American history. And the news media are timely in a way that books can never be. Yet books perform a function that our instantaneous journalism cannot: they can offer depth, perspective, continuity and complexity, a panorama instead of a close-up -- which is why so many journalists covering the war choose to write them. And so, as Fareed Zakaria writes, George Packer of The New Yorker builds a detailed case that the Bush administration allowed its preconceptions to override the facts on the ground. Ben Macintyre tells how Anthony Shadid of The Washington Post was able to use his encounters with ordinary Iraqis to put together a rich collage of the people who must live daily with the war. Dexter Filkins relates how Michael Goldfarb, previously a National Public Radio reporter, took an opposite tack from Shadid, focusing in depth on the tragic story of a single brave individual, while James Traub moves us beyond talk radio's fervid simplifications and television's contrived vituperations by looking at two thoughtful collections of pieces that give us the real debate about the war. Finally, as Robert F. Worth reminds us in his essay on the back page, books are necessary not only for a concerned public but also for the journalists, plopped down in a strange land, who need to educate themselves about, as Worth puts it, ""the human roots,"" ""the Arab history that lay beneath the rubble of Baghdad.""",2005-10-30T05:00:00+0000

In 1943, he volunteered as a paratrooper and joined the 82nd Airborne division, serving in the African, Sicilian, and Italian campaigns, and parachuted behind German lines at Draguignan, France. He was wounded in France and in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. His medals include the Bronze Star, Purple Heart with two palms, and the Yugoslav War Cross. He was aide-de-camp to King Peter II of Yugoslavia and thereafter championed and published several books on the Yugoslav Karageorges Royal Family. After the war he lived in Paris, where he represented European wines and spirits in the US. He was a Knight Grand-Cross with sash of the Sovereign Order of Malta, an order he served in many capacities for 45 years. In recent years, his commentaries in European journals provided insights on European royalty and the breakup of Yugoslavia. He will be remembered gratefully by family and friends for his unconditional love, loyalty, and friendship; values that shaped his life.

It is also the title of his new book, out from Phaidon.

In fact, some of the more interesting clothes of the season appear to have been conceived with this dark place in mind, even if the designer versions come elaborately embroidered or trimmed in astrakhan. Ballen had never photographed fashion, but he found it a willing accomplice to his vision -- so, too, the fearless Selma Blair, who appears this month in a remake of ""The Fog.""

us,Comings and Goings,"The powerful phrase ""Last orders!"" -- shouted at pubs throughout England at around 10:50 each night, causing a rush of customers to the bar, desperate to get that final drink -- is about to be consigned to the dustbin of history. On Nov. 24, the British government, apparently convinced that the 11 p.m. mandatory pub closing law has led to binge drinking, will allow pubs to remain open longer, even up to 24 hours a day, if they can get local government approval. Meanwhile, late-night partygoers may well decide to give Barcelona a pass this year. The Spanish press is reporting that Barcelona is planning to introduce on-the-spot fines aimed at foreign tourists who exhibit public displays of inebriation -- like vomiting, urinating, wandering around with open beer cans or with their shirts off. The fines could go as high as 1,500 euros ($1,830, at $1.22 to the euro) and a city spokesman said that visitors arriving in Barcelona would be given leaflets explaining the new regulations. Paris Photo, one of the largest international fairs for 19th-century, modern and contemporary photography, involving 90 galleries and 106 exhibitors, will run from Nov. 17 to 20 this year. The main exhibition will be at Carrousel du Louvre, 99, rue de Rivoli (Mtro: Palais Royal); general admission is 15 euros. Hotel prices in the United States are expected to rise 9 percent next year, with domestic air fares predicted to go up by 6 percent, according to a report released earlier this month by the National Business Travel Association.

First published in 1997, this thing has now been on the list for 260 weeks -- longer than all but a handful of titles, including ""The Road Less Traveled"" (694 weeks) and ""The Joy of Sex (363 weeks). Kiyosaki, who was born in Hawaii, has diversified feverishly in the years since ""Rich Dad"" was released -- there are now 10 books in the ""Rich Dad"" series, he's done infomercials, been on ""Oprah"" and played Madison Square Garden. Kiyosaki's book is often credited with helping start the boom in ""flipping"" real estate, but as Carol Lloyd pointed out recently in The San Francisco Chronicle, he's backing off some of that advice now. ""I'm worried about people using their houses as A.T.M. machines,"" he said. He added that flipping is ""really stupid right now."" (These days, he is more bullish on oil and gold.) Kiyosaki's kind of success can bring scrutiny. When I punched his name into Google, for example, the top hit was a strenuous, almost book-length put-down of ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by the newsletter publisher John T. Reed. (Reed doesn't call Kiyosaki ""the worst financial guru of my generation,"" but he comes close.) Still, as Kiyosaki said on CNN earlier this year: ""The world is full of critics, and I ask those critics, 'Have you sold 20 million copies of a book so far? Are you a multimillionaire?'

A disgraced businessman, T, picks up a young couple, Jenny and Lester, who are hitchhiking, armed with, respectively, impressive cleavage and a lead pipe. Once he dissuades them from bashing his skull in and taking his car, T gives them a lift to a secluded cabin near Alexandria Bay in the Thousand Islands. He ends up staying with them, even though they're obviously con artists at best and probably a lot worse -- Jenny keeps cuddling up to him, Lester seems more or less psychopathic, and both of them make it clear that they'd like a whole lot of money from him to clear up a drug deal gone bad. Inevitably, revelations, double crosses and violence ensue. The story could be short-circuited at virtually any point by T wising up enough to drive away by himself. Why doesn't he? Well, he's got something like a death wish (having been busted for downloading child pornography, he's got little to live for besides his memories of a long-ago affair with one of his professors), and he's desperate enough for human interaction and fascinated enough by grotesquerie that he's willing to risk his neck just to see how the whole sordid business is going to turn out. Falco's prose is cold and brisk, with occasional flashes of hard-boiled eloquence, and the story hurtles like a brakeless truck toward its bloody denouement.",2005-10-30T05:00:00+0000

us,Why the Fed Cant Go Long,"Jim Hargrove, Austin, Tex.: You commented in your recent column [Bernanke and the Bubble] that the Fed controls only short term interest rates. Isnt that really a policy choice that the Fed has made? Does anything prevent the F.O.M.C. [Federal Open Market Committee, the Feds policiy panel] from buying longer term bonds or selling them to try to affect longer term rates?",2005-10-31T19:16:06+0000
us,Grading the Bush White House,"Sharon Wichmann, Bremen Germany: The Plame affair has solidified the publics growing doubts about the administrations morals. By a 3-to-1 margin, according to a Washington Post poll, the public now believes that the level of ethics and honesty in the government has declined rather than risen under Mr. Bush. Do you really think that the public thinks? I devour your columns and rarely disagree, but the general public has a two-minute thought span and seems to be swayed rather dramatically by the least little bit of news. NOTHING HAS CHANGED: Bush and Company are what they were when they were elected and have not changed one iota. If people really recognize that, more power to them. Ill wait to see the polls of their opinions in another four weeks and see how consistent they remain.",2005-10-31T20:55:00+0000
us,Hidden Costs and Master Plans: Readers on the Iraq War,"Leitha Martin, Milan Italy: Your column [Karl and Scooters Excellent Adventure] is a clear and reasonable assessment of the real motives for the war, but what someone living in Europe cannot fathom is how come the fables  fed to the nation and the world were so readily digested by the nation if not the world? Inter alia, Powells U.N. presentation was patently weak and unconvincing: why were Americans, including much of the press, so gullible?",2005-10-31T21:38:07+0000
us,Readers on the New Nobel,"Elizabeth McBride: Alpine, Tex.: There should be both more prizes awarded in drama and new prizes in cinema. To my mind, Edward Albee is the most important American playwright because he brought to American drama the influences of mid-century European philosophical thought. I would say that playwrights like Pinter derived a lot of energy from Albees strategies. However, cinema is no flash in the pan now and awards would also be appropriate.",2005-10-31T21:41:34+0000
us,Schizophrenic in New York,"I think some readers were puzzled by my Tuesday column, warning against borderline indictments (which aggravated my usual fans), followed by Sundays column saying that Cheney should speak up or resign. Its true that the tenor was rather different, but they both reflected my distaste for government getting bogged down in partisan bickering  and also in inconsistencies.",2005-10-31T21:49:08+0000
us,Wiping Smiles Off Faces,"Heres some of the commentary on my latest columns about Cheneyit included some people saying, in effect, LET US GLOAT! Jean from Ann Arbor, MI writes: I am struck by your frequent referrals to the Democrats glee in your last two columns. Respectfully, sir, I think you misconstrue the reaction of the Democrats, who have watched our country be lied to repeatedly, with a passive press repeating those lies, and who have also watched anyone who challenged the lies be fiercely swiftboated, whether they be Eric Shinseki, Larry Lindsey, Paul ONeill, Rand Beers, Richard Clarke, Wesley Clark, Joseph Wilson or any number of talented, brave people who attempted to engage in dialogue about the truthfulness of the administrations claims and the wisdom of its actions. Its not glee  its an enormous sense of hopefulness that perhaps there is accountability in government and that governance itself is not merely an act of wag the dog. ",2005-10-31T23:57:42+0000
