The coordinator, Joseph DeVincenzo, in an interview, dismisses the allegations, but adds that it is the city's policy to discard stale or obsolete resumes every six months or so. July 13 and 21: Mr. DeVincenzo testifies in closed session before the commission. Jan. 9, 1989: Nydia Padilla-Barnham, the director of the Talent Bank who resigned in 1987, testifies to the commission that instead of recruiting minority employees, the agency was used to dispense patronage and that the vast majority of jobs went to white men. She also describes in detail the destruction of documents and the altering of computer files to cover up the political side of the agency. Jan. 11: Mr. DeVincenzo, speaking before the commission, denies that his agency was used for patronage, disclaims knowledge of applicants with political ties and says the destruction of records was routine. His assistant, James G. Hein, also denies allegations of patronage, but testifies that Mr. DeVincenzo ordered him in February 1986 to cleanse the computer and paper files of out-of-date resumes and of ''any references to political figures.'' Jan. 23: Mr. DeVincenzo files papers saying he would retire by the end of April, thereby insuring full rights to an annual $52,000 pension. Feb. 24: In his resignation letter to the Mayor, Mr. DeVincenzo says he ''never lost sight of our affirmative-action goals.'' The Mayor later testifies that he was ''distressed'' to learn on Feb. 17 that his assistant had retired before being forced to resign. Aug. 4: Mr. DeVincenzo's indictment on 11 counts of perjury is announced. It cites his testimony on July 13 and 21, 1988, and on Jan. 11, 1989.",1989-08-05T05:00:00+0000

us,"RAYMOND CARVER: A STILL, SMALL VOICE","A year after his death, the recurring image I associate with Raymond Carver is one of people leaning toward him, working very hard at the act of listening. He mumbled. T. S. Eliot once described Ezra Pound, qua mentor, as ''a man trying to convey to a very deaf person the fact that the house is on fire.'' Raymond Carver had precisely the opposite manner. The smoke could be filling the room, flames streaking across the carpet, before Carver would ask, ''Is it, uh, getting a little hot in here, maybe?'' And you would be sitting in your chair, bent achingly forward at the waist, saying, ''Beg pardon, Ray?'' Never insisting, rarely asserting, he was an unlikely teacher. I once sat in and listened while Carver was interviewed for two and a half hours. The writer conducting the interview moved the tape recorder closer and closer and finally asked if Carver would put it in his lap. A few days later the interviewer called up, near despair: Ray's voice on the tapes was nearly inaudible. The word ''soft-spoken'' hardly begins to do justice to his speech; this condition was aggravated whenever he was pressed into the regions of generality or prescription.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"QUIDDITIES: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary, by W. V. Quine. (Belknap/Harvard University, $9.95.) Beginning with ''Alphabet'' and ending with ''Zero,'' one of the century's great logicians writes miniature essays on ''Atoms,'' ''Etymology,'' ''Fermat's Last Theorem,'' ''Redundancy,'' ''Rhetoric'' and other favorite themes. The book ''is infused with a deadpan humor that can light up even the most austere subjects,'' John Gross said in The Times in 1987. ''At almost every turn there are cheerful ripples of wordplay,'' as in the title, which at various times has meant essence, a subtle distinction and a quibble. PARIS TROUT, by Pete Dexter. (Penguin, $7.95.) After a Georgia shopkeeper named Paris Trout kills a 14-year-old black girl, the people in the town of Cotton Point try to convince themselves that they are somehow different from their racist, paranoid neighbor. ''Mr. Dexter's strongest suit is his exquisite understanding of the finely meshed engines of greed, appetite and self-interest that drive a small town,'' Deborah Mason said in The Book Review last year. '' [ His ] great accomplishment is to remind us, with lucidity and stinging frankness, the lengths to which we will go to deny our own racism and to reassure ourselves that we are innocent.'' The novel won the National Book Award. Penguin has also republished DEADWOOD ($7.95), Mr. Dexter's story about Wild Bill Hickok and his deranged friends. In 1986 our reviewer, Ron Hansen, said the novel is ''unpredictable, hyperbolic and, page after page, uproarious.'' VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU: And Other Reports From the Not-So-Far-East, by Pico Iyer. (Vintage, $9.95.) A British journalist finds that some of the weirdest things in Asia come from the ''Coca-Colonizing forces'' of America's ''pop-cultural imperialism'': fern bars in Bali, apartments in Tibet decked out like Greenwich Village pads. ''His travels have yielded a meticulously observed and reported book,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year, ''a magical mystery tour through the brave new world of Asia.'' FRYE STREET & ENVIRONS: The Collected Works of Marita Bonner, edited by Joyce Flynn and Joyce Occomy Stricklin. (Beacon, $9.95.) This collection of fiction, plays and essays by one of America's pre-eminent black writers includes short stories about ghetto life that are ''hard, unrelenting [ and ] rendered with exquisite craftsmanship, with a brevity like a master's ink sketch of brash strokes that reveal everything,'' Doris Jean Austin said here in 1988. FAMILY OF SPIES: Inside the John Walker Spy Ring, by Pete Earley. (Bantam, $4.95.) When John Walker, an officer in the Navy, started peddling secrets to the Soviet Union, he was motivated not by ideology but by greed. Pete Earley, who had to pay Mr. Walker for his story, exposes ''his superficially slick but profoundly distorted mind,'' Lucinda Franks said here in January. ''The result is an unusually penetrating portrait of the banality of evil, of a psychology that usually defies intimate understanding - the narcissist whose rationalizations make his wrongdoing seem almost normal.'' THE RAT, by Gunter Grass. Translated by Ralph Manheim. (Harvest/Helen and Kurt Wolff/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $9.95.) In a concatenation of stories within stories, Gunter Grass tells of the dawning of the posthuman age when the world is overrun by rats. ''This exhilarating, exhausting, maddening, brilliant, funny and profoundly disturbing novel is about the end of mankind, the end of plot, the end of syntax, the end of language,'' Janette Turner Hospital said here in 1987. The same publisher has also reissued Mr. Grass's 1978 novel, THE FLOUNDER ($11.95). Our reviewer, Morris Dickstein, described it as ''a gargantuan fable that spans a period from the Stone Age to the 1970's . . . [ an ] exuberantly inventive work.'' A GODLESS JEW: Freud, Atheism, and the Making of Psychoanalysis, by Peter Gay. (Yale University, $9.95.) The author of the recent biography ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' contended in this earlier work that atheism was more of an influence than Judaism on the founding of psychoanalysis. Mr. Gay uses ''great sensitivity and insight'' to argue against those who characterize psychoanalysis as a Jewish science or a form of religion, one reviewer said in 1987. THE NIGHT OF THE WEEPING WOMEN, by Lawrence Naumoff. (Ivy, $3.95.) After a young couple move to a farmhouse in North Carolina, they each take a cue from their parents and start having marital difficulties. Last year our reviewer, Valerie Gladstone, said ''this tight, intense first novel . . . makes suffocation look like a lot more fun than marriage.'' MUSINGS: The Musical Worlds of Gunther Schuller, by Gunther Schuller. (Oxford University, $11.95.) The composer Gunther Schuller tries to break down the walls between artistic domains, combining the rigors of classical composition with the inspiration of jazz. In 1986 our reviewer, Carol J. Oja, said these essays are ''a joy to read. . . . 'Musings' reveals the exuberance and depth of his work.'' THE TRIARCHIC MIND: A New Theory of Human Intelligence, by Robert J. Sternberg. (Penguin, $8.95.) A Yale University psychologist argues that intelligence is not a single abstract quality that can be measured like temperature, pressure or the brightness of light. The best I.Q. test is life itself and how successfully we negotiate its corridors. This book is ''a lively popular account of his work on intelligence,'' Philip N. Johnson-Laird said here last year. ''The book is laced with tests for the reader to take and tips on how to improve intelligence - the faculty rather than the test score.''",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

Ty Cobb was not as good as his .367 career batting average, say the baseball computer analysts; if he were playing today he would hit only .289. That only proves Cobb's greatness, say the critics of such analysis - .289 is impressive hitting for a 102-year-old. Bill Starr, a minor-league player in the 1930's and owner of the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League until 1955, says that the players of the 1920's and 30's get a bum rap. It is wrong to assume that because athletes are generally faster, bigger and stronger than in the old days, baseball players necessarily are better, Mr. Starr says in ''Clearing the Bases.'' Those traits make for better football and basketball players, but baseball depends on hand skills more akin to those used in golf, and quickness rather than foot speed. The theory that a lively ball created higher batting averages in the 20's and 30's is bunk, says Mr. Starr. Rather, Babe Ruth established that hitting drew fans and a higher salary, and players altered their bats and styles in Ruth's image. Mr. Starr cranks out his own statistics to show that players of the old days managed to hit the long ball while keeping strikeouts - much more an embarrassment then than now - to a minimum. Mr. Starr emphasizes that his book is no nostalgia trip. Too bad, for as he makes these and various other cases with quotes from old-timers, the reader gets too-brief glimpses of a time when all manner of spitballs were common, owners figured one ball should last a whole game and crowds milled around the outfield during games.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,Fund Follows a Tradition of Marian Anderson,"WHEN Marian Anderson received the $10,000 Philadelphia Award in the 1950's, she used the money to set up scholardhips for young singers. ''If some of these people have gone out and brought pleasure and satisfaction to publics of their own and if the scholarship helped them climb another rung on the way to their goal, I feel that the people who have listened to me ofer the years deserve the credit,'' she wrote in her autobiography. ''Their faith opened the way for me to be useful to younger singers.'' Miss anderson, who has lived in Danbury since 1940 and was a prime mover in establishing the Charles Ives Center for the Performing Arts there, will be honored by the center with a gala concert on Saturday. The proceeds from the event will establish a Marian Anderson Award to promote the careers of promising American singers. The outdoor celebration, starting at 8 P.M., will feature the violinist Isaac Stern playing Mozart's G-major Concerto: the soprano Jessye Norman singing two arias from Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' three strauss songs and a number of the spirituals that Miss Anderson has performed, and Julius Rudel conducting the Ives Festival Orchestra in those works and other pieces by Wagner and Mozart. For Ms. Norman, the concert is almost a way of repaying an old debt. ''I first heard Marian Anderson on a recording at the age of 10,'' she said. ''It wasn't just a voice; it was a revelation, and I wept.'' ''She has meant so much to so many. It would have been completely impossible for me to have any kind of career if it hadn't been for people like Miss Anderson with such strength of character.'' Mr. Stern, a friend and neighbor of Miss Anderson's, said: ''Music was for her an expression, not a career. It reflected her simplicity and natural nobility as a woman; it came from her inner self. The uniqueness of her talent is what made her very special - the sheer magnificence of the voice, the intelligence of its use, and the true himility that you so rarely find in a major artist.'' Benefit tickets, which include tax-deductible contributions, are $50; $100 and $500. Unreserved lawn seating is $15. Next Sunday has been set aside as a raing date. For reservations or more information, call the Ives Center at 797-4002. At Music Mountain in Falls Village, the summer-long parade of top-notch international string quartets will continue today at 4 P.M. as the Franciscan performs Haydn's ''Rider'' Quartet, Beethoven's Opus 135 and George Rochberg's Quartet No. 5. Breaking the usual Saturday pattern of lighter concerts at the Mountain, the Quartetto de Venezia will give an 8:30 P.M. recital devoted to Puccini's miniature ''I Crisantemi,'' the Quartet No. 1 by Charles Strouse and Beethoven's E-flat Piano Quartet, with Marian Hahn the guest jartist. The Quartetto de Venezia will return next Sunday afternon at 4, for Bartok, Schubert and, again with Ms. Hahn, Mozart's E-flat Piano Quartet (496-1222). The Chestnut Hill Concert Series will continue at the Congregational Meeting House of Madison at 8:30 P.M. Friday as the violinist Ik-Hwan Bae, the horn player Robert Routch and the pianist David Oei gather for sonatas and tios by Beethove, Messaien and Brahms (453-1359). At the same hour, the Norfolk Festival will close its summer season with a final recital of Beethove, Ravel and Franck by the Tokyo String Quartet (542-5537). Instead of its usual orchestral session, the Summer Music Festival in Waterford will present a chamber music recital by the Empire Brass at 8 P.M. Saturday in Harkness Park. The quintet has prepared transcriptions of a dozen or more staples of the symphonic repertory, including excerpts from Copland's ''Rodeo'' and ''Appalachian Spring,'' the Ravel ''Pavane for a Dead Princess'' and Brahms's ''Hungarian Dance No. 5.'' There will also be selections from Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess'' and Bernstein's ''West Side Story,'' and a couple of Ellington's jazz classics (442-9199).

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Revueltas, Ginastera, Villa-Lobos: String Quartets Cuarteto Latinoamericano. Elan CD 2218; CD only. Latin concert music of this century has tended toward the neo-Classical rather than the fiercely dissonant, with honorable attention paid to the varied folk traditions of the Latin countries. In the 1930's and 40's, the United States heard a good deal of this music, but those links have eroded in recent decades, and disks like this fine survey of Latin string quartets should help restore these composers to our repertories. Included are the Quartets Nos. 2 (''Magueyes'') and 4 (''Musica de Feria'') by the Mexican Silvestre Revueltas, the Quartet No. 1 by the Ar gentine Alberto Ginastera and the Quar tet No. 17 by the Brazilian Heitor Villa-Lobos. The performances, by an ensemble of varied Latin ancestry now in residence at Carnegie-Mellon Univer sity in Pittsburgh, are first-rate. - John Rockwell Hanson: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 The Seattle Symphony conducted by Gerard Schwarz. Delos D/CD 3073; CD only. To listen to Howard Hanson's symphonies is to feel America digesting the Romantic era. Hanson lived until 1981, and these pieces -the so-called ''Nordic'' and ''Romantic'' Symphonies - were written in 1922 and 1930 respectively. But this music is clearly about an older time as experienced by a newer coun try. Hanson's simple diatonic language, his strong, clean-shaven orchestration and his tendency toward un complicated heroism are never pretentious, always sincere, very American. Mr. Schwarz and his Seattle players respond in kind. - Bernard Holland Chopin: Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3 Mitsuko Uchida, piano. Philips 420 949; CD and cassette. The best things here are the palpable enthusiasm and the broad structural grasp that gives an unusually strong sense of arrival to the returns of big themes (especially the rising motif of the B minor finale, which wells up splendidly). The actual pianism is sometimes a little restricted in tonal palette, sometimes a little brittle; for some reason this seems more bothersome than it did when Ms. Uchida gave a joy ous, headlong rendition of the Third Sonata at Tully Hall last season. Perhaps the close miking has something to do with it; as so often in current piano recordings, the fortes are harsh and the bass overbalances the treble (try the big chords at the end of the exposition in the Second Sonata's opening movement). I enjoyed the Second less than the Third; the Funeral March sounds all too dogged, and its trio lacks lyricism. But the first movement of the Third has adventurous, expansive brio that I associate with this interesting artist's best work. - Will Crutchfield Alkan: Organ Works Kevin Bowyer, organ. Nimbus NI 5089; CD only. Charles-Valentin Alkan (1813-88) was a flamboyant and visionary composer of piano music, and from the evidence here, his organ music is just as flabbergasting. Although an organist in his youth, Alkan produced only a single work specifically for organ - a set of eight tantalizingly brief preludes. But the more substantial ''13 Prayers'' -with their astonishing harmonies, strange and often whimsical melodic de velopments and keyboard fireworks - are probably even more striking in their organ guise than in their original form for the now obsolete pedal piano. Still more spellbinding is the brilliant organ transcription of Alkan's two-piano ''Impromptu on the Luther Chorale,'' played with all the spectacular dazzle it can withstand by the superb British organist Kevin Bowyer. With the Salisbury Cathedral organ vividly captured, this disk should appeal to organ fanciers as well as to anyone with a taste for wonderfully extravagant music. - Mark Swed Stravinsky: Les Noces (1917 and 1923 versions) Alla Ablaberdyeva, soprano; Ludmilla Ivanova, mezzo; Alexey Martinov, tenor; Anatoly Safiulin, bass; Slovak Philharmonic Chorus; Savaria Symphony (1917); Adrienne Hauser, Zoltan Kocsis, Pi-Hsien Chen and Imre Rohmann, pianos, Amadinda Percussion Ensemble (1923); conducted by Peter Eotvos. Hungaroton HCD 12989; CD and LP. The composition of ''The Wedding'' cost Stravinsky much time and trouble. Though brilliantly conceived and seemingly spontaneous and inevitable, the roiling instrumentation of four pianos and percussion (1923) grew out of numerous false starts, including a com plete version with chamber orchestra (1917). Hungaroton offers that draft alongside the finished product, and it's fascinating to hear them side by side in comparable performances. This folkish work places scant premium on vocal refinement, and receives little here. The playing from both ensembles is gritty and incisive. Unfortunately, the performances together total only 46 1/2 minutes - perhaps not enough to attract the nonspecialist. - James R. Oestreich POP/JAZZ Harry Connick Jr.: 'When Harry Met Sally . . .' Columbia 45319; all three formats. The 21-year-old pianist and singer from New Orleans moves into challenging new territory on his third album with renditions of ''It Had to Be You,'' ''But Not for Me,'' ''Don't Get Around Much Anymore'' and ''I Could Write a Book,'' modeled after Frank Sinatra's recordings with Nelson Riddle. While Mr. Connick sounds a bit daunted by his co-producer Marc Shaiman's theatrically flashy arrangements, he still shows abundant promise as a band singer. Rounding out the album are smaller-scaled, jazzier versions of pop standards. Two of the best cuts are a lilting solo piano version of ''Autumn in New York'' and a voice-and- piano rendition of ''Where or When,'' which contains the disk's most relaxed, fluent crooning. The album is another step forward for an immensely gifted talent. - Stephen Holden New Winds: 'The Cliff' Sound Aspects 025 (import); all three formats. New Winds make fringes their home. The trio of Ned Rothenberg and J. D. Parran on saxophones, clarinets and flute, and Robert Dick on flutes and piccolo push their instruments beyond conventional technique, using double-stops, eerie whistle tones, percussive key thumps and cutting overblown notes. And New Winds can improvise or achieve a chamber-group precision, working on the fringe where the textures and twitterings of classical new music meet the sultriness of jazz. Collective improvisations and band members' compositions share the album with pieces by Duke Ellington and Ornette Coleman, balancing the earthy and the otherworldly. - Jon Pareles Joe Henderson: 'Inner Urge' Blue Note/CDP 7841892; CD only. ''Inner Urge,'' recorded in 1964, is one of the more brilliant documents from the period. The album seethes with intelligent experimentation, a reminder that the 1960's were full of political and esthetic promise as well as excitement. Backed by McCoy Tyner on piano, Bob Cranshaw on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, the saxophonist contrasts a granitelike bluntness with elliptical flowing lines. He'll break up a line with stuttering accents, drop a full-bloomed melody in the middle of things and then race off in sweeping be-bop lines. As a composer, he merged prairie-wide modal harmonies with sophisticated, rapidly changing harmonies that have made his tunes essential learning vehicles for fledgling jazz musicians, and a major part of jazz history. - Peter Watrous Jason and the Scorchers: 'Thunder and Fire' A&M 5264; all three formats Few bands can deliver clanging, stomping, crunching flat-out rock-and-roll like Jason and the Scorchers. The Nashville- based band uses three decades of technology to soup up its Chuck Berry twang, as Jason Ringenberg sings his pugnacious lyrics in a proud drawl and Warner Hodges plays zooming, skidding lead guitar lines; Mr. Ringenberg finds new ways to declare love, lust and automotive cravings. The slower songs lean toward self-consciously poetic soul-of-the-South pronouncements, but the band has regained its sense of proportion with its fourth album. Whenever pretension peeks out, another rock song blasts it away. - J. P.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

My first route was a two-mile loop. On the first day, aiming for distance, not speed, I did the first almost completely downhill mile at a really slow trot. A slight rise in the middle almost stopped me, but it was short and I got over it. The second mile was rolling, ending with an uphill run back to the starting point. That first day I ran out of gas as soon as the downhill ended. Each run I tried to go a bit farther.

The authors of this irritating novel are publishing veterans - he's the president of the Hearst Trade Book Group, she's a former editor - so presumably they know something about the world of talent agencies, which forms the backdrop for their breathless account of the glitzy activities of New York and Hollywood deal makers. Unfortunately, the story is trite, its dialogue filled with cliches and its heroine so obtuse it seems unlikely she could run a hot-dog stand, let alone ''the biggest and most powerful talent agency in the world.'' Allison Morton, a beautiful, young Harvard Law graduate, becomes the head of Universal Talent Management when her Uncle Gus dies of a heart attack after a mysterious fire in his home. In the course of fighting off a hostile takeover attempt by the sinister Frame family, Allison discovers that she's adopted - and that someone is trying to kill her. As ''Talent'' proceeds, Allison repels the Frames, unmasks her biological mother and the would-be killer and is reunited with her boyfriend, a gorgeous New York playwright who was alienated from her by the machinations of a treacherous U.T.M. subordinate. Since Allison is basically a stick figure in designer clothes, as are most of the other characters, it's unlikely that readers will be terribly thrilled by her triumph over adversity. The novel's implausible plot twists and relentless dropping of famous names finally become so tiresome that only those with an insatiable appetite for show biz sagas will find ''Talent'' worth their while.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

In 1949, Arthur Drayton, a postal worker, was suspended from his job after 25 years of service. His offense: the refusal to disassociate himself from an organization deemed subversive by President Harry S. Truman's loyalty boards. Mr. Drayton's account of political discrimination is included in ''It Did Happen Here,'' a collection of oral histories compiled by Bud Schultz, who teaches education and psychology at Trinity College in Hartford, and Ruth Schultz, an independent scholar. The turbulent course of the 20th century is traced in the harrowing stories of people like Jack Miller, who survived the 1916 Everett Massacre, in which at least half a dozen members of the Industrial Workers of the World were gunned down by local authorities in Everett, Wash., and Chuck McDew, the civil rights leader, who was beaten and jailed for his activities in the 1960's. Violations of constitutional rights are Government-sanctioned, the editors write, and perpetrated behind a ''veil of patriotism.'' It is their contention that repression is not confined to periods of political frenzy. Witness the case of the leftist writer Margaret Randall, whose deportation was ordered in 1986 under the McCarran-Walter Act. For all the outrages described in this book, it is not defeat that resounds but a steadfast defiance and the knowledge that the fight for civil liberties is a continuous one.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

The 1938 summer season is well under way at Friend-Indeed, a Bible camp in the northeastern corner of Connecticut, when a new boy, Leo Joaquim, arrives to take the place relinquished by another camper, Stanley Wagner (a definite ''spud'' according to fellow campers), who has departed under awkward circumstances. Hopes are high that Leo, an odd, gangly, unathletic orphan who plays the violin and collects spiders for a hobby, will do his bunkmates proud in their quest to win the camp's all-around trophy, given to the cabin that wins the most prizes in the summer's many competitions. And so, thrust into an unfamiliar world inhabited by kids with nicknames like Tiger and Bomber, a spoiled rich-kid counselor named Reece (Heartless) Hartsig and Ma and Pa Starbuck, the benign couple who run the camp, Leo does his best to fit in. Only his best isn't quite good enough. Soon Leo, who quickly earns the sobriquet Wacko, finds himself in the midst of what some might call a season in hell. In ''The Night of the Moonbow'' (a title that refers not only to the lake adjoining the camp but also to a local legend, complete with Indian warrior and maiden), Thomas Tryon, the author of ''Harvest Home'' and ''The Other,'' presents a tale that begins as an appealing account of life at summer camp and the trials and tribulations of a square peg trying to fit into a round hole. Mr. Tryon has a wonderful ear, and his writing is crisp and evocative. Unfortunately, in midstream he changes canoes, apparently feeling that his readers expect a touch of terror and suspense. This is provided by a secret concerning Leo's mother's death that the boy has so far managed to repress. But the secret and the tragic events its revelation sets in motion are neither particularly horrifying nor unexpected, and so a novel that began very promisingly falls somewhat flat in the end. Nevertheless, thanks in no small part to Thomas Tryon's skill as a writer, there is still plenty of offbeat fun to be had at Camp Friend-Indeed.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

''We are talking about hundreds of customers and thousands of trades,'' said Anton R. Valukas, the United States Attorney in Chicago. The Government said customers' profits were skimmed by traders through practices like falsifying records and arranging secret trades. Reports said that 14 of the indicted traders had agreed to plead guilty and cooperate with investigators. More indictments are expected. *",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

us,SURREALISM FIT THE FASHION,"The fashion photographs in MAN RAY: BAZAAR YEARS (Rizzoli, Cloth, $35; Paper, $19.95), shot for Harper's Bazaar between 1934 and 1942, meld commercialism with artistry of uncommon power. These pictures, most of which have not been reproduced since their original publication, do more than display pretty models filling out fabrics and styles by such celebrated designers as Chanel, Schiaparelli and Mainbocher. These are pictures to dream about - images that promote desires and provoke fantasies and emotions. And sometimes, like fractured dreams, they tell stories. A man's hand reaching for a fallen handkerchief, the closeness of a woman's jeweled sandal - bits of a larger drama - foretell an intimacy about to happen. Many of the photos, assembled by John Esten, the former art director at Harper's Bazaar, show women poised for sleep or nocturnal adventure in gauzy nightgowns and negligees, and that seems fitting. Isn't fashion itself the stuff of dreams, manufactured fantasies for the consumer? A model reclining as if asleep, in a beach coat that looks like pajamas - dreaming of what? Possibly the giant female lips floating in a landscape above her (the lips and landscape are actually one of Man Ray's Surrealist paintings). Man Ray was also a great innovator. A nude outlined in what appears to be ultraviolet light, his ''Rayographs'' - produced by placing objects on or near sensitized paper and exposing them to light - and his transmission of fashion silhouettes from Paris to New York via radio waves are just a few examples. Fashions may come and go, but the freshness of these classic photographs even today makes it clear why the artist's influence on fashion photography has spanned the decades.",1989-08-06T05:00:00+0000

What the sea took away in other places, it gave back on Fire Island. This is because of a phenomenon known as the longshore current, which comes from the angle of the waves.

She has the compassion to understand why that must be so and the good sense to give him up while he is still in love with her.

But the immediate noticeable impact is likely to be confined to somewhat lower interest rates for a relative few. The main short-term effect, analysts said, is likely to be the disappearance of premium rates that venturesome depositors have enjoyed at institutions in areas where the industry's distress has been greatest, mainly in Texas. [ Page D1. ] COMPANIES The stock of UAL soared 28 percent, or $46.25, after the company said it had received a takeover proposal from Marvin Davis, who earlier this year tried to buy Northwest Airlines. The offer is thought to be for more than $200 a share; the company's stock closed at $210.75 in heavy trading. The market's reaction suggested that there were expectations of a bidding war for UAL, parent of United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier. [ D1. ] Warren E. Buffett purchased $358 million of USAir's convertible preferred stock, in a move that gives the company protection against a takeover. [ D2. ] After years of fare wars, the nation's airlines are thriving. But for the millions of Americans who fly, the outlook is less cheerful.

us,RESULTS PLUS,"YACHTING Lack of Wind Stalls Fastnet Fleet: A lack of wind left the nearly 280 yachts in the Fastnet Race, the most prestigious portion of the Admiral's Cup regatta, floundering yesterday in the waters off the southwestern coast of England, having covered less than 150 miles in 24 hours. It was one of the slowest starts ever in the Fastnet Race, between England and Ireland, and many of the boats had to drop anchor overnight to avoid being carried in the wrong direction by tides. The 40 boats remaining in the regatta are participating in the Fastnet event. Denmark's Andelsbanken was leading the fleet on the water, with Japan's Will and Britain's Jamarella close behind. But the American one-ton yacht Sagacious V was leading on corrected time and the American 50-footer Great News was second. Sagacious had been a disappointment during the first five races in the Admiral's Cup. The Americans, in fifth place at the start of the Fastnet, faced a tough battle to reach the overall leader, Britain. (AP) TENNIS D'Allesandro Takes Lead: Laura D'Allesandro, an amateur from Spring Lake Heights, N.J., shot a one-under-par 71 to gain the first-round lead yesterday in the Metropolitan Women's Open championship in Locust Valley, L.I. Susie Berdoy, a pro at the Ridgeway Country Club in White Plains, is second with 72. The tournament concludes today. Rain Suspends Play: Rain suspended the only two matches to get under way yesterday in the Swiss Army Knife Open tournament in Livingston, N.J., forcing postponement of the remainder of the day's schedule. Nduka Odizor of Nigeria held a 6-3, 1-2 lead over Philippe Poch of France and Jeff Klaparda was ahead of John Ross, 6-4, 2-2, when rain stopped play at the Newark Tennis Academy. (AP) HORSE RACING Audio Cassette Wins: Audio Cassette came from off the pace to score a 1 1/2-length victory over Packett's Landing yesterday in the $89,550 Albany Handicap for 3-year-olds at Saratoga Race Track. The victory was the fourth in five career starts for Audio Cassette, who was ridden by Jerry Bailey and carried 113 pounds. The son of Talc-Cassette covered the mile and an eighth over a fast track in 1:52 to earn $53,730 for the owner, James F. Edwards.(AP)",1989-08-08T05:00:00+0000

Yobes Ondieki of Kenya won the 1,500 meters, but ran the distance relatively slowly in 3:39.03. Andre Cason of the United States, the world junior record-holder, won the 100 meters in 10.27. Calvin Smith was second at 10.37.

(AP) TENNIS Yzaga and Pugh Upset: Sixth-seeded Jaime Yzaga of Peru and three other seeded players were upset yesterday at the United States Hardcourts tournament in Indianapolis. Joining Yzaga on the sideline were No. 11 Jim Pugh, No. 12 Pieter Aldrich of South Africa, and No. 7 Peter Lundgren of Sweden. Yzaga, who received a first-round bye, was beaten, 6-2, 6-3, by Johan Carlsson of Sweden in second-round play. A tired Pugh strained his lower back in a 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 loss to Simon Youl of Australia. A qualifer, Barry Moir of Atlanta, No. 226 in the world, eliminated Aldrich, who is ranked No. 71, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Last night, fifth-seeded Jay Berger defeated Michael Robertson, 6-3, 6-3, and Lundgren was beaten by Andrew Sznajder of Canada, 6-3, 6-4.

Chang, the French Open winner and the fifth-ranked player in the world, lived up to his billing in the 22-minute opening set, losing just 4 points on his serve and recording two service breaks on Warner, ranked 199th. But in the second set, the 6-foot-5-inch Warner got his big serve going and the 17-year-old Chang of Placentia, Calif., had lots of trouble handling it. In the final set, Chang dropped back 10 feet behind the baseline to receive serve and that proved the difference. In another match last night, second-seeded Brad Gilbert defeated Tim Wilkison, 6-4, 6-1. In the afternoon, seventh-seeded Paul Annacone won a marathon second-set tie breaker and defeated Tim Pawsat, 4-6, 7-6, 6-4.

us,BUSINESS DIGEST,"THE ECONOMY A fundamental remaking of the savings industry was quickly set in motion as President Bush signed legislation intended to end years of staggering losses. Mr. Bush expressed pride in the bill passed by Congress early Saturday, saying it would ''put in place permanent reforms.'' The law calls for outlays of $166 billion over 10 years to close and merge insolvent institutions, and many more billions after that. [ Page A1. ] The nation's economy continues to grow slowly, the Federal Reserve said in its ''beige book'' on economic conditions. [ D2. ] COMPANIES Responding to Marvin Davis's offer, UAL's board said it would explore ''all possible financial and strategic alternatives.'' Mr. Davis said he was encouraged, and some analysts said United Airlines was now in play. Even before the announcement, UAL stock again rose sharply, climbing $24.625, to $243.875. [ D1. ] Bonwit Teller and B. Altman stores filed for bankruptcy protection, along with the American arm of Hooker, the Australian developer. The company hopes to open merchandise pipelines and to obtain relief from pressing debts. [ D1. ] Citicorp gave Hong Kong a vote of confidence, saying it would arrange $667 million in loans to build two office towers. It also said it might take an equity stake in the project. [ D1. ] Anchor Glass received an offer of $280 million, or $20 a share, offer from a large Mexican glass company, and its shares soared 61 percent, or $7.50, to $19.75. [ D1. ] Stock in Paramount Communications rose $2.50, to $62.125, on rumors that Cablevision's chairman, Charles Dolan, or Chris-Craft Industries was accumulating stock. [ D19. ] Chase Medical is to be delisted from the American Stock Exchange, the Amex said, because more than 90 percent of its shares are owned by its chairman, Stanley Chase, his family and the Securities Settlement Corporation. [ D4. ] Gtech agreed to be acquired by an investor group consisting of its management and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, in a deal valued at $16.625 a share, or a total of $290 million. [ D4. ] Coca-Cola completed the acquisition of a French bottling and distribution subsidiary of Pernod-Ricard, ending a dispute over the marketing of Coke products in France. [ D4. ] MARKETS The scandal in the commodity tradings pits appears to have dealt a serious blow to the prestige of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but it is unlikely to put much of a dent in their business. [ D1. ] The Dow Jones transportation average soared 50.49 points, to 1,406.29, once again driven by UAL, which jumped 24 5/8, to 243 7/8. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 13.09 points, to 2,686.08. [ D8. ] A disappointing auction of 10-year notes sent prices of outstanding Treasury notes and bonds lower, and dealers questioned whether interest rates would have to move still higher to generate demand for today's sale of $9.75 billion of 30-year bonds. [ D15. ] Yields of money market mutual funds were down for the week ended yesterday. [ D13. ] Corn futures were lower and soybeans and wheat futures finished higher as traders maintained narrow price ranges in advance of the Agriculture Department's survey of crop production for the year.

Stars are followed by the date of original publication; restaurants mentioned in Diner's Journal do not have stars. Prices are current. American Festival Cafe * (July 27, 1984), 20 West 50th Street (246-6699) - Rockefeller Center's plaza is the unlikely camping spot for a 100-year-old chuckwagon as the American Festival Cafe features San Antonio-style barbecue on the current menu. The wagon and its companion meat smokers, installed next to the fountain, were brought from Texas to lend authenticity and atmosphere to the $15.95 three-course dinner. Hand-shaped corn cakes topped with guacamole, salsa and cheese start the menu. Barbecue choices are brisket, pork ribs, smoked longhorn sausage or combination plate ($16.95) accompanied by beans, cole slaw and barbecue sauce. Dessert is pie, either pecan or deep-dish peach with ice cream. Barbecue menu through Sept. 10 at dinner only. Open 4 P.M. to midnight Tuesdays through Saturdays, until 10 P.M. Sundays and Mondays. Gage & Tollner * (July 7, 1989), 372 Fulton Street, Brooklyn (718-875-5181) - A new owner and a new menu designed by a renowned Southern cook have revived this Brooklyn landmark. The turn-of-the-century room remains the same: gas-fueled chandeliers light the dark mahogany panels and long rows of linen-covered tables. The house specialties include brisket of beef, pan-fried quail with spoon bread, and crab cakes with red rice and cole slaw. For a good shellfish starter, try cornmeal-coated fried oysters. Appetizers are $4 to $9.50, main courses $12 to $19.50. Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; dinner: 5 to 10 P.M. Mondays through Thursdays, until 11 P.M. Fridays, and 4 to 11 P.M. Saturdays. Closed Sundays in August. Jezebel ** (Aug. 28, 1987), 630 Ninth Avenue, at 45th Street (582-1045) - This theater-district restaurant is a stage set in itself, with the expansive room decorated with wicker and antiques, palms and piano shawls. Among the recommended starters are smothered garlic shrimp and Charleston she-crab soup. The chef's main course specialties include Southern fried chicken, Carolina shrimp creole, and roast chicken with waffles. Strawberry shortcake, made with fresh baking-powder biscuits, is the real thing. Appetizers are $5 to $7, main courses $14.75 to $21.75. Dinner daily at 6, 8 and 10:30 P.M. seatings. Sylvia's Diner's Journal (Nov. 4, 1983), 328 Lenox Avenue, at 126th Street (996-0660) - Extremely popular with both residents and tourists, this bustling restaurant dishes out calorie-packed main courses of fried chicken, smothered pork chops, barbecued ribs and short ribs of beef. Corn bread, collard greens and potato salad are the accompaniments. Sylvia's also serves a good sweet potato pie. Main courses are $6 to $10.95. Open 7:30 A.M. to 10:30 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays and, 1 to 7 P.M. Sundays. Yellow Rose Cafe Diner's Journal (May 11, 1984), 450 Amsterdam Avenue, at 81st Street (595-8760) - This popular source for Texas-style cooking is owned by a native of Fort Worth; the narrow space was recently expanded to include a bar (with converted Western-saddle bar stools) and seating area. Some New Yorkers get their first taste of chicken-fried steak here. The Southwestern oddity is well-pounded cube steak dipped in flour and buttermilk batter, then fried like chicken. Other choices are barbecued chicken or ribs; Southern fried chicken, and Mexican salad in a flour tortilla ''bowl.'' Side dishes include mashed potatoes with cream gravy, fried okra and butter beans. Appetizers are $3 to $5, main courses $8.25 to $11.50. Open noon to 11:30 P.M. daily.",1989-08-11T05:00:00+0000

Very fresh corn will have a dewy moistness about the husk and silk, and the stem will not be brown. Refrigerating corn until cooking will help keep it in good condition. Sugar or milk (or both) can be added to the water if the corn is boiled, but they will have little effect if the corn is boiled as briefly as it should be. Here are some tips on cooking fresh corn. Method Preparation Timing Boiling Remove husks and silk Place in boiling water to cover; when water returns to boil, remove from heat; let stand 5 to 20 minutes. Grilling Turn back husks, remove silk, Grill over or in hot rewrap corn in husks and soak coals 20 to 30 minutes. in cold water 30 minutes.

Other indexes, like the Standard & Poor's 500, reached record levels in late July. At times last week, the Dow did trade above the peak of 2,722.42 it set on Aug. 25, 1987. And it did manage one close above 2,700, when it finished Thursday at 2,712.63. But on Friday the Dow ended at 2,683.99, up 30.54 for the week. The reasons given for the rally included heavy corporate-takeover activity, a revival of computerized program trading and an environment of declining inflation and lower interest rates in an economy that is growing slowly but is, nonetheless, growing. The Dow transportation index had a record one-day surge on Monday, when a bid for United Airlines was announced. The index jumped 94.06 points that day, to 1,344.06. Bond yields had a tumultuous week. On three days, the Treasury auctioned new securities, causing enough nervousness to push the yield on the 30-year bond up to 8.14 percent.",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Beth Lordan paints the small-town atmosphere of her first novel in sumptuous prose; she refers, for example, to the ''wide generosity of the day's breeze,'' the ''cicada-laden silence.'' Out of this setting a potentially compelling story struggles to rise. A young woman named Rachel, recently widowed, returns home with her big-city ways, catching the eyes of the local men and the ire of their wives. She has come back to care for her much-troubled brother, Jacob, who has suffered an emotional breakdown after the death of their mother; he cleans the house obsessively and walks, often cursing along the way, ''like a pack of dogs was worrying at him from all sides.'' But rich prose alone does not a novel make, and Ms. Lordan's characters are weighted down not only by small-town intrigues but also by her writing, whose artfulness becomes at times self-conscious, even confusing. The novel could withstand these excesses if Jacob evolved into a real character. A figure who can be placed in that literary tradition that attributes to derangement special lyrical powers, he takes to the roads at nightfall, his lunacy charged with allure, his ''sweet singing voice . . . mysterious and beckoning.'' But by the end of ''August Heat,'' the mythic hold Jacob's madness has on the townspeople feels like Ms. Lordan's writing itself: elaborate, but not wholly genuine.",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"STEVIE SMITH: A Biography. By Frances Spalding. (Norton, $19.95.) ''Stevie Smith is an unusually difficult subject for biography.'' So begins this book by Frances Spalding, the British biographer of Roger Fry and Vanessa Bell. The problem is that there is not much to go on: days spent as a secretary in London, evenings eked out in a household of spinsters in a suburb so outer it was virtually outre. Stevie Smith (1902-1971) seemed to have been doomed from day one to live life most fully in her work. Through ''Novel on Yellow Paper,'' Ms. Spalding traces the writer's childhood and creative influences; between the lines of her poetry and short stories, she uncovers her arguments with Christianity, her early passions and her later, more circumspect affairs. The personality that emerges is one of contradiction, an eccentric whose mantel of naivete served as both protection and weapon. This is the sort of sensitive, scholarly work that is important simply because it has been undertaken, and will no doubt delight Stevie Smith devotees by being well carried out. For the lay reader, though, the book is too respectful to make good reading. Why, with such obvious talents, did Smith choose to remain unmarried and solitary? That is what her friends wondered, and Ms. Spalding does, too; then, with typically British tact, she simply calls it rather astonishing, and leaves it at that. For all the careful detail, this biography never seems to close in on the central mystery of this life: what made Stevie Smith so afraid of it to begin with?",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"HORTENSE IS ABDUCTED. By Jacques Roubaud. Translated by Dominic Di Bernardi. (Dalkey Archive, $19.95.) A dark Parisian night, an eerie mansion, midnight bells. A shot rings out and a life ends. A conventional detective story? No, no, a significant 37 times no. Although ''Hortense Is Abducted'' is a mystery with a plot literally as intricate as a sestina, its real fascination lies in Jacques Roubaud's conversational asides, inside jokes and self-referential word play. What detective story, for example, makes allusions to Monte Carlo computer simulations, Bertrand Russell's barber paradox and the philosopher Saul Kripke's concept of a rigid designator? The story features Hortense, who is a Madame Bovary parody; six almost identical-looking princes from the imaginary country of Poldevia; a cat who communicates with his whiskers; ''twins'' with different birthdays and different fathers; an innkeeper obsessed with infinity; and an assortment of standard Gallic types. It is appealing even if (or maybe because) many of its jokes are a little puerile. Some of the book's allusions probably resonated better with its French audience, but most work fairly well in English - and a few, I suspect, are scarcely comprehensible (despite Dominic Di Bernardi's adept translation) in either language. A member of France's Oulipo school of experimental, quasi-mathematical literature, Mr. Roubaud includes within his novel querulous letters to his publisher, as well as logic and number puzzles. Also a good deal of enjoyment. By the way, I'm not revealing much if I tell you that the murder victim is a dog.",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME VIDEO/NEW RELEASES: NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"Patty Hearst 1988. Media Home Entertainment. 1 hour, 48 minutes. $89.95. Laser disk (Image Entertainment), $39.95. Closed captioned. R. Though made on a comparatively modest budget, this is a beautifully produced movie, seen entirely from Patty Hearst's limited point of view - stylized at times, utterly direct and both shocking and grimly funny. Natasha Richardson is ''absolutely smashing'' in the title role, with not a gesture or word wasted. Paul Schrader's direction avoids imposing any kind of reassuring order on the harrowing, real-life story of the Hearst publishing company heiress in her entanglements with the Symbionese Liberation Army. A study in the fragility of personality, this is a ''a model of swift, spare, unsentimental film making about a character who can never be known . . . and about a specific time and circumstances that, with hindsight, seem incredible.'' (Vincent Canby) Tap 1989. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video. 1:50. $89.95. LD (Image), $39.95. CC. PG-13. Written and directed by Nick Castle, the son of a choreographer who collaborated with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, and starring Gregory Hines, a fine, sinuous dancer, this should have been the kind of superior movie that evokes the exhilaration of dance; instead, it just talks about it. The supporting cast includes seven of the greatest tap specialists still alive - Harold Nicholas, Jimmy Slyde, Sandman Sims, Bunny Briggs, Steve Condos, Arthur Duncan and Pat Rico - as well as the 14-year-old Savion Glover (of Broadway's ''Black and Blue'') and the beautiful actress-singer-dancer Suzzanne Douglas. But almost every time the film gets around to the dancing, it cuts away to pursue the romantic melodrama that passes for a story. '' 'Tap,' according to the production notes, 'is more than a pretty musical spiced with tap dancing.' It sure is, and that's what's wrong with it.'' (Canby) The Wash 1988. Academy Entertainment. 1:34. $79.95. Not rated. Set in a Japanese section of San Jose, Calif., this story of an older couple's painful separation and funny new romances is less about any ethnic community than it is about confused feelings between two individuals, played by Nobu McCarthy (Masi) and Mako (Nobu). The great strength of the film, written by Philip Kan Gotanda from his own play, is that, through Masi, who has left her husband but still stops by every week to do his laundry, we see the overbearing Nobu sympathetically, as the victim of his own intolerance. Though it threatens at times to slide into cliches, the picture is emotionally honest at core and blessed with first-rate performances across the board. In its best moments it is ''a triumph of intelligent acting and film making.'' (Caryn James) The Burbs 1989. MCA Home Video. 1:42. $89.95. LD, $34.98. PG. This is a big unfurnished movie about some very small characters living in a suburbia that is consciously designed to look like sitcom land. Tom Hanks, Bruce Dern and Carrie Fisher, as suburbanites loudly suspicious of a weird household of new neighbors, do nothing here to bolster their reputations. For a while the movie threatens to become a minor plea on behalf of people who do not conform, but in the end, ''the best thing that can be said for Joe Dante, the director . . . , and Dana Olsen, who wrote the script, is that they don't try to stuff 'The Burbs' with a worthy message. The movie is as empty as something can be without creating a vacuum.'' (Canby) I Am the Law 1938. RCA/Columbia. 1:23. $69.95. Not rated. When this film was released, B. R. Crisler of The Times found Edward G. Robinson ''slightly miscast'' as a beloved law professor drafted into service as a special prosecutor against the rackets: ''He, or his authors, really didn't have to pull that smoking-pipe-in-the-pocket stuff on us, his old friends, who are all for him, so long as he keeps his place. And that place, we can't help feeling, is sociologically on the other side of the tracks.'' Wendy Barrie, too, is ''simply too charming and well-mannered as an ex-newspaper woman higher-up in the rackets.'' At that, the film was ''still the liveliest melodrama in town. . . . Somebody is kayoed, rubbed out, arrested or blown up, during every five or ten minutes of the action, and anybody who can sit through a series of such incidents without a sphygmometric reaction - even if it is only a movie - is just abnormal. We recommend it as a practically sure cure for low blood pressure.''",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Susan Isaacs' novel about a Wall Street secretary who becomes a spy in Nazi Germany is ''not just a 1940's period piece, but as close to a 1940's movie as a book can get,'' Anne Tolstoi Wallach said in The Book Review last year. ''It's like the kind of big, exciting movie we loved best then, in which someone pretty much like us takes incredible risks for unimpeachable motives and wins just what we wanted.'' IN SEARCH OF J. D. SALINGER, by Ian Hamilton. (Vintage, $8.95.) The final pages of ''Franny and Zooey,'' with all the meditations on the evils of ego and fame, seem to make it pretty clear why J. D. Salinger chose to slip through a tear in the Veil of Maya and disappear into the silence of New Hampshire. But his relentless efforts to block publication of Ian Hamilton's story of his life appeared most un-Zenlike. This very unauthorized biography is a ''rich and subtly dramatic book,'' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said in The Times last year. Ian Hamilton ''has conjured a substantial portrait more or less out of thin air, and it has much to recommend it to a public also hungry to possess the famously elusive J. D. Salinger.'' SWORD POINT, by Harold Coyle. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) Antagonized by the two great Satans, the Soviet Union and the United States, Iran decides to end it all with a nuclear Armageddon. Last year our reviewer, John Glenn, said, ''Mr. Coyle knows soldiers, and he understands the brotherhood-of-arms mystique that transcends national boundaries.'' DARKNESS AT NIGHT: A Riddle of the Universe, by Edward Harrison. (Harvard University, $12.95.) With an infinite universe presumably filled with stars in every direction, why is the sky black and not blazing at night? ''Mr. Harrison has an answer,'' Timothy Ferris wrote in The Book Review in 1987, ''but to state it here seems as unfair as giving away the final chapter of a mystery story.'' HER MOTHER'S DAUGHTER, by Marilyn French. (Ballantine, $5.95.) Despite their good intentions, four generations of daughters find it impossible not to repeat the mistakes their mothers made. ''Though 'Her Mother's Daughter' suffers from problems that are often found in sprawling page-turners . . . Ms. French continues to write about the inner lives of women with insight and intimacy,'' Alice Hoffman said here in 1987. ''What she's given us this time is a page-turner with a heart.'' ON ACCOUNT OF SEX: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945-1968, by Cynthia Harrison. (University of California, $10.95.) A historian of the women's movement explains why there was a decades-long dark ages between the suffrage movement of the 1920's and the feminism of the 1960's. Last year our reviewer, Deirdre English, said this ''perceptive new volume . . . focuses on the deep conflicts among women that shaped women's politics from the mid-1940's to the mid-60's.'' SILVER, by Hilma Wolitzer. (Ivy, $4.95.) On her silver wedding anniversary a household-hints columnist who always wanted to be a poet decides to leave her husband and Long Island for the writer's life in New York. Though the plot feels contrived, Michiko Kakutani said in The Times last year, Hilma Wolitzer has an ''unerring sense of the daily rhythms of domestic life, [ an ] ability to describe the ordinary in terms that remake the familiar.'' NUCLEAR FEAR: A History of Images, by Spencer R. Weart. (Harvard University, $14.95.) A historian shows that the best gauge of how the public conceives and misconceives of nuclear energy, whether in a reactor or a hydrogen bomb, is in novels and movies, from ''Madame Curie'' to ''The China Syndrome.'' '' 'Nuclear Fear' is a good and useful book, an intellectual treat for anyone who still believes that there is such a thing as 'the spirit of the age,' '' Alfred Kazin said here last year. JACK OF DIAMONDS: And Other Stories, by Elizabeth Spencer. (Penguin, $6.95.) When this collection of short fiction was published last year, our reviewer, Madison Smartt Bell, said Elizabeth Spencer's strong sense of locale makes each of her stories ''substantial enough to make up an entire novel.'' STRENGTH FOR THE FIGHT: A History of Black Americans in the Military, by Bernard C. Nalty. (Free Press, $12.95.) Since the American Revolution, when Virginia slaves were offered freedom if they would fight on the side of the Crown, blacks have been treated well by the military only in time of war. ''Mr. Nalty's book suggests that it may require another war to correct the armed forces' latest mistakes,'' Russell F. Weigley said here in 1986. He ''makes optimism about his subject difficult to muster.'' MEN, by Margaret Diehl. (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $7.95.) In this novel about Stella James, a woman obsessed with the need for anonymous sex, some of the best moments come when the author explores her heroine's gallery of memories, Howard Coale said here last year. ''Stella's description of losing her virginity at 15 in a freezing New Hampshire backyard, after sitting nude in an orgone box, is particularly wonderful.'' SENATORIAL PRIVILEGE: The Chappaquiddick Cover-Up, by Leo Damore. (Dell, $4.95.) This account of the accident that killed Mary Jo Kopechne the night she left a party on Chappaquiddick Island with Senator Edward M. Kennedy is fascinating for ''its wealth of detail,'' Jo Thomas said here last year. ''Mr. Damore has re-examined many of the stories that have floated around in reporters' notebooks for years, too plausible to discard but too shaky to print, and he has unearthed new material as well.''",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Other people used their connections to serve as consultants, helping to secure subsidies or grants for clients or themselves. No Administration figures have been charged with criminal wrongdoing.

us,NONFICTION,"IMAGINING THE PAST: East Hampton Histories. By T. H. Breen. (Addison-Wesley, $19.95.) ''We are what we were even when we most passionately reject our own history,'' says T. H. Breen. The Long Island seaside community of East Hampton would seem the last place in America in danger of rejecting its past. ''Share Our Traditions,'' reads the sign in front of a local real-estate agent, and everywhere - in the style of its new homes, in the local shops, in the periodic wars against developers that flare up - can be read the persistence of the past, or, as Mr. Breen sees it, of an image of the past. Brought in as ''Resident Humanist'' to work with the East Hampton Historical Society, Mr. Breen, a professor of American history at Northwestern University, has written less a history of East Hampton than ''a book about history in East Hampton.'' Contrary to the pastoral vision of self-sufficient yeomen advanced by town historians, Mr. Breen traces in the growth and depletion of the local whaling industry a prosperous and often troubled commercial history. The author's deductions - for example, his demonstration of how lawsuits work as a means of establishing social standing in a community - are an interesting behind-the-scenes construction of how historians work. He is particularly adept at drawing broader applications from seemingly narrow issues. ''A little village had proven unable to control the petty animosities among its inhabitants that surely occurred in other towns,'' Mr. Breen observes, after surveying a 17th-century attempt by the town to align itself with Connecticut rather than with New York. ''This is a disturbing thought for anyone who believes that individuals in small groups, expressing their wills through democratic procedures and having access to resources sufficient to maintain their families, can coexist in peace and mutual understanding.''",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

us,A Congenial Chinese Newcomer,"CHINESE restaurants have traditionally offered good value for families dining out. Even today, when restaurant prices are steadily rising, this continues to be true, as Uncle Dai's, a new Chinese restaurant in downtown Stamford, demonstrates. Uncle Dai's does not put a lot of emphasis on decor. A few pictures, a lacquered screen masking flowers do their bit to dress up a long, drag storefront with red plastic chairs and booths and matching carpet. But what Uncle Dai's lacks in accouterments, it more than makes up for in the congeniality of its service. The menu is described as Sichuan-Hunan, but if you prefer really incendiary food, you will have to request it with insistence. The red-starred ''hot and spicy'' dishes are pleasantly seasoned, but in no way fiery. True to the form of so many other Chinese restaurants in Connecticut, Uncle Dai's breaks no new culinary ground. But within the framework of the all-too-familiar menu, it does a serviceable job of preparing and serving many standbys. It does add one welcome touch, illustrating its willingness to please its customers: it brings dishes in sequence, rather than serving all the appetizers, and then all the entrees at one time. We had requested sequencing the courses Chinese style so that dishes (which all the diners wanted to share) could be savored and enjoyed one or two at a time, without getting cold. Lo and behold! Uncle Dai's complied with our request, a signal that an effort it being made to please the diner, and not simply cater to the convenience of the staff. There is a long list of chef's specialties, similar to other chefs's specialties to be sure, but after trying many of them and other dishes on the regular menu, we would advise following the chef's lead. Surprisingly, they are the same price of just one or two dollars more expensive than the regular entrees. The clear winner among the entrees was dried sauteed beef Sichuan style, which had excellent flavor, and the spicy meat strips played off well against the shredded carrots. Capital chicken, tender white meat pieces with shiitake mushrooms and broccoli, needed more seasoning and additional vegetable textures to overcome its blandness even the crunchy sour taste of its watercress bed was not sufficient help. The seasoning was perfect in the sesame chicken, though - a pleasantly spiced medley of chicken chunks rolled in sesame seeds and served with al dente broccoli. Crispy prawns (jumbo shrimp) with caramelized walnuts were prepared with a light touch, as was a generous portion of sliced duck with scallions in a brown sauce. Tasty appetizers included lively seasoned Sichuan dumplings in red hot oil with a minced port filling, and well-prepared dim sum (tiny steamed dumplings filled primarily with chopped shrimp and water chestnuts). Warm noodles with sesame and hot sauce were also competently prepared. The only serious misstep was an order of scallion pancakes that tasted deep-fried to a tough, tasteless crisp. Tofu Sichuan style with minced pork, deceptively red-starred for hot and spicy, proved innocuously free of spice or flavor and was formless as well. Desserts are mnimal at Uncle Dai's - lichee, pineapple and ice cream. The fragrant pistachio ice cream was studded with pistachios and very tasty. Four appetizers and four entrees came to $54.60, with items left on the platter for the doggy bag. The tax and tip were extra. It is possible to eat for even less, as many entrees run between $6.95 to $8.95. A glass of white wine is offered without charge, as Uncle Dai's does not have a liquor license. While there is nothing exceptional about Uncle Dai's, it serves acceptable Chinese fare at prices that make it possible to feed the family and even assorted guests for modest cost. A few extras - caramelized walnuts served gratis when you arrive and fresh orange wedges and pineapple chunks accompanying forturn cookies at the meal's end - add to the sense of welcome that Uncle Dai's extends. Uncle Dai's Good 109 Atlantic Street, Stamford (between broad and Main Streets). 327-0182.

us,FICTION,"IN EXTREMIS: And Other Alaskan Stories. By Jean Anderson. (Plover/Talman, $16.95.) The Alaska of Jean Anderson's first collection of short stories is a magical place whose remoteness and harshness make its inhabitants' emotions and relationships stand out in great relief. Many of the characters in ''In Extremis'' discover this truth only after having fled other, seemingly more complicated lives in states such as Texas or California, Ohio or Michigan. But once they've come north, they find that the uncompromising quality of Alaskan existence forces them into strange alliances, bridges that are ultimately as fragile as the ice over a crevasse. The title story, for instance, is narrated by a disgruntled cook on an oil rig who falls in love with an odd young woman. On the night he attempts to seduce her, she reveals a secret that has transformed her life, and that will prevent him from ever again seeing her - or himself - in the same way. Three of the most affecting stories - ''Distance,'' ''Hitchhikers'' and ''Fixing Blame'' - also include encounters, either violent or bizarre, that permanently alter the characters' images of themselves and the people they love. Although these catalysts give Ms. Anderson's work much of its power, they are sometimes so obscure or whimsical (a woman, for example, deciding to divorce her husband because of a blessing given her by a vagrant) that they seem mere literary devices. But at its best, this collection captures the heartbreak that afflicts only those who have already traveled as far as they can go.",1989-08-13T05:00:00+0000

Nearby, some of the province's other Palladian villas - Pisani, Malinverni, Piovene, Poiana and Saraceno - nestle naturally into the landscapes. Sublime architecture, they are also brilliant sculpture. (Vicenza's villas are among 25 that are scattered throughout the larger Veneto region.) Flying high in this judgmental fourth dimension, one almost hears the music of Mozart's opera ''Don Giovanni,'' filmed at La Rotonda in 1981.

Political exiles are, arguably, the most passionately committed of all political dissidents. Unlike members of a ''loyal opposition'' seeking political reform from within a nation's borders, or refugees who attempt to create a new life in a new country, political exiles are suspended in a kind of ideological limbo. While they are removed from their homelands, their activities are all directed toward the old country with one singular goal: overthrowing the existing regime. Unfortunately, Yossi Shain's study captures little of the force that drove people into exile and caused them to dedicate their lives to their causes. ''The Frontier of Loyalty'' fails to delineate any underlying theme that ties together the groups it purports to study, such as Cuban exiles in Miami and Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. More glaringly absent is any sense of the intense human passion that drove these exiles. Mr. Shain's overuse of secondary sources may be responsible for the essentially lifeless character of this book. It originated as a doctoral dissertation and, as such, it is bogged down with attempts to fit the information into theoretical concepts. Mr. Shain, now a lecturer in political science at Tel Aviv University, apparently felt his professors looking over his shoulder.

The hard-charging Wallace, who finished second to Ricky Rudd last year after winning in 1987, survived being caught in the wrong place on a caution flag and a flat tire under the green flag to win for the fourth time this season. The victory on the 2.48-mile, seven-turn Watkins Glen International circuit was his fourth road-course victory and the 13th triumph in his Winston Cup career. Wallace crossed the finish line 1.06 seconds ahead of second-place Mark Martin, with Dale Earnhardt, Davey Allison, Bobby Hillin Jr. and Morgan Shepherd following at the end of the 90-lap, 218.52-mile event. Wallace won $56,400 after averaging 89.242 miles an hour in a race slowed by six full-course cautions for 21 laps.(AP) Mansell Wins in Budapest: In a race he described as one of his career's best, Nigel Mansell, driving a Ferrari, swept to victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest yesterday. It was the Briton's second victory this season. He started the year by winning the Brazilian Grand Prix in March. Ayrton Senna of Brazil, in his McLaren Honda, was second, followed by Thierry Boutsen of Belgium, driving a Williams Renault. Mansell finished the 77-lap race in 1 hour 49 minutes 38.650 seconds.(AP) TENNIS Filippini Overpowers Skoff: Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay overpowered Horst Skoff of Austria, 7-5, 7-6, yesterday to win the $170,000 Czechoslovak Open grand prix tournament in Prague. Skoff missed two break points in the second game of the first set and both players held their serve with powerful baseline strokes. Filippini broke Skoff in the 11th game with spectacular volleys, winning the set in 60 minutes. Filippini started coming toward the net more often in the second set, and Skoff, sending most of his passing shots wide, lost the ninth game, struggled back, but succumbed in the tie breaker.(AP) SOCCER Two-Way Tie for Second: Trinidad and Tobago tied El Salvador, 0-0, yesterday in a qualifying match for the 1990 World Cup and moved into a second-place tie with the United States in the North and Central American and Carribean region. The game was played in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It was scheduled for San Salvador but the Federation Internationale de Football Association, soccer's world governing body, ordered it played in a neutral country after disturbances by fans at the El Salvador-Costa Rica match on June 25. Costa Rica (5-2-1) has completed play in the double round-robin group with 11 points and is virtually assured of advancing to the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy. The top two teams in the region advance. The United States (2-1-1) has five points but has played one less game than Trinidad and Tobago (1-1-3). (AP)",1989-08-14T05:00:00+0000

Page A1 40 years of Communism in Poland A6 The Soviet Union reacted to Poland's movement toward a government led by non-Communists with equanimity, declaring that Polish developments were strictly an internal affair. A6 In Latvia, the small family farm is replacing collective agriculture. Under a government program, families are reinhabiting farms that were abandoned during the republic's recent decades of urbanization. A1 The fighting continued in Lebanon though its intensity has markedly decreased since last week. The Muslim side shelled four seaports, and Christian forces retaliated by bombing seaside quarters in Muslim West Beirut. A3 The Arab uprising's underground is urging Palestinians to step up their rebellion while trying to regain control of a vigilante system of justice, in leaflets distributed in the occupied territories this week. A8 Relations between Japan and China may soon return to normal. Japan dropped its recommendation to business executives not to travel in China and said it was ready to lift a freeze on economic aid projects. A9 The anniversay of Gen. Zia's death was observed by about 80,000 people who assembled at his graveside. The gathering occured without serious incident, though the government had feared otherwise. A8 For peace talks about Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Government and rebels fighting against it for nearly three decades have agreed to meet with former President Jimmy Carter. A3 In defiance of South Africa's bans imposed in a crackdown on dissent in February, opponents of apartheid said that their restricted organizations planned to resume operating. A5 National A10-18 AZT can delay the onset of AIDS in people who are infected with the virus but have no symptoms, a new study has shown, the first evidence that the drug AZT could help this group. A1 The nation's trade deficit narrowed in June to $8.2 billion, the lowest level in four and a half years, the Commerce Department reported.

In 1980 David Price, an American anthropologist, was solicited by the World Bank to assess the impact of a $1 billion development proposal on the Indians of central Brazil. The Polonoroeste project, which the World Bank helped to fund, would include the paving of a 1,000-mile highway through this remote region; its effects on the Indians promised to be dramatic. With considerable trepidation and a strong desire to aid the Indians - particularly the Nambiquara, a tribal society barely acquainted with the modern world - Mr. Price consented. ''Before the Bulldozer'' is his gripping account of that experience, which was marked by bureaucratic corruption, lack of foresight and downright ignorance at every turn. The reader follows Mr. Price through the byzantine bureaucracy of the National Indian Foundation (known as FUNAI), the Brazilian agency charged with devising an acceptable plan for allocation of resources to the Indians, then to the remote and dwindling Nambiquara settlements. The author, who contends that the Indians were viewed as mere obstructions to economic development, found the FUNAI proposal grossly inadequate. His report was virtually ignored by the World Bank, and the loan was approved. Today, much of the area has been deforested; settlers have flocked in, encouraged by the new highway, only to find their promised land practically barren; new diseases have plagued the Indians; one Nambiquara tribe has mysteriously disappeared. More than an anthropological study, Mr. Price's book is a passionate appeal to preserve cultural diversity and to re-examine the concept of development in light of the cultural and environmental havoc that frequently follows.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

In the course of his long career, Irwin Shaw seems to have almost had it all - early literary success as a socially conscious playwright and short-story writer for The New Yorker, then even greater financial success as a Hollywood screenwriter and the author of such blockbusters as ''The Young Lions'' and ''Rich Man, Poor Man.'' The richer Shaw grew, however, the lower his literary reputation fell and the glitzier his life became, leading Michael Shnayerson, in ''Irwin Shaw: A Biography,'' to see the writer's life as ''an ethical allegory, a deep and implacable struggle between art and money in mid-twentieth-century America.'' Mr. Shnayerson, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, portrays the writer as a complex personality who could be extraordinarily generous to his friends and at the same time psychologically abusive to his wife. Born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents in 1913, Shaw came of age in a modest home in Depression-era Brooklyn. He went on to lead a glamorous life, first in New York and Hollywood, then as an expatriate in Paris and Switzerland. As Shaw's womanizing escalated and his marriage deteriorated, the outwardly idyllic life at his Swiss chalet became increasingly sordid. Mr. Shnayerson, who conducted more than 200 interviews for this book, does not shy away from the squalid details of Shaw's heavy drinking and compulsive infidelity, but when told at such length, they begin to border on the voyeuristic. ''The intellect of man is forced to choose / Perfection of the life, or of the work,'' Yeats wrote. To judge by Mr. Shnayerson's cautionary account, Shaw's inner demons seem to have got the better of both the life and the work.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

It is different from team sports like baseball in that fans must identify with an individual who may disappear from the sport as quickly as it takes to count 10. While an occasional champion in a lighter weight classification, like Sugar Ray Leonard, captures fans' imaginations, it is the heavyweight division that garners most of the attention. It is on this division that Phil Berger, the boxing reporter for The New York Times, focuses in his fine book, ''Blood Season.'' Beginning in 1978, when Leon Spinks snatched the title from an aging Muhammad Ali, and taking us through the present reign of Mike Tyson, Mr. Berger charts the course of professional heavyweight boxing. Through his experienced eyes the reader begins to understand the personalities of those who pull the strings, men like the promoters Don King, Butch Lewis and Bob Arum and the manager Dennis Rappaport. These men are often far more interesting than the fighters they send into the ring. Writing knowledgeably, compassionately and with remarkable insight, Mr. Berger offers a bird's-eye view of the machinations of the sport. He is especially strong when dealing with the controversy centering on Mike Tyson; his former wife, Robin Givens; and his managers, Bill Cayton and Jimmy Jacobs. The only quibble, and it is a small one, is Mr. Berger's arch choice of referring to himself in the third person. Otherwise, he has produced a valuable, clear-headed and much needed overview of the sport.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"NEVER QUITE DEAD. By Seymour Shubin. (St. Martin's, $17.95.) There are no really likable people in Seymour Shubin's seventh novel, a tense, driven tale of a man dedicated to tracking down the murderer of a 3-year-old boy who was beaten to death and dumped on the street 20 years earlier. The searcher, a thriller writer named David Kyle, is obsessed with the hunt, partly because no one ever claimed the boy's body. The plot of ''Never Quite Dead'' is based on an actual, still unsolved crime that was committed in Philadelphia, where much of the action takes place. In addition to being a good mystery, the novel also seems grimly topical, now that national attention has become increasingly focused on child abuse. The people involved in Kyle's search are middle-aged former hippies who have made conventional lives they want to preserve - but they know what happened to the boy, and Kyle is relentless. About a third of the way into the story, it's reasonably clear who did the killing, and in the next 50 pages the motive is revealed, though not the actual circumstances. Still, Mr. Shubin is able to sustain the novel's drive with good plot twists. It's disconcerting, however, suddenly to find all these people, including Kyle, starting their sentences with words like ''Hey'' (presumably replacing ''Oh, wow!''). They also whine and cavil; occasionally Mr. Shubin also describes the hydraulics of their sex. And there's an annoying amount of inelegant narrative padding: Kyle not only makes phone calls, he sits down on the bed and taps out the numbers. He not only gets dressed, he tucks his shirt in and zips up his pants. He not only orders crab cocktail and blackened redfish, he eats them with a fork. Still, as the end of the novel approaches, the padding disappears and the action becomes rapid, convincing and compelling. Despite the story's flaws, the emotion Kyle feels for the boy is touching, and the finale comes with a fine, satisfying snap.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,New & Noteworthy,"A MASCULINE ENDING, by Joan Smith. (Fawcett, $3.50.) A feminist professor visiting Paris to deliver a paper on the oppressive nature of masculine grammatical forms stumbles across the murder of an Oxford don. This novel ''offers a pleasant look at the world of British academe,'' Newgate Callendar said in The Book Review last year. ''Ms. Smith is a literate writer who, in this accomplished novel, manages both to educate and to entertain.'' IN THE AGE OF THE SMART MACHINE: The Future of Work and Power, by Shoshana Zuboff. (Basic Books, $11.95.) Thanks to the computer, work is becoming less a matter of manipulating things than manipulating symbols, and the distinction between blue- and white-collar labor continues to dissolve. Thus it is managers more than workers who are threatened by the information revolution, a sociologist argues, and many of them will do their best to subvert it. Last year our reviewer, Robert Howard, called this book ''a work of rare originality and engrossing complexity that defines the choices new technology frames for us, even as it documents how we so often misunderstand them.'' AT RISK, by Alice Hoffman. (Berkley, $4.95.) A middle-class family must decide what to tell themselves and everybody else about an 11-year-old daughter who comes down with AIDS. ''In its simplicity and directness and restraint there is very often a compelling power'' to this novel, Jim Shepard said here last year. In LOVING RACHEL: A Family's Journey From Grief (Signet/New American Library, $4.50), another novelist, Jane Bernstein, tells how she learned to accept the fact that her daughter was born blind. ''Her prose is incisive and vivid; it rings with truth and flashes of humor,'' our reviewer, Heather Vogel Frederick, said last year. ''Parents of disabled children, or any parents for that matter, will find this an inspiring tale.'' THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN, by Tom Clancy. (Berkley, $5.95.) The author of ''The Hunt for Red October'' turns the Soviet-American ''Star Wars'' competition into another of his high-tech thrillers. ''While his prose is no better than workmanlike (the genre does not, after all, attract many budding Flauberts), the unmasking of the title's secret agent, the Cardinal, is as sophisticated an exercise in the craft of espionage as I have yet to encounter,'' Robert Lekachman said here last year. OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT: Art, Ego, and the ''Twilight Zone'' Case, by Stephen Farber and Marc Green. (Ivy, $4.95.) Two journalists recount how the director John Landis's desire for dramatic footage in the movie ''Twilight Zone'' resulted in the deaths of Vic Morrow and two child-actors. ''The assumption of their crisply reported, deeply moral book is that no movie is worth risking lives for,'' Carrie Rickey said here last year. EVA LUNA, by Isabel Allende. Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden. (Bantam, $4.95.) Moving from one surrealistic romance to another, a Latin American peasant becomes a revolutionary and a writer. Last year our reviewer, John Krich, said that this novel is excessively sentimental and operatic but that Isabel Allende shows ''an evident affection for words, compassion for the oppressed and the inarticulate, the daring ambition to draw cross sections of whole societies and a nearly maternal approach to narrative that bathes characters in a warm, milky light.'' IN AFRICA WITH SCHWEITZER, by Edgar Berman. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) A surgeon from Baltimore tells what it was like to operate in Gabon with Albert Schweitzer. ''By approaching him professionally instead of journalistically, Dr. Berman provides a refreshing perspective in this memoir about one of the inspiring figures of the 20th century,'' Herbert Mitgang said in The Times in 1986. ''Listening in on surgeons as they talk to each other under pressure can be more revealing than trying to fathom what spiritual elements make up sainthood.'' THE BODY IN THE VOLVO, by K. K. Beck. (Ivy, $3.50.) A tenureless professor running an auto repair shop is accused of murdering his old department head. ''The story is imaginative, the presentation lighthearted, the characters believable,'' Newgate Callendar said here in 1987. THE MAKING OF McPAPER: The Inside Story of USA Today, by Peter S. Prichard. (St. Martin's, $5.95.) USA Today may be the paper for people who don't have time to watch television news, but Peter S. Prichard, one of its editors, considers it a journalistic success. In 1987 The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said he was surprised at the candor of this authorized corporate biography. It is, he wrote, ''a cleverly packaged drama of brilliantly clever packaging.'' BLOOD RUN, by Leah Ruth Robinson. (Onyx/New American Library, $4.50.) An emergency room physician suspects that her colleague's drug overdose was not really suicide. Last year Alan Caruba said here that this novel by a former medical technician is ''a thrilling blend of cold medical facts and heated emotions, a portrait of a place where death is an everyday event - until, with a murderer on the staff, it strikes so close that no one is safe.'' THE SEARCH FOR OMM SETY: A Story of Eternal Love, by Jonathan Cott with Hanny El Zeini. (Warner, $9.95.) Convinced that she had lived before as an Egyptian priestess, Dorothy Eady changed her name to Omm Sety and embarked on a career as an Egyptologist, irritating colleagues with her claim that her discoveries were based on memory, not secondhand scholarship. In 1987 our reviewer, John Anthony West, said this book about her life was ''readable, fair and always lively.''",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,Body and Mind; When Baby Has a Fever,"I'VE BEEN ON THE TELEPHONE now for two hours, trying to track down a 1-year-old boy with a positive blood culture. He came to the emergency room two days ago with a fever of 103.4. The doctor diagnosed an ear infection but, before sending the child home with a prescription for amoxicillin, he drew a blood sample and sent it to the laboratory. Now, with the aid of a telephone operator enlisted in this medical emergency, I finally reach the mother at work. ''Bring the boy back in today, please,'' I say. ''We need to check his blood again.'' She does. But now he has no fever. He wants only to run back and forth at high speed in the hallway, making a noise like a fire engine. So why has all the fuss been made over a simple ear infection? Because of the fever. Meanwhile, another baby has been brought into the emergency room, and I glance at the nurse's clipboard - at the age of the child, 3 weeks, and the vital signs: the temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. I call Admitting and book a bed even before examining the baby. Why? Because of the fever. Children seem to get fevers from almost anything (execpt, contrary to common belief, teething): from colds, sore throats -and yes, ear infections. Fevers can spike high, as we say, in these very young, very hot tots. A 2-year-old with an ear infection and a temperature as high as 104? Happens all the time. But you rarely see a 12-year-old with a temperature that high. As a consequence, I often find myself reassuring parents of infants: no, the fever itself won't do him any harm, his brain won't melt (this was my own private anxiety when my own son was going through the ear-infection stage), give him Tylenol every four hours and sit him in a lukewarm bath.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

Barrowman, 20 years old, was clocked in 2 minutes 12.89 seconds in his heat at the Yoyogi National Swimming Pool on the final day of the championships. Barrowman set the world record of 2:12.90 on July 3 at the United States national championships. It was the first world record so far in the Pan Pacific meet, which began Thursday. Nick Gillingham of Britain last week equaled Barrowman's world mark of 2:12.90 in the European championship. Yesterday, Janet Evans extended her streak to 21 victories by winning the 400-meter freestyle for her third gold medal at the Pan Pacific championships in Tokyo. Evans was timed in 4 minutes 4.53 seconds, shattering her meet record of 4:09.32, set in 1987. She holds the world record of 4:03.85. Doug Gjersten of the United States won his third gold medal, swimming on the 400-meter freestyle relay team with Brent Lang, Jon Olsen and Tom Jageralso. The Americans won in 3:17.75. (AP) East German Women Win: East Germany swept all three women's races at the European championships in Bonn yesterday and Martin Lopez-Zubero of Spain scored a thrilling victory in the men's 100-meter backstroke. The Olympic champion Daniela Hunger of East Germany won the 200-meter individual medley in 2 minutes 13.26 seconds. Her teammates Anke Moehring and Astrid Strauss placed one-two in the 800 freestyle. And the East Germans won the women's 400-meter medley relay in 4:07.40, the best time this year. But the biggest surprise was the dramatic photo-finish victory by Lopez-Zubero. Ranked 88th in the world, Lopez-Zubero caught Sergey Zabolotnov of the Soviet Union, Dirk Richter of East Germany and Frank Hoffmeister of West Germany at 50 meters and charged to the finish in 56.44, a hundredth of a second ahead of Zabolotnov.(AP) Diving Titleholders Triumph: Wendy Wyland and Matt Scoggin successfully defended their United States 10-meter platform titles yesterday at the United States outdoor championships in Raleigh, N.C., with both events decided on the final dive. Wyland, of Boca Raton, Fla., outscored Courtney Nelson of Concord, Calif., by 0.18 points to earn her seventh United States platform title. The score was 412.68 to 412.50. Wendy Lian Williams, the 1989 World Cup champion from Bridgeton, Mo., was third with 387.39. Diagnosed with viral meningitis and hospitalized one month ago, Wyland had trained for only two and a half weeks before the championships. Scoggin, of Great Falls, Va., held off Scott Donie of Houston, who led by 1 point going into the final round, to win his third United States platform championship. The score was 612.45 to 605.70. Patrick Jeffrey of Madison, N.J., a 1988 Olympian, was third with 537.12.(AP) Cycling 2d Gold Medal for Longo: Jeannie Longo of France and Claudio Golinelli of Italy each won a second gold medal yesterday at the world championships in Lyon, France. Longo won the women's 30-kilometer points race after Golinelli took the men's professional keirin title. The keirin is a high-speed event with the cyclists vying for position behind a motorized pacer. Then, with 1 1/2 laps to go, the pacer goes off the track and it's a race to the finish for the final 500 meters. Golinelli previously won the professional sprint. Longo, winner of the individual pursuit title Friday, has won seven world championships since 1985. Marathon Swimming Australian Wins Again: Yesterday, as expected, Shelley Taylor Smith of Australia won her third consecutive Manhattan Island Marathon Swim, circling the island in 7 hours 32 minutes. Smith, a 28-year-old high school teacher from Perth, battled rain and cold as she won the event for the fourth time in five attempts. In 1985 she set a course record by swimming the 28.5 miles in 6 hours 12 minutes. Unlike in recent years, the eighth annual marathon was fairly close. The top five swimmers all arrived at the Battery Park finish line within 30 minutes of each other. James Barber, a 29-year-old marketing agent from Indianapolis and a fourth-place finisher last year, was second. He was followed closely by David Strasburg of Sterling, Ill., and Susie Maroney, a 14-year-old from Australia who won the United States nationals earlier this month. Karen Farnsworth, a lawyer from New York City, placed fifth. Golf Geiberger Leads by 2: Al Geiberger shot his second successive 68 yesterday to take a two-stroke lead over Mike and Dave Hill in the G.T.E. Northwest Classic in Seattle. Geiberger's total of 136 is eight under par for 36 holes on the 6,501-yard Inglewood Country Club course. Mike Hill had a 66, matching the lowest round of the day. His older brother, Dave, had a 70. Bob Erickson also shot a 66 and was tied at 139 with Frank Beard and the first-round leader, Miller Barber. Beard shot a 70, but Barber slipped to a 74. (AP) Eagle Sends Norman to Finals: Greg Norman scored an eagle on the 17th hole yesterday to advance to the finals of the International, the PGA Tour tournament in Castle Rock, Colo. A field of 72 was reduced to the 24 who will compete today. No scores are carried over. All players start at zero under the modified Stableford scoring system, in which an eagle is worth 5 points, a birdie scores 2, bogeys cost 1 point and double-bogeys and higher cost 3 points. Pars are worth nothing. It took 6 points yesterday to make the final round. Jack Nicklaus made it to the finals for the first time, on the strength of a 4-foot putt on the final hole of the Castle Rock Golf Club course, which he designed. He finished with 7 points. Norman was at 6 points through 16 holes, then hit a 6-iron second shot eight feet from the cup and made the putt for eagle-3 on the 17th. He ended with 11 points, as did Chip Beck and Ben Crenshaw. Ted Schulz led the field with 14 points.(AP) Harness Racing Victory for Mack Lobell: Mack Lobell, driven by Veijo Heuskanen of Finland in place of the dismissed John Campbell, successfully defended his title in the $100,000 Challenge Cup last night at Yonkers Raceway. Mack Lobell was coming off a third place finish in last Saturday's International Trot at Yonkers. Two days after that race, owner Jan-Erik Magnusson dismissed Campbell, Mack Lobell's regular driver until the 5-year-old was sold to Magnusson by Lou Guida and moved to Sweden. Mack Lobell covered the mile and a quarter last night in 2:34 4/5, equalling his own track record set last year at the International. Heiskanen, leaving from the rail, drove Mack Lobell to a near-perfect performance. In the stretch, Mack Lobell pulled away from the six-horse field to win by three and three-quarters lengths over Indus of Denmark, with Hans Svensson, who went on the outside to run down Senic Regal. Mack Lobell won $50,000, boosting his lifetime earnings to $2,668,318. He has 47 victories in 64 starts. As the 2-5 favorite, Mack Lobell paid $2.80, $2.10 and $2.10 for $2 across the board.(AP)",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"STRANGER AT THE GATE. By Malcolm Bosse. (Simon & Schuster, $19.95.) Indonesia in 1965 was a country in turmoil. On one side was the P.K.I., the third-largest Communist Party in the world; on the other, the country's Muslim majority and its army. Caught in the middle was the increasingly ill President Sukarno, who, in an attempt to maintain power and a semblance of order, was performing a delicate balancing act between opposing factions. Into this cauldron of escalating violence and political intrigue, Malcolm Bosse, the author of ''The Warlord,'' has tossed two Americans, Vern Gardner, a builder, and his anthropologist wife, Maggie. Vern has come to Indonesia to construct a hotel; Maggie is studying the culture. When things get too hot in riot-torn Jakarta, Maggie travels into the countryside. This separation, it turns out, is not the best prescription for a happy marriage. Away from the capital, Maggie begins to lose her identity as a Westerner, slowly donning the cloak of Javanese culture. She even falls in love with a respected dalang, an Indonesian puppet master and interpreter of the ancient Hindu religious classic, the Mahabharata. As one might imagine, this torrid affair doesn't go over well, either with the locals or with Vern. And here lies one of the major problems with ''Stranger at the Gate'': there simply aren't any surprises. Instead, Mr. Bosse, who has spent a good deal of time in Southeast Asia and has obviously studied his subject well, substitutes endless descriptive details. As a result, his characters become little more than puppets themselves. Eventually his tale, which lumbers along at an infuriatingly slow pace, sags under the sheer weight of its local color, proving that what works as a travelogue doesn't necessarily make for a successful novel.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

us,HOME ENTERTAINMENT/RECORDINGS: RECENT RELEASES,"CLASSICAL Schubert: Piano Sonatas (D. 959, 960) Melvyn Tan, fortepiano. EMI/Angel CDC 7 49631 2; CD only. We have had many period performances on records of early Beethoven and his predecessors. Now we have Schubert - two of his last three sonatas - on a replica of an 1814 Streicher fortepiano made in 1983. Both pieces are heard a half-tone below modern pitch. This Streicher is a robust-sounding instrument, much closer to the sound of today's pianos than are the Stein and Walter instruments of Mozart. Mr. Tan plays the great sonatas in a competent, not very imaginative manner. Period instrument or no, his training is of today's school, which means strict rhythms and an avoidance of personality. Thus both slow movements emerge in a distressingly matter-of-fact manner. Why should expressivity these days be incompatible with ''musicianship''? - Harold C. Schonberg Sibelius: Songs (27) Ritva Auvinen, soprano; Gustav Djupsjobacka, piano. Ondine ODE 728-2; CD only. Sibelius composed 92 songs, mostly in Swedish. Though more rarely essayed than his orchestral works, they are hardly new to disks: Jorma Hynninen recorded two exemplary sets (Finlandia and Harmonia Mundi France LP's), and Tom Krause and Elisabeth Soderstrom collaborated on the full canon (Argo LP's) to fine effect. The songs run the gamut from chilly desolation to steamy, passionate longing, with occasional bursts of frivolity to lighten the mood. The Finnish soprano Ritva Auvinen offers a healthy, rounded selection in her 70-minute recital. Her timbre is not always ingratiating, and on balance I would more highly recommend the sets listed above. Still, she does generally get to the emotional heart of the music, and Gustav Djupsjobacka proves a magnificently expressive, colorful pianist. - Allan Kozinn Dvorak: Piano Trio ('Dumky'), Piano Quintet (Op. 81) The Nash Ensemble of London. Virgin Classics 90736; CD and cassette. This is a magnificent recording. The quality of the playing is first-rate - sensitive, assured and loving - and the ensemble work is as close to perfection as one could desire. Yet for all the obvious labor that went into the Nash's achievement, the performances are as spontaneous as if both of these familiar compositions were being played for the first time. Moreover, the engineering results in clean, natural, well-balanced sound, neither artificially close nor too distant. Founded in 1965, the Nash is one of Britain's pre-eminent chamber ensembles today, and this disk amply shows why. - Barrymore L. Scherer Franck: 'Symphonic Variations'; Prelude, Chorale and Fugue; Prelude, Aria and Finale Jorge Bolet, piano; Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Riccardo Chailly (Variations). London 421 714-2; CD only. On this disk of Franck's piano music, the Prelude, Chorale and Fugue and ''Symphonic Variations'' are well known. The Prelude, Aria and Finale is seldom played. It is a long work that wanders a great deal, though the fugue is as stunning as the one in its companion piece. Mr. Bolet, who performs it as a labor of love, is in top form here. That means playing of refinement and elegance, with supple technique and nuanced sound. In the ''Symphonic Variations'' he gets solid cooperation from Mr. Chailly and the great Concertgebouw Orchestra. No better performance is available. - H. C. S. Chopin: Preludes, Op. 28 (orchestrated by Francaix) Berlin Radio Symphony conducted by Karl Anton Rickenbacher. Koch Schwann Music Mundi CD 311 060; CD and LP. It's every orchestration student's worst nightmare: having to rescore perhaps the most felicitously pianistic music ever written, utterly self-contained yet grandly expansive. For reasons best known to him, the French composer Jean Francaix embraced this thankless exercise in 1969 unforced, picking up where others had mercifully left off in the Chopin-derived ballet ''Les Sylphides.'' His inflations go beyond the gratuitous to the grotesque, with gong and snare drum inflicted on the great D flat Prelude and bass drum and cymbals heralding the B flat minor. The inept performances seal the devastation. - James R. Oestreich POP/JAZZ The Pogues: 'Peace and Love' Island 91225; all three formats. Ireland's turbulence and romance, its rage and its boozy pratfalls, echo in the music of the Pogues, who sandwich Irish traditional instruments (pennywhistle, accordion, banjo) between a rock rhythm section and Shane MacGowan's gruff, punky singing. But ''Peace and Love'' is a letdown after last year's gutsy ''If I Should Fall From Grace With God.'' The band tries to broaden its style with fuzz-toned rock and bits of klezmer and flamenco, but the better Celtic-based songs sound uncomfortably close to previous Pogues material, and only ''Tombstone'' moves the group into new territory. - Jon Pareles Bee Gees: 'One' Warner Bros. 25887; all three formats. The Bee Gees' strength - one they periodically resist in attempts to prove they can be funky and hard-edged - is atmospheric ballads. And their second album for Warner Bros. points them back in the right direction, toward the warm and soft. The album's title song and its strongest cut suggests a more metallic echo of the group's Caribbean-flavored dance music for ''Saturday Night Fever.'' So do the chiffon-textured songs, ''Bodyguard'' and ''Wish You Were Here.'' But even the most tuneful numbers lack the melodic sweep of the trio's best ballads from the 60's and 70's. - Stephen Holden Johnny Hodges: 'The Complete Johnny Hodges Sessions 1951-1955' Mosaic MR6-126 (35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06904); six LP's only. Johnny Hodges was in many ways the most minimalist of all of jazz's saxophonists. His command of nuance - the shading of a tone so that its colors bleed into significance; the way a beat, rushed or turned to molasses, was meant to indicate mood - made him one of jazz's finest blues musicians. And his solos, never hectic, have the feel of real attention. Mr. Hodges, who played most of his career with Duke Ellington's orchestra, left from 1951 to 1955. The material here, recorded during that period, is masterful, but it's been overlooked, partly because it hasn't always been available, partly because some of it, intended for the rhythm-and-blues market, is simple blues. Mr. Hodges ate it all up; and while the blues are magnificent, the small group arrangements are stunningly beautiful miniatures. - P. W. World Saxophone Quartet: 'Rhythm and Blues' Elektra-Musician 60864; all three formats. With short selections and most of them familiar soul hits, ''Rhythm and Blues'' may be the World Saxophone Quartet's most overtly commercial album; it opens with ''For the Love of Money.'' But it takes only minor adjustments for the group to move from jazz to (nominally) pop. There are more pieces driven by Hamiet Bluiett's baritone-saxophone riffs and more bluesy chords; there's slightly less improvisation. But the quartet - Mr. Bluiett, Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake and David Murray on saxophones - moves six soul hits into its own domain (alongside three original pieces), with arrangements full of gutsy chromaticism and untrammeled counterpoint. It's not the quartet's wildest work, but few groups of any kind, in jazz or chamber music, are so luxuriant and precise. - J. P. George Benson: 'Tenderly' Warner Bros. 25907; all three formats. The newest album by the buttery-voiced singer and guitarist is an aurally delectable, emotionally detached collection of pop standards in lush, romantic settings. Four of the eight cuts are vocal, the others instrumental. Mr. Benson croons ''You Don't Know What Love Is,'' ''Stardust,'' ''Here, There and Everywhere'' and ''This Is All I Ask,'' with glossy orchestral arrangements by Marty Paich contributing to the dreamy atmosphere. The instrumentals, especially a diaphanous solo guitar version of ''Tenderly,'' have a light, easygoing charm. Backing the singer on most of the album is a jazz trio that includes McCoy Tyner (piano), Ron Carter (bass) and three alternating drummers. - S. H.",1989-08-20T05:00:00+0000

In their original shape and material, they served a practical purpose, and were designed for ease of movement or protection in extreme climates.

Many in the Reynolds clan probably will hope that ''The Gilded Leaf'' disappears in a puff of cigarette smoke. With the journalist Tom Shachtman, R. J. Reynolds's grandson, the antismoking activist Patrick Reynolds, chronicles three generations of one of the South's best-known and most dysfunctional families. The same entrepreneurs who two generations ago founded RJR Tobacco Company and Reynolds Metals also sired heirs whose exploits smack of bad television drama: palatial homes, world-class drinking, adultery, threats of murder, a suspicious suicide, lawsuits, abandoned children. Family eccentrics range from the third wife of R. J. Reynolds Jr. - who, we are told, wears turbans, carries a dagger and consults occult treatises - to R. J. Reynolds Jr.'s son Zach, whose primary interests, according to the authors, are sex, motorcycles and guns. The writers make no claim to complete objectivity. Before R. J. Reynolds Jr., a heavy smoker, died of complications from emphysema in 1964, he disinherited his six sons, including Patrick. Perhaps as a consequence, Patrick Reynolds and his co-author were denied access to many important family papers. If the team's research has not successfully uncovered the minutiae of every Reynolds scandal, ''The Gilded Leaf'' is nonetheless a courageous and worthwhile book.

us,"Review/Theater; 'Titus Andronicus,' Grisly Stew","The first sight to greet the audience at the Central Park ''Titus Andronicus'' is a small, flaming barbecue grill propped up on a slender tripod at center stage. ''Titus Andronicus'' is a revenge-begets-revenge tragedy of rape, dismemberment and decapitations whose body count runs so high even scholars don't always jibe on the final tally. It ends with a cannibalistic feast in which a mother unwittingly eats a pie containing the innards of her sons. So why are we greeted by a wimpy barbecue that is less evocative of the barbarous human stew of Shakespeare's ancient Rome than of last weekend's hot-dogs-and-marshmallows cookout in Great Neck? The answer arrives soon enough. What the New York Shakespeare Festival has decided to present is a genteel ''Titus Andronicus,'' which is kind of like doing ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' without the chain saw or ''Sweeney Todd'' with an electric razor. Not particularly heartfelt or grotesque or long (the text is butchered more persuasively than the play's victims), this is a ''Titus'' that serves little purpose beyond filling another slot in the Shakespeare marathon and reconvening the increasingly numbing debate about the marathon's purpose and direction. It's a routine sandal-and-toga recital of an early, infelicitously written work that, more than its betters in the canon, demands extravagant imagination and passion to rouse audiences.",1989-08-21T05:00:00+0000

One is that ''CNN Newsroom'' carries no commercials, while every edition of ''Channel One'' contains two minutes of advertising. The Whittle effort is frankly for profit, from advertisers, some of which goes to pay for video equipment that is given without cost to schools that carry its 12-minute daily program. The provision of the television hardware is the other big difference. Whittle hopes to have 8,000 schools signed up by March, when ''Channel One'' begins in earnest.

Zia ul-Haq, most of his top generals, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan, Arnold Raphel, and an American military attache. What isn't so widely recognized, however, is how little the assassination has helped the Soviet Union. If anyone has benefited, it's the U.S. A report on the technical causes of the disaster by the Pakistan Government's Board of Inquiry - aided by six U.S. Air Force specialists - indicated that the crash was not an accident. Explosives were found in the wreckage, the investigators said, and the plane was likely brought down by the deliberate contamination of the main hydraulic system and its back-up, which would have made the plane almost impossible to control. The board concluded that ''the use of ultra-sophisticated techniques would necessitate the involvement of a specialist organization well versed with carrying out such tasks and possessing all the means and abilities for its execution.''",1989-08-23T05:00:00+0000

Small children, usually up to the age of 4, are required by law in every state to ride in approved seats designed for children, and the seats must be secured by safety belts. Find a seat that fits your child and your car and use it for every trip. Here are some safety tips from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Position: Place the child's carrier in the middle of the back seat to prevent injury in sideswipes. Face infants toward the rear of the car. Belts: Thread the car's belt through the safety-seat frame according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fasten the child-seat harness snugly over the shoulders. Quality: Buy and use only child safety seats that meet Department of Transportation requirements and carry approval labels. The date of manufacture should be after Jan. 1, 1981. Some seats are also certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for use on airplanes.",1989-08-26T05:00:00+0000

us,Q and A,"Tipping the Guide Question: How does one tip adventure travel guides? - J. M., Stowe, Vt. Answer: Tipping on such trips is never mandatory but almost always appreciated if participants feel a guide has done a good job.

It concerns airplanes and people, real and imaginary, of the period 1927-37, a glorious era for aviation but for Western humanity a slog through the sloughs of depression and totalitarianism, emerging in war. Mr. Boyne's hero pilot, an American engineer named Frank Bandfield, is not immune to history; his fortunes rise and fall, as do those of Mr. Boyne's villain pilot, the German plane maker Bruno Hafner. Like all pilots, Frank gets gobs of sex, some of it pretty technical. (''Their first kisses had . . . a sort of rasping, sucking urgency that shot Bandfield's testosterone gauge past the red line.'') Odious Bruno gets even more, though as a German and a rotter he is less potent and more kinky. In a scene I certainly hope to see in the movie - I will pay plenty - Frank and his sweetheart, Patty (''when she unbuttoned her blouse the moon caught her breasts tumbling out in an avalanche of beauty''), go the distance in the front seat of a hurtling Beechcraft biplane over Arizona. I will not fully reveal the whole astonishing conclusion of the climactic Spanish Civil War dogfight between Frank and the Nazi opportunist Bruno because Mr. Boyne, who intends a sequel, doesn't reveal it himself. But I will say that Mr. Boyne's planes are livelier than his people and I miss them more when they crash. Not every plane is perfectly characterized - there was no such thing as a Messerschmitt Bf 109 V5, only the one and unique Bf 109 V5, and the real Howard Pete racer had a Wright Gypsy engine, not a Menasco - but they fly.

Those two syncopated chords, like a rock ''Amen,'' are the ones that kicked ''Jumping Jack Flash,'' ''Honky Tonk Women'' and ''Start Me Up'' into gear; they're a Stones trademark, and Keith Richards's guitar makes them sound brash, slick, edgy, poised, offhand, jubilant and nasty, all at once.

us,HOMEENTERTAINMENT/VIDEO: NEW VIDEO RELEASES,"Rain Man 1988. MGM/UA Home Video. $89.95. Laser disk, $29.95. 2 hours, 15 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Dustin Hoffman takes hold of a ''star's dream of a role'' (which won him the Oscar) as Raymond the autistic savant, and Tom Cruise is his brother, Charlie Babbitt, a fast-talking, fortune-hunting (Raymond's fortune) auto salesman from Los Angeles. In a ''decently thought-out film'' (which also won the Oscar), Mr. Hoffman gives a performance of sustained virtuosity, but the ''true central character is the confused, economically and emotionally desperate Charlie, beautifully played by Mr. Cruise.'' (Vincent Canby) Wings of Desire 1988. Orion Home Video. $79.98. 2:10. Subtitled. PG-13. Two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), come to earth in stark, cold Berlin to observe people and to ''serve as silent partners in almost all forms of human experience, be they physical or cerebral, violent or serene.'' Wim Wenders's film is startlingly original, but the ''unyielding whimsy [ has ] the effect of wearing the audience down.'' For a time, though, there is a ''loveliness of conception that, for a time, keeps it feathery as an angel's wing.'' (Janet Maslin) Beaches 1988. Touchstone Home Video. $89.95. LD, $29.95. 2:07. Closed Captioned. R. C. C. Bloom (Bette Midler) and Hillary Whitney Essex (Barbara Hershey) go from bitter feuds and tearful recriminations to loving affirmations in a story about friends that is pure soap from beginning to end. Much of the relationship is in flashback, tracking their lives together as young women making their way in New York, with C. C. as the singer on the way up and Hillary looking the demure debutante. As opposites, they ''make an appealing if pat combination . . . .Together, they make the friendship convincing and the story a lot more interesting than it otherwise would be.'' (Maslin) The Naked Gun: From the Files of the Police Squad! 1988. Paramount Home Video. No suggested retail price. 1:25. CC. PG-13. This ''proudly sophomoric'' comedy is at its funniest when it's hardest to second-guess what will happen. Calamitous pratfalls are the sine qua non of this kind of humor, but the film gives it an unexpected sophistication, thanks to Leslie Nielsen, who as Lieut. Frank Drebin manages to make himself a perfectly oblivious fall guy. The director David Zucker has given it a cheerfully messy style, but ''high spirits may be all that a film like this really needs.'' (Maslin) Bert Rigby, You're a Fool 1989. Warner Home Video. $89.95. LD, $24.98. 1:34. CC. R. When a strike shuts down the coal mine, who should emerge from the shaft, singing ''The Continental,'' but the miner of the title, played delightfully by Robert Lindsay. New employment ensues as, successively, pizza delivery man, assistant gardener in Hollywood and finally as an English butler who manages to set fire to an Impressionist painting. Career detours notwithstanding, Bert bursts exuberantly into song at the least mishap, giving Mr. Lindsay opportunity to perform ''Puttin' on the Ritz'' and a brief medley from ''Singin' in the Rain.'' (Maslin) Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure 1989. Nelson Entertainment. $89.98 suggested. 1:30. CC. PG. ''We are about to fail egregiously,'' Ted says to Bill, and so they do almost totally in this painfully inept comedy about two high-school pals who upon entering a magic phone booth are able to transport themselves back to key moments in history. Enter Socrates, Napoleon, Joan of Arc and Abraham Lincoln, among others. Meant to be funny, the film ''only swells the sinus passages.'' (Canby)",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

The Chicago Seven defendant who married Jane Fonda tells about a time long ago when children of the affluent briefly found common cause with Black Panthers and thought they could start a revolution. Last year our reviewer, Paul Berman, said this autobiography is ''evocative, wordy, sometimes inconsistent. But what a story! . . . I turned the last page feeling a wary admiration for its author.'' REVOLUTIONARY ROAD, by Richard Yates. (Vintage, $8.95.) When Frank and April Wheeler left Greenwich Village for the Connecticut suburbs, they were convinced that they could insulate themselves from their dispiriting surroundings with alcohol, a well-honed sense of ennui and the knowledge that they were somehow different. It didn't seem to occur to them that their supposedly benighted neighbors might be thinking much the same thing. ''The excellence of 'Revolutionary Road' lies in the integrity with which its author depicts the Wheelers' disintegrating marriage,'' Martin Levin said here in 1961. His characters reveal themselves ''with an intensity that excites the reader's compassion as well as his interest.'' Vintage has also republished Mr. Yates's novel THE EASTER PARADE ($8.95), the story of two sisters whose parents' divorce twists their lives in two very different directions. Sarah becomes trapped in a marriage, Emily in a search for the perfect man. In 1976 one reviewer called Mr. Yates ''an unexcelled documentarian of sadness. . . . The details of [ the sisters' ] suffering are exact, indisputable, and moving.'' Also available from the same publisher is a new edition of ELEVEN KINDS OF LONELINESS ($8.95), a collection of short stories published in 1962. THE MAKING OF ''THE WIZARD OF OZ'': Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM - and the Miracle of Production N1060, by Aljean Harmetz. (Delta, $12.95.) The introduction to this behind-the-scenes look at what was once the height of special effects wizardry was written by the Wicked Witch of the West, Margaret Hamilton. ''Now at last I know how I flew,'' she says, ''how I melted, how I wrote in the sky 'SURRENDER DOROTHY OR DIE.' '' In 1977 our reviewer, Nora Ephron, called this ''an extremely jolly book . . . full of absolutely fascinating details.'' It has been republished for the movie's 50th anniversary. TRACKS, by Louise Erdrich. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) In the early years of the century, the Chippewa ancestors of the characters in Louise Erdrich's novels ''Love Medicine'' and ''The Beet Queen'' fight winter, smallpox and a conquering alien culture. ''Her sure sense of the way people think and talk keeps it hard to remember she is making them all up,'' Jean Strouse said here last year, ''and her lithe, athletic prose makes wildly improbable events seem as natural as the weather.'' GENERATION OF SWINE: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s, by Hunter S. Thompson. (Vintage, $8.95.) A series of columns published in The San Francisco Examiner massacres George Bush, Pat Robertson and Dan Rather (to pick a few targets at random) with the chain saw prose Hunter S. Thompson developed in books like ''Hell's Angels'' and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, which Vintage has also republished ($7.95). He combines ''name-calling, bomb-throwing and sardonic humor,'' Herbert Mitgang said in The Times last year. ''He's a little more strident this time out, but if you happen to share his public enemies, Mr. Thompson's your man. Nearly everything he writes makes yellow journalism pale.'' COLLECTED STORIES: 1948-1986, by Wright Morris. (Nonpareil/Godine, $10.95.) Wright Morris's fictional realm is peopled by ordinary folk, often from Nebraska, who suddenly find their lives upset by something unexpected: a meeting with hippies, a trip to New York, a drowned child frozen in a pond. In 1986 our reviewer, Rosellen Brown, praised the author's ''unique voice - a touch irritable, adorned almost affectionately with his characters' cliches, unsympathetic to pretension, quirkily independent in the face of received opinion.'' THE CONTROL REVOLUTION: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society, by James R. Beniger. (Harvard University, $12.95.) The Industrial Revolution begat the Information Revolution, James R. Beniger argues, by producing a society so complex that it requires computers to keep it from inevitably slipping toward entropy. In 1986 our reviewer, Langdon Winner, said he thought Mr. Beniger put too much faith in the value of this high-tech nervous system, but he praised the book as a ''skillful cross-disciplinary synthesis'' and a ''challenging, highly readable work.'' THE LAST FARMER: An American Memoir, by Howard Kohn. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) A former editor of Rolling Stone goes home to the family farm and uses the story of his hard relationship with his father to write about the crisis in American agriculture. The result is ''an intense and disturbing personal journey,'' Ben Logan said here last year. The book ''ruthlessly examines the new meanings that surface when past and present are freed from the linear mind and given the right to merge.'' THE MIDDLEMAN AND OTHER STORIES, by Bharati Mukherjee. (Fawcett, $3.95.) From Vietnam, the Caribbean, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to Queens, Ann Arbor and Cedar Falls, the modern immigrants in Bharati Mukherjee's short stories create a multiplicity of new worlds. ''They're not tired, huddled or even poor: they own motels, work scams, teach in college, breeze through on private funds,'' Jonathan Raban said here last year. The book is ''a romance with America itself, its infinitely possible geography, its license, sexiness and violence.''",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

Since Paul-Loup Sulitzer has already published novels entitled ''Cash,'' ''Money,'' ''Fortune'' and ''The Green King,'' it seems safe to say that he's not uncomfortable airing his personal preoccupation with wealth. His latest effort, ''Hannah,'' is a rags-to-riches tale chronicling the adventures of a peripatetic Polish girl who rises from her humble origins to become an international cosmetics queen. Having dutifully announced that his book is based on the life of Helena Rubinstein, Mr. Sulitzer then offers the reader an outrageous, wildly imagined yarn that corresponds in only a cursory fashion to any of the details of Mme. Rubinstein's own story. Mr. Sulitzer's Hannah is a headstrong, manipulative creature who will stop at nothing in her globe-trotting pursuit of tycoondom. In a flat-footed prose style translated from the French with occasionally awkward results, the plot doggedly traces Hannah's exploits as she manages to gratify her every desire, from business deals to sexual conquests. What she cannot acquire with finesse, she buys outright. The book is liberally sprinkled with the names of her many illustrious friends, the celebrated writers, artists and musicians of her day. But these figures always remain just outside the narrative. With cold-blooded, calculating business acumen, Hannah succeeds in parlaying her mother's homemade beauty remedies into a worldwide empire. When asked if they really work, she replies, ''I haven't a clue.'' Like Hannah's overhyped cold cream, Mr. Sulitzer's novel panders to an audience more awed by celebrity than quality.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

us,NONFICTION,"''ELDER OF THE JEWS'': Jakob Edelstein of Theresienstadt. By Ruth Bondy. (Grove, $26.95.) History rarely forgives those who fall, eyes closed, into its traps. Ruth Bondy makes this point in ''Elder of the Jews'' with the story of the commissioner of the International Red Cross during World War II, a man who emerged from a stroll through the Theresienstadt concentration camp convinced the Jews there had reached safe haven. So one might also expect Ms. Bondy to condemn Jakob Edelstein, the Czechoslovak Zionist who founded Theresienstadt in 1941 and from there unwittingly helped ship other Jews to the gas chambers. But she does not. Ms. Bondy defends men like Edelstein against charges of complicity and naivete, against those who accuse European Jews of abetting their own murderers. She retraces the events that forced Edelstein, a leader of Prague's Jewish community, first to beg favors of Adolf Eichmann, then, with his followers, to erect Theresienstadt - intended as a model Jewish community - out of an old fortress. This is not really a biography; Edelstein is more a unifying principle for a series of digressions - on Czechoslovak nationalism, Czechoslovak Jewry, Eastern European Zionism and international indifference to the Holocaust - than a presence. Given so loose a structure, it is not surprising that Ms. Bondy, who is a writer and teacher in Israel, loses the thread of her argument. We must sift through half the book (competently translated from the Hebrew by Evelyn Abel), through the minutiae of prewar Zionist politics, before arriving at the real story, Theresienstadt itself. As a child, Ms. Bondy survived both that camp and Auschwitz, and the most engrossing parts of her book are her observations of camp life and death; they are obsessively complete and completely brutal.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

us,FICTION,"OPHELIA AND THE GREAT IDEA. By Deborah Levy. (Viking, $16.95.) In the title story of this collection by the young British playwright Deborah Levy, one character glosses the eponymous ''great idea'': ''To invent a time and place of your own.'' To this end, Ms. Levy has discarded the traditional props of plot and unified setting. Instead, she has produced a series of dreamlike miniatures in which ideas, images and characters endlessly collide, pick themselves up and head off in their own directions. That's the good news. The bad news is that Ms. Levy's imagination, and often her prose, trail far behind her formal inventiveness. In story after story, she submerges the reader in a porridge of staleness and cliche: ''Preparing for Life'' is an inept rehash of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ''Heresies'' trots out all the old inverted sentimentalities about art and madness and in ''The Sinful Twins'' a randy painter takes up with a Spanish girl ''famous for her lustrous coil of black hair, whom he devoured and deflowered with all the passion of his vermilion tube of paint.'' In a few cases, Ms. Levy experiments with more success. ''Flush'' is a well-turned surrealistic cartoon about capitalists and corruption; ''Proletarian Zen'' is a kind of extended and amusing dialect joke. On a more ambitious plane, the title story opposes love and science, atoms and personalities, and derives from these oppositions a genuine sense of mystery, which Ms. Levy calls the ''fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.'' Here, at least, the author's associative instincts pay off: it's the atypical peak of a rather dismal collection, whose wholes more often add up to distinctly less than the sum of their parts.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

Those were the days when to read ''Ulysses'' was to break the law. Modernism was dangerous, and one of the marks of modernism was strangeness of language. Hopkins, like James Joyce, had bizarre compound words like ''beadbonny'' and ''fallowboot-fellow''; he seemed to be dragging the Germanic roots of English out of freshly dug earth. Yet how could a Jesuit priest, who died in the same year as Robert Browning, be a modernist? By an accident, the fact of his not being published until 1918, he was forced into joining that tide of literary innovation on which T. S. Eliot rode, also Ezra Pound, above all James Joyce. The poet Robert Bridges, the closest friend of Hopkins, had done wrong, I still think, in delaying the publication of Hopkins's small poetic oeuvre until the end of World War I. Young poets died in that war, and they would have been glad to take that thin volume of Hopkins into the trenches. But the world, according to the highly conservative, not to say timid, Bridges, was not ready for the Hopkinsian hand grenade, and it is true that the 1918 edition of his work was slow to sell out.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

It is a collection of 125 beautiful, very detailed photographs by Peter Aprahamian of some astounding interiors from different periods, with accompanying text by Mr. Friedman relating historical anecdotes and information about architecture and design. We are taken behind closed doors to buildings that are well known - Harrod's Meat Hall, a splendid example of Edwardian design; the geometric and oval Art Deco artistry of Claridge's Mayfair Hotel - and many that are unknown - for example, the old operating theater in the attic of St. Thomas's Hospital, Southwark, the oldest surviving interior of its kind. We enter shops, restaurants, theaters, town houses, pubs, banks, embassies, Government buildings. Some of the interiors are by such well-known designers and artists as Christopher Wren and Robert Adam, others by unrecorded craftsmen. The book includes a useful gazetteer explaining how to reach the buildings and giving historic information and hours of business. ''Inside London'' is more than a coffeetable addition; it is an earnest plea to halt the wrecker's ball and to preserve the heritage of London's architectural treasures.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

Although we've got used to second-generation actors equaling or surpassing the accomplishments of their parents, the same hasn't happened with second-generation novelists. Nonetheless there are a few, like Martin Amis and Susan Cheever, who are making names for themselves - and added to their small number ought to be Kaylie Jones, the daughter of James Jones, whose second novel, ''Quite the Other Way,'' is a look at the particulars and peculiarities of glasnost. Clinton Gray, the daughter of the famous American correspondent Alexander Clinton Gray, spends a college semester in Moscow - with side trips to Tbilisi and Leningrad - formally studying the culture and informally but compulsively searching for information about her now-deceased father's sojourns, when he was about Clinton's age, in Russia during World War II. She begins an affair with a fellow student, the opaque Phil Chase, gets chummy with two other students, Isabel and Ceppie, and is befriended by a line of Muscovites as long as any outside a Soviet grocery store. Although every single day of Clinton's stay is not described, ''Quite the Other Way'' includes coverage of the quotidian that sometimes seems to have been included simply because it happened and not necessarily because it is dramatically cogent. Nonetheless this account of Clinton's quest for fragments of her father's past and her coming to terms with life and love in today's Soviet Union is touching, disturbing, funny, frustrating and as charming, in its way, as that of the more innocent earlier adventures of Americans-abroad Emily Kimbrough and Cornelia Otis Skinner in ''Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.''",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

The cost of conscience: permanent anonymity. As originally reported by Daniel Lang in The New Yorker magazine in 1969, Private Eriksson's story remains as vivid and disturbing to read today as the De Palma movie is to watch.

For foreigners who seek fulfillment by submerging themselves in another culture, it represents the ultimate challenge. As Michael Shapiro shows in his insightful book, ''Japan,'' it is a challenge they can never entirely meet. Mr. Shapiro, a writer who accompanied his wife when she was sent to Tokyo by her newspaper, never had high expectations about his ability to fit in. He became fascinated, however, by those who did, who believed that through hard work, patience and love they could become truly accepted by their Japanese friends and colleagues. This book tells the stories of five contemporary Americans and a turn-of-the-century journalist, Lafcadio Hearn. Each progressed through an emotional dialectic of infatuation followed by extreme disillusionment, culminating in a realistic acceptance of his role and identity. Mr. Shapiro's technique, jumping back and forth among the stories of Hearn and the contemporary Americans - a baseball player, a businessman, a missionary couple and a young woman who defies the fingerprinting required by Japan's alien registration law - is somewhat artificial and occasionally disconcerting. But the stories are compelling, particularly that of the baseball player, who discovers that in Japan he will never be accepted as part of the team. Mr. Shapiro adds a few of his own offbeat experiences, such as trying to explain to Japanese Christians what it means to be a Jew.",1989-08-27T05:00:00+0000

us,Question Box,"Yankees and Mets Q. When Walt Terrell joined the Yankees from San Diego last month, he also joined a list of major leaguers who have been with both New York teams, the Yankees and the Mets. How many pitchers are in that group? A. Terrell is the 18th pitcher among the 39 players to have donned both New York uniforms in a regular season, meaning that more than 45 percent of those with Met-Yankee backgrounds have been pitchers. Besides Terrell, the pitchers still active are Don Schulze, Neil Allen and John Candelaria. The 14 others were: Jack Aker, Ray Burris, Rob Gardner, Bob Friend, Dale Murray, John Pacella, Hal Reniff, Bill Short, Tom Sturdivant, Ralph Terry, Dick Tidrow, Mike Torrez, Doc Medich and Dock Ellis. Tidrow has one other distinction: He is the only pitcher in major league history to have worked not only for both New York teams, but also for both Chicago teams, the Cubs and the White Sox. Two Outs, One Run Q. With the bases loaded and none out, the batter grounds sharply to the shortstop, who feeds the ball to the second baseman for one out, and the second baseman relays it to first base for the out there. On the double play, the runner from third scores, and the batter is charged with a time at bat, but not credited with a run batted in. In the same circumstance several innings later, the same batter hits a fly ball to the right fielder, who catches it for one out, then makes a strong throw to first base to catch the runner who strayed too far for the second out. On this double play, the runner from third scores by tagging up after the catch. Does the batter get credit for an r.b.i. this time? Is he charged with a time at bat? A. Yes and no. Even though the circumstances were the same - with the batter twice hitting into a double play with the bases loaded and none out - the responsibility for the outcomes was different. When the batter in the first example grounded into a double play, he provided the source of the force at second base and he failed to beat the relay to first base, so he fully deserved to be deprived of an r.b.i. and fully earned a time at bat. When the batter flied into a double play the next time up, though, the effect was a sacrifice fly that made it pretty certain the runner from third would be able to scoot home. So the batter deserved the r.b.i. But he had nothing to do with the runner on first being caught off first and doubled up; that runner was not forced to leave the base, so his out was his own fault, not the batter's. Under the rules, the batter who drives in a run on a sacrifice fly does not get charged with a time at bat. So the batter in the second example did not have an official time at bat, even though his time up led to two outs for his team. DiMaggio's Streak Q. When Joe DiMaggio set a major league record by hitting safely in 56 consecutive games, in how many of the games did he get more than the one hit necessary to extend the streak? A. There were 22 multiple-hit games and 34 one-hit games during the streak, which ran from May 15 to July 17 in 1941. Four times DiMaggio got four hits in a game and five times he got three, including the day before the streak ended, against Cleveland. Only twice over the 56 games did DiMaggio manage not to be retired in a game. He went 3 for 3 each time, once against the St. Louis Browns in Game 4 of his streak, and once against the Chicago White Sox in Game 32. He wound up batting .408 with 91 hits in 223 times at bat during his record run. Age and U.S. Tennis Q. In men's and women's singles, who are the oldest and youngest players to win the United States Open tennis championships? A. Among the men, these extremes go back almost a century, to a time when the event was known as the United States championships, when it was held at the Newport Casino in Rhode Island and when a challenge-round format made it easier for a defending champion to repeat because he had to play only the winner from the elimination rounds. After Oliver Campbell won the first of his three consecutive titles in 1890, he became the youngest men's singles winner, at 19 years 190 days, and he remains the youngest ever. After William Larned, at 38 years 242 days, captured his fifth successive title at the 1911 championships, he became the oldest ever, and no man has passed him.
