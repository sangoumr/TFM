us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Popular Science,"Henry Holt & Company, in its series ""Scientific American Focus,"" has the rather interesting goal of taking areas of science that are likely to be in the news or are generating controversy and making them clear to the average newspaper reader. The first three volumes, all written by science journalists and each costing $22.50, are written in simple, straightforward language and are embellished with numerous photographs and diagrams. MEDICATION OF THE MIND, by Scott Veggeberg, grapples with one of the many deep and difficult problems uncovered by our new understanding that life depends, at bottom, on chemistry. Specialized molecules in the brain, called receptors, seem to govern our moods and general feelings, and drugs like Prozac, which affect molecular chemistry, are the first fruits of this new understanding. But as more and more illnesses are dealt with by manipulating the brain's chemistry, traditional mental health practitioners find themselves fighting a rear-guard action. COSMIC COLLISIONS, by Dana Desonie, takes on the bombardment of the earth by pieces of debris from interplanetary space. Starting with the Big Bang and the formation of the solar system, the book describes the historical process by which humans came to realize that large stones occasionally fall from the sky. My only problem was a sense that Ms. Desonie was trying too hard to make the subject relevant, perhaps underestimating its inherent interest and her own ability to spin a good story. THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS, by Stephen Hart, is full of interesting tidbits about the communication inherent in the feather displays of peacocks, the mechanisms for sound production in dolphins, and modern experiments on the language capabilities of chimpanzees. What is missing is a single coherent theme, or at least some direction as to which topics are sidelights and which bear on deep scientific questions. If these books are any indication of what is to come, I look forward to the next volumes with great anticipation. James Trefil",1996-06-02T05:00:00+0000

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Starting Over,"Before he married Eva Wasierski, Tom Riley's life was ""so uneventful, so without particulars, it might have been ordered from a catalogue."" An energetic and opinionated world traveler, Eva prodded and enlivened this quiet pet-shop owner who had rarely ventured outside his native Chicago. They had planned to go to Egypt to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary -- but instead Tom finds himself alone, mourning Eva's death in Lago de Luz, the small Mexican town where they spent their honeymoon. ""You can't run from sorrow,"" his sister warns him. To which, with admirable logic, he replies, ""I can cry in some warmer place, at least."" As the opening chapters of Sandra Scofield's latest novel, A CHANCE TO SEE EGYPT (HarperCollins, $22), make plain, Tom's journey is a metaphor: without Eva, he thinks he cannot cover new ground. But when, shortly into his stay, an incident at the hotel leads him to take up residence elsewhere, we understand that Tom is ready to venture beyond his past. Drawn to the strength of a local woman, he slowly awakens to his love for her beautiful and spirited 18-year-old daughter, aptly named Divina. Ambushed by his emotions, Tom is aware that ""he had not so much earned his joy as accepted it."" While this May-December romance may seem terribly familiar, Ms. Scofield (whose novel ""Beyond Deserving"" was a finalist for the National Book Award) gives it her own skillful twist. With its lively cast of characters and its vividly rendered setting, ""A Chance to See Egypt"" emerges as an absorbing story that allows us to delight in Tom Riley's elation at the unexpected gift of a life renewed.

He commissioned ""The Roosevelt Bears,"" drawings and verse about two bears who traveled east to see President Theodore Roosevelt. Only two years before, Roosevelt, amused by a cartoon showing him refusing to shoot a bear, had given permission for his name to be used for a new toy, the teddy bear. The toy survives, but Ochs's venture into educational comic strips died after six months because children preferred the colorful ""Yellow Kid"" and ""Katzenjammer Kids.""

In 1890, he built a dynamite and powder factory in the town that would become known as Maxim.

As he says in A CAST OF FRIENDS (Taylor, $22.95), written with Tom Ito, a freelance journalist, Mr. Hanna and Joe Barbera knew they were a winning combination from their first meeting, in 1937. In short order, their collaboration produced Tom and Jerry, the classic cat-and-mouse team. When they founded Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1957, the two were pioneers gambling that their new limited animation techniques would enable cartoons to move from movie screen to television. Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, the Flintstones and the Jetsons, among many others, were the result. Now 85, still happily at work in his ""cartoon quarry,"" Mr. Hanna pays tribute to wife, family, animation colleagues and employees while giving his two children and seven grandchildren credit for helping him bridge the generation gap. To this day, he watches pencil sketches evolve into exuberant cinematic fantasy and always finds the result ""somewhat astonishing."" He takes the reader backstage and lets him feel that excitement. ""Cartoons,"" he says, ""symbolize enchantment.""

us,Books in Brief: FICTION;Philadelphia Story,"Even the air is palpable in TUMBLING (Morrow, $24), Diane McKinney-Whetstone's engaging first novel about a 1950's community threatened with gentrification. In the working-class black Philadelphia neighborhood that serves as the book's setting, the woeful plaint of Mahalia Jackson records mingles with the perfume of backyard honeysuckle. But the city's insidious attempts to buy out homeowners eventually spill into the domestic world of Herbie and Noon, a young couple whose lives have already been rerouted after not one but two little girls are abandoned on their doorstep. Herbie and Noon are more successful as parents than as spouses and they salve their marital wounds independently: Herbie in a nightclub singer's bed and Noon in her church and in her fight against the city's plans. But they are true partners in the love and care of their children, especially Fannie, who came first and who charms and frightens them with her occasional clairvoyance. Though the book's end is bluntly forecast from early on and more than a few events are puzzlingly unexplained, the story moves forward on the power of Ms. McKinney-Whetstone's characters. Herbie and Noon's neighbors -- from the meanspirited petty bureaucrat across the street, desperate to protect her meager authority, to the well-intentioned but miscalculating local pastor, who falls prey to his own pride -- are never merely props. Through these and other deftly portrayed individuals, whose wrongdoing stems more from fallibility than intent, Ms. McKinney-Whetstone captures the formidable struggle to protect both a community and a family.

Draga Grubic was slightly more poetic but no less blunt: ""I have no desire to go to Sarajevo anymore. I don't even have a desire to go back to Zagreb, where I used to live. It's like a love relationship -- when it's over, it's over and you have to find another one."" I've been thinking of that conversation as the debate heats up over whether the international community should certify that conditions exist in Bosnia for holding fair elections. Those conditions include the arrest of war criminals, access to media for opposition parties and an atmosphere free of intimidation. U.S. officials acknowledge that few of those conditions exist today, but they are pressuring European election organizers to authorize the voting anyway, arguing that with a little effort conditions will be good enough by Sept. 14, Election Day.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000
us,Reagan's Tax Cut Didn't Cause Deficits,"To the Editor: Roger C. Altman (Op-Ed, June 6) perpetuates the myth that President Reagan's across-the-board tax cut produced the large budget deficits of the 1980's. The deficit increased in the 1980's because Government expenditures outraced Federal tax revenues, whose growth was 65 percent higher per year in the low-tax-rate 1980's than in the high-tax-rate 1990's. Mr. Altman says that substantial tax cuts would contribute to declining living standards and wages. In the wake of the Reagan tax-rate reductions, real median family income increased from $36,326 in 1982 to $40,890 in 1989. Since Congress raised income tax rates in 1990, however, real median family income has declined, from $40,087 in 1990 to $38,782 in 1994. Under President Clinton, the growth rate of median family income has been zero percent.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,BASEBALL;Selling Americans Their Own Pastime,"If you've marketed brands like Entenmann's, Maxwell House, Lenders bagels, Pepsi Light and Tang, can you sell the world on Ken Griffey Jr., expansion, wild-card playoffs, interleague play and Albert Belle? Major league baseball hopes so. Baseball yesterday handed its marketing reins to Gregory Murphy, a diplomat's son who played Little League in Libya and was most recently president of Kraft Foods Bakery Companies. Murphy lacks sports experience, which did not scare off baseball. The erstwhile national pastime has come to be viewed as a vastly undermarketed product that long ago ceded market share to other sports and entertainments. ""We determined that the position required experience that went beyond traditional sports marketing,"" said Bud Selig, the acting commissioner. Murphy, 47, insisted that the fundamentals of selling jars of coffee or bags of frozen bagels can be transferred to baseball. ""Get deeply involved and understand your consumer and your brand,"" he said. ""I think I'm prepared."" Murphy, who will report to Selig, becomes president of Major League Baseball Enterprises, a new division that embraces television, advertising, public relations, licensing, sponsorships and international development. ""My biggest shock when I became chairman of the executive council in September 1992 was to find that baseball never had a central marketing operation,"" Selig said. ""This was a very necessary step."" The structure of the new division bears similarities to those in pro basketball, football and hockey, which have marketed themselves with more savvy than baseball. ""The N.B.A.'s efforts the past decade have been extraordinary,"" Selig said. Donald M. Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he has long hoped that baseball would adopt a national marketing strategy. ""Without it, you don't give yourself a chance,"" he said. A labor deal, which has long eluded negotiators, would be crucial to baseball's marketing, by assuring fans that work stoppages will not reoccur. But Fehr said, ""It would help, but there are a lot of strengths baseball has and must figure out, make known and reinforce."" Murphy was reluctant to reveal his possible strategies to increase revenue, attendance, television ratings and franchise values, his four main goals. ""I want to be sure I deeply understand the baseball brand and the consumer,"" he said. ""I'm reluctant to say, 'These are my programs.' "" But, he said, he understands that baseball is weakened. ""Fans are angry,"" he said. ""I think disgusted. In many ways that's great because they really care. When you have such an intense feeling, there's a passion."" Baseball's popularity has suffered most among youth. Fewer kids are playing or tuning in on television. A new survey of 2,477 adolescents by the Brainwaves Group, a unit of the advertising agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, showed 63 percent chose baseball or softball as a favorite sport to play or to watch live or on television. Basketball was named by 76 percent, football by 74 percent. Murphy was asked to compare marketing baseball now (on the eve of a possible suspension for the Reds' owner, Marge Schott) to marketing Kool-Aid for Kraft in 1978 after the mass suicides of Jonestown cultists who drank a fruit-flavored drink laced with cyanide. Murphy said that it was actually another beverage used in Jonestown. ""It had little effect on Kool-Aid,"" he said. He added: ""Everyone feels passionately about baseball. Even Marge Schott. The core equity of Kool-Aid and the core equity of baseball are strong.""",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

It is a basic guideline of investing that someone with only $70,000 in net worth should not be buying individual stocks, and certainly not volatile, new stock issues. This is especially true for someone who has not much better than a 50-50 chance of retaining his employment every six years. Moreover, the Senator should not have risked more than 10 percent of his assets in a single issue.

No sooner had he announced his desire to include a ""declaration of tolerance"" for pro-choice Republicans in his party's platform than seemingly every G.O.P. leader, seconded by every major news organization, lined up to declare peace was at hand. On one network news show Friday night, no fewer than four party factotums, starting with Pat Buchanan, expressed varying degrees of contentment with Mr. Dole's masterly move.

At the offices of the two bellwethers for the pro-choice majority in their party -- Ann Stone, of Republicans for Choice, and Susan Cullman, of the Republican Coalition for Choice -- phones and fax machines were fielding a far less tranquil reaction. Many pro-choice G.O.P. women and men are not satisfied with the back-of-the-bus status of being ""tolerated""; they want the abortion plank, with its call for a Human Life Amendment, removed entirely. ""My surprise is how duped the press was,"" says Ms. Cullman. ""They seem to think if the religious right is quiet, then the problem must have been solved.

Advances in analytic technology are irrelevant to Delaney, which prohibits the deliberate addition to food of any level of chemicals known to induce cancer in humans or animals. Furthermore, the advances of understanding in the molecular basis of carcinogenesis over the last few decades are consistent with our inability to set tolerances or safe thresholds for any one carcinogen, let alone on multiple carcinogens in food. Animal tests for carcinogens give results that are highly predictable to humans. All 23 recognized human carcinogens are also carcinogenic in animals. For many of these carcinogens, the animal data preceded human confirmation, in some instances by decades. At a time when cancer risks are escalating, the Clinton Administration is wise to insist on retaining the Delaney Clause, and on protecting consumers against avoidable exposure to carcinogens that are in food.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Early in the day, Bethpage Black and Southern Hills Golf Club in Tulsa, Okla., were the two front-runners for the vacant 2001 date. Southern Hills, which last hosted a major championship in 1994 when Nick Price won the PGA Championship there, was the apparent favorite for 2001 with Bethpage still under consideration and strongly endorsed by David Fay, the U.S.G.A.'s executive director. Later, however, after much debate in the executive committee meeting and following a lengthy dinner meeting, Bethpage was eliminated from consideration for the 2001 date and U.S.G.A. officials declined to identify the chosen site.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000
us,"DANCE REVIEW;With an Emphasis on the Emotion, Not the Mechanics","Antony Tudor's ballets are about emotion. As Tudor, American Ballet Theater's founding choreographer, once said, he wanted to ""feel"" the music, not count it. Feeling is certainly what ""The Leaves Are Fading"" is all about, and this 1975 Tudor masterpiece received a glowing performance from two different sets of principals at the Metropolitan Opera House. On Monday night, Marianna Tcherkassky, who will make her farewell to Ballet Theater after 26 years on Saturday night, was seen for the first time in New York in the leading female role. She was partnered with masculine grace by Robert Hill, while last Saturday afternoon, Amanda McKerrow and Wes Chapman led a virtually all-new cast. In each performance, the tone of young love deepening into tenderness was marvelously sustained. Ms. Tcherkassky and Ms. McKerrow are, however, very different dancers and each brought her individuality to Tudor's expressive use of the classical idiom. Ms. Tcherkassky has excelled in 19th-century Romantic roles and she slipped naturally into the gestural flow of Tudor's neo-Romantic style. In the central duet, she looked properly ecstatic and impressed by Mr. Hill's flourish. If the more passionate choreography had a few glitches in the partnering, every swoon and lift spoke of intensification of feeling. With at least four couples engaged in tricky partnering, ""Leaves"" presumes a high level of technique. Ms. McKerrow, at her best in neo-classical ballets, brought that level to the choreography and also superbly captured its lyricism. Mr. Chapman was on her wavelength and danced with the same daring in his timing. Especially lovely was their exit in the duet. Here the ballerina, slowly dipped head-down by her spinning partner, is finally carried off in profile at his side, head thrown back. Amplifying the love image are three other duets. There was a girlish sparkle and lightness to Yan Chen, dancing with a boyishly eager Angel Corella. Christina Fagundes and Andrei Dokukin, who also had a folk-flavored solo to the Dvorak music, were grand in their boldness. Maxim Belotserkovsky and Martha Butler were ill-matched but did well enough. On Monday, Ms. Tcherkassky stepped into Lar Lubovitch's ""Brahms Symphony"" as the girl in cherry red. Her main duet with Keith Roberts had the sweep and surge brought to it by the rest of the excellent ensemble.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Law School Women Gain From Socratic Wars;No Gender Disability,"To the Editor: I was dismayed by your June 5 Education page report of criticism of use of the Socratic method in law schools because women students find it intimidating to be required to express themselves orally in class and to have their analysis of a legal issue subjected to rigorous scrutiny. May we assume the next step will be to prohibit a client or judge from asking a woman lawyer to support a position that she has espoused? As a lawyer in a firm where 7 of the 15 other members are women, as a man whose spouse is a lawyer and a former judge, and as the father of 3 daughters, I reject the suggestion that women suffer a gender-based disability in law schools. Cultural attitudes and pedagogical insensitivity at schools and colleges disadvantage female students.

us,Sports of The Times;Why Schott Should Not Be Booted,"IT seems certain that Marge Schott will be forced to decide today whether to relinquish control of her ball club, the Cincinnati Reds, or suffer a suspension again, for a one- or two-year sentence. It is certain that Marge Schott embarrasses her fellow owners by her insensitive, boorish and bigoted remarks. Bud Selig, a fellow owner with the conflict-of-interest title of acting commissioner, said earlier this week, ""Yes, she has hurt baseball, no question about it."" If ever someone has advertised her ignorance it is the baseball team owner Marge Schott. She is on record of making slurs toward blacks, Jews, working women, Italians, Asians -- and these are only the ethnic and racial groups that she was asked about. As far back as 1992, she remarked to me that ""Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far."" That was one of the particulars in the indictment that got her suspended from baseball for a year in 1993. When on opening day this season in Cincinnati, the umpire John McSherry collapsed and died on the field in the first inning, and the game was canceled, she complained, ""First it was snow, and now this!"" It was as if she believed God was conspiring against her having a decent opening day. And when she sent the umpires flowers in an attempt to make up, the flowers were discovered to have been recycled. A television station had sent them to her the day before. Many people who know her describe her as a lonely widow, without children, and with a drinking problem. All this may be true. But in my time spent with Marge Schott, I have found her to be a person of firm convictions and with a pittance of information. She knew as little about Hitler, for example, as she did the infield fly rule. As for her drinking: When she made that Hitler remark to me, it was 10 in the morning, she was driving a car and driving it straight, under the influence of nothing but her simple, unworldly, minimally educated self. She does, however, appear to have a quirky if not crafty business sense. Her fellow owners will tell you that she knows nothing about how to run an organization. But if people are so set against her, then they would not, or should not, show up to her team's games. But they do. Last season, in the smallest metropolitan market of the 14 National League teams, the Reds had a home attendance of 1.8 million fans and outdrew eight of Schott's competitors, including the New York Mets, by 500,000. Her fellow owners will tell you that she knows nothing about baseball. But in the 11 full seasons she has owned the Reds, they have been winners. And in the 1990's, only the Atlanta Braves have a better on-the-field record than the Reds. And while the Reds are in last place this season and playing only .400 ball, they won their division last year -- the same twist experienced by the Boston Red Sox. Schott has the lowest ticket prices in all of baseball and has insisted on fans being able to buy a hot dog at Riverfront Stadium for a dollar. An organization in Chicago called the Fan Cost Index figured out that for a family of four to attend a ball game -- from tickets to parking to popcorn -- the Reds have the lowest total average cost: $81.31. The average is $102.58, with the Yankees coming in at $117.32 and the Mets at $104.80. As for hurting baseball, what hurt baseball more than the owners calling off the World Series in 1994? What hurt them more financially than the $280 million they had to pay the players for illegally colluding to hold down salaries? And not one owner had to relinquish control of his club, or was suspended for it, either. And just who are these fellow owners sitting in judgment of her? The admitted felon in the Bronx? Ted Turner of Atlanta, who urinated in public after his America's Cup yacht racing victory? The owners would distinguish themselves not by taking club control away from Schott, or by suspending her, but by saying that while her speech and actions are despicable, it is also true that in America everyone has a right to make a fool of oneself. It is the right of the customers, however, not to patronize such a fool. So far, the fans in Cincinnati and in the National League cities have not seen fit to send that message. But they should be the ultimate judges, not her pious fellow owners.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000
us,Hijacker Sentenced to 20 Years as Judge Rejects Claim That Bias MadeHis Crime Justified,"An Ethiopian man who hijacked a German jetliner to New York in 1993 was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison after a judge rejected his assertion that the hijacking was justified because his visa application to the United States had been denied. The man, Nebiu Demeke, argued that he had been refused entry into the country because of his nationality. ""I was forced to hijack the plane and I hijacked it politely,"" said Mr. Demeke, who the authorities believe is the only person to hijack a trans-Atlantic flight to the United States in the last two decades. But Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court in Brooklyn sternly rebuked the man. ""When you spoke, Mr. Demeke, of how you are a victim of discrimination, you are preaching to the choir,"" said Judge Johnson, who is black. ""I have understood that pain for many years. However sad and wrong that is, there is no justification for doing what you did."" So ended an unusual case that moved from a sky-and-runway drama to the courts. Mr. Demeke, who had lived in Germany since August 1992, had deftly smuggled a starter's pistol under a wide-brimmed fedora onto Lufthansa Flight 592, which left Frankfurt with 94 passengers and 10 crew members on Feb. 11, 1993. The pistol fired only blanks. He seized the plane, bound for Cairo and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and threatened to kill crew members unless they flew it to New York. He surrendered without a struggle when the wide-bodied, twin-engine Airbus 310 landed at Kennedy International Airport. Yesterday, Mr. Demeke asked for the minimum sentence on the charge, which carried a maximum of life imprisonment, because he had been so cooperative. ""I freely surrendered,"" he said. ""I helped the F.B.I. They wouldn't have known how I hijacked the plane. They wouldn't have known if I didn't tell them."" Mr. Demeke acted as his own lawyer during a four-day trial in March and refused to raise an insanity defense. He was twice found incompetent to stand trial. But under medication for depression and hallucinations, he ultimately went to court, and a jury found him guilty in less than an hour. ""When he was off medication, he was talking about people beaming him up to Mars,"" Alan Seidler, his legal adviser, said in an interview. Mr. Demeke, who was a student in Morocco before he moved to Germany, told the judge he had wanted to come to the United States ""to redress a wrong."" He had testified that he had sent an American lawyer some theatrical scripts and music that he believed would earn him a fortune. He later became convinced that the lawyer and his own father, who was in United States at the time, were stealing the scripts for their own financial gain. But the Federal prosecutor, Gordon Mehler, said yesterday that another undercurrent of Mr. Demeke's frustration was that his two brothers and two sisters obtained visas to study in the United States and he did not. Although he had applied for political asylum in Germany, he withdrew the application and asked the German Government to furnish him a ticket to return to Ethiopia. He used that ticket to hijack the plane. At the Frankfurt Airport, Mr. Demeke was asked to remove his Indiana Jones-style hat. He complied, pinching the pistol in the crown of the fedora. He was then scanned with a hand-held metal detector but only from the shoulders down.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,"COLLEGE BASKETBALL;For Parker, the Next Issue Is Academics","Richie Parker moved closer to ending his two-year exile from basketball yesterday afternoon when he hand-delivered his application for admission to the registrar's office at Long Island University in Brooklyn. The action marks the beginning of the end of a saga that saw him go from being considered one of the top 100 high school basketball players in the country to a pariah whom no college program would touch. The former star at Manhattan Center High School pleaded guilty in January 1995 to first-degree sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl in a stairwell at the school a year earlier. Five months later, he signed a letter of intent to attend Seton Hall. But protests led the school to withdraw its offer, and subsequently a number of other schools, among them George Washington, Utah, Cal State-Fullerton and U.S.C., backed off. Long Island University must now evaluate Parker's transcripts from Mesa Community College in Arizona. As long as school officials determine that Parker is academically qualified, the school will be free to tender an athletic scholarship. When Parker signs, his quest will be over. National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations prohibit university officials from discussing Parker or his enrollment until he signs the financial aid offer. But there was reaction elsewhere. ""From the perspective of a former athletics director, I would not extend an offer of an athletics scholarship to someone like Richie Parker,"" said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation. ""A scholarship is a measure of integrity and standards. It is our job to look at the type of people we recruit. We look for people who are exemplary role models for kids in generations to come."" ""This is a real tough one,"" said Anne Connor, president of the New York City branch of the National Organization for Women. ""You want a young person to be able to have a chance to get on with their life if they have been punished. But what about the young women who was the victim of that attack? ""Young people have to know that there are consequences to behavior. You did this and therefore you've lost some chances and you will not be rewarded. It's tough."" Connor said that she was encouraged that Parker had apologized to the victim. ""Unlike Mike Tyson, he seems to have recognized that he did something wrong,"" she said, referring to the aftermath of Tyson's rape conviction. Ernie Lorch, who is the director of the nationally known Riverside Church basketball program and has known Parker since he joined it in the eighth grade, characterized him as a solid young man who made a tremendous error and paid for it. ""I think people began to realize that you can't condemn a kid in perpetuity when he makes a mistake, however serious it may be, at the age of 16,"" Lorch said. ""He was never in trouble before, he has never been in trouble since. I think that when a kid makes a mistake, a serious mistake, he needs to pay for it, he needs to recognize that he's made serious mistake. But then I think we have an obligation to afford him the opportunity to redeem himself. Certainly, redemption is a great part of our point of view."" Connor said she will simply wait and see. ""I wouldn't organize a protest at the university,"" she said. ""But on the other hand, I wouldn't be part of the welcoming committee.""",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Law School Women Gain From Socratic Wars,"To the Editor: As a woman and a third-year student at Fordham Law School and as a veteran of the Socratic wars, I have a bit of advice for women (""Law School Women Question the Teaching,"" Education page, June 5): It is really not that hard to get a law professor or your classmates to respect your opinions. Do what lawyers are supposed to do best -- argue back. Do the class reading, volunteer in class, answer with confidence even if you don't feel it. Don't end sentences as if you're always asking a question? (Your future employers and clients will never take you seriously.) Law school women who don't want to volunteer to answer in class and don't want to be called on but do want to be taken seriously can't have it both ways. Lawyers do a lot of speaking before groups; get used to it. The American Bar Association school accreditation rules provide a framework of legal equality for women. Women need to stop being deferential and insist on actual equality. Above all, don't demand kid-glove treatment, because that only perpetuates the image of women as delicate creatures who can't take the heat in the legal profession. Women have to be willing to compete, because law is a business. Law schools should consider the leadership role that lawyers have in our society and should encourage thinking before speaking and discussions that go beyond quick answers. These changes would be good for law schools and the legal profession and society as a whole, not just for women.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

Despite almost indecipherable instruction booklets, the video cameras are remarkably easy to use and the new digital versions are equipped with ingenious editing devices. Result: home movies have come a startlingly long way from the days of clunky cameras and unwieldy projection reels and screens. Now individuals and families can simply turn the compact cameras on their own lives with a minimum of fuss and technical expertise. The end products can be used for anything from documenting living wills to keeping a record of some happy occasion. More significantly, they can go deeper into personal lives, gathering stories and revelations that would set the daytime talk shows to salivating. And that raises the question: why bother with unctuous hosts when you can bring the product directly to an audience.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

So they cheered when a liberal Democrat, Senator Edward Kennedy, teamed up with a moderate Republican, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, to introduce modest health reforms. Kennedy-Kassebaum, as this legislation is called, would require insurance companies to accept applicants regardless of pre-existing medical conditions and to allow employees to buy job-to-job health coverage. With different versions passing overwhelmingly in both houses, the bill was to be the perfect example of how well the incremental approach worked.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,Wine Talk,"EVERY year around this time, the mail includes a substantial number of letters inquiring about the next vintage chart. This year there were fewer than usual. Are wine drinkers tiring of the annual numbers game? A vintage chart can cut through the woolly language that confronts and baffles potential wine buyers in advertisements and articles. It can single out bad years and give general advice on good ones. But little more: vintage charts promise more than they can deliver. As in the past, the 1996 chart is two years behind in its ratings. Judging the 1994's, the best of which are only now being bottled, is risky enough. And any definitive reading now on the 1995's would be presumptuous. Again this year, the 1987 Bordeaux have been eliminated. Short-lived wines, they were good value for a few years. No longer. The 1994 Bordeaux reds were over all better than the 1993's, but like the wines of 1991 and 1992, they failed to match the excellent 1990's. In general, 1994 was a good but not excellent year for all the wine regions listed. Only Sauternes and red Burgundy rated lower than 7 out of 10, and the Sauternes may well improve. The chart is better on older vintages; those that have withstood -- or failed -- the test of time. Even then, there are grounds for debate. Are the 1982's really the wine of the century? Have the 1975's come around? Will they ever? Don't look to a vintage chart when these weighty issues arise. There are years like 1991, when the vineyards of the northern Rhone Valley produced superb wines, while those of the southern Rhone, including Chateauneuf-du-Pape, gave forth mostly junk. The northern Rhone rated a high 9 that year; the southern Rhone, at best a low 6. Averaging them serves neither region well. California is divided, probably for the last time, into two categories, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. O.K., a good year for cabernet sauvignon in California is usually a good year for the other Bordeaux varieties, merlot and cabernet franc. But what about zinfandel, pinot noir, sangiovese, mourvedre and other red varieties competing for stardom? Let's face it: can a single-digit rating encompass the wines of Mendocino, 120 miles north of San Francisco, the wines of the Sierra foothills, 100 miles east of the Pacific, and the wines of Temecula, 60 miles miles north of the Mexican border? Vintage-chart makers skirt the problem, or pretend to, by noting that their ratings apply mostly to the North Coast wine counties, Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino. Vintage charts were once more relevant. The wine world was smaller, more manageable and essentially French. Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne were what counted and, on a few more generous charts, the Loire and the Rheingau. Italy and the New World were ignored. Who could have envisioned then that serious table wines would one day come from New Mexico and New Zealand, from Sicily and South Africa, Long Island and Washington State, Chile and Australia? And Spain. Not just Spain but regions within Spain -- Rioja, Penedes, Navarra and Rueda? How can a single vintage chart encompass them all? And then there are the variables in wine making. Robert M. Parker Jr., the wine critic, put it succinctly when he qualified one of his own charts by observing that all such efforts ""are filled with exceptions to the rule."" These include, he continued, ""astonishingly good wines from skillful or lucky vintners in years rated mediocre, and thin, diluted, characterless wines from incompetent or greedy producers in great years."" And Champagne? Most Champagne is a blend of wine from different years: nonvintage. Which literally has no place on a vintage chart. Vintage Champagne appears only in years when the producers know it's going to be good. Does it help to rate it? Maybe. A little. Vintaging wine is a marketing tool. Perhaps consumers are beginning to realize that good wine makers make good wine. They recognize labels that, year in, year out, represent quality at reasonable prices. With that knowledge they have the confidence to make their own judgments.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

us,N.B.A. FINALS;The Bulls Prepare to Face Their Toughest Foe: History,"Michael Jordan is not sure how to answer this one. If he says yes, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird might differ. If he says no, he is backing down. ""Are we the greatest team of all time?"" muses the Chicago Bulls' supernova guard. ""Well . . . "" How can anyone be sure after this championship series, when it is no longer Bulls versus SuperSonics, but rather Jordan and his teammates against National Basketball Association history. As Chicago looked to close out the finals with Seattle in Game 4 on Wednesday night at Key Arena, the overriding theme was not what little chance the Sonics had but how Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the hired help would be construed next to the league's other great teams. The Lakers always had the Celtics for six or seven games to measure themselves by. The Bulls of the early 90's had the Pistons and the Knicks. Ali had Frazier. Martina had Chrissie. These Bulls have . . . these Bulls. Either they're simply too polished to have their greatness quantified or no one will ever know how good they are because they were never tested. They beat the rickety Knicks in five games, swept away some big kids in mouse ears from Orlando in four games and are on the brink of removing Seattle's voicebox, also in four. The last playground war they took part in came three weekends ago in New York, where a split at Madison Square Garden became the only blemish on their 14-1 post-season record. ""The fact that there is no comparison says it all,"" Pippen said. ""And that is: We're the greatest team of all time. That's my opinion."" It is one shared by many outside of the organization. With Nate McMillan doubtful with a strained back for Game 4 and the squawking of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp surpassing their play, the Sonics will become the second 60-victory team to be eliminated by Chicago in four games en route to a title. Only one other team in N.B.A. annals has accomplished that feat: the Bulls of 1993, who beat the Knicks (60 victories) and the Suns (62). A sweep would also mean a 15-1 post-season mark, the best during a championship run. But, really, aside from the Knicks, there were no decent scrums, no great test in the post-season for this collection of basketball players who won a league-record 72 games during the regular season. ""That's not the Bulls' fault,"" said Bill Walton, the NBC analyst who played on the 1986 Celtic team that is considered among the league's best. ""That's everyone else's fault. They have no control over who they play."" Ron Harper, who did not start Game 3 because of a bruised knee, is expected to start in Game 4. Seattle Coach George Karl will sit down center Ervin Johnson in favor of Sam Perkins or Frank Brickowski, going with either more offense and physical play. In other developments today, Phil Jackson, who is essentially cashing in his last bargaining chip on Wednesday, made it clear he is not opposed to taking a year's sabbatical instead of returning to coaching next season. He did not rule out coaching in Europe or taking a job as an announcer for a year, like Pat Riley did in between coaching the Lakers and the Knicks, or merely retreating to Montana to mellow out. The options, of course, become more diverse -- Jackson has yet to mention becoming a parasailing instructor -- the longer the Bulls wait to sign their free-agent coach to a short-term deal that would not be insulting, one for John Calipari and Riley money. Meanwhile, between diatribes on how great this Bulls team is compared with how great those other Bulls teams were, Jordan decided that ""great"" was being thrown around a little too freely, considering Game 4 had not yet begun. ""We can taste it,"" Jordan said. ""It's definitely there. But we still have one hurdle to go over. Sometimes that last hurdle is taller than all the others when you get to the end."" Jordan, who has said he only wants to play with Jackson as his coach, went on to say that as loyal as he is, he will only go so far. ""Tell Phil I'm not going to Montana,"" he said, with a mischievous smile. Neither the coach nor the star player of perhaps the greatest team in league history mentioned an eventual trip to Springfield, Mass. Like their blistering run through the finals this season, some things in this business you just take for granted.",1996-06-12T05:00:00+0000

THE British novelist, playwright and journalist Angela Huth's lovely new book, ""Land Girls,"" is a war story about the real heroes of World War II: not the generals but the ordinary citizens who left their workaday lives and fought for their country as best they could. The girls of the title were young women who joined Britain's Land Army; they left the safe, tea-cozy world of traditional female jobs -- university student, hairdresser, sweetheart -- and went off to take up the exhausting, dawn-to-darkness labor of agricultural work so the male farm workers could take up arms. At first blush, there is nothing exceptional about the three main characters. When gentle, cerebral Agatha, romantic Stella and fluff-brained Prue first assemble for their tour of duty on the Lawrence farm in Dorset, the reader might be deceived into thinking this is going to be yet another banal three-girls-meet-somewhere-and-become-friends novel, the sort in which there is inevitably one suicide, one ghastly abortion, a slew of beastly men and a great display of passive aggression.

Unfortunately easy access to the full spectrum of pain and anxiety control for dental procedures is not available in the United States today. Isn't the universal metaphor for a bad time having a root canal? Most people wouldn't think a root canal more aversive than having ""wisdom teeth"" extracted. Yet the metaphor isn't for the wisdom teeth. It's for the root canal. The reason is that ""wisdom teeth"" are usually removed by an oral surgeon, who usually has the ability to provide some form of pain and anxiety control, other than simple local anesthesia. The root canal is usually done by a dentist without that ability. So it's not the procedure that's aversive. It's the lack of adequate pain control.

Mitchell. ""Well, George,"" the President said, ""like the song says, 'I got the mine, but you got the shaft.' "" Mr. Mitchell, who was later appointed by the Irish and British Governments as chairman of the new, broad-based Northern Ireland peace talks, laughed. But last week he wasn't smiling as Protestant unionist politicians sought to thwart his appointment. The unionists attacked him as an Irish-American Roman Catholic who would side with the province's Catholic minority. Mr. Mitchell, only part Irish and a Maronite Catholic, was finally confirmed, but he still faces a difficult summer. The talks are unlikely to succeed without representatives of the Irish Republican Army's political wing at the table.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Everybody's Master,"No painter has been so hallowed by his fellow artists as Paul Cezanne. Picasso called him ""the father of us all,"" Klee ""the supreme master,"" Matisse ""a kind of benevolent god of painting."" Yet despite a century's influence and an abundance of literature that has successively denounced, extolled and interpreted his work, Cezanne remains an enigmatic artist, his impact on subsequent generations more quantifiable than his artistic intentions. In the introduction to CEZANNE (Philadelphia Museum of Art/Abrams, $75), an exceptionally handsome catalogue raisonne produced in conjunction with a traveling exhibition currently at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Francoise Cachin, director of the Musees de France, and Joseph J. Rishel, a curator of European painting at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, make no claims to providing new interpretations of either the artist or the man. Instead they concentrate on the shifts of Cezanne's critical fortunes. The result is a fascinating patchwork of opinions that illustrates not only how Cezanne has been reinvented as the patron saint of each successive movement from Fauvism to Cubism to early abstraction, but how monumentally important he remains. Each reproduction is accompanied by a short text that provides the provenance of the work, bits of biography, excerpts from letters and occasional anecdotes, as well as details about Cezanne's technique. More academic and less accessible is Pavel Machotka's CEZANNE: Landscape Into Art (Yale University, $45). Mr. Machotka, who teaches psychology and art at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has photographed the sites of Cezanne's landscape paintings, with an eye to approximating the spot and precise time of day that Cezanne painted each scene. He then attempts to analyze Cezanne's way of working, noting the correspondences as well as the changes between place and painting. The result is fascinating to look at, though frequently pedantic.

There was also a disturbing trend of young female basketball players buying men's shoes rather than women's. The company's concern was not for the girls' self-esteem, of course, but for its own potential profits: it feared that a booming new market would fall into the hands of a company shrewd enough to speak directly to women.

A woman slices off her lover's finger while wrapped in his embrace. A man and a woman spar bitterly and then part, for reasons unknown to either. A movie crew bakes under the Mexican sun while Indian voladores, or ""flying men,"" dangle from a pole in an ancient ritual.

THE German occupation of France and its factious fallout provide the raw material of Brian Moore's powerful new novel. Between 1940 and 1944, more than one in four of the 330,000 Jews living on French territory were deported. The majority were identified, arrested and shipped off by French administrators and the French police, without whose zealous cooperation German forces in France would have been unable to carry out the job. In a time of want, fear and national humiliation, few of the French cared about what happened to the Jews. While many individuals helped them (otherwise three in four would not have survived), many also denounced, pursued and robbed them. The drumbeat of official Vichy propaganda presented Jews as noxious parasites, and the church went along, fearing godless Communists more than godless Nazis. Some bishops -- and, in their wake, some priests -- denounced such injustice, but most Roman Catholics had other priorities.

us,Books in Brief: NONFICTION;Things as They Are,"Dorothea Lange (1895-1965) was a complex woman who excelled at making straightforward images. To show things as they are was the challenge she set herself; to her that meant a simple and direct portrayal of people firmly rooted in their time and place. Lange moved from New York to California in 1918, having picked up her technical training by doing odd jobs in Manhattan studios. She became friends with a circle that included Imogen Cunningham and Ansel Adams, and for a time ran a successful portrait business. During the early years of the Depression, when breadlines and picket lines formed in San Francisco, she began to photograph trouble in the streets. Subsequent work in the 1930's focused on rural poverty and migration, which she documented for studies directed by her husband, the economist Paul Taylor, as well as for the Farm Security Administration. THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF DOROTHEA LANGE (Hallmark Cards/Abrams, $35) includes her famous images, like ""Migrant Mother,"" as well as those from other, less well-known series, like those on the internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942, on war workers in a California shipyard and on a California public defender's office. By her choice of perspective, use of gesture and framing, Lange's photographs convey her empathy and passionate belief in human dignity. The book, with text by Keith F. Davis, who has written extensively on American photography, reflects Lange's taste with its spare presentation of 85 reproductions and accompanying quotations or comments, a device Lange often used herself.

Not surprising, since Chaya is in search of a way of dealing with the horrors of the Holocaust. She blazes through books about Judaism, as well as physics and astronomy, but her most sophisticated readings are of her parents and the Kalmans, the Orthodox family for whom she works as a nanny. Chaya's mother, once ""harnessed like a donkey to a cart that she had to pull along the streets of Auschwitz,"" now dedicates herself to baking and weaving. Chaya's father is absorbed by plans to dig up the suitcases that he buried during the war. In Jeannette K. Ringold's translation from the Dutch of Carl Friedman's novel THE SHOVEL AND THE LOOM (Persea, $20), the author perfectly accomplishes the delicate task of making unspeakable stories at once accessible and shocking. Three-year-old Simcha Kalman takes Chaya by surprise: though his life is governed by laws she mistrusts, she finds herself falling in love with him. Indeed, this devotion presents itself as a vital part of her search for meaning. Yet in the end, the author gives even this small redemption a tragic twist, as if to acknowledge the ultimate inexplicability of life. Katherine Alberg",1996-06-30T05:00:00+0000
